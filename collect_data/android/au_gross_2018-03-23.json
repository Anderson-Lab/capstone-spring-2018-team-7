        "This game is amazing.  I play several of the spin/build games, but nothing is like this one.  There is so much things that you can do.  I now have my mom, brother, sister, aunt and cousin playing and still bugging other friends and family to play.  Thanks for a great game. LOVE IT",
        "Something has happened.. I am currently playing the attack master event. I have attacked 20 times at least. But the metre only indicates 6 attacks. Everytime I attack I see hammers going to the metre but the number there remains the same. I would have gotten 12 million and evemln more but due to this issue I haven't. It's definitely the fault of game. Please fix it as soon as possible.",
        "Very frustrating to have to work for weeks to earn enough to build in the higher levels and have it constantly being destroyed because in three days worth of spins you only receive 2 shields... not to mention the rarity of free spins (maybe once a week) Game is an exercise in frustration and not worth the download.",
        "I am playing this game in a long time. but i have found some issue.. many time i am not get shield & someone attacked my village. How to upgrade my village. Pls tell me Moon active team & also upgrade spin 50 to 60 & also redused village manufacturar cost... Thank You.",
        "Game was running successfully but now game has stopped working in my phone all of a sudden, I have uninstalled the game and again installed but not working. My mobile handset is Motorola g5 plus and android version 7. Please help me out to resolve the issue asap.",
        "I actually liked this game but recently very glitchy/buggy. I get attacked by the same person twice within less than a min of each, same with raids. I earn for attack/raid master and the counter doesn't update. Freezes in the middle of spins. Don't earn coins for watching videos sometimes. This is even after the most recent update"

        "I just completed all 3185 rounds... took nearly 2 years to do so. A couple of suggestions...  1. Some big reward must be given to the one who completes all the rounds... an uphill task. 2. All these years I played the spin wheel every day ... but not even once the jackpot was opened... it simply shows the malintentions of the programmers who programmed it as such. 3. Boosters must be given more often.",

The music isn't my favorite, I find it somewhat creepy. Greatful for the music mute button.  Thank you Development Crew for a fantastic, free app which I have been playing for years! One suggestion: make it clear $3 gets you one-time access to your piggy bank only. Thanks😄",

Once you take out one licorice another drops....you need to rethink that level, because it's a level that will make people stop playing.... doesn't matter what boosters you use the licorice keeps dropping and you can NEVER clear all the jelly!",

And one more thing, Can you explain why I have to wait over 2800 minutes for my next life? It's been 3 days and it went from 2800 minutes to 2300 minutes! Based on your stupid calculations each day is equal to 170 minutes? Give me your supports group email add and I will send you a screenshot!",

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pokémon and I intend to play Pokémon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "Pokemon Go is a pioneer into the world of AR. This game was a hit despite its incomplete composition, and this is why many people left. However, the game now is more complete with features such as raiding with others and dynamic weather. If you are looking for something new on the move, give it a try! Or if you left after launch, give the game another try and see how the game has updated over time. This game is recommended for suburban/urban players, as in-game features such as pokestops are not abundant. This game is still very buggy so patience is required. Thanks for reading!",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "It runs quite smooth and gives me an extra reason to get out and exercise. My only beaf now is that it is impossible to acquire any of the legendaries. If you live in a small rural town you will never have the numbers to take on anything beyond 3 star in raids. Everything else is awesome though."

        "On level 2185, had over 800 different boosters and suddenly all of them are gone, serious glitch in game... emailed their tech center for over 1 week now and only get a automated response and nothing from a real person. Wasted 3 years of time and data on this worthless app.... recommend not installing or uninstalling it... customer service sucks",
        "Ive played this game a long time. New update and instead of making the game better you screw your customers. I lost all my boosters and you expect me to continue? If nothing else its a matter of principle. You punish me by taking everything ive bought and earned, ill punish you by never giving you another dime and i will let everyone i know who plays or asks about any of your games ro stay away.",
        "So frustrated with all the candy crush games. I periodically get angry enough to quit for awhile,  but end up back. Why am I upset? I was just in the middle of a rare winning streak and had earned a number of special candies to start games with. I was up to 2 hour on the fish, multi color candy, and the juicy jawbreaker, with 3 hours of life. Suddenly,  i still had the life but all other rewards disappeared. This is far from the first time. I am tired of it. I am removing the king games and I am not coming back this time. I get glitches happen but I have never had any  Indication  that anyone gives a damn. No one makes anything right or even says,  sorry. I'm ok with a game having issues but I am not ok with being treated less than.",
        "In places with bad connection the facebook popup bug is also annoying and causes you to have to restart, losing lives and the streak. And having to click different buttons to confirm to end a game is stupid design.",
        "Would love to give a better rating, but after the most recent update the game has very bad lag, worse than the usual lag it's always had. Updating this. Was hoping update today would fix the lag. It didn't. Also, adding 2 extra steps in order to replay a stage sucks. You know the old saying; if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
        "EDIT: Update on 3/22/18 fixed NOTHING! New levels still locked as well! Worst update in candy crush history. Riddled with bugs. It didn't add new levels like it should have. Unlimited boosters don't appear on level when they should. And boosters are no longer allowed on lower levels. I'm at level 2100 something. I should be able to use boosters when ever I want! And I should be able to have unlimited boosters appear on all levels, not just when they feel like it. Fix and I will give more stars."

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "It's a good time passer.  Beware of guild system, it has major flaws. If a guild leader doesn't log on in a while, The guild gets given to another.  When it happened to me it picked the newest, least trusted official, rather than the one who had been there since day 1 or one of the two who actually donate resources to the guild. So we easily lost months of work.",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "There is certainly alot to do, but is there really much to DO do? I've just been continually tapping red dots and getting free prizes, which (although nice) doesn't feel like I'm especially earning anything, you know?  Feels like a game that will keep you occupied for maybe months, but a year after you delete it will you really REMEMBER it? Probably not.",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend."

        "Great fun game. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because you go through your money pretty quick buying boosts to win levels to then upgrade your garden. I like the game a lot. Also I think that at the end of your board if you have undetonated items they should detonate at the end of that level. I've lost too many levels because of not getting one item that was next to something that was undetonated.",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "Much has improved since my original review (see below). There are special events going on quite often to help with earning coins and powerups, and the levels don't seem to be as tedious. Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I'll be playing this for a long time! I'm working on the living room right now, getting close to level 800! Thank you Playrix!",
        "Its a mind blowing game i cant help but to play this game my day seems not complete if i cant play the game specially when i cant pass the next level and the hardest part is the hard level the time are very fast when i am playing.i really love it and the freebies i can get everyday to boost my game.thank you creators and the makers the graphics and the animation is very realistic.",
        "This is really exciting BUT the levels get way too hard!!! I want a game that you don't have to replay a level more than a couple times! That's when I stop playing. It's a game...it's supposed to be fun not rocket science!! It should relax you but when you're played a level 6 or 7 times and you get down to needing1move to win... yet again... you get stressed!! And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun! I like a challenge but this is ridiculous!!!",
        "Just gave it 2 stars from 3 stars, everytime i use the kite booster it doesn't work and wastes it by flying away. Continued is my previous feedback. Love the game but it is ridiculous how we need stars to start a new day etc. It is difficult to get stars anyway. The lives go out fast because levels are hard. It take 900 coins just for 5 extra turns to finish the level but you get 45 or 50 coins only per level. You need to change this. Make it on the same level, give us atleast 1000 coins per level and let the level have enough stars per task rather than 1 star per level and requirement is 2 stars per task. Something to look into.",
        "Getting green pieces gets extremely redundant. After 30 levels it's still the goal. Levels are near impossible unless you get lucky and things line up perfectly.",
        "I enjoy this game more and more each day.  Is there a possibility to reduce the memory mb? It really takes a lot of storage and slow down my tablet. Thanks"

        "This game is great and could be better if it was fair for everyone that plays! If you are a free to play player you will be destroyed with no way of getting ahead in this game. IGG only wants pay to play players with the upgrades and fixes they have put in this game. The game is fun and would have more people keep playing but once you play for a while and see it takes an ungodly amount of time to do anything in this game people quit. IGG really needs to look at this an make the game more enjoyable for all!",
        "Love this game some people p2p but you dont have to. To level up does not take long and its easy step by step. Also if you you run into events you are not sure of how to do most pros help out . I also love the fact you can send items you need to other like food.",
        "This is a pretty fun game as long as you don't care that IGG doesn't care. I've enjoyed the people I've met (And they're really the only reason I keep playing).  Unless you spend an ungodly amount of money it takes forever to be able to participate with the big guys (and theres ALOT of them. ) Plus there are many glitches that IGG won't ever own up to or reimburse you for. Itsnlike a vending machine play, and pay money at your own risk cuz if you lose, man you REALLY lose.",
        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "This game needs balance. Seems like all one does is hide behind shields and gather resources and hope higher might players harvest you for your resources. There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players"

You can play them all or pick the ones you like best. As a f2p the game presents many opportunities to acquire in game money (especially during the events) - hoard it for energy refreshes. You'll find yourself in very few dry spells needing in game money and energy.",

I have a three star awakened dark pixie, when I tried to evolved her into a three star I tried to use other pixies and they only leveled up her skills, so I used two other monsters to evolve her. This happened again when I tried to evolve her into a four star. Please help!",
        "If your into gathering  monsters to strengthen and fight aswell as evolve then this game is for you. It's very fair and rewarding depending on your efforts. Further expansions for this would see the current fans gain more pleasure out of it and it's already a great game. Liking they added 2 new monsters but seeing that as a regular thing and still keeping current top summons valid would be incredible. Speedy gameplay and no issues for me. Username : violentmaw",
        "Been playing this game for years. Really enjoyed for the first few years. But while years of time past, the rune drop rate and 5* monster summoning rate still remained very low. Its very sad and depressing. Now i just login to settle my guild wars then log off.",
        "Been playing this game every day and it's extremely addicting. Gameplay and graphics are wonderful, support is great, etc. However, it seems to have really become a pay to win game. You'd think that with all the mystical scrolls, summoning stones, attribute scrolls and crystal summonings I've been summoning, I'd at least get a natural 4 star character but i can't even get that. I get garbage every single time. Its frustrating when you put so much time into the game and get nothing in return."

Makes you forget about the game sometimes as you can't do anything else untill it's complete. I refuse micro-transactions so this game now only gets visited once every couple of days. It's a shame really as it's great fun to start with.",
        "Provided the developers with evidence of rampant racism, homophobia and misogyny present in the game. They have so far neglected to take any action against the perpetrators. Unacceptable.  Edit: I have already provided screen shots to you via the Help & Support board, you haven't yet taken action. Please do so immediately.",
        "This game is not made for people who do not spend money. The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",
        "This garbage is nothing like ads show. It's a pay to win mmo that brings nothing new to the table. You can always tell a game will be garbage when their ads are fake. Uninstalled!",
        "Unless you are willing to line their pockets with cash your wasting your time on the game.  You'll never catch up to those who have been playing the game a long time without money.  Parents beware.",
        "Absolutely no support available in the game.  If you're able to take money, people should be able to contact you.  Game is also geared for higher level players to advance by ganging up on new players.   I was attacked 19 consecutive times in a 5 minute period with 6 players attacking me at once.  In short, don't waste your time"

        "I am really disappointed that it takes so much to upgrade each time is insane. I love that there are a few things to help but to have to put so much money into it to be able to do that really makes me not want to play, only a week of that but we get attacked so much that it was all for nothing. I must say Alot of people won't stay if this continues and you won't make as much if you contantly let people down on these little things you could fix. Makes us feel like it's only about the money... it should be fun and enjoyable but that's hard when everything takes so much and so long.... Make the money worth spending.",
        "This game has been glitching for the past 20 hours. can't log in. have reinstalled multiple tjmes. my army will probably have been wiped out by someone who has spent 120,000 dollars on his account (yes there are people who have spent that amount and that's what you're up against) glitch laden game. admins don't give a damn. I will get a standard response to this... if any. Don't download. don't play. don't waste your time and money.",
        "It's a good game but the issue is that much higher level players can attack you regularly. And this sets you back on your development. Level 5 players should not be being attacked by level 20 players. You rebuild an army using resources needed to grow only to have a higher level player destroy it again and again before you can even rebuild completely. My army took a day to rebuild and before I could yluse it it was destroyed again. And more resources are wasted. It is a distressing pattern that has put me off the game.",
        "I love how the game is. Our kingdom 489 have the peace treaty. We dun attack others tagged clan bases. We let them grow. But I currently now facing a problem whereby I can't upload my picture profile. It sucks. Help me and you get ur five stars rating. Get back to me asap. I've been trying for abt a month and nothing change",
        "Really sets you back when your attacked by much higher lvl characters/kingdoms. There should be level attacking restrictions for example a lvl 5 kingdom shouldnt be able to be ttacked by a lvl 10 kingdom. My only complaint i hope they fix it soon and come up with a visable solution for all. Thank you",
        "This game changed my life and how I live... Up until now every so called \"strategy game\" has been full of nothing but disappointment but then I came across king of Avalon and I was astonished that such a game existed. The graphics are breath taking and the community is truly like your in another world... 5 stars!!!"

        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info.",
        "The game is a lot of fun if you are willing to put A LOT of time into grinding things out. They have made huge changes for just quality of life things, but they have kept the core game the same. Grind, grind, grind, grind, and grind some more. You can get everything in the game just by playing it. No need to pay anything. However it would be a lot easier if you could spend 1000$ on the game every couple weeks lol."

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Love this game. My mom and I play it 24/7. It's addicting. Annnd it's a great time killer. Just like everyone else there are things that I would suggest to improve the game. Like for example the time frame for waiting on items. Crazyyyy long. Like the fish nets are like 14hrs! Could drop all the high times to half. That would be cool. But of course if you guys did that then it would be super easy to level up. And you guys would loose out on money cause there are some impatience people out there that just go ahead and buy diamonds and such. Anywho. Love the game. Please consider some of these people's suggestions. Thank you. #HayDayFan",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "Good game. I initially wrote a one star review because this game was very dependant on microtransactions but it's actually pretty fun if you have the patience. Right off the bat you have to wait upwards to 30 minutes or an hour for basic production and warming but as you grow your farm it gets easier to deal with. This definitely isn't a game you can play for, like, an hour, consecutively, which kinda sucks but it's great for the 10-20 minites you pop in now and then."

It's pretty simple and easy to learn. Newer and f2p players have a bit of a rough go, but you can easily keep pace in this game for less than $100 a year.",
        "It's a fun game for a while before you will get frustating. Too much depending on luck no matter how good your deck is if you couldnt get the card to do your combo its useless againt an opponant that have better draw than you.  Also if you are free to play you have to be petient to get ass kick for a while till you have luck enough to get some useful legend card.",

You can be in a winning position and still lose because of 1 in a 10000000 chance of the oponent getting lucky. Even when I win I feel bad from winning because I know the oponet was unlucky.... It is very rare I get a game where I think. This game was awesome because we both did our best.",

Then it takes too long to reload causing me to lose a turn. This is the worst in arena because losing one turn will kill you and it becomes a waste of gold. Please do whatever you can to solve this problem."

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. 😁 It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖",
        "This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.",
        "What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I'm in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can't push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something"

        "Love it.  I kept seeing ads for it and thought it was just another crappy rip off game, but I figured I'd give it a shot, and I'm so glad I did. Game play is fun, there aren't ads every 30 seconds, the app runs smooth, and the artistry that went into designing this game and the characters in it is absolutely flawless. Can't complain at all. Great game, I do recommend to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games.  10/10!",
        "Awesome game. Sadly motivated by profit grabbing providers. The cost to buy extra lives is astronomical. The only way to buy on a more viable basis was via the piggybank and guess what. They removed it. When I questioned this I got standard fob off bull. I questioned that and guess what no reply. A shame, it is a great addictive game. Just don't get tempted to get you wallet out..........",
        "Zainy!  I can understand the addictivity of it, however, just as I was getting into each level, surprise!, is was completed! This spoilt a bit of the fun for me.  The catchy music, oddly I never got tired of hearing... Great game!!!  This review is after my first experience of the game which I played upto level 20 before stopping.",
        "Sounds boring but I'm loving it! Sucks you right in. Starting to get a little complex (actually using some real brain power) but still very much doable and no charges as of yet and I'm up to level 10 atm. I am no gamer by any means but I'm really enjoying this.",
        "After my anti-matter laboratory had a slight malfunction and destroyed half the houses in my town I discovered that I had a lot of time on my hands. So I discovered Toon Blast. Been busy ever since! Thanks guys",
        "Awesome game! Thanks to the developers for not only making this fun, but doing it in a dignified way (i.e., no annoying ads). I love this game! It's fun, addictive, and challenging enough that it's still entertaining 500 levels in! Love it, can't say enough good things about it."

I payed £2.99 to open the piggy bank to collect my gold bars and when I tried to collect them again, I have a pop up telling me that I have to pay another £2.99 AGAIN to collect the 50 gold bars I have earned from completing each level! Nothing states that these are one off payments and that you have to pay everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars. I never normally spend money on games and I most certainly will not waste any money on this game again! What an absolute rip off. When a gamer clicks on the piggy bank, I think that the notification should state that you have to pay the ridiculous amount of £2.99 everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars.",
        "Latest update keeps crashing especially when a level has been won and on the bonus. Crashes to hone screen then the level is lost  and had to be done again. Will restore 5 stars when fixed.",
        "Payments for bricks does not respond with google play . Just says error occurred try later or wrong password. Im already logged in google play atc. I did not make any changes in my account."

For example i just been upgraded to th10, i dont have infernos , i dont have 3rd xbow and im getting maxed out th11 bases to raid in crystal league. Similarly maxed th11 players are raiding my base sucking all my loots with all maxed troops , lvl 50 king/queen and lvl 20 warden...This is because i dont invest money in this game.",
        "Hi COC. I love this game. This my only favourite game. And its the best in the world. I love when there are updated in the game. But I have a query this time. After Builder Hall 8 update whenever I click by boat to go Builder Base the game shuts. I am not able to upgrade my Builder hall. SUPERCELL you are super we know plz fix this issue and let me know. Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "HI SUPERCELL . some players ruined the clan because of Clan Games. Why? They will join ur clan and check if we already achieve the reward like book. They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",
        "Super game my favourite game really nice guys download it .I have A small request if we have got any bonus in war or Multiple battles it automatically goes in Clan Castle ,and when we want withdraw it give whole treasure comes out. So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.",
        "A nice game. I will always be in search of games. My Friend recommend that this is nice game. I installed it. He said that join in my clan. I joined in his clan. Now I am playing this game wonderfully. Thank you super cell and coc. But only the problem is maintainance of server.  It says try again later.  That's why I have rated it 4★. Other wise iwll give 5★. But any way game is wonderful.        PLEASE INSTALL THIS GAME IT'S WONDERFUL GAME"

I can't leave message with development so this is the best I can do about that. But I love the game and this wouldn't change my activity amount at all. Keep up the great work development and look forward to new games in the future.",
        "Best game i played ever. But new update have some bugs like if we going to play with friends it take too much time for loading nd mostly notification pop up that there is an error your coins refunded in your account. Kindly resolve this issue. Except this best game 👍",
        "So I have no idea why I am always at a club disadvantage. My driver is level 5 and always vs a person with level 7 or 8. Why do I never go against level 3 drivers. Always vs higher clubs! ALL THE TIME! you might as well give them the win. Losing me as a customer because there is something very lopsided.",
        "The mechanics of the game are fun, but once you move up a rank or two winning is tough. That is an issue because gold (needed to upgrade) is earned thru even payout bets and very little gold is generated naturally. If you can't keep a high win % you either can't play or need to spend $$$. It's hard to win often when most games come down to closest to the pin shootouts.",
        "Constantly glitching now. Will select an opponent but pictures continually scroll and game never starts. Have to shut game down and start back up for the game to begin. On the verge of uninstalling. Will select opponent and never start game and I end up losing money. Forever downloading, takes forever. I always loved 30 seconds when I start the game up if it doesn't start up by then I just shut it down. Beginning to be very disappointed"

        "great game! auto play is helpful for players who do not have a lot of free time in the real world. eats up battery like a fat kid at a buffet.   not worth downgrading a star but I noticed there is no audio mute option, just turn down volume bar as far to the left. So when you start the game app the first time, the intro audio blasts in your face! after you log into your account, game play is silent.",
        "It's been ok so far, I personally don't enjoy the auto feature but I get why it's there... I'm a busy person I have other stuff to do while I really want to game. Of course, the pay2play option is there otherwise you grind like ALL mmorpgs. Which I don't see the problem with... it's a free game ppl and a pretty decent one at that.",
        "Not only is it laggy, now after loading and installing the recent update, I can't even log in. After log in screen and after it checks for any update, it logs me out to main menu! This is ridiculous! After spending real money with this game you deny me access? So!ution required please asap.",
        "After update, not able to log in. Game crashes all before loging in. Either you fix it today, either i will demand for money return. I have payed money, not to be unable to log in. Do it today, or return money payed.  Since you have not attempted to fix the issue, i demand full refund for the purchases i made. Expect refund and reply! You HAVE to give any reply.",
        ".... Like the 100 or more people before me after the March 14th update I'm no longer able to log in for some unknown reason.. No info on the netmarble site about this issue which is odd.. I actually liked this game but this is really nad customer support.. Well time for a new time sink I guess..",
        "Game is a decent time waster. It's true that it is tedious if you're not willing to blow an inhuman amount of money. The recent update is causing the login screen to be unresponsive to my touch, and I cannot log on. Not terrible otherwise.. Samsung galaxy s8 active."

        "Excellent card game.  However as soon as you get passed reasonably priced starter packs you cannot play the game and why not?  Because you play two games then you need to spend huge amounts of money so you can play two more rounds.  Then you need good cards and guess what you have to buy them through a lottery system like gambling highly addictive but after maybe thousands of dollars you get the card you want guess what you need to evolve your card and guess what you need to buy your reagents big dough yet again.  Then when you have spent all your hard earned cash you need to buy special weapons to give yourself a good boost to your cards.  Do you get where this game and a right game it is too. It relies on you getting addicted so you spend all your time and resources on an endless quest for something you will never have uninstalled buy buy.",
        "Amazing game, honestly, top 3 mobile game I've ever played, found an amazing guild and it's loads of fun. No paywall is the crowning achievement in my opinion. One thing, cause I don't know where customer support is, I started a Path of Champion level, and  on the first wave the game crashed and when I logged back on I had no key and didn't have a chance to beat the level",
        "Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition",
        "Great games. Controls suck.  You want to scroll and click a card instead (i know how to swipe) turns are fast paced..sometimes too fast. And as a starter...some of the turn challenges seem a bit unrealistic with the characters provided. Almost like they want to have you spend money off rip. Good game overall....but some things should definitely need work.",
        "It's a lot other games of this type. I haven't been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you're looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn't find any more connections, that would be great!"

        "I really love this game, i've been playing it for nerely 5 years now and although it can be hard to progress without paying money it is possible. I am free to play which can make it hard but for the people that are not willing to pay money igg is there for you, every week i can earn up to 1500 gems which is probably the reason i have yet to quit. Other than that the leveling and many heros makea the game that much better.",
        "I up my rating to 4. After playing 5 years, this game is really fun to play. I cannot give 5 star as i still having issues with the gem price too crazy expensive. Hope igg can revise gem price back, so many player can support this game, not the rich guy only. I believe you guys has realise many p2p player already quit, so better to revise the germ price again. Overall, i love this game^^",
        "Decided to edit my review to clear things up for people that says this is a money making scheme etc. To the people that say that, do u understand that this game is Free? The devs spend a ton of money making a game enjoyable for people, adding new content such as, new heroes, new events, new upgrading features etc. It's only normal to lock some heroes behind a paid service, and the heroes behind the pay wall isn't even game changing or op. U don't have to spend a cent on this game to make progress. Rolling heroes takes time but it's so rewarding when u get that one hero u were looking for. This is a great game and if u complain about ingame purchases for a game so well maintained then rather go play another free game full of bugs and zero updates.",
        "Holy cow, sitting at 100k might but leveling goes so slow now. Please do something, and new quary is really annoying and sitting in the way.  Edit: everytime I open the game through notification is doesn't load the game.",
        "I hate it. It's always connected to those fake link downloads ugh and if i donwload this game and run it for 30 seconds, the link will open BUT NO it's a lie. This game just wants to be seen as a game with millions of downloads and I HATE IT."

They give daily prizesand makes thou wsnt to come back. It can be frustratingly challenging and that is a hood thing.. thank you creators.",
        "Ok new review, I've passed all 1740 levels would have given 5 stars but the upper levels can only be passed when you hit the right program! Play same level 20-30+ times then suddenly pass with 10-15 moves left!!! Not fun anymore!!! Uninstalled",
        "This game was my favorite, however the lack of being able to reset the game is truly sad 😢 and takes away from my joy of the game! Please give the option for us to reset our play easily, please 💕",
        "Can you sponsor a video for me? I've introduced this game to several people and I have yet to hear it be exposed on youtube. As a creator I can give the game the exposure it deserves.",
        "The recent changes to the game bother me, you can no longer see how many points you get as you go or when you fail. Now it seems that they limit the amount of points you can get at the end for the moves you have left. The only time you see points is the total at the very end. Seems like they're screwing the people who want to get 3 stars on the levels...",
        "I enjoyed playing this game but I was to reset game to beginning.Tried clearing data and cache but didn't work.E-mailed developers to ask them and they e-mailed back saying they would but only once which I am still waiting for them to do.What is the big deal about wanting to start over the game again?Better that than once getting to levels you can't do to not play game again surely!!!!"

        "It really  depends on the game and how much effort the creator put into it. My favourite  game is Elemental Battlegrounds. Itwas created this year and the creator clearly put a bunch of time in making it. I love Roblox and most of the games on it. At least it it's a 3.9 out of5.",

As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15",
        "I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my \"family\"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we're like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I'm from Michigan,we're both married ,but there's nothing I wouldn't do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!! Lifelong friends/family!!! 💜"

        "Ok so ive been olaying this game for a long time now, but I had to delete the game for storage purposes. Once I game back I logged in with my facebook account and all that but nothing loads. Which is fine I just have to wait. But now my issue is that the actual levels for the wedding event, and the normal quest, it kicks me out of the app and it does thatt every time. Please fix this issue. Maybe then Ill give it five stars.",
        "Great addictive game! Starts out cute and innocent. Recently found out through a spoiler thread that it does take a darker turn in Ch 15. The U.S. servers are currently only on Ch 12. Still a great addicting game that many players start out thinking \"Awesome! A great game that I don't I can have the option to play for free!\" Soon they cave when that ONE outfit comes along that they HAVE TO HAVE lol.",
        "I love this game! It's really good for creative people who like to design their own outfits. I just downloaded on my new phone and started over (I don't have Facebook to link my progress with). Please make it available to link with Google play so I don't always lose progress!   Also, since downloading again, I found that some of the names are different... I was very confused, since the voice over still says the old names. I like Yoko way better than Bobo!!",
        "I loved this game, and am V8. So its not like I am against paying. I am against the ranking event especially since you devs LIED TO YOUR PLAYERS and said we wont be getting one again. We will not pay 100s for a non guarenteed reward. It would be more HONEST, if you set up the suits as 300 USD each recharge.  If you are smart at all, devs you should understand that business ethics is just as important as profit and will benefit everyone in the long run.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events."

        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",
        "Its a good game but the rewards for tickets are rubbish , last 6 times i claimed gold reward for 1000% more cash , its given less than 200,000 which is rubbish get more for the bronze , needs sorting",

        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget.",
        "I wish rating took into account the design assignment. People design completely different styles than the description and as long as they design in black and white or a neutral palette it will win votes over a design that is actually following the instructions. Contemporary design beats Mediterranean or Eclectic every time. There's no point in even entering those contests because people who do a contemporary design will cancel your design out."

        "I like it.   The fish are friendly and encouraging.  I use the game to help me keep calm and relax.  Please consider allowing us to select another of one of the earlier aquariums when we get to the point where we are waiting for new aquariums to be developed and have finished everything.  I'd like a place to put new fish and decorations, but none of the old fish want to be sold.  They are still my favorite friends.  The game uses a lot of memory, and I had to uninstall it from my tablet because it kept making it crash.  Works on my phone, but it's still a lot of memory.",
        "Love this game!! I love the challenge with completing levels. There's days I can't get enough of this game. I play every day. I love decorating my tanks. I love when I get infinite time, but It would be nice if we had control over when to use it or the time would stop and be saved for when we return. Sometimes 6 hours is impossible to sit there and just play. One thing that would be nice is if we didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life to renew and could have more friends to  receive more lives and got to use the diamonds we earned amd not be stored in a bank to buy. Other than that I cant complain😉 best game out there and I highly recommend it to all ages.",
        "It's a great game. I play it with my daughter on our freetime it's quite addictive. Its great that you get rewards if you have to watch the movies. The only thing i would change is the reloding of the lives. Half an hour for one life is too long. Every so often you get a few free hours, but you need to have free time to play.I love the fact that we can play using my phone sideways (landscape ) as I have a problem with my wrist. I highly recommend it!",
        "Fishdom is a fun game.  The puzzles are challenging. I would love to see a change to the gifts we can give our neighbors . Such as, the lightening, or fireworks, or an ornament for their aquarium. I would also like to see the diamonds we earn to be available, not stuck in a bank, to be paid for.  Limits could be put on it, of course, but the free one here and there only help once in any puzzle sequence.   Overall, though, its a nice game.",
        "I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one's tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don't earn anything for more decorations and it doesn't get dirty and the fish don't get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.",

The AI will always take advantage of beating you with moves that will take what you need 98% of the time. Moves that no one can see but magically the AI knows what to choose to beat you. I love strategy games, but cheating is not a fun for anyone. The AI compition is not a compition. It's a slaghter waste of time until you get lucky or they give it too you. No strategy there. Just piss you off cheating AI. Being the top of Candy Crush and Candy crush soda. And yes also Jelly. It is ridiculous sometimes to waste my time with this one. If the AI opponents played at the highest level of what to use, then I wouldn't mind getting beaten. But when you watch the AI make the dumbest move to get what it needed, tells you that the AI sees the whole board. Even what is hidden. Give up or beat yourself up on this one.

Watch the number counter not the monklings going under the rope & u will see the counter not go pass a certain number! THE SAME NUMBER continues like 6 will stay 6 4x's! That way u don't beat the level & u have to buy a booster, KING Co are CHEATS!",

That means you can progress through it without even spending a dime. Its a simple game with decent graphics to play at leisure and has become my current pass time.  Update 3/22/18  I decreased my rating to three stars (from 5) until the developer can correct the latest flop from most recent update. Flop regards being able to log in but paralyzed from any action that requires an in game pop up. I including the \"Help\" module which is used to contact dev with.

So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning.

        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much",
        "I've always been a fan of The Sims since it first came out on the PC and now this version is WAY BETTER than their other App game! I LOVE IT! It's so much fun and I can't wait to see what more is in store! UPDATE: After playing longer and being able to have a baby with my spouse, I found that our kids are labeled son and daughter under his family tree, but as father and niece under mine. That makes no sense! What's going on?!",
        "One of the best mobile games I have played. Not forced to buy anything with real money to keep playing, the cupcakes are great, I love everything. Right now, this is funner than Sims 4! My only complaint is that you can't change the story with another sim. I would love if once a story is complete, you could choose to pick another one. After all, relationships change over time in real life. Love this game!",
        "Sims is finally here on Mobile! I like how the Sims can complete events while you're not in the App. My only concerns are the limitations. It seems like with a lot of the actions my Sim is talking to herself or interacting with herself especially during the Hot Tub events. It would be nice to have them be able to interact with other Sims even while at work or at another event especially if rust are already friends or lovers with the other Sims! Also I think the careers and hobbies should have more variety. I also would like to be able to purchase a pool and build a patio."

Why have a cloud save or play the game or spend moo pney when it's erased. I still love the game but now frustrated I will think about uninstalling.",
        "The puzzles are interesting, the animations are generally enjoyable. It quickly becomes a grind, though, where you aren't enjoying the gameplay, you're just trying to get past the timewasters of the daily challenge, or fighting the arbitrary points of the arena. The clan battles and Mighty Eagle challenge are the best parts, but you can't play them all the time. You have to grind away in the Arena.",
        "I just purchased a new phone. And being I'm using the same e-mail address i would have thought it would have started me at the same level I had been on prior to the new phone. Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "GAH! They've over complicated this game with unnecessary graphics and gifts and prizes etc. I couldn't even figure out how to get into the levels for a while haha. I'm sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn't want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn't change it. Uninstalled after 1 day.",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download."

Deducting credits may not the good way to discipline afk players. Its good if no one's lose or gain star either win or not. Make it the game not counted so players not waist time to pursue the game. I'll give 5 stars if 5 theres improvement. Thanks!",
        "MOBA with analog is really a big joke. The graphics is trashy. Hero and skin are hard to unlock. There's a kind of in game power up that could be bought with real money. The only reason this game has so many player is the game size & device compatibility. If your phone is capable of playing \"the famous 3v3 moba\", you'd better play that game",
        "This game is so cool. Only noob will say it hard to play or hard getting hero/skin. Maintain the gameplay and everything will be alright. Sometimes we win and sometime we won't. Only the graphics need to be improve. Come on! It's 2018 already! Make a tournament cause i wanna join!!. (Give me free skin. I give u  5 stars bitchhhhhhhh)",
        "Why don't you try real super hero characters that we know like from dc anime etc such as. Dragon ball naruto bleach justice league avengers try doing it new heroes are good but if there are some like worldwide famous heroes also then it would sound much more  interesting",
        "I love this game, I've been playing this for over a year and I still play it daily! All the skins and heroes skills are amazing. But please don't  let me team up with low level players it's affecting my game and stats when I'm trying my best to carry they would just afk which can be frustrating. But overall it's a good game",
        "I hv been playing this game for two years alll good perfect game perfect graphics..bt there should be some changes for the afk players... strict steps should be taken towards for these afk players not bye lowering credit score by banning from game for a period of time so that they won't be spoiling game any further"

    "descriptionHTML" : "Join your friends in a brand new 5v5 MOBA showdown against real human opponents, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang! Choose your  favorite heroes and build the perfect team with your comrades-in-arms! 10-second matchmaking, 10-minute battles. Laning, jungling, tower rushing, team battles, all the fun of PC MOBAs and action games in the palm of your hand! Feed your eSports spirit!<br><br>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, 2017&#x2019;s brand new mobile eSports masterpiece. Shatter your opponents with the touch of your finger and claim the crown of strongest Challenger!<br><br>Your phone thirsts for battle!<br><br><b>Features:</b> <br><br><b>1. Classic MOBA Maps, 5v5 Battles</b> <br>Real-time 5v5 battles against real opponents. Fight over 3 lanes to take the enemy&#x2019;s tower. 4 jungle areas. 18 defense towers. 2 Wild Bosses. Complete reproductions of classic MOBA maps. Full-on 5v5, Human vs. Human battles. A triumphant return to genuine MOBA gameplay.<br><br><b>2. Win with Teamwork &amp; Strategy</b> <br>Block damage, control the enemy, and heal teammates! Choose from Tanks, Mages, Marksmen, Assassins, Supports, etc. to anchor your team or be match MVP! New heroes are constantly being released!<br><br><b>3. Fair Fights, Carry Your Team to Victory</b> <br>Just like classic MOBAs, there is no hero training or paying for stats. Winners and losers are decided based on skill and ability on this fair and balanced platform for competitive gaming. Play to Win, not Pay to Win.<br><br><b>4. Simple Controls, Easy to Master</b> <br>With a virtual joystick on the left and skill buttons on the right, 2 fingers are all you need to become a master! Autolock and target sifting allow you to last hit to your heart&#x2019;s content. Never miss! And a convenient tap-to-equip system lets you focus on the thrill of battle!<br><br><b>5. 10 Second Matchmaking, 10 Minute Matches</b> <br>Matchmaking only takes 10 seconds, and battles last 10 minutes, glossing over the quiet early-game leveling up and jumping right into intense battles. Less boring waiting and repetitive farming, and more thrilling action and fist-pumping victories. At any place, at any moment, just pick up your phone, fire up the game, and immerse yourself in heart-pounding MOBA competition.<br><br><b>6. Smart Offline AI Assistance</b> <br>In most MOBAs, a dropped connection means hanging your team out to dry, but with Mobile Legends: Bang Bang&#x2019;s powerful reconnection system, if you get dropped, you can be back in the battle in seconds. And while you&#x2019;re offline, your character will be controlled by our AI system to avoid a 5-on-4 situation.<br><br>PLEASE NOTE! Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is free to download and play, however some game items can also be purchased for real money. If you do not want to use this feature, please set up password protection for purchases in the settings of your Google Play Store app. Also, under our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, you must be at least 12 years of age to play or download Mobile Legends: Bang Bang.<br><br><b>Contact Us</b> <br>You can get customer service assistance via the [Contact Us] button in the game to help you with any problems you may encounter while playing.

        "This game is pretty good and nintendo/IS takes in community feedback. This is probably one the most generous of any gacha game out right one and there have been some powerful units given to us for free. Content is 99% free to play friendly with only 1 or so events that were very difficult for f2p. While its not a true fire emblem game, it is still pretty good for a mobile game.  P.S. there are some 5 star units that shouldn't be there. They are only there to gimp you out of another unit.",
        "If you ever were interested in the Fire Emblem series then this is defenitely a good place to start off. It's simplistic enough for new players yet at the same time it offers a lot of possibilities on how to build your units. It's fun to collect Heroes in this game and it's fun working on them to make their stats and strategy better. Each Hero has a fun personality and each one of them is well drawn by talented artists.  A fun strategy game that also can get really challenging in some of the harder quests.",
        "Great game. I've never played Fire Emblem before, so this app is a great way to see what the games are like and all about. I like all of the cool characters and all the details each one has. If you like RPGs or want to try one out, this one may be a good one to give a shot at. You don't need money to play either. You might just want to get yourself into the FE games series after playing this. ;)",
        "Been having this app for a year now and yet I haven't thought its a waste of space at all! It's extremely addicting and makes you want to play more. Its also nice how the creators interact with the community alot and listen to our feedback. Its also nice to have a game that's constantly worked on and it just keeps improving. The art and the voice acting it also a big pro for this game. It really does capture the characters personality,even if it is a few words. The art is simply amazing. I appreciate the artists for thier hard work. Would definitely recommend it if you like RPG games.",
        "Turn based strategy rpg. If you've never played a Fire Emblem, time to remedy that. Fantastic depth and graphics for a free game. This feels like a full blown complete Nintendo title I'd expect to see for $30 for Gameboy brand new. At the price of nothing, everyone should try it.",
        "This is a work in progress. I am a huge fan of Fire Emblem, Sacred Stones and I really wanted to love this right out of the gate.  It has made a good start.  All maps are a set size, something like 6x8, with two teams of 4.  No terrain bonuses, no special conversation where one of your characters can convince one of them to join you, ALL attacks result in hits of a predetermined amount, no crits/no misses, no permadeath.  Voiced characters are a nice plus from the old GBA days. This is as close to a real Fire Emblem game as a mobile, free to play will get, and the devs keep changing up stuff to keep it interesting. Great game!"

Hope they fix it or I'll have no choice but to uninstall. Not keeping a game I can't play do to some unprofessional error on the games part",

However anyone who wants to play a final fantasy game, but find that the amount of things you can do and how to do these things is overwhelming, then this is the game for you. Nice mix of old school graphics and slightly more modern 3d graphics, good storyline and funny dialogue. Big fan !",

        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "Love the concept of the game but the moment you start reaching higher castle lvl  that's when you realize that if you don't pay you will be on a long journey, ie.. PvP are out of the question everyone has minimum of 5 epic items, arena you will have to settle for 5th or less place due to power lvl difference. I am about 141000 fighting 190000 or 90000, which is not fair for those of low power or advantage to those of high.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",
        "I loved this game very much, I had a lot of really nice things and invested nearly $60 dollars into making my guys 5 stars and diamonds and other level up promos... I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine.."

        "I like the game its fun and engaging but the premium choices cost a lot of diamonds and you don't get a lot opportunity to earn them. 12- 18 diamonds for more then a couple  choices in a story to make interesting choices that wouldmake the storys better but you only earn 1 diamond a chapter witch you have to wait an hour or more to unlock or buy keys.  So you pretty much have to spend real money for this game to really enjoy it. Ill be deleting this app not worth my time.",
        "While the game is enjoyable and the stories are intriguing, it is way too expensive to make certain choices. There is absolutely no need for choices to cost 20 or 25 diamonds when you only get 1 diamond for each chapter completed.  This game is in no way good enough to warrant spending real money on it, especially considering the ridiculously high prices of making certain choices which would require making a purchase in every single chapter.",
        "The game is great. Great graphics, nice music, perfectly cued entrees  for new characters, amazing story line.... But they don't give you enough keys or diamonds. I mean, y s its understandable that the chapters are long but 2hrs for a recharge on keys? Really? Either make the waiting time shorter, give us more, or both. Now as for the diamonds, they give you 25 of them. But each special choices is always way to much. And you never really know when your going to need them for something serious. With that said either give us more keys, lower the cost of the choice, or give us more diamonds per chapter. Not like 2 but 5 or more.",
        "It's a brilliant app, though sometimes I wish there wasn't as many gem choices. I fully considered buying gems until I realised how quickly they'd be used.   My favourite story was It Lives In The Woods, though most of the choices are gem choices. The story itself is fantastic, and I love the diversity of characters.   I had a problem with a story playing up and after a chat with the team was told to restart it. I didn't mind but I didn't get any keys to compensate what I'd already spent (I don't buy them I just wait for then to recharge, but it did mean I had to respend keys on one story because of a issue out of my control)   Overall its a great app and highly playable without spending.",
        "Diamond choices come up way too often for how much they cost and how little you get. The keys have an unreasonably long cooldown to get them. Options like watching ads to get diamonds would be a great option, especially seeings how you have that option in HSS and HU:RS. All that aside its a good game. Lots of the stories are enjoyable and its visually pleasing.",
        "Great graphics and great stories. Right now they have like 30 \"books\", so there are lots of options. I've been playing since 2016 and the app just keeps getting better. Can get a little pricey for the preminum choices, but otherwise it's a fantastic app; very additive and entertaining"

        "Repetitive game that requires a lot of thinking. Quite addictive as I've been playing for nearly year and half now. I didn't spend a penny on game but quite a lot of time. Its very difficult to be very good without spending real cash but it's possible. You can watch adverts for coins, so be patient and play. The more you play the more you get. You don't need top characters to have great team - you can create great team with average characters if you focus on weapons. Get yourself into a good team, hit faction's minimums and you'll become great.",
        "There are good and bad aspects of this game, but the pros out weigh the cons. You can absolutely level up incredibly high without spending a single penny on this game. You just need patience. One of the funniest aspects of this game is its long term playability. There is always something to do every day and in the long run it all adds up to your benefit.  My only complaint is the pop up windows when you first get on. They show you you've been raided...then you have the notification that you have to check that gives you the same info. If the pop up already gives me the info, why do I still have notifications?",
        "Rubbish repetitive game. After spending ten's of thousands pointlessly I can tell you honestly... don't waste your time or money. It's a very addictive cash cow and just a very smart way to take your money and keep you hooked. Scopely has repeatedly lied and will continue to do so. You have been warned",
        "Ive been playing this for 2 years, love it but support is well below standard. I have a problem just now where it crashes every 5 mins and support do nothing. Its become unplayable. Avoid if you have a samsung device",
        "The game has slowly been turning more p2w than ever before. Before 6 stars had come into play, you could easily get any 5 stars. Even some p2w toons were able to be accessed later on in some events. With 6 stars, this really isn't the case. This has also caused the Road to Survival community to become more toxic and started making the game unfair/not fun for other players.",
        "I like the strategy involved in playing the game. The only thing I think I would change is when you kill an enemy and he comes back to life,  they should come back as a zombie. .not keep all their ability before death. .otherwise it keeps you interested."

Aces, review by Da1 G Reaper of the Sun Tzu Ghosts Gaming Community... #livfreeplyhard #STGGC",
        "Good luck in this game if ya don't want to spend money. No game balancing meaning a lvl12 can attk lvl  1 with no post attk shield or protection of any kind. Got attk 12 times in a row by same player of higher lvl. Also If you have issues with game content good luck getting a good answer on that too.",
        "Hi A.K server 52. Have been playing for couple of months now and still love the game.just when you think you are on top of things something new comes up. I personally like the challenge and new changes.for those who have not played this game before I would recommend it.  Very addictive. If you are going to spend money in this game spend wisely.",
        "After last update, this game getting worst, score for pirate event has been reduced, and the pirate getting stronger.. fix it fast.. many player complaining about this Nick : Premi06 Server : 041",
        "Please add more vessels like USS Carl Vinson, and enabled to play offline too. And please make no time limits to purchase for the new promotion with a cheap price such as new ships or aircrafts, when that happened I bet there will be more interesting. Thanks.",
        "If you don't have money to burn then don't play this game. This game is the embidiment of the 'pay to win' phrase and would make EA look like a baby when it comes to that. Levels are easy to scale up in the beginning but as you cross level 10 through 20, you'd realise that without paying through your nose, you are just fodder for paying players. Don't be a sheep they'd like you to be. On top of that, the game is riddled with bugs and the developers are unresponsive, unless again you are a paying player. Do yourself a favor and Invest your time in another game."

        "This game is a lot of fun get to customize some great cars . A lot of my favorites and i was surprised to see some cool muscle cars . Very unique collection of cars. This is actually better than their console games. Well recent carbon and most wanted are amazing. The newest are hot garbage. This one is fun.reallywish there was free roam or a sand box room where you can admire and test drive  what you have grinded out so many hours to get. Only bad thing. Also the boxes are too expensive leaving having to grind way too much just for absolutely anything. By the time you get anything good this game servers will be empty.",
        "Thank you for making this awesome game, I love it! I've not had this much fun playing a Need For Speed game in years.. Update 2.9.1 is fantastic. Although after updating, I'm having trouble connecting to the game servers... :/ Hope it gets sorted soon! nevertheless, I look forward to future updates. ;)",
        "It's a great game, graphics are ok, smooth playing. But. There are some ideeas that may do something different. Think about a chat room, or a place where players can do some trades. Think about adding the possibility for players to get vip points for watching videos, or maybe one day..open world gameplay. And there could be a lot more features. Thumbs up if you agree.",
        "The gameplay/races r so short. It takes less than a minute to finish it. And the police cars than u see in the gameplay don't even do anything they just keep going on on there own, sometimes getting to finish line before u. So basically this would be a perfect game for a three year old but incredibly boring for anyone over the age of 7",
        "I just bought a golden crate for 100 golds, only to get a muscle ECU uncommon part. Disappointing,  no blue prints. Even in a free crate you get blue prints.  Frustrating the reward system is horrible. Am never going to buy any golden crate. Players should be given choices to buy golden crate but you get trusted upon with useless worthless part. Otherwise good game",
        "The game is pretty good, being a free mobile game, it is not trying to hide it's PTW features, but you can do mostly everything without having to spend a penny. One suggestion I think needs to be put in place is a confirmation window when you go to skip a level, because I was doing the speedhunter event for the Mazda MX-5, and accidentally hit the skip race button and lost a lot of gold, maybe not letting me even get the upgraded car now."

Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "GAH! They've over complicated this game with unnecessary graphics and gifts and prizes etc. I couldn't even figure out how to get into the levels for a while haha. I'm sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn't want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn't change it. Uninstalled after 1 day.",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download."

        "One of the best sports games available on the market right now. The graphics are awesome. And the player realism is good. The challenge of acquiring Elite Players keeps you going.    EDIT: This game is a perfect example of how not to screw up a top notch game. Used to love it to death before the update, now every aspect of the game has been worsened; Auctions, Gameplay, Teams. Just name a feature and you can be sure that it's been screwed up. Just hope they resolve this the next year. Will just uninstall till the new yearly reset.",
        "YO IS IT ME OR BEFORE THE UPDATE I HAD CHOICES TO PICK BETWEEN 5 TEAMS I WORK SO HARD TO BUILD? DEFENSIVE LINE UP, SHOOTING LINE UP, AND SO ON. Listen Whoever made the game. I know what type of tricks u tryna do ok. I'm smart enough to know. And I know what y'all doing with that MONEY. So I would appreciate it  if I can use my teams again✌",
        "I can't see myself EVER giving EA mobile games anything but a 1 star rating, the game is geared to cheat unless you're spending actual $ on paccs & players. How many times can an event rob you of stamina to only rob you again by redundantly giving you the same fucc'n collectables over & over & over again!!! By the time you actually complete the set either the seasons over, or there's better players @ the position that you'll probably never end up getting either... Unless you spend some cash. EA succs man, SINCERELY!!!",
        "I think i'm dissatisfied with this game of rule. You should change this rule... when the all people can feel comfortable, and can be feel happy, free and enjoy it. This is so very very bad news with you EA. If you still use this rule, i think... this game can be game over forever. You should back this rule like before. if you can't, everymonts, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, this rating of Nbalivemobile always down, decrease, and fall, hopefully you can understand if you feel this game very important for you! Trust me!. Thank you. Tru",
        "EA, the game is official and is above average as far as graphics, gameplay go etc. etc. but food for thought and I think it'll be a gamechanger really...it'll take the game to new heights on a consumer level. It's the only thing missing aka Commentators/commentary as part of the in-game gameplay and the rest will speak for itself. 🔦"

        "I love this game! Its BEYOND ADDICTIVE! There is no Methadone to cure or lure one away from the graphics, variety of bonus games or ever changing levels that erase reality and become the Pied Piper as its classical music lures one into its universe of gaming. This is a \"slot,\" which appeals to those who also enjoy a nether-universe of of scifi/fantasu. Its visually appealing, as well as, fun!!!! An AWESOME SITE!!!",
        "Yes it looks and sounds amazing. But short of that, this slot game is completely unremarkable. Just like every other slot game out there, wins are few and far between. The hourly bonus is weak aswel. When you're at a level that requires you to max bet (25000000 or more) and you win 1000000 on the hour bonus and have nothing in the credit meter due to the lack of free spins and no bonuses, it becomes very frustrating. Install if you're easily entertained by graphics and sound, because thats seriously the only thing you will get from this.",
        "THE PLOTS(NOT SLOTS,LOL)ARE THE BEST ,GRAPHICS ARE GREAT AND YOUR NOT JUST PLAYONG A SLOT,YOU ARE REALLY IN TO THE GAMES!!!!! I HAVE TO SAY IT JUST GETS BETTER AND MORE INVOLVED THE MORE YOU PLAY. THANK YOU.10+!It just gets better and better!!!!! Love it more and more!! thanks again THEY KEEP ME  EAGER TO GET TO THE NEXT ROUND OF  PLAY.   KEEP  THEM COMING. THANK YOU",
        "Used to be fun and worth maybe occasionally spending a few bucks on. Now early levels easier but struggle to ever get past first 3 levels. Seems to be just about getting you to spend real money now. Better have your big boy wallet or not worth installing. Really too bad.",
        "This is the best online slots game ever.  This game has so many awesome graphics and great prizes for everyone playing.  Thanks Murka for keeping for the last 2 years of  my sleeplessness nights soooo very interesting!!!!!  Luv ya bunches....waiting for more to come.....",
        "I love the graphics and the slot games, I really enjoy playing, but by level 70 some of the missions are just completely ridiculously high and for me that takes away some of the enjoyment, eg. Spin 700 times on max bet - that is just too much. How about give more variety of challenges rather than making them too hard to achieve or too long winded."

        "I d give it 10/10 if there way a search button to look for mayors, more communication options (private/public) messaging to facilitate talking in the game etc..and concerning the gameplay, it would better if devs reduce the production time of items. It takes way longer and as players we dont have all day to play even if we used boosters and in game cash !",
        "Wonderful game indeed. The only thing is missing is the financing part. Would be really nice to have a banking inductor a stock market where you could trade financial products like other cities bonds or debt. Financing during the game can be a big problem so having a financial hub from where you could trade and borrow would be really useful. Thank you for developing this amazing game.",
        "This game is crazy and awesome at the same time. My population has been awesome. Just 2 months and it was from 0 - 92 000+! The crazy part is when I see a blue hospital sign, the people dont even tell good reasons. ALL THEY DO IS SAY, Sometimes I go to the clinic just to read MAGAZINES! My citizens are so crazy JUST BEACAUSE IN ONE HECTARE, I AM A GOOD MAYOR!",
        "Too much waiting for things to get made and produced. The storage and items for upgrades FAR too difficult to get. 42 items to raise storage by 5 items. And it can take weeks to find all the items. When you go to global storage and find an item that you really need, by the time that you get there, it's already sold! 😠 Also, it takes 3 different items, and you have 3 of one item and 24 of another. Really? Also, it should be that you get needed items more often, randomly rather than at specific times. Other than that, a good game.",
        "Like the competition challenges it holds your attention. the time frames of production are a little long however the markets move products fast. I also like the club wars and the mayors challenges. My dislike is there are not enough thought bubbles in the fact that you only get two the rewards should be more frequently.",
        "The new arenas for war are terrible... There is a massive lag time... I can't even get to the war after rebuilding until the game thinks for approximately 45 seconds... By the time I actually get one shot off it's a minute and a half... Then I'm almost dead and you come back with I'm sorry we're experiencing connectivity issues get it fixed please!"

Case in point: My opponent takes the discard, the 2 of spades, gets gin immediately, but doesn't use the 2 of spades. The cheating developers should be humiliated by this garbage.",
        "I'm convinced the game is not set up to be fair. How does one loose 5 games in a row? Where the other player is able to knock before the draw pile even reaches 27. 5 times in a row that happened to me. Very frustrating. Seems to be a way to just attempt to encourage people to waste money to buy coins. Very saddening.",

If I bet big, I lose. Time to buy more fake money. I'll play people with the same profile picture but with different stats. Weird. Buyer beware.",
        "Don't care for the fact you have to invite friends from FB NOW and they have to start playing in order to receive points. I wont ever go into my own wallet in order to play a game . Never have and i dont believe these games should ask you to do so to keep playing their game...bad customer service.. buy them if you dont want constant ads or something like that, but not to play a game.",
        "How can you win when you're dealt crappy cards every deal and then you run out of money,  conveniently 10 seconds before the end of the game. But you can purchase more coins!!!! Ridiculous!!!"

        "This game is amazing! But enemy units keep getting stuck behind walls Also there are a few enemy lands that are not responding when you tap on them. This didnt happen before.  I think updating attack list would be good. So you could see who you have attacked, not just who attck you. Just  a thought",
        "It's a great game but I think it be better if you created workers and mined,  lumbered, and gather favors or technology like warcraft use to be like.  The commands are also touchy and the battle displays for viewing if kinda difficult to  keep up with. But it's fun and a little bit addictive.",
        "Amazing graphic but really poor gameplay... Even lowest level, it's hard to complete easy campaign. Every win need to paid. Useless to raid... Uninteresting how the mission needed to complete... Disliked this game bcoz of the poor gameplay and the way of how to complete the mission.",
        "Ive been playing this game a very long time now. definitly a 5 star game in every aspect. only issue is.. i spend money on this last event.. 3 raids left to get 14k reward for the 4 star poison ranger.. the bloody game hang again..manage to log back only when the event was over..!!! Now i have this 2 useless relics taunting me.. Almost felt like deleting the game..",
        "One of these game where you need to pay to play if you want to be any good, slow if any support. If you don't have a life, you can get good a this game real quick. If you have low self-esteem, stay away, experience gamers will tear you a new one repeated, makes progressing to new lvls  slow."

That is just too much access to my phone. I did not even get a chance to play the game because it wanted that access on start up; it will not allow you to play the game without give permission.",

PvP is more event driven rather than a free for all.Great value for the money you spend whether it's a little or a lot...and the purchases give a little free to your team. Lots of ways to win free stuff and points you can spend on items needed in alliance store and keep up with your wallet warrior team mate. One downside is the support..they can be a little sliw in response time to problems. But they don't just ignore you either.",

You're still getting the permission from un-educated users that you can read their messages. That's very shady.",

Reported the issue but they ROK did not bother to give me a courtesy reply so if you decide to play but sure the system does not steal your time and effort playing the game.

        "It's a good bingo game with a good amount of variety. Love the fact that you can play in different rooms and get bonuses with the puzzles! I was wondering if buying the elite pack is a one time purchase or a monthly fee. Couldn't find the answer anywhere. One tip to make it even better would be to make the tickets a little easier to get. Otherwise would give 5 stars!",
        "My only issue with this game is that u almost have to end up purchasing tix to continue to play. The further u move on in the game, the more tix each card costs & ur only given a certain amount thru a daily reward. App should provide ways to earn more tix, either thru a daily spin or higher rewards. *(since app developer replied to this review, I changed my review to 4 stars)",
        "The game itself is very fun.  However, if you run out of tickets, it is way too difficult to earn more.  Apparently, they made it easier to earn tickets but after playing many other games, the update isn't enough.  To continue playing, you must buy tickets.  I may have to delete the game which is a shame because it really is a fun game.    3/18/18... They tell you to play lower cost games to get more rewards but it doesn't.  It just takes you a bit longer to go through your tickets but you don't win anything.  Time to delete.  Graphics were great and games were fun but without tickets you can't play.",
        "Really liked this game. Now i cant play it because its near impossible to get more tickets. I cant complete daily tasks as I have no tickets and ive got to wait ages to get daily tickets. Even then there gone within 5-10minutes and cant get no more until following day. Games dont pay out enough either when you win",
        "It's been nice...I'm happy to share: they heard us. We can earn power now, the games are fun, excellent pace. Thank you \"Dataverse\", I appreciate your changes 💯 ☠☠☠☠☠ UPDATE: n again 1/11. again: I ventured and came back. I can buy credit in January. Cuz we HAVE to have boosts to play long. Here I go !Update. I like a lot. Spent 20 but you simply can't spend enough.  must buy boosts too. Boosts get stuck",
        "I really like this Bingo  game.  A few upgrades and it will  be better than all the other Bingo games.  I love the amount of tickets it gives you to play.  I love the extra stuff you can earn and not have to pay for.  A couple of things that would  make this game better would be all 4 cards on one screen in tablet mode, the power ups being applied automatically  and being able to daub that last number that's  called cause usually that's the one needed for Bingo.  Otherwise its great.  I hope  you find this useful.  I understand  if you can't  fix all three of these but the first 2 are more important  than the last and i understand  there can only be a certain amount of bingos i guess.  Thank you.  Real close to being a 5 but those 3 issues really hold me back as I'm  sure it does others as well."

        "This is a great game. It's fun, addictive, and a great time killer. The only problem I see is that I created an account on the game thinking it would save. WRONG! I had to do a factory reset on my phone and now I have to start over. I was so far with some really good cards, but alas I know more about the game now, so maybe I'll get there quicker this time.",
        "Don't bother downloading this game.  The customer service in this game is terrible.  I submitted a ticket because several combinations i researched in game disappeared.  I got a response that the game would fix itself and my ticket was being closed.  The problem didn't fix itself and i can't remember every combo lost. I submitted another ticket and I'm waiting for a response but after how my first ticket was handled I'm not confident they'll fix it. I've only been playing a few days but if the game is this buggy already then i don't recommend downloading it.",
        "It's actually surprisingly fun. The card mechanics are simple to grasp but with a enough depth to keep you trying new decks and combos. I chuckled a few times at some of the dialouge between the characters. 10/10 would recommend",
        "The game is addictive, but in short it's a gamble for cards. The prices are a lot for what you are getting. Lots of repetitive challenges. Unfortunately the quest for cards is really a quest for your wallet. I played since 9/16 and decided to walk away. Unfortunately you get to a point where the only way to move up is to spend, spend, spend. The gambling pulls for cards on real money game currency got old.",
        "The main problem with the game in my opinion is being able to attack your opponent while they have other cards in play. Perhaps if you could choose to block rather than be forced to take it the game would be a bit better aa youd have to manage your resources a bit better rather than beat hard until its over. Aside from that it is a very fun game to play",
        "Waste of money. No matter what you spend you never get decent cards. They stack the odds so no matter how you buy cards you'll always get ripped off. Mom's box is supposedly random yet I've bought hundreds of boxes I've never got anything worth a damn. I've played over a year and wasted a hundred bucks on this game w no reward. I strongly recommend you don't spend a dollar on this game. It won't help. The game will still screw you. Money will not help on this game."

        "Dear team, It's really a awesome game ever. I'm playing it since 2 years. Very addictive. But i request you to all, when we start a TEAM RACE many players join clans for playing team race n take efforts in team race for getting better reward but many of them team leaders kick players just before ending the team race n players won't receieve any reward for it. It was happened with me 2 times. So please do any update for those players who take much efforts in team war and then also they get nothing. Thanks",
        "This game used to be 5 star. They've changed it where all team events are gem sucks. You have no chance of winning without using a considerable amount of gems. They've taken away most in game free ways to get gems, and to buy them is not worth it, they're very over priced. It's not a team event, it's a paid for event. If they change it and make it more fair for everyone I'll make a new rating.",
        "It's a nice game with so many awesome monsters. I like it and it's my favourite game in this category. My suggestion is that if you can include an option to cancel ongoing breeding by giving gold or gems or without anything, it would have been better. The game has events that comes very frequently, it helps so much in getting new monsters and or progressing in the game.",
        "The game is awesome! The game play, the monsters, and also the actual fighting and graphics. This is one of my most rated games and my most played; I couldn't go a day without it. It's competition is so good online with people and in dungeons and the map, also team wars are fun with your friends. Get this game you'll never regret it.",
        "DO NOT PAY FOR ANYTHING IN THIS GAME. Recently my account was reset due to the game posting the wrong price of gems. I have lost everything even the things I paid full price for. I have been robbed of gems, cells, gold, food and my time. If you do play the game, don't spend actual money because they can take it all away. BE CAREFUL"

It does take a long time but to me that is part of it. It makes you slow down and enjoy simple fun. Too be honest all of us need to slow down and enjoy life around us. I play it on my breaks at work. The way you play this game allows for  short or long periods of play . Also it's quite fun seeing the little guy demolish tiles. It truly is an awesome game. I have recommended it to family and friends.",
        "I deleted all of my games except for Diggy's Adventure. This is my favorite game. I am going to play this game until me and Diggy win, and then I'm going to play it again from scratch. Google should make a whole lot of games like this. They are way better than match 3 puzzle games. I love cats I wish they could make a kitty's Adventures game like Diggy's Adventure.",
        "I've played this game for almost 2 years and have not once had a problem and have spent a lot of money. For some reason it's now crashing every few mins. I don't lose progress or anything but it's getting frustrating to have to keep restarting. I've even updated the app on my Android. Please help? It's my favorite app and I just want to dig!",
        "I really like this game but... It has been glitching A LOT for me lately. While I am playing it will freeze my phone. If I walk away for just a few seconds it freezes. My favorite glitch is after I watch a video for energy and before I use it the game kicks me out. Upon my return the energy is gone and I can't get energy for 2 more hours. 😐",
        "Very addictive game but you spend more time waiting for energy than playing. When you have unavoidable tiles of over 400 points it doesn't take long to lose all your stored energy. I thought games were for playing, not waiting around. It's play for 5 minutes wait for an hour. It's a shame because some of the puzzles are quite good.",
        "Would be better of the android app version had the same features as the full site.  I've been wondering how i can get friends logged onto a laptop and saw so many different features"

        "App is addicting! Fun to play! Levels get difficult  as you get higher. They should offer special coin purchase of 12,000 coins for $1. Since they take 500 every time to add 5 more moves! Would keep people playing more and they would have more purchases! That's how I'd rack in the bucks if it were my app!",
        "2ND UPDATE: 3/21/18- Thank you for adding new bathrooms and bathroom rugs! Thank you also for giving new, unique furniture on 5th or 7th consecutive days. Great job, and ty for  listening to players and making more  levels and changes and continued updating!  UPDATE: 2/2018 Please make more optional designs to find at neighbors' homes. I've been searching, and I can't find any more. Especially for the bathroom, and for the garden/flowers. That is one of the best features of the game. ty!         Thank you for the new update and new expansion!  Cant wait to achieve the new rooms. Best game!  Much better than \"Scapes\" Games. I like the way you can travel to neighbors to get new interior design fashions! A new idea that is brilliant. I am spoiled now! LoL Thank you and please keep up the hard work!",
        "Good game. Fun so far. I enjoy renovating the first room and the master bedroom.  So far I have only one complaint. Why can't I get the master bedroom? While I'm all for being generous, generosity has its limits and it is MY house. It might seem small to some but it does irritate me as I do love the story as one of the best bits. I'm not the only one who doesn't like her just claiming for herself. It comes across as rather arrogant and presumptuous of her. An idea might be to give me the master bedroom and then give her another where you can design it more to her tastes as a decorator.  Apart from that story issue just keep on going.",
        "Getting a little frustrated with this. I play on both my phone and tablet. When I try to play on my phone it asks me to update to synchronize my progress yet there are no updates available.  I have switched off and on and even uninstalled and reinstalled.  Very annoying that I cannot now play on my phone.  Just reinstalled this and it is working great now. Thank you for sorting. 5 stars all round.",
        "I am obsessed with this game! Love that you can easily make friends with other real players and use their furniture! Mixed levels of difficulty which means you never get stuck on a board for an annoying amount of time. Only thing is that when choosing your furniture, you have to click the picture a bunch of times before it let's you preview it.",
        "I like this game but it's frustrating how it's hard to get stars and then they want you to waste them on things like giving the cat a bath... I want to decorate the house not do all the silly side things."

        "What have you done?!! This was a great game with a few annoying adverts, now it's just one long advert interspersed with occasional races. I have no real issue with adverts but when they stick on the screen and hide the X until way after the timer ends that's just offensive. And seriously - £8.99 PER MONTH to clear ads? (Yes I know you get extras) - come on that's taking the ****",
        "Really fun casual game. Adverts are present but not too intrusive. Allowed to watch adverts in exchange for upgrades or items.   My only criticism is that it takes a while to get used to the different menu items as there's no instructions and the \"see as far as you can go\" sections are really expensive to unlock.",
        "I've been crazy about this game, but the new update is terrible because of the crashes and bugs. In the middle of race my touch screen doesn't work, the pedals either. Please, for god sake,fix this annoying problem, i can't play any more.thanks a bunch",
        "Fix the damn gas pedal. The reason why I lose half my races cause the gas pedal just magical doesn't want to read my finger but the brake sure does work just fine. Keep shoving ads down my throat and it'll be all 1 star.",
        "Money greedy game. You will end up watching ads every minute. You will be forced to watch half a minute irrelevent ads every minute. It's like these guys built the best game to annoy people with ads. Good luck. Played several levels just to get annoyed and uninstall."

        "Finally got the game to load, was delighted to see that the multi hour rewards were 880,000, so much more than other slot games! All of a sudden however you guys have decided to restrict those hourly gifts to 200,000! How are we supposed to play these games when most of these slots by default are asking us to bet several hundred thousand credits at a time? And yes, I do buy coin packs on rare occasions, but I shouldn't have to just to play this game! 😒",
        "It is a great apps and the games are amazing. I've reached level 241 and won big amount of credits.. however I just found out i could not go back to the pain page and keeps saying that is on downlaoding assets. Can anyone tell me what can i do to...?",
        "Loved this game but seems like product madness is very money hungry. You guys have to remember your just a game not a real casino. Lighten up on your wins and bonuses and maybe ill give you a try again.",
        "I found this slot app great to play just like the real thing . my only complaint would be need more coins on hourly bonus cause with most machines there's not even enough coins to have one bet. Thanks guys job well done.",

They do not follow their own rules.  They do not compensate players for their mistakes.  They let Chinese player buy packs cheaper and use at accounts.  If you are a Westerner do not play or pay on this game.  Their customer service sucks.  They actually try to get you to feel sorry for them.  Its amazing.  They will only steal from you.",

The developers claim it's not, but if it wasn't true, then why are 99% of the servers dominated by Chinese players?  Plus the Chinese to English translations are terrible.  You will barely understands what they're saying.",

Like things that have been improved on in this genre of game in other apps are still frustrating here. Oh well, what can I expect from a freemium game? Overall it's enjoyable but I have to take it in doses; basically until I get frustrated by the gameplay or other players. All in all, there are worse was to spend your time.",

For example I bought a Saint Patrick pack, 1000 gems a pack and got 10 lucky leafs, I could use the lucky to buy another pack, which I got a lucky leafs from, so I spent 10 lucky leafs got 1 lucky leaf that I couldnt use  unless I brought more! Literally got nothing for my money. This is EAs way of mugging people.",
        "Please add more sounds effect on this game, and fix the sfx that already on this app. I hope you add full match online like the other game (90 minutes) so we just not attack but defends too. Replay button must be great, and i have idea that you guys add event like \"best goal of the week\" or so, from that replay, we can save, and send to you, and you can choose who will win it. I think it will make people playing this game. Commentator should be great too if you add full match versus online. I love this game, please read it. Egy Maulana V plays for Lechia Gdańsk now. Add it! Add to all of your fifa games. That replay button should be great",
        "I just saved up all my team hero points, watched a heap of ads so I could build up stamina so I could do my best to try to get Mané in team heroes. About half way through collecting my hero rewards, the rewards pages started to go blank, and the last 25 packs I opened were empty. Is there any way to correct this?",
        "The game is good but it could be better. Elite players are too expensive  so it's hard to upgrade team. Informs and special cards are all untradable so unless you get lucky in events you won't get a chance to play with them. The new layout is better though. Unless you have plenty of time or money don't expect to progress in this game all that quickly. Mobile games should not be as grindy as console games.",
        "What's wrong with this game. I was playing Vs mode and was in world class level and got more then 600000 fans.and now I saw I'm in pro level.how it could be automaticy.fix it pls what the hell is going on.i make my progress playing v hard and all gone with in movement.even I did not play and lose."

        "Ok best game ever. I always dreamed of playing games like pubg or ml something like that but its just not my thing yknow? How its hard to control and super annoying to play. But this god this takes the trophy. Easy control, fun game play, get to live again after dying so no need to be sad so yeah well done gi",
        "Update: Game was fixed very fast and is my favorite game. Everyone should download and play this game. It's simply amazing with great graphics!!! Only thing is why can't we have a woman character? I'm a woman in real life and want to play one online too!!! When are you all going to add women characters???",
        "Graphics are good an Gun play is pretty fair. When battling the game goes on runs where I get matched against teams whos members are way stronger then my team an I. Then it goes back to fair match making.   3 Month UPDATE: The game has turned into a money grab. You have no chance to compete against players that drop a bunch of money an have 4 an 5 star guns. This was the top shooting game in my opinion, but turning it into a pay to compete killed the fun with this game. Havent been match fairly against players in a couple weeks now. I would recommend trying a different p vs p shooting game.",
        "Amazing game, however there is one small problem, but not enough for me to not give it 5 stars. Recently when I've been watching an ad to double the reward at the end of the battle, the video has played until the end and it says the reward has been doubled, but I only receive the regular reward? It has happened 15-20 times and it's getting slightly annoying, as I'm about 4000 gunbucks short of what I should be now. Anyways, thanks for making such an awesome free game with little to no adverts!  UPDATE: video watching for additional rewards does not work with anything. No extra crates or supplies",
        "One of the best fps I've played. Graphics is cartoonish but fun, Remedy is underpowered in the sense that it doesn't generate a decent HP on each hit. On lower levels, it's decent but on higher levels against Porcupine, Ranger, Thunder it doesn't stand a chance that could be balanced out by either increasing the rate of fire or increased health generation on each hit , Lifestealer is pretty darn awesome but could do better with a bit smaller crosshair and little bit more accuracy",
        "Initially the game seems super addictive but once you hit level 16 it gets ridiculous. You have players who have spent money on guns and you're practically no match. Also the teaming of players should be balanced out. Another thing is even if you win a match you win around 30 trophies, if you lose there's a loss of 60 and if by chance you're internet is bad and you automatically get kicked out and cannot reenter you lose a 100 .Eventually you get sick and tired of all this and the game gets boring."

        "Love it. Been playing for over a year. You can earn gems slowly to get premium characters or spend money to get them. However you do not need premium characters to play the game. I think people forget that your \"FREE\" games have to make money some how to pay developers, animators, IT support and more. Either they have dozens of ads everyday (DK has a few but not dozens) or premium paid content.",
        "Most addictive game! Playing it since it 1st started. Love the new mystery event it's so adorable except your missing one vital character!!  I think there's a couple points to improve on... the send home button in the characters actions list I think should be up the top and smaller instead of scrolling down for it cos I use it often. 2nd all of the sounds in my game are very poor, it's nearly always silent and music is always late. Haven't heard the high 5 sound in ages 😔 please fix the sound!",
        "The game is fun and all, but do you think you guys could get this game optimized for the Lenovo tablets? I had to get a new tablet since previous one broke. Now the game keeps closing out on me when I'm trying to do something. Think you guys can fix this somehow?  I'd appreciate it if you do. Thanks in advance.",
        "This game has given me nothing but problems. Every update has to have a glitch. First there was a problem when ever I tried to open a chest. Then an update came and After that update now the consetion stands close out the game anytime I want to view. Now with winnie the poo update the whole dam game is slow. Seriously thinking of quiting. It doesn't matter every update has a glitch. Can't u guys fix it? Or is just me?",
        "This is a fun game. Graphics are so very Disney.  I have a question.. WHAT is the reason for the guests to have a character over their head? That is quite distracting..especially when I don't know what their purpose is.  Also..I wish their leveling up and their quests weren't so long..I only get to play about 5 minutes. But I do love the game",
        "This game is amazing! I love it so much! It just reminds me of my childhood, and of all of the TV shows I used to watch. I have only 1 problem with this game, it does not count time when you go out of the game or close your phone. It might just be me, but if it wasn't for the bad saving, I would have given this game 5 stars, since it deserves it, or even more."

        "Nice game but the random number generator is non existent. Hold three numbers and roll again, even with free or earned additional rolls, are ALWAYS the same number that was there! This would fail state regulations on gambling games. Fun but a sucker game for rolling anything that counts as statistically random",
        "This is fun, IF you can figure it out. I like playing yahtzee but this is complicated. Every time I get extra dice, the ???? spends them or takes them away from me so I don't get to spend them the way I want to. That sucks.",
        "Love the game! But recently did an update for the app now my game glitches out. Takes forever to roll the dice. Only updated the app cuz it said they fixed bugs & made faster well it did the opposite for my app.",
        "Showdown is a joke!  100% guarantee opponent will get a double Yahtzee every single game.  Their average score is 320+ when a normal person scores 250-275.  Impossible enough to score a Yahtzee yourself but double is almost unheard of.",
        "Playing verse your friends is fun but Playing against the computer is not fun but a complete waste of time. Only way to Win is to Extra rolls with the Dice you have to buy. If you don't plan on losing 2/3 of the time.",
        "The game was awesome until the ads started to pop up every 5 seconds, and the game progressively got slower and slower. Now it's just ads upon ads and lag. Game got ruined quick."

        "Can't win.. sure they give nice daily bonus credits. But the machines are tight won't let you win and after you lose conveniently a pop up to purchase from their site.",
        "Am frustrated can not log in it just says goldfish has stopped have not gotten a chance to get my daily bonus so may be pushed back to day 1 sent 4 reports and not 1 was answered ughhh pls get back to me someone thank you",
        "The ruby slots should be our choice I never get the one I like. Otherwise this is my favorite slot casino",
        "Very  realistic free casino game.  Most slots match brick and mortar casino slots exactly.  Realistic pay outs as well. Perfect app for wasting a little time at work!!",
        "On December 9 2016 I purchased a Christmas pack for $4.99 didn't receive coins. About 10 minutes ago played fish food game got all cans went to gold turtles got the 200,000 because i bet the minimum of 14,000 and the total was 796,000 in coins made the. big win sound but didn't pay me my coins. Don't purchase this app or play the game its a rip off also today I got a goldfish bonus picked 20 spins in total I had 1,847,000 coins but after the bonus finished it did not pay me on today 9/19/2017"

        "Do not spend any money on this game. This used to be one of the best slot games until the developers got greedy. Payouts are small and events are nearly impossible. They try to make it all sound good but it's not. They also changed the customer service on here where it's hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!",
        "What the hell kind of question is that?  \"Is it beautiful\".... meaning the game! HOW NOT PERTAINING TO ANY GAMES!  Anyway,  this game is hands down the best Slot game EVER!  Have played slots in and out of casino's for over 20 years and this is the one to play! A huge variety of Casino games,  easy to maneuver and a lot of really nice people.",
        "I used to love this game but something they did changed it. Winning is nearly impossible even if you are a paying customer. I know it is a game of luck but when you purchase 85 silver tickets you should be able to complete puzzles when you only need 1 piece for each of them. Make winning a little easier and people will be happy to spend money.  I think the game is broken. I was just playing in a room on Billionaire with a person who was playing on Huge Casino. I know it's the same developer but I don't think that is supposed to happen. I know the person was playing Huge Casino because it was my husband playing it. May want to look into it.",
        "Customer relations are horrible even non existent. If you spend money you will lose far more than you win, in their eyes you will spend even more. If you send a message they will hide behind a canned \"industry standard\" response. This is not a free standing casino there are no freebies and you can't collect any winnings. Yet they have their games dialed in so you lose in hopes you will spend money. Horrible company.",
        "I just started this account in hopes of recovering my lost one. If it goes smoothly, I am happy with the app to date. The slots don't pay as much as they used to, a little tite , otherwise a fun app. The events they choose for you to play, daily, do steal a lot of chips. If u want to remain in a successful club, you must do them, is the main downfall. I would recommend it to my friends.",
        "This is an interesting game. After I played it for awhile it became very boring. Haven't gotten a big or any good win for the past 70 million. I guess if you buy chips you might win more often. It doesn't give you all the bonuses, and it takes gifts and doesn't give them to the gamers you gave it to. So all in all it's just okay. I've never been able to get anywhere with their support team as they added to my reply. I'd give it a one star but if you buy chips it might be better."

You can spin any game, at any bet level, even buy more chips but the payouts absolutely disappear. It will  happen to you, trust me.  Beware of Jackpot Party!  THEY FLEECE THEIR PLAYERS!",

I wonder if your advertisers know you block videos from playing. I could understand if it were for real money but this is (WAS) my bathroom game.",

        "I use to actually win back in the day on this app but now it's about impossible. Also the ad videos for free coins is a complete scam !!!! You receive 200k coins which is basically a spin and you will not win. All free coins from ads will not produce any wins. Please tell me there is not a different payout percentage off the ad coins. But you're making real money from us watching  the ad. Mmmmmmmm....",

I would have been excited about the upcoming birthday event if I could access my game. Fix soon or I will delete this and all other zynga games I funnel my hard working money into",
        "Great game, love achieving all the quests, also love the show animals, I wish I could do more than one with a partner though. I wish that during an update that it wouldn't stop the game for the players, showing grassy area with no coins or keys and level 1, so I could continue to play. But I know I just have to leave it for a while and wait till the update is finished, which is hard because it is so addictive. Some people need to remember though that this is a free game.",
        "Liked this game until now. I recieved some keys from the game. I used them then they said they had had some technical difficulties and some players should not have received them then promptly took my remaining keys off me!  This was they're mistake not mine. I find this churlish and ridiculous. It's put me right off the game!",
        "Since Jan this game has gone to hell in a hand basket. Every update I have to fight to get stuff back they y'all took from my game. This game use to be fun, now I don't care if I play it or not. Y'all only care a out the people who spend money on your game, not the loyal ones that's been playing since it went mobile. I'm very disappointed!!",
        "I just started playing this game and was really liking it. In one day I made it to level 15 and had made a purchase using real money. The app froze and I tried everything is fix it but it erased my whole farm and made me start over. I am soooooo mad!!!! And I'm mad I spent money and lost everything. Really not impressed at all",
        "When I first got it it worked fine. (Yesterday). Now every time I get on it'll load but will freeze and not let me do ANYTHING AT ALL. I've tried everything from closing the app to restarting my phone. Please fix it because I really like the game."

        "Awesome game with a cool soundtrack, the gameplay itself isn't too challenging and has room for strategy. The only downside as far as I can tell is the terrible multiplayer system which doesn't even work most of the time. But overall this game is a great time waster and very enjoyable.",
        "Good graphics. Good units. Awesome skills. Nice drawings. All in all, this is a really good game 😁👍👌But I have a problem. It keeps stopping everytime I open it. And I've also been addicted to this game for more than a month now 😄",
        "It's been a year since I've last played this, still fun. I've been playing this from day to night as far as I could remember. Hopefully, the bugs where the downloading restarts are solved. Nice Gameply as ever, getting hooked to this once again.",
        "This game is fun and addictive. I like that you don't have to work very hard to get decent leveled characters, and having everyone be overpowered makes the game fun. My only problem is how multiplayer is a little wonky sometimes, mainly when the app suddenly freezes during a battle.",
        "Feels satisfying and stress-free , cute characters too. I just have one problem, when it gives me a notifications of free polygons or similar to that, I go check but I don't get anything. There appears nothing in my giftbox.",
        "Great graphics and music and very f2p friendly for a gachapon game. Lots of banners with guaranteed top tier units so if you follow the Discord or Reddit community's advice on when to pull, you can make the free gems go a long way. The more characters you have, the more quests you can do to get more characters, so it may seem slow in the beginning but eventually your character collection will snowball until you have more waifus than you know what to do with!"

        "A well made app that's immersive, addictive, and the essence of the Kingdom Hearts franchise. The app is mission based and has a complex but easy to use medal system with rock-paper-scissors type of combat. You can join/make a party, or go solo. Money isn't an issue so long as you pace yourself. It gets better the more you play. There are optional event quests and a story, but don't fret if you can't get the app or just starting out; it's slow going. 735 quests.",
        "Liking the cute art style but my god does this game take forever to download even with a low resolution. Has taken me two attempts and I'm doubtful that it's related to my broadband speed and connection (not sure if it's to do with my phone? But again, doubtful.) Would be great if this could be fixed somehow.",
        "I freaking love this game! However I have a small complaint that is probably fixable. I was wondering for my lg g6 if you could expand the borders so the screen would fit. And if the screen is not able to get any bigger, I'm hoping you people can at least put a cool border around it instead of leaving it as a black bar. I know you people can make cool borders. Thanks for your attention!",
        "Hey guys, huge fan of the kingdom hearts series and also the game in general. Though one thing I wish you could add is the option to link your data to your Google Play account as well as Facebook. Not a lot of us use Facebook so I wish there was more options to get your data back if you ever deleted the app. Otherwise, good game!",
        "I love this game.  Strategy, adventure, and story (once you get far enough) are all great!  Although it is a little pay to win, and they keep coming out with new medals (attacks) that are infinitely better than your current ones.  This can get discurraging, because your hard work doesn't really mean much in the long run.    I played for 6 month when a friend got a single medal that made him more powerful than me on his 1st week playing.",
        "[Edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH! I love that you all added a lower quality version this way I can play this game.] I like it and all, but when that very large download starts after the tutorial, it stops at 4/6 and restarts, even though my phone has enough room for it, I think. Please fix this, I really want to play it!"

        "Love this game. My only issue is with an update a few days ago that gives the background animation. I  have visual issues and the movement is making this game less enjoyable for me. One of the reasons that I  love word games is because the screen is without animation. It would be great if this was an option that could be turned off in settings.",
        "So good I've finished it! Great game for stimulating the mind. Waiting for new levels but at least I can still do the daily puzzle. Only downside is that some of the words are extremely obsure but the dictionary should help with those. Please hurry and add new levels.... I'm addicted!",
        "Challenging, fun and interactive! Great app for those who likes brain and vocabulary challenges :D Down side is that after the update, the butterflies run out in daily challenge even before i finish the puzzle so I always end up with 2 stars... please fix this bug or error...",
        "Very good but log in or if u change phone u loose ur game & start again! 😂 very frustrating when so far in lol! Also why is lea not a word i thought it was a meadow in the english dictionary? Am i wrong?",
        "Where did the free hints in exchange for ads go?  They had recently moved to their own button, found by hitting \"Shop\" then X-ing out.  Today, they are completely gone.  I'm going to stop playing this game without them.  It's no fun to get stuck.",
        "Ok. This is my THIRD review of this game and I'm getting a little upset. You put the clues back. Thank you very much for listening to us all. Now I have a new issue with the way you have changed this game. Before People Fun came along, when we put a word into the puzzle, sometimes we would see things like, \"Excellent!\" Or, \"Spectacular!\" pop out at us. I noticed this morning that you've taken away that feature. Why? This game was absolutely perfect when you came along. Why are you changing it? Who are you, that you would take a perfect game and then take away the best features? Those words popping out made the game more fun, and they encouraged us to keep going, and yeah, I don't mind saying it. They made us feel good about ourselves. It was a pat on the back. Who gets many of those these days? And you took that away from us. Now this game is dry and boring. Please put the pats on the back, back. Thank you."

        "I just updated the game which fixes some minor bugs. But, Game stuck at 11% before updating & also after updating & it's become HABIT for me to see the Gameloft's March of empires: war of lord games SERVER PROBLEM. I am a Android mobile user, so, there must be a option of graphic quality change just to make sure that game runs smoothly, because I spend many months to grow & if big guys using PC version attacks, then I can't do anything because my game just freezes, lags & don't respond for some time. But the game is over for me as I loss so much. So, Gameloft launch a LITE VERSION FOR ANDROID USERS or there are huge chances of players who will leavethis game & already many left this game, as you can see the are many dead castles in each realm.",
        "Please upgrade to more realistic graphics and gameplay like Age of empires 3. Think more innovative like Fort camps to protect capitals and much more is needed in regard to spies, make it more difficult to spy and gather info. Also the defenses should be given more importance cause some guys from all realms have huge armies and it's easy for them to break into castles, I prefer more options when it comes to defenses. You guys are doing great but more options the better."

        "Well this is not a grate game this game is FANTASTIC  !!! Haven't seen any adds in over two weeks I've been playing it. I think they asked, but I came all by myself to rate it because its a grate game! Gorgeous graphics, controls are excellent, music is good  and most of all its quite interesting! Way to go people ! Thank you! Came back to update on my experience with this game. Over a month paying no  surprises, no adds, no asking to rate it just wonderful. Challenging at times than easyer and so on. Congratulations to the creators of this game and keep up the grate job!!! I am at the level 126!",
        "I am at level 218, since the recent update I am unable to play, screen goes to loading the level them just keeps loading, I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times with the same result. There's a glitch that I wish would be fixed before I decide to uninstall for good. Lost all of my gold bars, all of my cherries upon reinstall. It's a shame.",
        "Used to love this game. Now game is too difficult. Have to repeat level over and over again to move on. It is no longer fun to struggle at each level. That is frustrating...not relaxing.",
        "AHHHH ONCE AGAIN AN UPDATE THAT WIPED OUT EVERYTHING I'VE WORKED FOR.  SOMEDAY YOU'LL FIX THAT BUG!  It's better than any of the others despite bugs.",
        "Use to love it but shuts down every time I try to play lately!  Also have never been able to pick apples always says oops try again!",
        "I lost  300+ gold & 700+ cherries after the game crushed last night. worst update ever   UPDATE 20 MAR: Would you please add a comfirm message when using 10 golds for play on? I have to restart  saving for  golds after the evil update, and I just lost all the 40 golds by wiping play on accidently due to slow respones of the game."

        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "Love the concept of the game but the moment you start reaching higher castle lvl  that's when you realize that if you don't pay you will be on a long journey, ie.. PvP are out of the question everyone has minimum of 5 epic items, arena you will have to settle for 5th or less place due to power lvl difference. I am about 141000 fighting 190000 or 90000, which is not fair for those of low power or advantage to those of high.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",
        "I loved this game very much, I had a lot of really nice things and invested nearly $60 dollars into making my guys 5 stars and diamonds and other level up promos... I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine.."

The bravery and HP system is very interesting, and I'm always looking forward for new characters and their few, but unique, special abilities. TL;DR Overall great game.",
        "My name is auron I've been playing game since release and I have some concerns. For starters I have 999 all strength crystals. Why is there still events to get crystals? And wakka can use some ability to boost his buff dance. He barely procs.maybe instead of strength crystals you can have key events for summon materials... Love this game btw keep up the good work and please rework wakka!!!!",
        "It's liked someone finally thought \"hey,  maybe people just want a classic ff based game with out to much mobile game bull.\" I liking  it so far,  leveling pretty fast(well until  the pay wall hits) and the chance of me spend money on this 70 percent. But for real,  4 chapters in still  no Squall ya killing me.",
        "Absolutely amazing. I can safely call this an actual game that you can play. There is no energy that stupidly limits play time, you can unlock all available characters by playing the game, and it actually FEELS like a true Final Fantasy game! I love this game and I am definitely going to spend money in the future to show my support for this amazing game.   However, since this game is fairly new, there isn't much to do. You definitely need to add more quests, more characters, more events, and PvP. Real-time PvP would be amazing. This is truely a spectacular game, and I highly recommend it for any Final Fantasy fan. Also, Cloud is available near the start of the game! Big thumbs up. Please don't screw around with energy Square Enix, please as it is a plague in the mobile gaming business.   EDIT: Please increase the level cap to 99 in the future please. Lv 50 cap doesn't feel right at all. Otherwise, awesome game.",
        "The game is amazing!! However I am not able to play on my Samsung Galaxy 9+ after upgrading my phone and this is truly unfortunate. Are you guys working on a fix? Pleease let me know, will update to five star after...cause I mean at this point I cant play the game :(.",
        "Got this game since launch, but after the 6th days, the game get pretty repetitive. My cload still at lvl 47 lol. The cutscene video could be better because I always skipped it. The casually walking at the start of a video make me wanna spam the skip button. I remember what intrigued me from the old ff cutscenes wasn't about the graphic, but their action pack scenes. RTK just launched (currently #1 on play store). I'll be playing that game instead for now."

Meaning you need to pay to do them. I really find it a nice read but since the books are few i'm on hold on purchasing diamonds. I guess once a series is completed i'm willing to buy diamonds to replay that game. For now i'm just browsing the game and taking notes on how many diamonds are going to cost per book.",
        "This game is amazing! The graphic is pretty great, plus the story is super ADDICTIVE. I can't stop reading this story but because of I have no pass left. However the problem is the pass, the pass is too little and the time is pretty long to wait. I hope this app would give much pass and please make the time shorter. But still this game is awesome, I recommend this game for you. You should download this app and try it."

Big advantage.. And you dont HAVE to go platinum to enjoy this game, but I am considering it ! GREAT JOB !!",
        "It has a good game play as well as millions of adds which eventually ruines the game. You have to watch an add after every single mission and before starting a new mission to gain energy. So basically the energy bar is just a little trick played on us for watching advertisement. I will not recommend this game only because of the adds, otherwise it's really a good game.",
        "Do not buy Premium. You see all the locked features saying exclusive to Premium. You drop $70 for Premium only to find out the best features are still locked because now there is Premium Plus for ANOTHER $150. You are not told other than here by me that what you get when you buy Premium is a Premium-lite. You hear about Premium Plus for the first time after you have bought Premium (lite)",
        "Nice game. So far I've noticed only critical hits count. Taking out a knee or a shot to the gonads usually fails. Upgrades are like any other game, spend money to get the good stuff. Hopefully it doesn't get to the point I can't unlock the items to keep playing.",
        "Sinse last update when playing when get killed it will show score screen but spawning back to game locks up and won't play just have to watch myself lose or stop and start over losing my life??????? Please fix...... Would like to know when you are going to fix can't win for losing life and diamonds and not even getting to play!!!!!!!!!! Don't know what you have done to the game getting where it is no fun getting killed before you even get respawned",
        "Not only are the graphics realistic, there so persise on everything. They even allow you to purchase different variety of guns. I just wish they let you assemble your own gun, which of course accessories. Best sniper game I've ever played."

        "This game should be avoided. They don't care about what the players think and refuse to make improvements or adjustment players suggest. Progress is slow and even if you spend real money your odds of getting what you want is low.  Avoid starting at a costs. It is not worth your time.",
        "It is impossible to have a good team without spending lots of money.  In order to have a good team you need 4 star level robots which even when you do get a chance to get one, you will end up with a duplicate which will be liquidated for just about nothing. Hence better players get better and lower level players stay at the bottom. Also players that spend alot tend to get better chances on draws that are supposed to be random. Wow that's a surprise",
        "This game is a lot of fun. Great time killer. The only thing I think could be improve is the fact that you can't upgrade your bots with duplicates you get in the space bridge. And possibly better mechanics to see the bots you have walking around your base. Other than that. It's amazing.",
        "Updated. Games are supposed to be fun, if u play this game be prepared for a complete lack of respect for its user Base from the devs and a lack of fun events. Even those spending 1000s are bored  Don't start spending as the game is dying Don't expect good support from the game makers either who seem to be on a mission to put off it's older users to the point of stopping them playing the game. Ps dont expect many players as a deception. Pps #saveferal",
        "First off, if you do not want duplicates, do _not_ spend any money on anything other than maybe another builder bot and don't waste any of your cyber coins on crystals until you get all of your builder bots.   So long as you don't care about getting dupes the game is fun. And you will get so very many many many dupes, often times the same bot in a row. Fortunately, the somewhat new cores help take away the pain of getting dupes.  Personally, I enjoy the strategic and alliance parts of this game a lot and the events are fun so long as you don't care about placement on the leaderboard. Having a good alliance helps a lot by the way. Don't be afraid to look around for ones that boot leaches.",
        "You save up to get new players for months that are three stars when you only have 11 of the 160 of the characters and then you turn in you three star crystals you have been saving for months and the next 2 of the next 3 characters are duplicates.  11 of 160. What are the odds. That upset me. Game is almost rigged so you don't get any good characters."

Unfortunately, i have one issue i can't access the chat room, no messages, cant access mh own profile. It keeps saying network error even though i am currently playing the game smoothly. If you can fix this i would gladly appreciate",
        "If you put gold army in your garrison troops its impossible to invade you even the attacker is highest level. Attacking castle is very costly you need to attack many times for few resources. The shop is sucks. Too much chines character. I dont know my goal at all. Etc.. So many issue for this game needs lot's of improvement.",
        "I think I would like this game but somehow I have never played it or downloaded it until today but the game is not at the beginning and I keep getting kicked off as it says I have logged into another device.  Not the first time I have ran into this problem.  Please help me fix this.  I have cleared the game data uninstalled and all that nonsense.",

I am enjoying this relaxing, mind game however, I had to reset my phone and all my progress was lost...not cool! I've contacted the developers / company twice with no fix offered yet.😔😕 Hoping to get an accommodation and a way to avoid this issue in the future!",
        "This is a pretty awesome app which makes our mind to formulate words with the given letters. But many a times we come across words for which we are unaware of the meaning. If you guys can create a small block on the screen which displays the meaning of the last word created/accepted. Then this app will become an ultimate learning app or say vocabulary building app as well. Hoping to see the enhancement is sometime near future.",
        "If I could give zero stars I would. This game was great to pass time and a good game for a brain teaser. But recently bought a new phone and even though I signed into Facebook it did not save me levels coins or anything else that I worked so hard to get. It reset me back to the beginning. So never buy a new phone if you don't want to start over.",
        "I really enjoy playing. Addictive even my husband downloaded!  My only frustration is that myself an him paid for no ads however he seems to get perks such as extra random coins an i dont! Why?? The game is good but doesnt feel consistent for all.",
        "The advertisement I saw for this game, WASNT EVEN THIS GAME. I downloaded it expecting a different time of word game, looked like a whole bunch of Scrabble word tiles lined up and you'd choose words. This game is nothing like that. Its ok, but very misleading advertisement and disappointed in that.",
        "It's fun and cute. I like that it gets harder as you progress. Edit: March 17th, 2018. There was an ad after you completed a level and that was fine. That's how it was last night and usually the ads were quick. Now there is an add at the very bottom of your game which really makes it difficult to concentrate and you accidentally click it every time you shuffle your letters. This was 5 stars, but now it's going to have to be 3. That, to me, is very annoying and eventually I'll stop playing altogether as a result."

But, Paradise seems pretty cool so far, only thing I'm not a big fan of is how everything deals with irl money while in the 'old' one you could build up gems or materials for certain things like VIP levels; also I heard about rewards being given to old players like me? That's pretty cool, will have to check that out... But yea, so far I like the game, miss the old style but it's still good to me, will update this later on when I play more.",
        "Gave you people an opportunity to fix the stupid chibi icon characters. The latest update didn't fix that so uninstalled.  Also do not reply with a generic response cause you can kiss my ass",
        "Only challenging for nonpaying playing. Not a big fan of pay to win games. But LoA is always addicting and just makes you want to spend your money. Not suitable if you're addicted to that overall. More nonpaying support would be reasonable for them to at least be able to compete.",
        "Latest updates just added more to this already enjoyable game.  However I wouldn't encourage new players to spend any money on the game as the benefits are nonexistant for what you pay. Which means a limited lifespan for the game if no one is paying.  Still a good game to enjoy on a mobile device.",

It's not my network so don't say it's my network.. I tried restarting the game that only makes it worst I really want to play this game."

        "Love this little game! I wish we had five life's, Three just gets me started. But overall, it's a great game. Getting like Candy Crush the higher the level the more impossible it gets to finish. Please don't make it so hard to win. I keep having to use coins to buy lives. Can never build up enough to amount to anything. Also you can give cash on the scratch off card. PLEASE !!!",
        "Very hard and not as fun as the other games but  because you cannot even solved one level in a 3 lives. My friends do not want to play when I showed them how it is being played. I've noticed that the first part of level 3 is more fun now than before. But still the 2nd and 3rd level is very hard. I admire those who completed the whole cities. They must be geniuses in algorithms in solving the 9 moves in one level. The most amazing part of this game are the graphics.  Awesome really awesome.  Very well done. Still playing this game but also still cannot convince my friends to get out of CC and other games. Will keep on trying though.",
        "This game is set up to STEAL a certain number of lives before you can win a level. Some levels, like Venice, level 79 may never be won. I have bought extra lives twice, extra moves twice, I REFUSE to make anymore purchases. If this was a truly user friendly game, it would BANK any extra moves, lighting, and other bonuses you've earned but did not use. But no, it throws them out. STEALS what you have earned. BANK it for me, I earned it, I should get to keep it. I'm done with this game.",
        "I am glad for the staff at big fish they did a wonderful job getting me back play after all my levels where lost.. They found them all and it made me happy that i can play where i was.. I can not play to often sometimes and had taken me a long time but look forward to every new city i get to open a new and all the challenges i get to participate in.  Thank you all for this game",
        "Fantastic game!  I love the graphics and interesting bits of trivia shared every time a landmark is built.  I also like the extra daily challenges and the special events that open up every so often.  Gummy Drop is challenging but can be played without needing to make any in-app purchases.  One con: the game starts you with three lives (lives replenish after 20 minutes), but in order to permanently increase your lives to five, you must pay $10.",
        "Surprisingly fun! I was setting the ads for this game everywhere but thought they were really unappealing. Work on your ads a little to emphasize the fun prizes for completing levels, the enjoyable hunt for tour letters in old levels, the history of the buildings you save! So many great things happening in this game."

        "Alright, once you start the game, you will be bombarded with text, and difficult to read names if you are unfamiliar with the franchise, But you definitely get used to the UI and various names soon.   It is free to play, and unless you are aiming to be top 1% I personally don't think the cash shop is mandatory. You do get free stuffs in forms of daily chests and log in events, jut be patient if you don't want to spend money on it. You will get the stuffs eventually.    Story mode is fun, and often quite challenging, If you can't decide whether or not you want to play the game, just give it a try for few hours. Who knows, you might like it!",
        "The worst thing happened in this game is players can use cheat/mod for annihilation. I low down from 5 star to 1 because of this issue which cannot be fixed in 3 weeks. There is no harsh punishment for cheating players who claim to the top to get reward. Even though I love this game so much, i am very disappointed with the response of developer of the game about this issue.",
        "Pacing is a bit slow, and getting good artifacts is a gacha sink, but the core gameplay is presently the best tactical gaming on offer for mobile phones.  FFT is still the genre's high mark, but RotTK is a different breed, and best in class.",
        "Was loving the game until I upgraded to Android 8.0 and it stopped working. I just click on it and nothing happens. Will rate higher after that is fixed. Edit: As of now it is fully working with Android 8.0",
        "The game is very good, but since yesterday that I updated the game always pop up that my connection is unstable attempting to connect even I have 4G internet. Please fix it for this problem.",
        "A good game but there hits a point where grinding is necessary to make further progress. Too many different currencies to earn. Otherwise great game and glad to see LoCC revived, as well opportunities for new stories."

        "Nice Game! At the start its easy, like many players said, but maybe they didnt stick through to further their games,I believe the easy start is needed to build for the later part of the games specially if you are a f2p player. Though being F2P isnt as bad here as it is on other games (speaking from experience). I like thier new updates now and specially the \"sweep\" requirement. Thanks Devs! my only hope is that please make planting/ crops a little easier on us common folks,it gets a little bit tiring to have to press from seed&gt;plant repeat (depending on your available field). Anyway, besides this i do not regret playing the game, easy controls, f2p friendly, graphics is good, controls are good. Keep up the good work devs!looking forward to more updates",
        "For the love of God let me grammar check your game...",
        "Very nice and addictive game, i like it.  Would be nicer if pvp is already availble",
        "Nice game. I just hope more free diamonds to be given during quests :)",
        "I love the game but what happened to pk cus you guys are an different company",
        "Downloaded the game just to see LoL heroes like Ahri and Sona on action only to found out most of them in preview screenshots doesn't exist in-game. But overall a fun game and f2p friendly.  Edit: upped my rating to 5 after 5 days playing, you guys deserve it. Keep up the good work. :)"

        "Addictive and engrossing game.  The bonus covers work well. The constant character tweaking and release rate makes the vs progression awards with wins is very good.  The favorites is a good way to let folks focus on building certain characters.  The transition points are still frustrating, especially when you get a run of bad luck with tokens.  Tokens might work better if they scaled instead. Biggest issue is progression awards in versus and the tough transitions in levels.",
        "This is an awesome, addictive and hyper fun game. Brilliant idea and concept. In all the games I have played this is the first I have spent money on. VIP member. Have a couple suggestions for developer tho. Can you add abilities to swap covers with alliance members and maybe add as a bonus drop for playing, an extra free slot. Keep up the brilliant work. Truely love this game.",
        "I have been playing this game for a few years now and love it! But a little suggestion... Because of the time I've spent playing it and the already difficult ability to get 4 and 5 star characters, I have nearly 3 million iso-8 that I literally cannot spend. Please add a way to convert iso-8 into hero points or command points!!! I'd like to get further in the game instead of literally stockpiling iso-8. This has all been done without spending a single dollar on the game too, btw",
        "This is my go-to game. Day and night. It's fun, simple and sometime challenging. My only complaint is that i have like a million of Iso-8 and don't know what to do with them. My thought would be that if we don't need so much Iso-8, be sweet to give some to aliance member who needs it or so on. Great game. Don't know what I'd do without it!",
        "Suitable for all age groups, Marvel Puzzle Quest is a great game for everyone. Progress with higher tier characters may be slow but yet significant. The wide variety of heroes and villians within the game allows for endless possibilities of the \"best team\". Highly addictive, I would recommend this perfect game to anyone and everyone.",
        "Love that they are always adding new characters. Would like to see some different characters like Cable, Domino, Sabretooth, and Bishop just to name a few. Just because they don't have a movie... Would also like to see some new events, new animations, and less repetitiveness. Love the collection part and finally being able to use characters when you've finally built their powers enough. Love that it can be played for free. Love that feedback is read and the game is constantly evolving.Thanks."

I love the easy gameplay and the graphics, The only problem I have with it is how hard I is to get ninja pearls without money, I'm young and dont have a credit card or job yet so I miss quite a few opportunities. I highly recommend to any Naruto fans.",
        "This game is very great and can be addicting. The only problem u have is that when ever I try to play a mission it always says there is a communication error. I would really like to keep playing the game, so if there is anything you could do about it- that would be great.",
        "your servers are bad.. trying to hunt Chino but 2 times already when we finish the last map and i see the yellow card of the last boss, then i get connection lost and don't get a thing in the end.. it is really frustrating to play for 15 minutes, see your goal fulfilled but then.. nooooo, you don't get the cards in the end",
        "I love the game, but during multi-player, especially in impact missions, let us continue even if player 1 gives up. It's extremely annoying when you play to the boss, and their hp is very low,  and player 1 leaves and all that time was for nothing. Let player 2 and 3 continue, even if player 1 and 3 or 1 and 2 quit, let that last player control the other two. That's the only improvement I can think of for the next update.",
        "I'm only putting it as one star in hopes the devs see this, but please find a better way to recover accounts. I've been a fan of this game for years and when I logged in I was logged out, I have no idea what my transfer info is because I've only had to do that once. I don't want to just start over, please find a better way for people to get their accounts back once your update logs them out.",
        "It's not the best game but because I am a fan of naruto my interest in this game might be different than others would think. Overall its a decent mobile game but it could use some more improvements."

        "Overall great game as far as playing is concerned. Major thing that could use work is matchmaking. Currently an 89 overall getting matched against 98-105 overall players. No chance to win and may discourage some people from playing the game. The gameplay is awesome and I have lots of fun, 100% worth your time if you avoid Head-to-head or tournaments (unless you have money or don't mind being poorly matched).",
        "This is my full honest review. Madden Mobile is back!! I'll admit before it was not fun and I complained that you need to pay to win but EA really did good when I came back to play. The game is fun and is somewhat easy to get 100 overall players and now they are bringing back Draft Champs and I have seen early drafts and it looks great. The promos are great. I would like to say great job EA on bringing this game back and making it fun. I always want to play everyday and build my Ultimate Team",
        "I have played this game for 3 seasons now.  I can't even begin to say all that is wrong, but one of the things that stands out most to me, is that your players stats mean nothing.  You spend a lot of time and effort completing events and grinding, and improve your team only to find out that when you play a team way below your level, it seems that that teams players are much faster and tend to play way above their ability.  this game seems to have the liberal bug that everyone is equal.  I am done with this game, don't get caught up with it, it's not worth the waste of your time",
        "Thanks alot EA for this new head to head style. Great to know that all the grinding and work put in is only allowing those who have a 100 overall or better reap the rewards. Everytime playing one of these individuals they have a counter for every single play. This really turns me off to the game.",
        "For the person hoping to find Madden 18, this is the closest thing you are gonna get. Yes, it doesn't have practice mode or my player mode, but it DOES have a incredible roster of players that you bargain for. The graphics are pretty good for a game on a smartphone.  Overall, this game is a MUST HAVE for NFL fans. 10 outta 10.",
        "You know I really like all of the Live Events but when I get these old collectible cards that aren't worth anything I have to cut them one by one. It takes way too long and I've got over a hundred. I would suggest having a way to group delete or in Madden terms \"cut\" the old dead weight."

        "Game wasn't all bad.....until you had to deal with customer support,  they could care less about the player. It was glitchy at times, report it, they'd just say they had no problems on their end...to bad. Had a few issues where customer support just blew us off.....sad to because could've been great game",
        "Season 1 is the only enjoyable time to play for free to play players, having enhanced legendaries gairo becomes the most important aspect of later seasons 2, 3 etc.. and only by spending money do your chances of getting good cards rises, if not for how the card draws work this would be one very interesting game. Big spenders make the game unbalanced and unfair for any other players.",
        "Love this game and have it on 2 of my other devices! But I try to play it here on my tablet and it loads, then right before it throws me in the game it force closes! :( sad and frustrating. I would love to see this fixed. Overall a great game though!",
        "The game is great in itself, it's functional and fun. The issue is the game only matters until the schemes come to light and the backstabbing starts. This kind of game always suffers from the pay to play platform, it's capable of being played for free but the wallet warriors take things to a point where it's not fun for anyone else, and most of the time you can't actually play the game the way it's meant to be played.",
        "Very good strategy game, tutorial helps you get started and provides you with resources at the beginning. Controls are occasionally confusing.  The game is rather complicated and I found it difficult to compete with long-term players although they were willing to help.",
        "I will write a new review in a day or two - starting on a new server now, the last was without good cards. I love this game but, need a fighting chance ;  )"

After 2-3 years, getting a mid range mobile, I installed the game once again to try it on my new android & guess what, it WORKED Flawlessly! (On Moto G5 plus) and also, thanks a lot for giving me Rewards as a returning user back to Kritika. Love you guys, you are awesome. Keep developing XD(Request: like orders & chaos 2, please try to give a open world look) thanks once again.",
        "I'll give it 5 star if only I can Recover my account. I forgot my password then when i asked Gamevil support, there so many requirement. I can't provide CS ID because I can't log in to the game anymore. Hope they can fix this. Best gameplay but sad account recovery system.",
        "Keep closing randomly on some missions on both my S8 and galaxy tab S2. Starting to get annoying.  Waste resources when it closes.  I uninstalled n install and that didn't solve the annoying problem. Waste resources anytime it force closes",
        "The game keeps kicking me out everytime i play. I cant play because the game crashes it takes me out of the game fix that and i will give it all stars it also gives me errors in the game itself for examples stamina error and free draw error I stopped playing the game because it kicks me out to much. This game crashes for android any android phone I don't understand.",
        "Server Issue!!!  Please fix your server! I'm really angry/pressured play your game! Especially event time. My connection it's really great! But why i'm always disconnected during play your game. The game is good, only the server. If you guys want people continue play your game. Do something about this. I hopefully, this problem fix as soon as possible!.",
        "A good game but can not download the latest patch after updating. I am a VIP and leader of a guild so this is troubling so until this issue is fixed the game gets just a star from me. The game has gotten worse tried to play after creating a new character and the game crashed on me, seriously gamevil you are slipping and it's a shame"

Edit- ok I'm in again, but I'm still mad, but relieved I didn't throw away my money. OTHER games send a apology message than an update is being performed or something. But as a game it is fun & strategic",
        "Would have given 4 stars if it didn't make you wait 4hrs on the pvp award or at least make the 4 he wait start when you first make the 1-5 match. Not wait 4 hrs after you complete 5-5. Look at how Clash Royale has their setup. Your already  trying to mimic their game. You should study their gameplay more and use it for improvements. Just saying. Make a change in that 4hr wait.",
        "Since the new update, major loading issues. Game just freezes on the title screen. I noticed that a lot of people have complained about the PVP battles not being fair, but they usually within reason. My main complaint is THE HACKERS WHO DRIVE ME TO THE POINT OF A MENTAL BREAKDOWN. This game has great potential, it just needs the major issues addressed.",
        "It's needed bug fixes for HTC One M8 since release. Current event RoboBebe stuck at applying configs. Matches work fine over my work hotel wifi but home wifi must reconnect after every match pvp or solo. 5* is my opinion regardless just 1* to try and catch devs attention",
        "Too many hackers since the beginning of the BFU!!! Too many are using a computer hack to play and cause energy speed ups. It causes the game to lag. Then I loose with an connection error or they just over power me with too many units on the field. Its ridiculous. I will change review when issues with them are fixed.   Now with one day to get to legendary tje game crashed...pathetic. Wish i could give a lower rating",
        "Would love to give 5 stars but I cannot even play. I downloaded, then went to play and got as far as the \"logging on\" page before the game said \"error no network connection\" when I clearly am connected.  EDIT : the issue has been resolved. Changed my rating to 5 stars as promised"

After this last update I lost slot. It started off awesome but once I started investing money in the game it's like it just took my money by taking the gifts and coins.  Such a waste of time and money when no corrections are made.  Trying to give the developer a chance to redeem themselves from this error.",
        "I like the idea of changing prices and finding new recipes. I want the barista to automatically start the machines if there isn't one already there. i want to be able to hire another barista. I want to put my menu on the other wall. I want smaller windows. There's basically a lot of things i feel limited on and i still haven't figured out if i can change the color on wallpaper or not.",

I used to play this game a lot and I've noticed the prices of everything have went up and including the spices. You no longer have the option to buy the cheaper furniture forcing you to spend more so customers come in to the Cafe. Very greedy and game makers. Sort these issues and give me the diamonds I'm owed or take away the ads.",

After certain update my game will start to reverse progress itself when one message pop out and state \"profile change, please restart\". Recently this problem occur very frequent and its so unbearable and irritating when what u done it just become undone, ALWAYS.  Im so fed up with this and quit for few days, wish developer can fix or lessen this issues or i will just uninstall it one day, thanks for reading.",

        "Not a bad game but it's typical like some other games. It starts off with the levels being super easy, letting you build your confidence to get you thinking you're really good.  Now I understand the higher the levels the more difficulty there is but not to the point where they make it almost impossible trying to get you to buy more chances. Another words they're trying to get you to pay to win and advance not necessarily on skill level. Very sneaky. Uninstalling. It's fun for a while but overall I do not recommend.",
        "Love this game, but it freezes up. I go to try and reinstall it after a few days but it won't let me reinstall the game. Just stays at the same  level last completed. Still having the problem of when having to reinstall I lose all my lives and charms. Love the game but hate ,owing all my lives and charms",
        "I love this game but damn, why does the videos seem to always freeze up. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a good game and all, so why don't you guys just fix the glitches. Thank you🤔",
        "The update took me from level 400 back to level 1 very upset be first I wasn't getting my daily play rewards so I figured like everything else it may need to update and the update blow my whole progress. I'm so pissed is there a way to fix this?",
        "I actually enjoyed the game and would give it four or five stars except 200 coins and multiple items were taking away simply because I got logged out if Facebook. Also several levels were lost.... This I understand, glitches happen. What I don't understand and don't accept is the lack of response from the developer. I've sent several emails and have yet to get a non automated response.",
        "I installed the game about 3 times and gave up. Can't connect with Facebook and when playing it suddenly stop and say it's not responding."

        "Absolutely sublime! This game is so awesome it's exactly what I want in a dragon game! Although there are microtransactions, you can absolutely play this game without spending a cent to progress! I have never ever payed real money to purchase gold, food and all other resources and I've played this game for almost two years The two tips are a little bit of patience and to keep on breeding. Even if you've already bred a certain pair of dragons, selling unwanted eggs is the best and quickest way to make gold",
        "Once you get to level 100, breeding a dragon is almost impossible to nil. Very frustrating. My roommate and I started this game the same time. I am level 115 and she is on 83. We will breed the same dragons at the same time, she will succeed 85% of the time on the first try, it will take me over 10 times if I even get it, this started after level 100. Good luck long term players.",
        "The events are annoying. I have reached the max on collecting eggs. I just gather then from doing tasks. Does that mean I can't participate anymore and am just stuck. I don't understand. Why would you limit the gathering of items?",
        "Have been playing this game for a couple of years now and I love it! Sometimes it's frustrating - especially when you'd need to buy something to be able to get all the prizes during events - but it just makes it more challenging.  VERY happy with the customer support. I had an issue with a gift not being added to my totals, so I emailed them and they fixed it without issue.",
        "The game is definitely addicting. But when I went into the Egg-straordinary Egg hunt island and tapped on a activty, it said their was a wonky spell and it completely stopped the whole game. I've tried different things different times, and it still won't work. I have played this in the past and the same exact thing happened, but with something different.",
        "This game is AWSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOme. I had 1023 gems saved up and then it glitched and now I only have 34. I love this game so much! Please help me get my 984 gems back! I don't want to rate it lower than 5 stars, but this has happened twice now...😟"

        "Awesome game.  Biggest downside I don't like is, unlike similar games, once the small packs are bought you are only offered the largest ($50/$100). I'd honestly like to see all packs back or at least if you're going to tier up buying options, at least offer a $25 as lowest.",
        "Once you loose the shield, you will get farmed by higher level players, forcing you to use whatever resources you have left over to repair. Once you finished repair, you not surprisingly get attacked again. This results you in being frustrated and uninstalling or you foolishly spend your hard earned cash for resources that you will soon enough loose from being attacked.",

        "Don't waste your time unless you are going to spend large amounts of money. Free to play players get attacked daily by credit card players and you dont get a chance to progress. Good idea for a game but sadly very imbalanced.",
        "Overall an excellent game IF you have an alliance to back you up.  Otherwise you are a sitting duck. I recommend this game anytime to anyone because you do a lot in half an hour.   Only option I request is warlords events diring the weekend.  Poly and Thor are critcal resources and there never seems to be enough unless you pay for it.",

        "Extremely addictive! First day I played I overshot my bus stop by 5 minutes because I forgot to look up.  There is always something to do in the game somewhere - and the micro transaction bit doesn't feel forced, and you can easily progress without it.  It kept me occupied for days - unfortunately I had to delete it because I got too caught up.  So if you're looking for a game to grab your attention and keep you entertained on long commutes and the like, this is great for that",
        "Fun little game, but I would love for food, and water, to be a little bit faster. Also maybe rise up the rush chances. I do have 1 suggestion, maybe when the people off to the Waste Lands, they can find some rare stuff, like gems or maybe clothes/weapons. This game is really fun, even though I've just started it, keep up the great work! 👍🏽",
        "I figured my old ass phone wouldnt run this game when first announced, just confirming for folks it sure doesnt. I thought there might be a chance it would cos my phone is rooted and I have full control over how my ram is utilized. Thank bob for android emulators on desktop, can't wait to play :)",
        "Look, I can kind of understand dwellers not dropping their assignments to fight raiders, but can we have the ability to assign fighters to the raiders themselves. It's a massive and unnecessary pain to constantly remind my few armed dwellers to actually fight the raiders instead of just looking cute in the room they just left. Weapons are scarce in this game, and raiders move too often to play pass the gun. It would also be nice if there was a pause feature, but that would reduce the butler-bot purchases.",
        "Fantastic! A resource management sim that is incredibly fresh and charming thanks to the richness of the Fallout franchise. Keeps you coming back for hours. From the quirkiness of the dwellers to the depth of the side quest system, this game is deserving of your time. Finally, the game is totally playable without paying. Still, throw the devs a few bucks! You'll sink hours into this title.",
        "Absolutely love this game. If you're a die hard fallout fan, or even someone new to the series this is the perfect game for you. You'll get a sense of nostalgia pulling your first legendary dweller, or a sigh of relief when you obtain that last part for the weapon you've been looking to craft. Fallout Shelter is the perfect mobile game for any fan of the series. The game is slow and hard in the beginning but when you get on your feet you'll never want to put it down. If you're on the edge about downloading it please do, it's worth all the time and space!"

I would rather play old Diablo 1 than this game, you have almost no control in game, everything is auto! Auto walk, auto battle, auto sell, auto quest, auto feed pet. The only thing that breaks auto-play is messaging other players and talking to npc. Just make the game a movie its more than halfway there.",
        "Good game. can't say ive experienced the problems other players have pointed out thus far. It is crowded with lots of players but you're free to roam at your own pace. Automation in an MMO is silly but I don't mind. I also was kind of expecting Dark Souls not WoW as the aesthetic and tone. I suppose my advise would be just add more classes, more stuff to do, and encourage actual interaction with environment and players. But not a bad game all in all",
        "Not good if you want to play this game, there's always people trying to kill you if you interact with players with red on their name. Im trying to level up my character and some random people keep killing my character, you can't have a personal space while you trying to level up, I'm warning you, don't be decieved by the flashy trailer they'll do any for your wallet"

        "Wasnt compatible with my tablet at first. Now it is. Thats awesome. Only problem is i got to a high level on my phone but i can't sign into google on my phone. But i can sign into google on my tablet. So cant access my progress from my phone on my tablet. Dont want to do it all over again and dont want to keep the app on my phone. So just gonna delete if it doesn't get fixed.",
        "Other than the glitches in the arena (ie; hulk freezing intermittently which freezes the match I'm in), I'm really enjoying this game! I would like to see players being able to get higher than level 50, but I'm sure that's coming.",
        "Game is looking really good so far the toon animations are awesome and the devs seem to be working hard to fix the bugs. There is a couple of problem in the guilds atm that really needs fixxed anyone can start the raids this results is people wasting points when the info says only officers and leaders can start raids (as it should be) also there is alot off guys guild hopping and farming guild raids with tag ons there needs to be a cooldown period added!!"

        "This game has been great to me forever, and I never had a complaint but this recent update has driven me here. The trophy cap is a real kick in the nuts and ruins the game for casual gamers like me. You now HAVE to advance through the games prestige system and keep resetting all your work just to help out a gang. And if you are in a strict gang like I am, they require 100 trophies a day. If I keep advancing, I won't be able to keep up with that. This is all a money grab by zepto now. They want you to have to pay to keep your machines strong so you can compete.",
        "I love this game. I have been playing it for a very long time. I play it every single day. I like the new updates however it seems you are getting away from the original game and focusing more on ultimate machines. Increasing the prestige levels was awesome but you need to also add additional upgrades with them as well. I have over 100 paw upgrades that are completely useless to me at the moment.",
        "Look this was a great game, worthy of it's previous accolades. Sadly since then it's been progressively ruined by an ever more aggressively enforced attempt to move to a pay to win model. Previously you could achieve anything in the game with a bit of hard work, then they tweaked it and you could achieve anything with a bit of hard work and team work. Sadly though what's happened is soft paywalls have been introduced, things you can't outright buy, but will only manage with financial outlay and change after change is being introduced with new soft paywalls and new ways to try and cash grab. The game is on a steady but rapid downward decline and to any new players I would avoid picking it up and investing your time in it now.",
        "Great game, easy to play and a good time waster. One thing I would like to see in a future update  is a scroll bar for the parts in your garage. It would make it a lot easier than swiping through them, especially for those who have a lot of spare parts like myself. Other than that, awesome game.",
        "This game sucks. First it is really hard to get good equipment. Then it is also very laggy. Everytime im playing the game it freezes right when im doing something. (Mainly when im customizing my car). Think about it when you are getting ths game to take up storage. If you'll excuse me now I've got a game to delete.",
        "I had a bad day but this game fixed it,... Well enough. I've bin looking for a good game to play for a couple months now but until, like 2 days ago nothing had shown its self to me or caught my interest! This game is 11/10 to me! For probably about the next two month!"

        "Like ot a lot. Taskforces need to be improved drasticly. Focus on playing with others makes it a lot more fun. EDIT: still no real task force improvements, why it doesn't open straight onto you TF or why I have to go through several buttons to see people starts is stupid. sorting this out make my review 5*",
        "This is not another Clash of Clans clone, but definitely pushes the boundaries of the clan genre. Good graphics, fun gameplay, and balanced in terms of units vs. defences for your island. While diamonds can be purchased by real-world money, the game doesn't trap you into needing them. The weekly mini-game missions help keep things fresh and assist in moving your base up the tech tree if you're patient. SuperCell is continually expanding the game to keep it interesting. Definitely worth a download!",
        "Very addictive and always checking on my base, upgrades etc. Strategic game play, however too much pressure to buy diamonds as it takes FOREVER! !! for some things to upgrade. Seriously. ..2 days for an upgrade??? Only other issue is the limited time \"special abilities\"...they're fun but it makes it far too easy for someone to raid your base and take all resources needed to get the upgrades. Lots of fun and love the graphics",
        "The graphics are amazing for this type of game. And I think that's why so many people love it. The only thing I wish that their could be is offline play. Just block the chats and player raids and only allow campaign attacks and their would be many more players able to play... Bcs sometimes I don't have data or wifi where I am and it's a pain bcs I love Supercell games. And ik why there isn't offline play, bcs the other players that attack you. But their must be some way around that like maybe a whole offline mode. Well if u read this ty and it's a great game keep up the amazing work you do providing us with amazing games...  ~Bladez",
        "I have played this game since it has come out and I have seen all of the changes and they have shaped that game for better over the years the game has been out it has improved and is one of my best games I have ever played. But the down side is that it is really hard to get resources at first but then before you know it you are full and you have nothing to do about it. Also when getting the heros they should make that base a bit easier because the lower level people can't attack till the have a lot better troops.",
        "Great game, but too slow. While I love the lack of pay to win, I'd wish for a way to speed up resource gathering: I've cleared out every similar level player in my area, and spend days waiting for RSS to build up so I can upgrade. Which is necessary before I can access a larger zone. No point buying speedup gems, as I've never anything to use them on!"

        "Great game, but the high level  goals take too long to achieve. (in Alaska and  Mexico there are 3 level requiring 850 tokens each, and the puzzles are shorter, thus earning less $$ to reach $7-$800,000 to level up. this is frustrating! It can take over a week to reach these marks. perhaps you guys can add a feature to buy boxes.",

I loved this game. Now not at all we hold our end of the contact why are you allowed to break the agreement. Its now 2016 an I still no help",

I will update my review with 5 stars when the game us updated again to the way it was.",

They sent me an email today for me to uninstall the game and reinstall it and that they said should fix the issues. Well it started my game back at the beginning and the is no way for me to retrieve my last games progress which was pretty far along. This use to be one of my favorite games but on Android it still is fun but to many bugs and like I said CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS"

        "More and more focus on pay to win and the 4th weapon, the distance weapon makes it too complex and disturbing. In particular the boomerangs because there are almost no chances to avoid a hit. In unequal battles the inferior just got an extra disadvantage --&gt; no David vs goliath anymore possible. It sucks",
        "At first look it didn't mesmerise me, but after 2-3 matches I feel in love with it! It is awesome and has tons of weapons and other stuffs. The multiplayer option is also great and chest opening is such a treat. One worry is that the weapon below the primary weapon is still locked (why I don't know), otherwise the game is superb. Graphics are top notch and fighting doesn't come more realistic than that!",
        "I have been playing SF3 for quite a long time til now and I just got a problem with one side mission. It was the \"Head hit only\" with an Accused. I play as the judge and all. However, when I hit him like a combos of headhits, it didnt hurt him at all. It is like he became invincible. Anyway, I love everything of SF3. The storyline, gameplay, graphic and so on, they are all great. And I hope you would fix that one single problem of mine along with others who have the problem of crashing as I had read the comments. That is all for me. Keep up the good work, Nekki.",
        "Good overall, although I have some gripes about the stunlocking when you're ragdolled on the ground and you can't recover. Also, at the fight with Xiang Tzu in the tournament, after I win the game blurs to blue as it is supposed to, but just stay there and doesn't show my rewards. When I restart the app the game then resets me to before I fought Xiang Tzu.",
        "I have been playing this game for past few months and i just love the game. Its so addictive but today when i updated it, it has become a nuisance. Every time i defeat a opponent in a mission the game halts after \"you win\". I tried this with other missions as well but things didn't work. Please fix this bug.",
        "Great game until Chapter 4 update showed up. Purchased a pack of cards, and the game is stuck in a loop where the cards will show up first then the package opening next, and it stops from there. Restarting the game does not resolve the issue. I'm stuck in a loop."

        "Much looser than big fish casino though the same devs. I love it so far but would like gold and tickets too in this one as well. Update:that was beginners luck. Now tight as the other casino.  Update: super tight with wins.  Haven't been able to keep 1mil in a long time. Update: seriously!?  Loosen up some. I need a jackpot!!",
        "One of the better slots app out there. I have had many and most the time they are uninstalled as fast as they are installed. Still trying to figure out a couple of things like the high five blue hand and the crowns...how do you earn them?   Otherwise I love it easy to play and the rewards are really good too!!! Thanks Big Fish❣❣ Still enjoying the game",
        "I gave it a 3 because the minimum bet is still a little high and you can't play if you don't have enough. If he got his lower the minimum bats then I'll give it a 5. I am having fun playing the game though just want to put that out there",
        "It's impossible to get bored with this app. It has a wide variety of the most creative, fun games with HUGE payouts and bonuses!! And no interruptions with ads. It's addictive, in a good way. You'll never want to play any other app. This is the BEST one out there! I 💜 it!!! So will you!",
        "Well done BF this is another great slots app!! I only give you 4 🌟s because of the glitches. For example; I haven't been able to play the new Leprechaun game sine the last update and I'm not signed in through Facebook so if I uninstall the app then reinstall it I'll lose everything. Also I have great 100 Mbps WiFi but still get bumped out room, especially if I'm on a winning streak. Fix my Leprechaun game and give you 5⭐s across the board!!",
        "You don't have to make purchases to win big!, NO ADs, bonus coins often, BIG Jackpots. Awesome games and graphics. Group, friend and private play.  Contact a real Agent in usually less than 24hrs by email. They may actually set up a phone call if needed. Just give them a try...it's free, free, free."

Update few days later...   Suddenly the game keeps crashing randomly...   Tried it for days....   Can hardly survive a single level now...    Very sad....   The game itself is still excellent....   Maybe a later update brings a fix..................",

        "Fun game, my daughter enjoys playing. ..easy, yet challenging at the same time.  One irritating issue...every time there's an update, or just opening the app, turns on the game's notifications..and have to turn it off constantly. ..otherwise it would be a rare 5 star rating from me.",

        "After the latest update, I've only gotten one set of daily quests which populated right after the update. After that, I haven't received any additional daily quest where I can win some gems. Why is that? Now the only way for me to earn more gems os through the free gems  (by watching adds), getting a high enough ranking in battlez, or buying them.",
        "I think the new update is nice battlez is awesome and the good news is that my phone doesnt crashes anymore and when I played Inzanity it did'nt lag great rework but 1 question, WHY DID YOU REMOVE ULTIMATE BATTLE AND DEMONSTRATION MINI GAME THEMES TO EVERY WORLD?? Im sick of every level with just only themes",
        "I think the new update is very cool. It adds some multiplayer into the game. When I heard of this new update I rushed to my phone and started playing. It turned out to be good I was happy and thought it would turn out well. Then after that I remembered pvz one. It's multiplayer mode was much better. One player would be plants and the other zombies. Why could they not have made that. It was such a good idea. I would personally play that mode more than this. But it's just my opinion. Thanks for reading.",
        "Since last update it is very unstable and keeps crashing. Also every time i finish the last inzanity it crashes then once reloaded says expired so ive lost out. In fact im not that interested anymore. Im not a fan of battlez and it all seems geared to that now so had fun while it lasted.",
        "I HATE YOUR UPDATE. Battlez mixed battle between players who bought plants with money with the players who don't is totally unfair. There are many players out there like me who play everyday collecting coins by coins and gems by gems patiently waiting for a good plant offer that we can buy with gems. Buying plants with money is not on the budget. I'm not angry. I'm sad. Because PVZ is always one of my top listed games. Now it's pathetic. Crashed. Unfair. Expensive.",
        "Just like.But EA just want money right? You just wasting money.Money cause something bad.This wirld need to follow the truth path.Not money path.I dont like those plant,pinatas and more that need to buy with money.Useless."

Everything is OVER PRICED. Even to just furnish your home. I hope kim and Glu reconsider this as not everyone has money to splash on what you need to progress more quickly.",
        "I've spent probably thousands on this game because I liked it, but I'm having serious problems. Back on March 13Th I bought yet another hundred dollar kstar pack that did not go through. I was able to confirm the order and they \"added it to my account\". The problem is I still haven't gotten it. And I've sent screenshots showing I have not gotten it. I've purchased several other packs of various prices and I've received them all, but I've still, to this day, not received the hundred dollar one. I keep getting bounced around and told \"just do a hard reset\" which I've already done several times as well as turning off my phone and everything. That doesn't explain why I've gotten the other purchases but not this one. On top of that, the \"help\" I've been getting has been taking longer and longer to even respond, each time though I'm getting the same unhelpful answers.  If it was five dollars I would have just forgotten it, but I'm being screwed out of 100 dollars with no answers. I'm extremely disappointed.  Buyers beware.",
        "Pretty cool game. I did buy the small star pack and it never showed up. Kinda lame. If someone could look into it that'd be great. I would just like to receive the stars. Not a refund. Please and thank you",
        "So...I'm thinking Kim kardashian again puts her name on something that would flop...but this is surprisingly a great game. I'm addicted to trying to level up etc. Worth a download.   Update- game won't start.  I'm losing progress in the game. Hope this gets fixed soon"

Doesnt bother you to Buy Currency. It made me wanna buy a small portion strictly out of appreciation. Mad Respect. If your reading this, download this right now, you WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!

Still love the game, easy to strengthen Pokemon as you battle and keeping it interesting with every update.  But that's only if it works",
        "Edit: the app has been getting worse and worse. There are a ton of problems with matchmaking, and pay to win is the way now. They refuse to fix the major problems in this game. Plus they just added a new terms of service that states they aren't responsible for those problems with the game. One of those things could result in you losing all the progress on your account or the account completely.",
        "Every time I play I hate it more and more. The only reason I still play is because I made the rookie mistake of paying for stuff in the game. Matches are rigged, whether intentional or not. My Pokemon have a Miss space of 1 and somehow hit it EVERY SINGLE TIME?!?!?!?! I don't think so homie. Spinner is rigged so don't play if you actually want to be the very best there ever was because the computer will not let you. Game is full of bots that just so happen to have the perfect team to beat you once you start doing well"

        "I use to love! this game, it was the one game that did not cheat you out of your coins now the game is red it doesn't stop when you wanted to stop some lines stick together in the game or if you push the game to stop it continues to roll that's cheating that's literally cheating people out of their money now the game sucks I would never buy coins to play this game again. I will only play with the coins this game allow me thank you",
        "I have been enjoying all the different things that are going on while I'm in play. I like that I'm playing for more than just credits!  I'm not just sticking around The same.number of credits...I don't like a lot of the gaming apps out there....they bore me quickly! I keep catching myself saying, \"ok... Just a couple more spins and I'll close it up and get something  done today....\"  Then I'll level up to unlock a new game... And who just closes the app -&gt;before at least checking it out first, Right? (kinda like hitting a baseball out of the park and walking over to the concession stands to buy some nachos before running the bases in Victory!) graphics are clear! Bonuses are fun! Good Job on putting together A Fantastic Gaming App!",
        "I just began playing Pharaoh's way tonight, I love everything about it except the two times it tried to show me some special things that are going on in the game, it freezes up and won't let me play until I completely shut it down and reboot the app. I hope you can resolve this problem! If you can, it'll be a next to perfect gaming app!",
        "Its coo!! Luv luv it! Arent we bout due 4 a new slot by y'all?!! And btw, them dayz y'all unlock all the slots 4 us 2 play, literally blow my mind! Keeps me playin waitin 4 the next day...its frequent & that is totally dream!!!! Thank U!!!! ✌️👍❣️"

        "It's a fun twist on the match-3 concept and a nice shift from the original Farm Heroes.  I wish you could earn gold bars instead of only being able to buy them.  Why not through the Country Show?  I'd rather earn gold bars than the unusable and irrelevant  coins and trophies.",

        "The good:  Better than WB1 where the same words kept showing up throughout even at difficult levels.  It's also nice that it shows your previous progress in a puzzle after you're forced to clear/restart it.  And although you'll still see lots of words that aren't part of the answer, the puzzles are themed so you can ignore those non-answers.  The bad:  The ads are very loud and you can't always silence them before they play.  It does not remember your sound choice so don't even think about playing this in the library.  Also, the game now has a ridiculous background that obfuscates the answer boxes making the game almost unplayable.  Finally, there are way too many boringly easy puzzles that you have to go through before you get to see the fun ones.  I almost uninstalled before getting there.",

        "This is the best of its kind for mobile, and one of the best overall. The graphics and UI are nice and stylish, the controls are great, the gameplay is solid and it's generally just very fun to play. However, the game has some optimization issues. When you minimize it, it disconnects, and if you wait long enough it shuts down the entire game. I get that it was made like this to reduce background data, but come on, not everybody stays in the game all the time. It also takes longer than most games to connect. These are minor issues, but it would be great to see them fixed.",
        "This game works good but the reason I gave it 2 stars is whenever I click on ranked games it shows leaver penalty and the time to wait is shown 00:00:00:00. After waiting for so many days,it is always showing like this and not allowing me to play ranked games.Hope you would look into this.",
        "developer, i used to keep on playing cuz its very very fun but idk why recently when i click on connect via google play it shows connecting after that nth changes. i DONT want the ops acc i WANT my usual account back. the name of my usual account is   -FiReRY-  and the clan name is DeNY. pls pls pls pls pls help me get that account of mine back. i worked v hard for it n i have almost all the skins n i seriously like all of them v much. Many thanks.",
        "This is the best First Person Shooter available on Android. The only game that's not pay-to-win. Ok I give you that this game is great, but damned login issues are the reason for 3 stars. I just can't LOGIN with google play. It's like the game decides when I can login and play coz sometimes I am able to login. REST OF THE TIME IT SAYS PLAYING AS GUEST. FU!CKING FIX THIS LOGIN ISSUE!!!!"

I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.",
        "I am not able to play with my friends in custom mode. We are a group of 11 & we want to play together in custom mode by creating our own room. But My 4 friends have IOS devices & their Servers are showing different than us. I don't know why? We can't even connect by number also. Tried doing that!. Please let me know its fixture",
        "It's a fun game. If you're a COD player you'll love it. In general It does good on it's own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It's good that there's a grind to get them but I think it's a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.",
        "I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to \"rent\" which is an option in the game.",
        "this game is great, but i rated 3 star cuz i wanted this gaem to be like COD: WWII, and like ravenfield. There are NO MG nests, no war modes like COD:WWII, and please, fix the prices! It took me 3 years of full gameplay, 5 hours just to get a shotgun. And please optimize the guns. Overall, really great game!                                  By a youtuber                            Zombiehunter78oo  P.S. Please add more guns and some more features.",

Play something else and yea a FREAKING TANK IN A MAP THIS SMALL. like were you under the influence of some substances when you made this game. Wast of time. Dont download this abomination."

        "I love this game. I only had one issue , and it was a small one. The fixed it in 24 hours an compensated me extra. I'm happy I wrote this after having the game for a few weeks. I truly can give this 5 stars cause I played it for weeks and have come across the different scenarios in the game. Thank you for your awesome customer service and great game!!!!",
        "Great. But some of the bonus games for golf bucks are not winnable.  For example, long drive gets a longer required result each time you beat it.  I'm currently required to beat 415 yards which I am sure is impossible.  So why bother trying?",
        "Got too allgegro madness. And got stuck with the no face cards. 14 cards is alot to get. In fairway blast the card suits stick until a new none face card comes up, or reshuffles them. I find with this game they dont stick when the next card is turned over. So your run ends. And the run cards you ave accumulated as returned back to one agan.",
        "I have played and enjoyed this game just about every day for a year or more now.  For some reason and somehow, they've sucked the fun out of the game.  It used to be about playing and earning \"golf bucks\" to use for things like re- filling your golf bag with irons, etc.  However now, it's very difficult to \"earn\" those golf bucks, in fact, it's even harder to play the game.  Now you can go through a complete hole without having any cards that you can actually play.  Now it seems that all the game is about is paying for irons, etc., and/or watching advertising videos to obtain clubs.  Like I said, I really used to enjoy this game but now?  I think it's time to uninstall it and move on to something that is actually fun, not frustrating.  I'd rate this game as \"0\" now, if it were possible!!!",
        "It's a fun game!! can keep you very entertained only thing that sucks is if you have it on PC or iOS there are way more features and it's way better than the Android version!!😢 So the side note is for the developers at Big Fish Games....... So I think we've all waited way too long it's time to step it up and come out with a greater Android version at least make it as good as the iOS version!!!!!?????",
        "People will tell you that it's good for your brain or that it's fun, but that really isn't true, especially since it won't even allow you to turn off hints. Immediately after you make a move, you can't even think for yourself and try it alone. It's annoying. Don't get it. Go to a different solitary game."

        "I really liked this game when it had only 20 seasons & I uninstalled it after finishing. I again installed it and started from the beginning and after completing 573 games & 1487 stars I am giving you just 2star rating because game lag all the time sometimes the ads got struck or maybe during rewind I lose my $1 but the game didn't rewind back instead crash and auto shutdown and I ahve to start the application again. Before adding 30th season please update your games stability it will be more useful.",
        "Surprised at how good this game is... very clever concept and I'm only half an hour into it and I'm already hooked! Recommend it to anyone who's a fan of football, well in fact, anyone who's a fan of gaming in general... well worth checking out, chuffed I came across it. 5***** for all features from me. The developers really did a fine job. Get it now is my advice! Peace out people :)",
        "Would like more customisation options for my character. This game keeps crashing for no reason and doesn't like to reward it's loyal users. It is a fun game if they just let you play it. Fun game, but the gold farming and inattentiveness to what the users want will ruin it. Great game, lots of potential if taken in the right direction, but WAY to glitchy.",
        "Like most other games, there is too much effort to bait you into micro transactions. The older games were so much better. It's a shame the Devs have resorted to such money grabbing standards.",
        "Kinda annoying game. Teammates won't go after the ball and watching ads sometimes doesn't let you try again.                 Season 3 level 76 is impossible I pass to my guy and he doesn't bother to move a finger.",
        "I like the tactic aspect of it, pretty good time waster. Took me a while to beat it, but didn't have to spend a dollar to do it. The story itself is very unrealistic and after 15 seasons I completely stopped following it and focused only on the games."

        "Amazing idle game best I've found great balance with coins and earning gems without \"pay to play for the gems\", a couple suggestions are to make perfect clone scrolls more available in the store and add a page to the store one to buy stuff with gems and one with coins, maybe adjust the casino a little so it doesn't land on the same items everytime, add some more characters like movie stars and music artists such as Slash, Toby Keith, Little Wayne, Gene Simmons, Ozzy, ect. Only issue i have with the game is trouble connecting to google play games and a force closing issue that hopefully gets fixed soon.",
        "Things in this game constantly change every week something else gets nerfed or taken away. Constant server problems where you can't log in for hours and when you can log in the game constantly hangs up and freezes with lag. Also for those that buy iap beware cause they also make changes to their game to be able to squeeze you for more and more money.  This company is a greedy leech. I Have made many attempts to contact your company and you refuse to reply.  Your company are money hungry scammers. I demand a valid working number and address to your company so I can get your company CEO on the phone",
        "I have purchased an item but got an invalid recipient error. But the money was charged to my account.  Have emailed them and try to communicate to them through the feedback button, but gotten no reply from the team.  Not worth the money and time.",
        "Great use of famous people, especially \"Social Pres\"... he looks like an idiot in real life, and you guys have certainly captured that quality. Good difficulty in the various modes of play, looking forward to more. Keep up the good work.",
        "pay 2 win at it's best. stay away from this. it's not that this game asks for money but the amount they ask for it's absolutely stunning. 10$ for 1000 diamonds and u buy a scroll for 1200 and u get a stupid blue hero. a blue. for 1200 diamonds. lol.",
        "Great game to spend hours playing. I love the character's, and the gameplay. Yes, you may need to spend a few dollars to advance far in The game, but it's so worth it. Only thing I dislike is having to wait on timed missions. Only thing I'd add is when you spin the wheel at the casino,  wish there were better outcome odds. Tired of always getting gold."

Also show subtracting from troop count how much food is getting finally stored. Total atk figure of all ships & troops before going to fight.... Etc... There are many ways to improve... R u interested to make such changes?",
        "Srill no fix for balance. Game has a lot of potential but until there is better balance it will continue to suck. Every update just introduces more was to pay. Perhaps if the devs did something about the balance issues more people would buy in. Until this is done the game will end up as a sinking ship.",
        "Lags upon opening, then freezes with a white screen when I touch anywhere. Yes I have a stable internet connection and Yes I have tried clearing the cache prior to loading the game.",
        "Great game or should say WAS a great game. Been playing this for over a year now but developers just not getting the bugs fixed. Lag and more lag, mail and report system still not fixed. It was a 5 star game. Pitty I spent money on the game.😒",
        "Unfortunately, if you don't spend money, this game is a waste of time. AND building at the higher levels takes months to build!!!",
        "If you don't read and learn from customers. .....you will loose them. This is a phone game. Not a 1 tb computer game..why so many updates that slow game play down?"

(ps. i know, i know, if it aint broke... but I would love to be able to rotate buildings and decorations!)",

And you can play for a long time with what it PROVIDES---NOT HAVING TO PURCHASE ANYTHING-this is one of the better matching story/games I have discovered",
        "It's a fun game. I really like it. The thing that is really buggin me though, is the grid system on which you design the village. You can't change the orientation of anything (rotate), can't place things the way you want to... But it's still very fun, cute and great gameplay too.",

That is a business model that questions any real money I would put into it. Don't bait freemium users into wasted effort. Good thing I realize this before I spent any real money here.",

Not sure why that happen. Also don't like how you have a truck and the grass and or sand will slow you down. Also wish there were more color options for your vehicles. Other than that its a fun and addicting game.",

Not cool at all. Once or twice is whatever, but its happened at least a dozen times. Please fix this!!  Just dropped my rating again because its getting worse! Idk if its people cheating or what but this is ruining the game! The race rankings are a complete lottery, doesn't matter what place you come in because its gonna change... For the worse. Had it with this.",
        "Well it's ok but you are always underpowered I literally but the next 2!! Cars and I couldn't even get in 2nd place it's ridiculous I mean come on and I wasn't even up against real people it was bots. And the ramps using nitro on them is a deathtrap and the driving is Soo weird.",

I feel guilty about favouring more dragons above the other and would prefer to just release them into the wild instead of keeping them in the stall just to do tasks. Love the game! Jut would like this one change, keep it up! :)",

Why? Please help! I had a membership active as well!",
        "I loved the game at first. But then I bought the 7 day trail of a membership. 10 minutes later It said I had no membership. And I never got tothless!! Plese fix this. I worked really hard for it. Besides that this is a really good game. Just wished that would have worked.",
        "note of how long it takes to download this game, now remember that it will take twice as long to load this game every time. And in my experience the first time I tried to play this game it failed to connect to the server after making me wait an absurdly long time. Uninstalled immediately",
        "Too hard to play without spending real world money. They try to trick you into it a every damned turn. Graphics are better on an iPad than the Samsung Galaxy I'm trying it on this time. If you try to play during prime time on the weekend (yes, even out of MMO mode) it is almost impossible to get into the game. When you do, it crashes within two minutes.  I'm still trying to give it a chance, since I love the HTTYD world and characters.",

        "The developers do not contact you with game issues in any timely manner, you spend months playing for the game to randomly unshield your base before the time has even expired causeing losses when there shouldnt be any. And support like i said is terrible do not waste your time or money downloading this! You will only be disappointed in the end.",
        "After playing for 10 months straight every day, still come back, even though everything is done very slow by that advanced level of the base, therefore it's addictive. A sci-fi setting in a familiar and loved universe helps, of course.  Just need to be able to send to other players various items, boosts, and shields, not only resources, that would make it much more interesting at this point!",
        "I would rate the game higher but it needs major work. The wait times for smaller troop tiers and beginning research is horrible. Makes the game boring.  I am waiting to see if I continue to play it. Depends if anything changes. To research for tier 2 infantry takes over a day. At this current time this is a very pay to play game as you would want speedups. This is odd for Plarium. I enjoy their other games. This one needs vast improvement and fast if they want to keep people around. As well the game is in desperate need of an in game translator!!!",
        "I really love this game. Easy controls. Yes, it takes a little longer to upgrade various parts of the base as you level up. I encountered the first war. WOW!But, One thing, please tell to upgrade this Draedulus-12 leader. He is at level 23, 3%. He still look the same. OVERALL-AWESOME.!!!",
        "I loved this game initially but one massive problem I have experience is the chat box within your leagues forum. It is massively glitched and when you type or try to delete one word then ten new ones randomly come on screen. This makes chatting to your team mates almost impossible. I asked plarium many times to fix this but they keep ignoring. You want a game where you can chat with ease with your team mates",
        "I m playing this game for long time and i liked this game but now this game asking too much .So many back to back events .I think the game maker must know that all playing this game have a real life to deal with.Reduce back to back events.I m sure if u guys dont do it most players will quit and this game will be longer played."

        "Great game, me and the family enjoy it immensely and we have all made our contribution, thank you. The controls in card battles on the phone are too fiddly, considering there is a lot of unused space on the screen: this would have been developed differently if it wasn't attempting to mimic the desktop version. Lazy! Is the \".. playing over WiFi...\" warning still relevant? Unlimited mobile data and 4g means many of us have as good a connection as fixed line. Love the game, thank you.",
        "This is an awesome game I play it be very day and I had two games I would always play now I don't even play them at all because this game is so awesome and I kinda play it to much.  But I did get my last account deleted for some reason I was mad and couldn't get it back so I had to create a new one",
        "Everytime I play a club arena game (free every 24hours) it will keep telling me i disconnected from the game while my Internet connection is fine. But when I play other normal arena games, it turns out fine. I find it very annoying because i have to wait 24 hours to play my favourite club games and it always disconnects, and it makes me mad. I hope you notice this comment and leave a reply... Please fix this... Thanks :(  Edit: It works fine now, thank you! :)",
        "Very fun game, my most played game by far but the major issue in this game is hackers. You get good and start to play the end gamers and realize 90% of them are bots with millions of coins and as soon as the game starts you are sent balloons to your side that cannot be activated until round 15+! It's frustrating to earn my coins legit just to have them taken by all the hackers and bots. Ruins the game when makers aren't doing anything about it.",

I had been playing this game for almost 4-5 years already.  With my issues being resolved I would say I love this game so much.  Much recommended.  😘",
        "I have waited 30min to see the gameplay after started the game. Very confusing.Bla bla, shiny things all arround, see this, take those, listen to the story and chose your 120lvl character. What is the point for new players to start from 120 lvl? How this can be fun?But never mind, I never understood the games which do that. Sorry, but I didnt find this game interesting for me.",
        "Wow, what do I think? I think this game is all hype took 4hrs plus change to download the game after installing it so to even play it was a joke, then when I finally was able, it froze on the log in screen and took me back out to my home page on my phone screen, only to then tell me the game had not been installed!!! Yeah clearly it is as it's taken up space! Not very good I'm not happy, I will try again before uninstalling this game if I manage to get in the game, obviously the review will change get but until then it's 1 star ass I can not go any lower. Sorry game makers!",
        "I wonder if there will be transcended busters in the future. Or perhaps the current arch buster will be the 'warrior' type and there will 1 of each type for us to mount. Looking forward to the overlord release though!",
        "Love the game been playing for over 2 1/2 years. Only one probably lately and that is my WB scores have been down substantially along with other users. I dont understand how going from a few archs' to having 6 and new gear makes my score down 14 trillion? Im bot the only one this is happening to so im a bit confused on what the problem is. Other than that great game play it everyday. Just dont like losing rewards on my wb% when it should be higher.",
        "After massive update and huge changes, I have to change my rating from 2 to 5.Such a big improvement toward all player,either f2p or whales.Congrats Gamevil, hopefully the community will grow as we see now in this game itself."

I'm aware you're trying to do your own thing as far as mobas go but I'd appreciate it if you'd consider adding a way to set up your own build before entering que. Many mobas do the same and I enjoy putting my own spin on builds without having to sit in the shop menu in game for 30+ seconds attempting to adjust everything from the standard builds.  Just a thought.  Thanks for this amazing game. =)",
        "The game is pretty good and the 5vs5 was the update I have been waiting for. Very easy to play nice graphics and controls are easy as well. But since the update 3.1 I have been getting bad pings but my internet is pretty good above 5 mbps constant an bing are well below 50. So have been getting thumbs down for rude pings. Kindly check i have been playing this gane for almost 2 years now. I dont want to remove the games.",
        "I've playing vg since its been 2 years before 5v5 update. After the updates i was start matching up time was taking pretty long and when it start to play the screen doesn't show up, after that it return to vg homescreen. Vanglory is one of my favourite game in these years and i don't want to take it off from my device. Try to fix the issue pls.thx",
        "Couldn't get free rewards for halycon, I clicked on them and it did nothing. I also had a rare mystery chest key and When I clicked to use it, it did nothing, not even get rid of the key. I had to reinstall and it still didn't work, please, help. I also never got that free chest for creating a profile. Very much appreciated if you help. I also don't know how to claim my five free heroes and one skin .-. And it shows I have no wins, which I do, but please, this really needs to be fixed!! I'm sure it's not just me who is having this problem. I also can't open my EPIC mystery chest, even though I have a key. Fix this.",
        "Nice gameplay, very good looking graphic for a MOBA game, on phone obviously. Very nice and comfortable controls. Impressive multiplayer and, fighting system. But The only problem i found is sometimes i still disconnecting from games due to low internet connection, but i got a solid 10MBps speed. I hope Super Evil MC quickly fixes this up. Really irritating when im fighting with enemy hero and you just \"pop\" disconnected. The others features are just fine.",
        "50 mbps connection with 47 pings tested during gameplay. Every time i start vainglory 5v5, works well. 10 mins in the ping goes to 30000 ms. I close the game and go to speedtest to check if my network works fine. ITS BEEN WORKING GREAT THE WHOLE TIME. i get back on the game and the ping is still 30000 ms till it goes back to normal after 5 mins. 5 MINS LOST. and after the game is over? DESERTER! do not push updates when your servers cant handle it. Its been happening to many players but they keep on thinking its their nets fault. Smh..."

        "This is probably the best horse game I have found so far. The porportions and the way the horses move are very accurate. A lot of horses in games I have seen have disporortionate bodies and are, over all, very unattractive.  The art style is similar to Spirit. Which was a big head-turner for me.",
        "Can't log back in to my old account which I spent money on. Can't get the game to log back into my Facebook and I'm on the same Google account. The game crashes. All the time. When are the problems going to be fixed. This is worse then my beta tester games. Very unhappy also don't expect Ubisoft to help u",
        "I'm playing this game for almost two years, and never get bored. I uninstalled a lot of game's on this time except Horse Haven: World Adventures. At this moment I think we need a Grand Stable for fantasy land, and another land for exclusive horse's, they are so much now on the game. Thank you Ubisoft for this awesome game. ❤️",
        "I would definitely recommend this game to horse lovers. However, it doesn't satisfy me and the quite some Dutch players since it has our neighbouring countries Germany and France but not our own. It feels as if our country is just being neglected. It would be great if someone could do something about this issue.",
        "So i have a problem with the app.......... After we race we should get the pieces to unlock the horses  the amount depends on the which place u get cuz im mostly at my mums but i only have a ipad at my grans (its hers) kind regards Me and my family 😄😁🤗😂😉💙💙💙💙💙🐎🐎🐎 So... i try to activate the horse breeds for 10 diamonds i have 15.. It says i dont have enough FIX IT NOW 😠",
        "It's a great game, I love that I get to interact with the horses and the graphics is good then only down fall is I can't earn money that much and you run out of it quick, and you can't make enough for crops or upgrading, since you have to upgrade alot to get food for the horses."

        "Fun game, I gave them some money for one of their packs. However, slightly noisy main menu with attention getting side bar is annoying.  Convoluted setup and equipment menu is a deterrent, and the fact that equipment you buy isn't permanent is terrible, thus the minus one star.",
        "Since the update was installed its harder to just play than do the rubick's cube... i  also was charged 50 bucks but can't buy a thing! Greedy wgt",
        "Since last update I can't hit a ball to save my life, what's happened?  Some of the views are misleading so you are unable to aim your shots properly.  Also there is a degree of inconsistency with shot making so room for improvement.   Takes forever to get enough credits to improve clubs unless you spend money..  most of the offers to get credits either don't work or if taking surveys you won't be accepted.",

        "The game is good. Awesome idea for a time killer app. Please add press brakes, laser cutting, turret punch, deburr operations. This would make the game sooo much better. It would make it more appealing to a wider range of players.",
        "Игра отличная. Только утомляет выбирать станки по одному и тыкать в апгрейды. Можно ли сделать меню «усовершенствовать станок/станки по максимуму» одной кнопкой при наличии достаточных средств и монет? И ещё, можно добавить функционал типа своего НИИ, КБ, которые разрабатывают новые технологии, станки, материалы? Добавить службу безопасности, которая будет бороться с промышленным шпионажем, саботажем и воровством на производстве?  Благодарю за ваш труд.",
        "It's definitely pretty darn good game and it makes me happy to know that I can run a factory better than my senile old boss at my current job",
        "Well done",
        "Great game, great idea. But, when you have even 2 workshops, notification for broken machines are really annoying. Every few minutes a long vibrate which I cant turn off... What is a difference if I buy better worker or he evolve? Maybe to include waiting for raw material after order? Include different sizes of workshops? I have some other ideas as well",
        "This game is really well done. The tutorial teaches you everything you need to know. Its an amazing game and its very fun for killing time. As a machinist my self I like the aspects it puts into play. So good job to the developers its a great game."

And then there is that glitch that happens a lot of times when you try to start a race and it uses your fuel but never starts, and that happens consistently. Please consider fixing the problems.",

I then pressed to race button again and again and nothing happened other than me losing all of my energy. I don't know why this happened but I'd like compensation, thank you.",

        "Most missions are 1 to 8 hours long leaving you bored and playing other games. Want to do ANYTHING, it'll take real money but gives you nothing in return. Now events keep expanding and back to back. Only way to advance is money. Went from pay to play to cash cow. They have terrible customer service and just ignore emails and they rigged the game so some missions you have to buy things with real money. And they actually punish good players and there is zero recourse.",
        "It is an entertaining game. The latest update won't let me play the game. It states there's an error with the map and to reload again. 24hrs now and I still can't play it. Also very very jumpy and takes a  good few minutes before it takes action and that was before this update. It looks cool and is more interactive but so much slower and frustrating.  Otherwise it would be PRIMO. Just not quite there yet.",
        "My first game glitched and didn't load the free black widow quest, or the black panther event at level six. Be careful about buying buildings you don't need yet, I had no way to buy Club A and had to start over.",
        "Too expensive at times to get the best rewards and all the goals. Love the concept and game play. Some adventures take a bit long.  Used to love this game. Have spent a fortune on it. Since the upgrade hate the gameplay....not that I can play anymore. Since the hulk event the game comes up and then crashes.  Give me my thousands of dollars and hours of time back, since it's now useless to me.",
        "After recent update game is not starting. As it is not working just uninstalled. Installed game as new event has started. I thought developers sorted out the issue. But after starting the game it downloads around 500mb data and stopped working. Wow what a beautiful new event.after new update & bug fix still game not opening.23 March still app is not working.",
        "So, a lot of problems have been fixed and now it's actually enjoyable and fun to play again. Thank you very much. Just a thing left to change, please lower the price for Ranking a character to 5, 20000 credits are hard to get, maybe 10000, or 15000 as well. 😀"

        "This game needs a lot of improvements. The castle/home screen keeps pixelising or bugging out when I tab out of the game and back in, sometimes it does it on its own too. The picture also wobbles a bit while zooming in or out. I'd also improve the tapboxes since tapping on the sky takes me to the fortifications panel for some reason. The map also seems pretty dull. Apart from all that, the UI is simplistic and I like it. I just wish there were more things to do.",

I did the math someone attacked 2 of my forts but didn't have silver to claim them, so I didn't bother sending that much support (just trickled). Guess what the person was a pay to win and had sent rubies, I lost both my forts. That's why rubies are dumb."

        "This game is similar to break it. It's cool. I like recording feature in this game. It also have some features of candy crush saga . But I think the name papa pear is not suitable . It is the best king game.👍👍👍👍👍👍👍. It's my short edit in my review.  It started taking long time to load with blank screen king l hate it now so I changed my rating it's OK form l love it . So now 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎. So please answer me developer.",
        "I wish the updates were quicker. Been sitting at the top waiting for more challenges. Check back weekly and still no new levels 😢",
        "why don't you leave the freaking wheel until you spin it..like candy crush. .seriously it's a no brainer .. I said leave the wheel not take it away altogether 😈",
        "This game is fun and challenging . I really enjoyed the prize wheel please bring it back and i will rate 5 stars",
        "I'm tired of playing the challenges and beating all 5 levels and not receiving my rewards. Please fix!!!!!!!!!!",
        "Great game, but don't get any free reward's like a gold bar, and other friends do!!!!"

        "Cons: The character movement in battle (i.e shooting X-bow, swinging, glaives, swords etc) is just a loop. 1 combo set of moves for each weapon. Game WILL freeze and close once every now and again. No live pvp.  Pros: 94 different solo story missions. The rewards system (chests, gems, etc.) is well developed. \"Dwarven Forge\" is a live 4 player co-op mini-game that is really fun and seems to run smoothly which is great because it's the only part you can play with other live players.",
        "this game has lost its standing every update is causing more issues! I can't participate in gold wares cause I instantly crash... I have lost at least 145 morale and over 200 gems... and they never refund the full amount! they only refund about half!  stop creating new features fix the stupid crashes...  I am a vip7 and was considering to go vip8... but so don't want to till they fix the dang crashes!",
        "I play this game about everyday just to get the legendary chest. My only compliant about this is last month I was due a legendary chest and on 02/28/18 when I went in to get my chest it was in March already,  What the heck is up with that. Spend all that time going into the game and no legendary chest,  is this on purpose or a glitch? I hope it doesn't happen this month again.",
        "I previously rated this game 1 star. With the new updated version game play is exceptional.  The coop mode can suck depending on others and their network speeds.  If you want to get powefull fast you can buy you way there or grind it out.  I prefer the gind as I play just an hour or two at night. Lol.  Fun game.",
        "Not as good as DH4. Only one class of characters to play as. Lots of more side things, but most are not worth the time. Direction of how to do some things are lacking, so you're left to feel around in the dark a bit. There seems to be an update every couple days which is kind of annoying.",
        "I could not finish the introduction because of multiple game crashes. I just deleted one of your other games because of the same unreliability with your servers. This seems to be an unfortunate pattern with Gameloft games. I will avoid any product you create moving forward. Pity."

The one above the have supplied to Google bounced back.  The one they advertise in game gets ignored. Take your money oh yes they sure WILL given the daily but this offers. NO SUPPORT REPORTING TO GOOGLE as support email is fake.",
        "This game is wildly disproportionate.... There are players who spend thousands of dollars on in-app purchases and have insane amounts of power so they pick on the players who can't afford to do the same. The amount of resources required to upgrade technology and buildings becomes astronomical very quickly and mining for the resources needed is impossible due to the fact that the huge players hunt mines. Adding to this, every time your fleet gets hit on a mine or a base you lose 20% of that fleet, which costs you more resources to build it back up, compounding the impossibility to grow unless you spend insane amounts of money. If you don't have ridiculous amounts of money to waste on this game, don't bother downloading it.",

Why change something that wasn't broken!! 😡  UPDATE...since the second update the game is back and I LOVE it. Thank you so much for sorting it out. I genuinely love this game!!",

Game constantly crashes, cannot play for longer than a few minutes before it crashes, can't go into any other hospitals because it crashes, can't watch videos because it crashes.....*STILL crashing, even after new update. I'm now getting a message on update screen 'this app may not be optimised for your device' - this app worked perfectly fine before update, why now is the app not optimised??",
        "This is A cute game to play doctor and all.  I just wish earning coins did not take so long, because to add on a clinic or expansion, it takes up all your money.  Also to purchase item for the hospital, the cost of each item goes up after you purchase one item. Like the waiting room chairs starts at 40 coins after a few chairs it is now at 70 coins per chair. Like how unfair is that?  Like is their a limit to how high each item gets?",
        "The problem is the friends system requires you connect via Facebook. For people that don't want to, or don't have Facebook, you're screwed. Please implement a way to add friends inside the game rather than through Facebook harassment.",
        "The game has the potential to be very entertaining however the constant crashes and app failure is very disheartening. Definite work needed to improve these issues, now its saying the app may not be optimized for the device. Why wouldn't it say that before downloading? Try again!",
        "Very laggy, took up alot of space on my phone. Wouldn't let me drag anything from one place to another. Very annoying. Don't reccomend"

        "Great game!!! Still some bug's. You have to log out and log back in to collect the 5 hour daily rewards. Sometimes you can't post in the chat rooms. It will say invalid character. A lot of lag at times when you use the power and impact gauge. There needs to be more options to customize character's and or add more. I also believe the daily 5 hour rewards need to change instead of the same rewards everyday. It is a fun game, and highly addictive. Great graphics, which still could be improved on, looking at newer golf games coming out.",
        "Great game.  Only problem is the huge 10 second warning that covers your shot.   Also the game meter jumps.  So I get penalties for taking longer than 10 seconds when I let the control bar reset.",
        "Almost great. The UI is a crowded mess. Too much nonsense. The equipment tabs are broken due to bugs(I downloaded on several devices) making it impossible to accurately navigate between items, and the putting is rigged(obvious padding) resulting in missed shots that shouldn't happen. Besides these glaring flaws there is great potential here.",
        "A great game easy to play and progress.  Only issue is i can't work out how to change my country from the usa to aus. Sick to death of my putts begging taken off me because you have ridiculously stupid gamer play.  If I putt a ball in real life and it hits the edge of a cup it goes in 90 pc of the time.  If I putt one to the lip of the cup in real life it goes ohm.  But bout your retarded physics.  They stop the ball on the edge or knock it away from the hole. What a load of bulls$/^. Fix this and I may consider upping the rating",
        "I really like this game other than the BIRDS IN THE BACKGROUND!!! Shut them up PLEASE!!! It's very annoying and makes me not want to play this game I have to play it with the volume turned down so I don't have to hear the freaking BIRDS!",
        "Fine before the update. Now it glitches and freezes. Cannot finish a round. Power bar no longer smooth. Not enjoyable to play. I wanted to quit in the middle of the round. Very disappointed in latest update. I hope this is fixed soon. This was my favorite game on mobile device ever and I want to go babe to playing it!"

        "I stop playing C C because I loved this game... I noticed that we use way more than we get!! And to only get a few tickets for every 10 Bingo's then having to wit for 22hrs....only 4 tickets and hr...and it takes way to long to get to the next level and when do reach it we get very little tickets!!! Dont have to many deals to get both tickets and special prizes... Also how does it when a game starts right after a tournament that I end up in the thousand plus  rank below the bronze??? As much as I love this game think its time to give it a rest until there re more incentives to bring me back!!!",
        "My game keep freezing up and not submitting my scores not giving me boosters I acquired during that round. Please fix the issues and give me back my points and boosters. Thank you   I just played again and I played the whole game but when it's time to tally the score the game freezes. I lost 3 footballs and a treasure chest plus my points. Please respond to my issues. I haven't heard from anyone yet. But I still like the game. Just want it to stop robbing me....",
        "This is definitely a fun bingo app. Where it's lacking or otherwise could be improved, comparatively to ther Bingo games, is the daily spin wheel & daily sign in bonus. Daily 24hr sign in should provide a much larger number of free tickets & include daily free power ups. Earning one or two power ups w a single spin of the wheel is anticlimactic! Power ups are a vital way to  daily tournament advancement, bingo wins & simy make playing more fun. Completing a pizzule is impossible without power-ups or making a purchase. However, a big win for this app. is the ability to sign in each new day to a new tournament which helps level the playing field. Special tournaments and/or the add' side bonuses, like the \"turkey daub\" made playing & making a purchase worth wild!",
        "Good, keeps me coming back for more. The only thing I don't like is there is no way of getting that many puzzle pieces in the time. Could you maybe let us play till we get the Puzzle Complete to get the rewards.",
        "I am addicted to this game. I think you should get more power ups instead of ticket's. Cause you run out of power up's. I feel you should get bingo power up's instead of ticket's. On the bonus spin they should add bingo power up's of 4. I need more bingo power up's. And would like to get power up's for daubing every number called each game. I need more power Up's. And the game should give you tickets when you get every number that is called correctly on each card every game that you play.",
        "The new additions of the outlaws was great, but then you added all these \"special\" days that serve no purpose but to make people spend money. I have spent plenty already but not for every game. Sorry guys, bad move. Too greedy."

        "So... if this isn't a scam... how can I quit a game before it's over and immediately be paired with the same opponent. Every time I've had an opponent drop out, it takes a few seconds to notify me they left the game. Every day a new reason to NOT pay a cent for this fraud. I play out of sheer boredom.",
        "Players with higher ranks should not be able to play  against players that are lower rank with less experience. Plus the ring challenge if you don't reach  the 30000 you should get the amount that it stops on, instead of 1000 points.",
        "Want to love this game, but it just constantly cheats!! It would be more enjoyable if you could have so many free plays per log in to just enjoy some play, like other games do. Instead you run out of gems right away after being cheated out of one or two games, which really stinks!!  I'm not paying through the nose just to enjoy playing a game. You are too greedy and a big fat CHEAT King and it has really disappointed me, because the game would be great fun if I could actually play it!!!",
        "Uninstalling...too many hiccups! Costs too much too play a simple game of cards. This game is all about making a lot of money for 'King' corporation. Can't really say anything nice about this game. Pretty much agree with the reviews. (didn't even have installed for 24 hrs.)",
        "I agree with the cheating and everything everyone else is talking about, but I also have a problem with the automatic card shuffle in the middle of your turn. Wait for the players turn to end, then shuffle.  I have lost several games because of this.  I now have a 3 lose rule because of the way this game messes with you and then I'm out and won't play for days or weeks, because I refuse to pay for a game that cheats."

        "I liked the game so much. No! I love it, but it's just that I'm now on level 65 but I'm stucked since I only have few gems left and I needed to extend the time, and buy some customers which I find amazing just to save your energy and the stage but I also find it hard since I have already completed 3 stars from lower levels and why is it that I can't play the levels I have already completed? I would really suggest that lower levels would still be played just to be able to collect gems. I hope you can fix this issue though. I'm so loving this game and I'm getting addicted to it. I got stucked on level 65 on my two days of playing. Thank you",
        "I love this game! So few games actually suck me in, but this game had me addicted right away. I play on my phone and laptop. Yes I have two different games at different levels lol. I love how upgrades are so easy and it isn't impossible to upgrade or move on. It gets challenging as you go up levels but it's so fun.",
        "Moving on is hard on some levels because they are specifically designed for you to use gems and they are hard to come by. However, If you are patient enough you can eventually earn them. I enjoy that you don't have to drag the items to the customers. It's definitely an enjoyable and challenging game. I'm currently at a \"coming soon\" stage where I can no longer move ahead. I've been waiting a long time and do not want to wait forever. Please do an update soon!!!",
        "Great game but some levels really hard I cant pasd this one level im on for days maybe update make it easier pass level I'm on I just did update...I hope so... love game anyways great game to.. identical cooking joy to map was a great game to but also hard get passed certain levels that game to n I can try play fast with my hands to still cant pass to not playing  cooking joy anymore going stick with this one see if game gets easier to",
        "It's fun till you run out of energy. They get you too rate the game right away while you are having fun with free lives. Give you enough lives to rate it good then the lives end and you have to watch a min advert or 30 mins for one life Regen. OR PAY. They just want your money at that point. So sad.",
        "Brilliant little time waster of a game.. yet.. once you start getting to the higher levels.. the less chance of earning gems and i aint noway paying for them.. last time I stupidly paid for gems on cooking fever..and got my account hacked into! Big lesson learnt! I do still play this alot tho so overall, definitely a good game. 👍"

I am not into waiting a half a day so I can gain a 5 min advantage, then turn around and do it again. Only this time, just wait longer! .... Or of course you could just spend be re $.... Awesome game... makers are greedy!",
        "I'm not happy that I can only send 20 gold from my accounts to one of my accounts per day. I'd like to send more gold per day. Annoying 2 alliance war battle limit should be gotten rid of. It's annoying, expensive and takes a very long time to reach each level of the game. Overall, it's a good game to play but it can be improved",
        "The last few days this game become completely useless and unplayable. The matchmaking has been tweaked to the point where I'm being attacked by significantly higher players, without even a possibility to retaliate! At the same time when I try to attack in quick match, the level of my opponents is being so high, that I have zero chances winning a simple attack.  I'm thinking about uninstalling this game permanently. When contacted, Zynga employee suggests to spend more money to upgrade my defenses. How is that for \"humanly friendly\" customer service? Horrible service.",
        "After getting to HQ level 10 it just got so boring.  To be honest don't like the game play playing against other people either.  The play is slanted toward the attacker .  Deleted",
        "It's quite unreasonable that the nuke is too close to other command items! So, please give me back a nuke, and 40000 fuels as well as 5000 metals for reviving robot and retraining tanks! Also put the nuke to other corners!",
        "Game has a fun, friendly community of players. Load times kinda slow. Occational bugs and glitches. Usually following after updates. Overall though a fun game that has new features added frequently, keeping it interesting."

        "This is one of the best rpgs out there in my opinion for a few reasons the graphics are very nice, rpgs whos graphics try to get really realistic are just not the same it looks blan likr that. My next reason is it isnt a pay to win game. For all of the people out there who like to pay a lot of money, its just dum. Money for a game should only be for cosmetic items to make you look really cool not to boost you 10 tens ahead of everyone, and for that I thank you Allstar gaming. Paying does get you a boost in game its just not very big the only reason rating s are so bad is cuz the top up didnt give them anything which is a huge bug.",

I came acrossed this one from a Facebook add and as soon as I started playying it has been super fun every since. The p2w ratio is literally not high at all. So F2P can definitely gain just ad much. Awesome gameplay good graphics for the game itself overall I definitely recommend this game. ♡",
        "Game sucks! No control in game for cheaters. Devs don't care about the game! Hackers are top ranked over the cash players. No matter how many tickets I opened there is no response. Don't waste your time on this game, unless you wanting g to get away with cheating g.",

Not to mention we payers get harassed in game by free to play players daily! Show some respect to the people who give you a pay check.",

And nowadays the prize of beating weekend boss arena is very low chance of idol and the boss really powerfull. I hope the dev team could look thia problems again. Thank you so much.",

Tho Im not a fan of kinda kiddy characters but still I play for content of the game really happy I could play again this kind of game thank you",
        "Developer team should consider treasure gnome strengths at beginning of stage. I lose 3 times in a row to that gnome in one hit. And additional monsters that can attack in 1 turn. Boss arena reward seems become worse, no idol at all for 3 weeks.",
        "Ive never been a fan of having to wait for energy in games but I guess that's what makes a smart phone game addictive. Try making it so getting diamonds is a little more easy (random drops etc.) But I guess you probably get more as you level up. Opening crates gives the game a better drive and makes it more addictive. All in all a solid game though..",
        "Drains battery too quickly. Haven't got any idols from boss arena for months. Massive chest is a dumb idea because it doesn't reward any gold at all. Lack of new areas and modes means daily boring gold grinding.",
        "I know the Concept from Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes and I've been looking for something similar ever since I've finished it. The fact that there are four colours to combine makes it a bit trickier, as it gets less likely to easily combine three (or more) of a kind, but that makes it just a tad bit more challenging.  So far it feels like a really neat game, though I still haven't unlocked anything but the Campaign and Treasure Cave."

I am in the 3rd stage and i went to update the game as it keeps freezing, and now I'm back at 115! And if i read the reviews here i am not the only one that has this problem. And seems you guys don't care. I will defnitely rate this minus 1!!!! 28.12.2017",
        "Submitted a report yesterday and you made out I was lying. I've submitted 2 reports since then with no reply.  When I pass a level my ticket count is not going up I'm now at the gate that is telling me I need a 100 tickets its pointless me going over other levels as the ticket has not increased. I was told to tell you when I'm at the gate, which I have done twice. Still ignored.  I really likes the game until this happened.",
        "A fantastic match-3 game for all ages. Kudos to the creator of this game. How about coming out with a Rio 2: Match 3 Party? I'm not even close to the end on this one, if there is an end.  Just asking basically if it had been thought about. More levels are great too, with more birds. Love these critters. Thanks!!!",
        "Haven't been able to play for 2 weeks. Submitted report after report and nothing has been done to fix the problem. Not very user friendly. Have full Wifi so that's not the problem. All my other games work great. No thanks. I shouldn't have to jump through hoops to play a game. Delete.",
        "Love this cute and challenging game but with all of these types there should be an option to turn off auto hints.. Really annoying and I like to figure out the next move myself.. Same thing with the constant tutorial, match 3 isn't rocket science... Otherwise great job!!!",
        "GREAT GAME, ADDICTIVE, LOVE IT!!!!!! HOWEVER, I have completed the first 2 locations, got the tickets that I need to proceed on the third location, but the game won't load the other levels... It keep saying i need atleast 77 tickets... I have 120 of them. I have uninstalled & reinstalled the game THREE TIMES but I am STILL stuck waiting. FIX THIS ASAP, PLEASE"

Edit: it won't allow me to invite friends, I'm able to play one game a day unless I continuously buy more tokens...but with ads after every game, they get funding from them. I installed this game because the reviews were the best, but maybe it's just got a grudge against me!",
        "I understand they are trying to make money off this app, but if you are going to charge someone 320 tickets to play 4 cards, the reward should be more than 70 tickets per win.  I mean, really?! Some people want to play bingo, but want something to work toward without being bored.  I played Bingo story and deleted it, because I had a lot of credits, but EVERY BOARD WAS THE SAME.  Also, the powerups in this game should be limited to what you have available, and not have to purchase because you are out of said power up.  It might make more people play if they are rewarded.  .  I mean the quests saying you will win 600 tickets if you complete the quest, but you're spending on the normal side 280+ tickets, really?  And no other options besides watching ad videos for free credits?  And I'm not saying to add a \"download this app and run it for 3 tickets.  Reach level 300 for 40 tickets.\"  Rant over",
        "Everything would be pretty neat, but there should be another way to get more tickets. I've been stuck at the New York state for several days now, cause I can only replay the first stages with the tickets from the daily bonus.",
        "Love it. The only reason I didn't give 5's across the board is it gets costly per game as you gain levels. The games are way fun and you can play up to 8 cards !!!!!",
        "There should be more ways to get or win more tickets and power-ups. I also think the costs per cards increases too much from board to board. Other than those two issues, I love this game. Would play more if there were other ways to get/win tickets, the purchase costs is ridiculous for the middle/working-class.  I'd rather pay my bills than buy fake in-game tickets that CAN'T win me REAL CASH. Thank you keep up the good work.",
        "It's a fun game. You have to be quick near the end beacause the game seem to end while the caller is still calling the last number. You don't get a penalty for daubing the wrong number."

        "Love this game. Second time I've played it. At level 46 I unlocked the whistles, at level 90 I finished the first puzzle, at level 95, I got my first carousel, at level 100 I had unlocked everything except the puppies...still need red puppy, at level 101 I got my first ferris wheel, at level 105 I got the first swinging ride, at level 121 I unlocked tier 7 & at lvl 130 I finished 2nd puzzle. Only thing I hate is the adds popping up as I touch the board, so it goes to the game & I have to exit. Edit: third time playing. March 2018. So much has changed!!! Quests, boxes, keys & now my game is saved...had to start from scratch but wont lose it again!!!",
        "I've run 2 other apps to get bonus coins both at almost 1k each and I never got my coins. I finished the tutorial like it said I had to but zero coins were given for it. U shouldn't offer free coins to run other apps if u aren't going to give the coins for it. Will probably give up and delete bc of it.  Tried to give it a 2nd chance and did the flash light purchase to get 2268 coins and never got my coins. Why offer free coins if u won't give the free coins?  I emailed like recommend and sent proof like requested and still nothing. I smell a lawsuit for false advertisement. My $4.99 spend on a flashlight is going to make me thousands. Thanks for not doing ur job.",
        "Extreme amount of ad pop ups. Usually loses dollars and coins. Fun but with all the flaws its not worth it. I played so far and it started over out of nowhere. Can't load or anything. Waste of my time",
        "It's is nearly impossible to play because of the amount of pop-ups. In one minute, I counted 15 pop-ups. Even if you aren't touching the screen, whilst waiting on coins, it jumps from advertisement to advertisement. A decent game ruined by pop-ups.",
        "It has its moments. With the abundance of ads present and the fact that the game gives notifications for things you cant get and the forced instructions at times it is a okay game but pretty boring after a while.",
        "I really enjoy this game..I  originally began playing to earn credits for another game but drifted past level 7,which was the required level I intended to complete and stop playing. Next thing I knew I was clicking away, determined to get the next cute \"prize,\" down the centre aisle. I looked up to see I was at level 10! Geez! I knew I was hooked when I found myself looking at my coin balance..found it satisfactory...smiling...i forgot my original game...now that's an addictive game!! Lol! I blame the cute puppy dog prize that lured me with its overwhelming cuteness.."

        "This is a fascinating game where you're a concubine battling it out with the thousands upon thousands of other concubines (players) vying for the emperor's affection. The YouTube ads are a bit misleading, and don't represent actual gameplay. Most of the game involves you getting an army of souls of historical  figures so you can fight other people's armies to continue the story  or get crucial items that will help level up your army. There's the option to slap/curse people, but most of the existing players apparently take this game WAY too seriously, and you can cause party wars and get disowned by your own party just by 宮鬥 ing easily offended people, which is pretty dumb since this game actively encourages you to do it. I've been told and reprimanded (?!?!?) to \"play nice so everyone can have a good time,\" which defeats the purpose and entertainment of this game...? There's definitely many layers to this game, and a complete time-suck (usually takes me about 2-3 hours of daily gameplay to finish all the missions to get the daily rewards). Very entertaining (and would be more entertaining if most of the players had thicker skin and don't flip out and try to get you destroyed in the game just because their avatar looks bruised for like an hour after a slapping).",

Gonna put a hindrance on the event that's over on Friday. Do hope it's resolved soon. Still like the game tho, but would like it better if I can play.",
        "Well a very basic game, as any other idle game. Has no real extra things that would wow you. Notifications less than a minute after closing the app (or simply pressing home) can get very annoying. As if I need a notification to tell me I closed the game.",
        "Right.  First off, If you are not a fan of Idle games, then don't play. This is the epitome of an Idle game.   The Early game is pretty simple. Click, Collect, Make your way to Level 80. You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn't bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn't been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event's are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events'  All in, pretty good.",

My only suggestion is maybe if someone takes the time to watch an ad for a lavastone maybe give them 2 or something those ads are long lol",
        "I do really like this game. But I have to admit I do not think it is as good as the other virtual villager games. Looks fantastic but it's missing the schools and other things. I miss being able to get a master doctor. I also think compared to the other games. The tech points are harder to get and it's not as fun or exciting upgrading in this game as it was with the other games.. I still enjoy it but I just feel like it's missing something.",
        "I love this series. One thing I would like to say is things should happen at a set time or after you finish something. I still have 4 puzzles that I am no closer to finishing then I was a week ago. But these games are fun and are a great way to pass the time. I actually play it on my laptop so it's a little easier for me.",
        "I love the game so much! I have played every other virtual villagers game and I love all of them; they are the best games ever. It's really challenging to get items that you need so you can complete a puzzle. It took me forever to finish chapter 1, but I finally finished 3 months ago, so now I'm waiting for chapter 2. It's really fun. Although it took forever to get the box to decorate the tree and to get the crab, but they were not as difficult as trying to get the pan to pan the gold because I couldn't see where it's location was and I looked everywhere, but I ended up finding it. Then there was the problem with trying to get the gold, becase the pan disappeared after getting the first gold. It was difficult to find the location to get the other two gold nuggets because I couldn't tap the area to find it, I could only find it by dropping a villager on it ( again I don't know where the location is) to get the gold. But I ended up finding them and in a way it was actually pretty fun for me to try and get the gold because it was challenging, but it did take forever. All'in'all it's a really good game; I just suggest (for the sake of other players) to make it possible to find the pan and the location to get the gold. I still love the game and I can't wait for chapter 2, and I hope for more in the future, you guys are the best so keep up the good work.  Thanks for the great game.",
        "Game has no instructions, no way of knowing what needs to be crafted etc,  huts can only be built when technology is learnt, and then no huts are used? Etc love shack and crafting... there are certain things you CANT pick up despite being told you can... no way of lighting the fire, no way of mixing herbs without water, but you have water in the craft hut?   No way of catching butterflies... i relised a giant octopus that sits and dose nothing..lolol crazy game massive improvements needed hence the 3 stars...",
        "I really  like  this game and all the villager games, also virtual families  2. I'm  disappointed  that  I  had to start over because of an upgrade issue that was not fixed. I lost all my progress. Luckily  I didn't  lose the heron and lemur that I paid for. Customer services  could use improvement ."

And I absolutely love my lil pets and their powers 😊 and the ingame friends I have are helpful. edited: I completed a purchase and did not recieve anything like the quest said I would. Also developers never responded to my email regarding something else. I've spent $40 bucks on this game in the 1st few days I've been playing and I think I'll keep my lil money to myself now since they haven't fixed the issue.",
        "Would give 5 stars but after you get to a certain level you have to spend real money to get farther. I have spend 65 dollars on this game so far and have been scammed so many times. Its a super fun game but so hard to get anywhere. You should be able to stock up shields. Also its stupid that you have to pay to talk. I might get the VIP if some things changed.",
        "The problem I have is you haven't given the radio toy for the bear and also you can't unfreeze the guy because you don't give out the items to do it even after defeating the monster. You still can't get enough fire logs plus still no radio toy for the bear? Plus should give more coins it is a lot in higher levels",

        "Fun, easy to play, complex to reach higher levels, this game has, so far, been great. No microtransactions (thus far) to continue playing, which is a huge plus. A few have stated a couple of bugs, which I agree with, adding only one other comment; I do wish their was an offline option for at least some gameplay. Online still necessary for a lot, but offline to run some dungeons. This could, in theory, help with some server space, as well.",
        "This game is one of the best game I ever played in mobile. I love the graphic which is cute and there is so many content, so it's not boring. And another positive side, you can get the special currency easily in the game. It's not a p2w games ^^ but the sign board was one of the best micro transaction I've ever seen. Try it and you'll see.. it's a lot of fun ^^",
        "I've been looking for a game like this for ages! I was a fan of Runestone Keeper and wanted something similar for my phone. These guys knocked it out of the park. I rarely spend money on phone games, but these guys deserve every penny and accolade coming their way. Fun and  simple, yet brilliant in execution and design. Tons of content already, and I can't wait to see what's next. Keep up the great work!",
        "This game is so much fun! My only complaint is that the gear is gone when done with the maze, so you start it over. As well as \"learning new titles\". It gets kinda old having to start that over every time you beat a full maze. But that aside, this game is definitely addictive! Keep up the great work!",
        "Your game is amazing. You guys are amazing. After everything you went through, you deserve these stars at the very least. Your game isn't pay to win, it's just a grand experience and I love it.  One of the BEST games on the market easily.  Keep up the good work, you're all doing fantastic.  Respect",
        "I've been playing like nine months and it's very addictive you really grow and have many choices. It's truly free to play and gems are everywhere. Buying a signboard for real money is the best bang for your buck and a lizard if you feel like buying something else.  Totally recommend it. I only hate getting creator gumball is so expensive other than that it's a great game. It's a game that goes as fast or as slow as you feel like playing."

        "Awesome game. just a few comments. you guys should have the stuff that's automatically generated (mining for example) running in the background even while the app is closed because otherwise you're just getting maybe 100 every now and then and you feel like you're getting nothing. would be nice for the money that comes every minute to also still run even while the app is off",
        "Great idle game that you can play as much or as little as you want, even if you only have a few minutes. My only gripe is all the inactive guilds. Finding a guild with an active guild master is virtually impossible, and when the gm quits all guild upgrading is over. It's also frustrating that all the upgrades you earn for a guild stay with the guild so if your guild master comes back after 6 months and kicks you, you get to start from scratch with no bonuses.",
        "This game is actually really good. Not as confusing as the picture shows. Lots to explore.   The only thing I would change for a 5 star it to not stop us from battling after 1 hour of playing.  Hypecrafter NX youtuber Sighing out.",
        "I am not able to access the members list after the upgrade, please fix this problem. I have too many inactive players I have to kick out. Kindly fix this asap",
        "great game, but one of the advertisements with a game in it caused my game to crash, and now i get nothing from watching the advertisements, I'd suppose because its still waiting for a reply from the advert. it was a casino advertisement with 3 buttons, and it led me to the top one. other than that, the app is good. definitely didn't expect an attack from the tribe of stretchy nipples.",

The one above the have supplied to Google bounced back.  The one they advertise in game gets ignored. Take your money oh yes they sure WILL given the daily but this offers. NO SUPPORT REPORTING TO GOOGLE as support email is fake.",
        "This game is wildly disproportionate.... There are players who spend thousands of dollars on in-app purchases and have insane amounts of power so they pick on the players who can't afford to do the same. The amount of resources required to upgrade technology and buildings becomes astronomical very quickly and mining for the resources needed is impossible due to the fact that the huge players hunt mines. Adding to this, every time your fleet gets hit on a mine or a base you lose 20% of that fleet, which costs you more resources to build it back up, compounding the impossibility to grow unless you spend insane amounts of money. If you don't have ridiculous amounts of money to waste on this game, don't bother downloading it.",

Looking to maybe take the owner to court for not doing anything about stopping this illegal activity of sexual harassment ect.",
        "The game developer keeps changing things so they can make more proffit it's not for the benefit of the players it's for the benefit for they can make more profit do not spend the money to start this game you're good so far along and then he'll change it on you or cost you more just to stay status quo",

Then when you complain, he purposely delays any response for 48 hours because that takes you outside of the Google Play store Return Policy...thus forcing you to either continue to not be responded to OR contest the entire transaction as fraud through your bank.

        "I reckon this game is so good! I reckon it needs a test mode track so when you finish fixing the car fully to 100% you can test it. And probably alot more cars to fix, and also instead of having just one place where there are garages. You can go all over the world to different type of country's where there are different cars like Australia has commodores, Japan of skyline etc. Love this game so much ❤ hope you take this into exception",
        "Overall the game is exactly what you think it would be, a mobile version of car mechanic simulator 2018. That being said the rotate and zoom features of the camera can be a little irritating at times. It's also very hard to make money to get to your 4th level of tools when you can't completely repair the majority of cars that you get. It can be a little frustrating to purchase a car only to realize that you cannot completely restore it.",
        "Great game and efforts of game generating team are appreciated. I wld suggest to add few things like  tires wheel rims tinted glass at extra cost and if used will pay more while selling. Also sometimes when we buy car from barn in some cases few parts could be made missing so that player wld need to search and then purchase new to add more fun. After u get all tools and all cards then it is boaring....",
        "Trying to find a support link?? I have all tools yet wont give me a bonus.... Love the game. Camera can be a pain sometimes but you learn where to and where not to touch parts. Also why not have buyers or clients stop in... Finishing a car 100% and only making 2k after putting wok into the car Then 10k into parts... I would fire the guy selling cars... Just my two cents.",
        "For the developers: this game is broken. I play on tablet Galaxi tab A   Start the game Remove battery Buy new battery Install new battery Cant tap the sell option Game freeze Nothing work Retart the game 5 times always the same",
        "Nothing like the older apps like this. Camera control is hard, going from warehouse to parts catalogue constantly to remember bad parts to replace is a pain, then an add plays further impairing your memory. Disassembly  got way less interactive and so far I can't repair parts, just  purchase from a catalog."

        "The game is good (played like 5 missions so far) but i feel like there should be a jump and crouch feature, even if its just a jump feature. Maybe make some levels where you gotta utilize the jumping, maybe throw in some jet packs during some missions/raids to get to a certain area to either continue the mission and/or find some hidden crates. Also, maybe add some melee weapons too?  Besides that, the game is fun, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay could improve tho.",
        "Its awesome. Running smooth with maxed graphics on s8+ and I had no problems while playing it for 10+ hours.  May be starting area could be expanded along with more multiplayer features and interactions. More unique missions between lvl 11 and 15. Also smaller package (5$) could be added. P.S crashes when collecting contract rewards ...Puzzles sucks. Avoid multiplayer and arena untill is fixed",
        "This game has little bit inspiration from many big games like destiny (duh), titanfall, doom. The game does have similarities to dead trigger. All the random loot is cosmetic, guns are easily obtained through missions. Good performance on my S7, but need internet 24×7 to run, even during campaign.",
        "The graphic is awesome.But the game sometimes crashes when entering the casino full of people. Also, add chat system in co-op modes. It's hard to make people understand the puzzles without a chat. Add jump,crouch. It will make the game more attractive and the things are also needed for a game like this. I love the game. Keep adding new things, just don't turn the game into mostly pay to play game.Thanks.",
        "Literally the best mobile game I have ever played. All IAP so far is cosmetic, which is great. Very similar to destiny with it's own flavor. I do wish you we're able to jump though and shotguns in pvp are OP. Game is optimized well for my mid-grade device. However, it won't run on my gf's ZTE Grand X Max which is very unfortunate considering it's basically the same phone as mine. Hopefully this changes soon because we really looked forward to playing together. Download this game!!!",
        "Giving the review after 24hrs of gameplay. Have to say that it's awesome. Cudos to the creators. Loving the gaming experience. Graphics rendering should be calibrated more. Make sure to do that in next update. Coins and slots are hard to obtain. Many of them don't want  to spend real money so better give some daily tasks to complete and earn coins."

        "I feel inlove with the game the second I opened it! being a huge naruto fan I had high expectations! and most of them were met.  I have two issues! it's seems the only way to get hero fragments is through the shops which is only 10 at a time. or special attack missions which keep changing! makes it very hard to awaken shinobi.  also why only 8 chapters in story mode! You have a whole two anime to base off and we only get 8 chapters! how disappointing.",
        "I am a little disappointed in the game right now. I saved up for the Jiriya banner which is supposed to have a higher drop rate, got one Jiriya card in a multi 10xs summon. I would like to know why that happened seeing as with every other banner I have ever pulled on had numerous cards for that shinobi, sometimes even the full kit minus an ult. I am not looking for an ultimate every time. But when I pull on a banner I would like the rate to actually be reasonable thank you very much.",
        "Everything was working just fine until not long ago. All of a sudden, everytime I try to play any kind of mission on my android, a message will pop up saying, 'Due to an unknown error the game will return to the title screen'. It's been happening for over a week now, I've tried to reinstall but nothing works. Please fix.",
        "4 days ago i was having a problem of playing missions. I couldnt start it because the screen showed \"due to an unknown error the game is returning to the title screen\". The issue was resolved yesterday and again today the same old stuff. Is this a joke going on with my account?",
        "To BANDAI NAMCO... Just suggesting a few thought about this game. I've taken liken this game more than any other I played so far.  I just thought during the mission about the choosen characters. I think this game will be more stratigical if you can switch characters during the mission. It just doesn't make any sense if the main character you control died right away. Since in a story there's still a chance to turn the table on your side. Just like in Naruto series though their team captain may die the subordinates will carry their will and a chance to win. And in this game,  If the main character died the rest automatically dies though there's still a lot of spare life. Hope you call consider.  Just making suggestion. Your AWESOME making this game BANDAI NAMCO.",
        "I really like this game, the only reason im giving it a 1 star. Is because I've tried to send them a message involving an issue but I cant seem to find the way to do it. In regards to the issue I hope they see this message and fix it, for some reason it wont let me do any missions. I have updated it and deleted the cache but the problem persist."

        "An absolutely wonderful game. Even better then Hearthstone if you ask me. It's so good that even I, Solaire of Astora who hails from Dark Souls, absolutely praises this game. 100% recommend. This only issue that one could run into is lag, but this is only due to the fact that I have an older phone. I'm sure that if you have a better phone, this game would be EVEN better. Praise the Sun \\[T]/",
        "Elder scrolls legends is a game with a elder scrolls taste and mechanics. Its choices, game modes and progress systems works perfect. It's story is great, and serve as a tutorial for the big part of the game. You can even unlock new dlc and decks through your progress in the game. This is truly a marvelous game. Problems like connection break occurs very rare and does not affect the game. If you like CCG and ELDER SCROLLS, then this game is highly recommended.",
        "Hands down one of the best card games I have ever played. The gameplay is simplistic yet emersive. The different combinations of cards and deck types you can build is vast allowing you to adapt to any challenge you may encounter. While the gameplay is phenomenal, it's very easy to gain an understanding of how to play and the cards themselves. Bethesda has yet again made a game that has captivated me. Well done 👍",
        "The first three turns of the game has an incredibly small amount of finite moves.  You wouldn't know this because the typical player will take more than 30 seconds on their first, second, and third turns.  You start to realize that on \"draft\" games, you will benefit more if you concede the game when your opponent is taking an agonisingly long time on the first few turns because they're putting so much thought into the only play in their hand.",
        "Week 1: *Going to try to make this an ongoing review*. Had to lower this to 4 stars overall, because you have to either pay or grind to access all of story mode. I'm gonna buy it, but I think it shouldn't cost more than $14.99. Just mho. PvP is fun and you actually play LIVE people, not an AI running someone's cards. Level rewards seem generous and worthwhile.  Runs a bit slow, but I know it's my phone and not the app's fault. Gameplay is very fluid and makes sense. I already like it FAR BETTER than Hearthstone.",
        "Fun game! Is very generous with card packs and rewards. Plenty of deck complexity yet easy to get into. The RnG can be troublesome at times, but I guess that's just how card games go. Would definitely recommend if you enjoy card games, specially if you're and Elder Scrolls fan."

I was able to get everything in the game without spending money up until now. Now I have spend money in order to get the more interesting content. Sadly, this app will be deleted. I am not giving Nintendo even more of my money, it is not a real Animal Crossing game to waste money on.",
        "I love playing this game, but now I can't get into the game, all I get is support error 802-9016. Don't try and tell me to move closer to the WiFi source, because I put my phone on the WiFi router and got the same thing. My wife, who is sitting next to me, gets into the game just fine. I uninstalled that game, same thing... I would love to get back into this game, and will change my first reassuring back to a 5, but until then... Yeah... Please help....",
        "First-time reviewer and life-long Animal Crossing player. This game combines everything good about the game series like fishing, but catching, gardening, decorating, and more. Therea is always an event going on to keep me playing multiple times a day. The team behind this game actually listen to what people say and fix it and add ease of play features! People saying this is pay to play are full of it. I have well over 600 leaf tickets from just playing the game... you just have to put in the time and complete challenges.",
        "I love the happy music and the relaxed vibe I get while playing this game. Easy enough for young children to learn to play, but not so infantile that an adult can't enjoy it instead. The garbled chipmunk-speak language of the animal friends is hilarious! Level progression seems fair and regular. Pay-to-play options are not necessary to have a good game experience.",
        "I would give this 5/5 across the board, as I have been playing since the November release and enjoyed every moment. Every update has made the game better, as the team listens and integrates whatever they can to make it better.  Microtransactions are ignorable, and they give leaf tickets hand over fist, besides the customizables for the campsite (foreground, midground, background) which are expensive.  Hopefully future updates brings better options.",
        "Just like the actual Animal Crossing games, but with even MORE to do! The only difference is you're a camp owner instead of a town mayor. Oh, and the fact that's it's a FREE app!   Seriously, this is a real deal AC game all squeezed into a free app. It's perfection all around if you like games like AC. They did such an amazing job on it."

        "Cool, nice improvement from MCoC. I love how the dev put Generation version of Transformers to the game specially Combiner wars and Titans Return (my recent favorite TF toylines). i hope the dev put references in the generation bots name since the movie and beast war character has reference on it.  But 1 thing is why my achievements doesn't work ??",
        "Beautiful graphics, love the collection of characters. One of the greats, definitely a must. Love the aesthetics of the maps and battles. My only complaint is my bot entering the fight already transformed unlike the cpu. I think both should enter in alt form THEN transform, if only to hear the sound lol.",
        "Much better than I thought it would be. It's an unconventional fighter to be sure but it's fun. The models in the game are amazing and somewhat bum me out they aren't being used for a more traditional 2d fighter on a thing that uses controllers. They were even able to make the Bayformers look good!  The many currencies and general in-game transactions are probably turning me off of what is otherwise a neat game. Kinda wish I could just buy it, have everything unlocked, and not have any of that garbage influence the design at all.  Besides that the team did a great job with what I imagine Hasbro told them to do.",
        "Great game good graphics nice controllers needs more characters and more unique attacks, had to edit from a 4* to a 2* star because the game is a fighting with no live action PvP mode. It's strictly a player vs ai game and that is unattractive to players who enjoy the competitive edge of a PvP fighting game. Will uninstall it gets very boring and repetitive , with out the PvP mode. Will reinstall when or if PvP ever becomes available. Me and a larger group of fighting game players will be waiting to invest in this game once PvP becomes available.",

        "The game is good but worst thing about this game is that it always needs cellular data for every fight. I have 4G network then also it keep Loading in a very slow speed. I request to the game management to give feedback on this problem."

        "Great game but you find a lot of in game duplicate hacker's which sucks because I have spent a lot of money on gems and then you got people ranking scores that are seriously not possible but they get rewarded first place ur cards so in the end, great game, awesome artwork, dedicated fanbase, childish modders/dupe hackers. Personal opinion gems are way overpriced. Once again though fantastic artwork. Thanks mynet keep updating",
        "This game is old and when it came out, it was amazing. I put so much time and money into it. Then it died, to be brought back years later without any form of revamp. The graphics are pixelated, it burns so much battery when the most animation that comes out of it is something you'd get out of a powerpoint slideshow. It's extremely glitchy and the loading is so slow. I'm so sad they re-released this to suck money out of people yet couldn't put in any effort to make the game updated and modern.",

Instead of focusing to the last server they had. When saying that the server is FULL it doesnt mean that all character here is active, when the new server is open everyone choose to  go there. What will happen to the other nation on the old server??? Some are ghost nation, coz everybody quits becoz of new server. Please fix this issues. Thank you.  Please bring back my 6000 power loss on my character on s25"

The only benefit for connecting with my Facebook account used to share to get free coins but that's minimal compared to the one she get normally and login as a guest.   And....  After all the trouble and being shorted more millions than I can count...  I guess I'm silly to think, in good faith, they would load some points for you, just to say thanks for being a player and it's their way of apologizing. After all other apps like World Series of Poker did that without hesitation.  Perhaps I'm getting frustrated to the point that I'm considering to  take my money elsewhere and unistall it.",

        "I hate to say it but what I thought at first was a cool extra is now ruining the game. It's no longer competitive on skill, it's just about how much you are willing to pay to get upgrades which negates any skill involved. It's just a money grab. If you don't pay and upgrade you lose!  Simple as that. So if you want a game with skill this is no longer it. If you want a game to empty your wallet to feed your ego then this is the game for you!",
        "Super glitchy!!! Love this game but I'm getting crazy annoyed!! Lost my lucky spins used one and it took 4 off me!!! The game has done this multiple times!! It needs to bed fixed, remove all the bloody adds.",
        "Could you guys maybe cool it with the damn ads? I can't even navigate the menus now without a 60% chance of getting a 15 second video about some crappy game with \"war\", \"clash\" or \"clans\" in the title...  Other than that, the gameplay itself is ok. Aside from maybe the lowered necessity for Tetrises because of power-ups or the annoying-ass \"some pieces are affected by gravity, but we won't point it which ones until you cause them to drop by attempting to set up your next move\" mechanic.  Seriously though, those ads after EVERY GAME NOW are cancer on toast. Knock it off.",
        "To many cheaters on the tournaments and no way to report them. Doesn't even make sense why they would cheat, it's obvious when you can watch the games. Spoils it so much for others",
        "Been playing this game for long time and am on level 191. It seems ur always gona hav and giv problems ! WHY won't it go to level 192 even tho I've cleared 191",
        "This gameplay makes Tetris way too easy. There is a swipe option for traditional feels but no one will win any tournaments or achievements with that."

        "Love the gameplay and the graphic but the reason why I'm not giving a 5 star because every time I open a \"guarantee 4star\" hero scroll, I kept getting 3 stars hero only. It didn't happen just once, twice or thrice, but it happen too many times.  I'm pretty sure this is a bug because the scroll didn't guarantee 4 star heroes.  Update: Much better",
        "At the beginning it's very intriguing. Soon it becomes tedious because it requires purchasing equipments otherwise you just can't pass. (I have 2 6star and 1 5star GuanYu all lv max, legendary equipment, still not able to pass an normal 7-3)And it's so time consuming to level your hero up 20 times an episode to level up by one, and even if you max up 3 6-star heroes, you can barely pass episode 7... the graphics and the acts are very good, though.",
        "Since the last update the game is running really slow. The hits don't register, it starts adjusting the volume settings on my phone for no reason instead of attacking. The chad feature doesn't work. I tried chatting on dozens of channels and there's no one there. No way I would pay for this game.",
        "Campaign is short but fun. PVP sucks big time. Matchmaking needs a big overhaul. It's not fun getting one hit by opponents who have super high level characters. Also the whole you have to fully beat you opponent before the timer find out or you lose is another deal breaker. Lower the HP on all charcters, fix the matchmaking, or make the timer longer because it is almost impossible to down all three characters in allotted time as a new player. I mean my characters aren't the best but definitely not the worst",
        "The graphics and gameplay is superbed,but really p2w unless ur a casual player . Grinding is tedious and u only get good stuff once a while,RNG is pretty bad but i so far have gotten 1 gold 6* character.There are also other game modes which really isnt rewarding like the boss fight that gives 100 silver LoL.Even coalition needs 200k power. not even my officer can come near 70k power. I hope the game be more generous towards f2p player,since transcendence is already almost unobtainable unless u pay to get 6* officers. i gave an extra * for the reply. i hope to see improvements in the future. This game has potential.",
        "Great. But can another (two) characters become AI? Can you add new characters in the upcoming dynasty warriors 9? And also add the collaboration of samurai warriors, orochi warriors, and others. And hold an event too. I'm bored, no events or updates.  And can you make \"skip\" for conquest. Can you add time from friend help? Time 15 seconds is too little, not including his friend attacked and bounced. I suggest it can be 30 seconds and the friend takes out the ultimate one last time.   Update : I'm bored.."

Keep playing the same level over and over until you can upgrade, play another level, then proceed to keep playing the same level again. The competitive mode is also messed up as the opponent gets scores near impossible",
        "Everything is great and good but only have one problem. And this problem will killing you all. That's the loading is damn slow no matter you are in LTE network or wifi situation. Because of slow loading it will kill your battery life fast as well. Please help to fix the problem and I will re-rate again. Thanks",
        "Even with a perfect LTE speed game struggled with downloading hunts. The game forces you to do certain hunts before you can go back to the ones you like and want to finish. Not too mention every other minute it forces you to watch an ad or tries to get you to buy something from them. I will be deleting this app once i finish posting this comment.",

        "The game currently wont open, when it does its constantly crashing and force stopping. I have the silver subscription ($1.00/weekly) and im unable to take advantage of the content im paying for  want a refund. The upgrades and new equipment are too expensive, the gear and parts are also too expensive and hard to come by especially for the spearfishing which is the best part of the game.. You certainly can't get very far without spending some real money. You can be killed by animals when the come from behind so you with your limited turning capability you have no chance to defend yourself. A lot of problems.",
        "During cts theres moments get sudden lag and it throws off the shooting causing to miss when i know aiming right. It never had these lag bits before."

        "Its pretty great overall but I dont like the fact that I cant expend anymore after level 60. Id love more space since you need to put lots of decorations for challenges . I also think there should be hearts every good bubble not just one out of 3ish. When you need 100 hearts its a long time getting them. Besides that very great game, still play it!",
        "Sadly I have decided today to uninstall this game. I've been really enjoying it but it is simply too resource hogging for me and keeps crashing. I think it needs an option to turn off animations especially when building etc.  EDIT. Since getting a newer, faster Samsung tablet the game has improved for me immeasurably. Excellent!",
        "Amazing game! Very similar to the original RC Tycoon, but a few added changes to make it more interesting. I've only encountered one major glitch where my park was erased and instead was given a friend's (I still had all coins, tickets, cards) but I had to rebuy whatever rides and buildings I had that my friends park didn't BUT they reimbursed me for it and gave me enough coins to rebuild my park (probably twice over thh). So overall a great game and great customer assistance too!",
        "Usually ill make it to level 10 in other games like, but this has been the only one that can hold my attention for so long. Just hit level 40 a figured it deserved a review! 5 stars from me! I love that you dont have to wait for anything. The missions just keep popping up regardless of how many you finish. If I didn't have any responsibilities I could literally play all day long.",
        "Awesome game! Great time- killer... Pls change so that decor and trophy bonuses apply to food and shop stores. They generate revenue just like rides do so makes no sense for them not to receive the decor bonus.  Pls change and will give 5 stars."

It is silly to invest an hour into exploring only to lose it all because of an extra click, especially when you have a bunch of telaports. When player runs out of food, options should be camp, teleport, or suicide...and suicide should NOT be clicking anywhere on the screen. Provide a button.",

You can pick the best choices and do the right attacks at the right times but still lose over half the time.  Where is the fun in that? I've defeated the council of ricks and collected most of the mortys but my odds of winning a tournament are the exact same as a level 1 player.",

Fueled by the love of Rick and Morty + Pokemon. This game speaks spritually to me.",

WELL, if you are reading this, you are either the creators or someone who wants a friend request. Send a friend request to lickmyballs24681. Get the joke in there?",

        "Screenshots made this game look amazing. But then i loaded this up, and didn't even want to finish the tutorial, (which felt never-ending) because I realized this an exact copy of Hobbits Kingdoms, which I stopped because there was never any actual battles, or  motion graphics. And all of those cool CGi characters don't play as shown in the screenshots. Deleted.",
        "In short this is the perfect pocket game. Strategy meets battles and bloodshed. You can play the game how you like, its not like clash of clans where your forced to be hostile, and it gives you a good start. Honestly, i dont understand why people dont like this game however all the bad reports seemed to be from players of the old game....",
        "Love the game. I've been playing since the realeasd of the game before it became Elves Vs Dwarves. They have done an amazing job with this game. Some things could have been better like a majority of my inventory resetting when i rejoined after the game was bought. But overall a wonderful game either way.",
        "Terrible game. In the original hobbit I was an original world 42, back in dec 2012.  Fully maxed 5 cities 100 billion might every hero in every city was min 250 some were 280. Not to mention had couple hundred mithril left in my account Plus 10s of thousands of troops to unbox.. when i went to update game the merged 6 new worlds and im back to level 1.. lmao stupid move on your end. Loyal player here now gone! Was an awesome game i loved it super fun now... seems to be a joke. Duces",
        "It's ok.. I wish they wouldn't have changed the Hobbit into this. It was a good game but I can't get into it now that they changed everything, I guess they \"stole\" or used the Lord of the rings without permission, probably copyright issues so they changed everything.. Now it's pretty lame..",
        "In server 179 one player might still 640m his troops still not cleared he still no 1 in might rank as he is a small player name . latrobio  of NOTORIOUS alliance please fix this. All others T5 troops cleared.he have lots of illigal troops of T5"
