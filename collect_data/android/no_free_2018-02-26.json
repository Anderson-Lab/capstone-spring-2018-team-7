      'I hope you take the time to read.   This game is amazing, and it just keeps getting better. I do wish you would change the video knives to apples or video. Now I have nothing to spend apples on.  But here is what i really wanted to say i really like this company and the games you put out to your users. I\'m newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me. I own alot of your games and have spent alot trying to help. I wish I had more to unlock things in time. But Thank you very much.',
       'The game sucks it\'s alwful. It\'s gliching non stop for your bad. There are ADS everywhere! Ketchapp you getting worse and worse. There are ads of stupid games everywhere. What a game maker will pay to another game to show them in ADS! That makes the game in the ad even worse. Please ketchapp I was a big fan of you but you made your games so STUPIT. PLEASE FIX YOUR GAMES!',
       'Ads interrupt gameplay and are extremely aggravating. The video that you have to watch to continue your gameplay never works. The game crashes when xp increases. I personally dislike this game, and it would be better if these issues were resolved. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this review.',
       'Deleted all my data with no reason. Had a bunch of Legendaries and Rares that have now been deleted. I put a lot of time into this game, and even bought the ad-free package. If you don\'t want a load of wasted time, don\'t download this app.  Edit- Updated the app and levelled up a bit. The game crashes every time I get a free revive. Still a massive waste of time.',
       'I really do like the game. There are two things that get to me however. Knives should all have individual names other than the boss ones. There are also alot of ads, I do understand they need to make 💰. Otherwise the game is great.',
       'I bought the remove ads purchase and it screwed me. I still get adds and i still have to watch videos to remain in the same level. I want my money back since the game is the same. DONT BUY THE REMOVE ADS PURCHASE.' ,

      'Good but £4 is a lot to not quite remove all the add. Some pictures are still locked behind and walls. Easy enough to unlock but for the price id expected all add to be removed. Also really would like the pictures to be sortable by category with more fantasy and space stuff in the complex pictures. Also there appears to be no way to sync pictures across devices. If I\'ve paid £4 I should be able to switch between the phone and tablet at will. Both are android.',
       'In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it\'s just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.',
       'I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It\'s kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.☺',
       'Awesome app, its oddly satisfying and can either be really challenging ir really easy. Its constantly update with new pictures to do, and already contains probably hundreds lol, if dont 75+ and in saving the really detailed ones for last. If there even is such a thing. But, i think a counter for how many blocks of each color are left would be a really awesome alteration. There are many strategies to use when you do a color by number. So a counter for how many blocks of the selected number are left, it would be such a life save.this game has taken enough of my life already as is lmao',
       'This game is an entertaining and super relaxing way to spend time. New pictures are added every day, and there is a large selection of different things to color. I really like this app, and think at deserves five stars. To whoever is making the art on this app, it is really beautiful. If you are reading my review, (Wich you probably aren\'t) I think it would be really cool if you did some pictures from popular books and movies.',
       'This is the best free colouring by numbers app out there however some changes need to be made to make it perfect.  Mainly being able to register and log in and out would be amazing in order to save your progress within the app.  One word of warning - do not move the app from your device onto an SD card or any other external memory because it will treat it as a fresh install and you will lose all your completed works! I learned this the hard way and I\'m rather gutted about it.' ,

Finally reached legendary 32, I\'ve unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so. Or at least a new adventure spot. Making a modded version of the rally car would be fantastic. Also, an upgrade on the formula car where it doesn\'t almost dead stop after it lands from a big air.',
       'If you don\'t want to give away free stuff from the chests, don\'t. But stop wasting my damn giving me these "free" coins for watching a video only to have the ad freeze %95 of the time. The are plenty of other free games out there, might be time for a change.',
       'Superb game! Too bad, the elements of hate like to hack good things and cause frustrations. For this reason, constantly run constant updates. I wouldn\'t mind paying through my rather expensive data to diffuse the damage by these bored, small prick nincompoops! Africa😝😝😝',
       'How can an offline mode still glitch?!?! I can\'t believe it. It\'s like I\'m playing with 512mg ram on dial up internet. This is ridiculous. How does this happen? Do your job, and when you release a game or an update, make it work!',
       'Alot of fun but needs new maps and vehicles. Wayyy overdue for some new stuff.  Update: since the latest update I was very disappointed to see that they nerfed the magnet. Still waiting to see new maps and vehicles',
       'Good game, some of the challenges are impossible to play well because players vehicles are doing impossible things. The jump buttons/boost don\'t work very well on my phone so it\'s impossible to do anything in the challenges.' ,

      'Love it! It just needs some adjustments. Too many levels that are way too hard, that takes you 50 tries to beat when you only have 5 lives in the first place. And it should only be beat one level to unlock one task instead of needed to beat two levels to unlock one task. If it\'s going to take 2 stars to unlock a task it should be something big not 2 stars for unlocking a task for cleaning up a little mess!',
       'The concept of this game is pretty cool and it is addicting Until you realize that the Candy Crush part of it is way too hard way too early. It basically forces you to make you want to pay for it. I would never pay money for Candy Crush or this game. But if I\'m still in the first room of that huge ass mansion and I can\'t even pass one of the levels, that\'s ridiculous. I am glad that there is an idea out there other than the Candy Crush concept, but this is way too hard. And I am in the 400 Something level of Candy Crush. Good luck, I\'m deleting this app',
       'Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it\'s advertised too much, but it\'s definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That\'s slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.',
       'Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I\'ll be playing this for a long time! I\'m working on the living room right now, getting close to level 600. Can\'t wait to see what the new character, Jerry, has in store for us! Thank you Playrix!',
       'I really like this Game so Far. I will play for awhile to See how it Works & If I like it. Absolutely Love Your Game. Play it ALL THE TIME!!! I Must Admit that I Really Do enjoy this Game! Sometimes I find myself Having a Hard Time With Certain Levels. I Could be On that Level for Days or a Few Weeks. I think with Some Improvement that Would make People Play. This Game More. But I Must Say Hat\'s Off to The Developers',
       'I loved the game until the last update. Until then, I found it relaxing and challenging. Since the recent update it\'s just aggravating.  The boosters don\'t act upon the same set of rules since the update. I\'ve been on the same level for nearly a week. I\'m on 280, and looking at the number of tasks coming up makes me feel that I will likely uninstall rather than spend my entire life playing. I wish Playtrix would go back to the older version.' ,

      'I love this game!  It\'s challenging yet not too complicated.  With some games it gets so difficult to play the higher you go and very dew helps are offered for free. This game is still fun and challenging but the levels are not impossible to beat. They also offer ways to earn helpful tools to assist in beating the levels.  The community is great also. You are able to request and give extra lives to one another very simply with minimal interaction Try it and see for yourself!',
       'At first, this is a fun little puzzle game. The levels are entertaining and simply addicting. But... This game takes quite a turn. I can\'t say for sure when it began, but I\'m on level 85 and it has become hilariously impossible to proceed. The levels become so ridiculously difficult that you need to spend real money to move forward. In other words, simple fun levels to get you hooked, followed by insanely difficult level to get you to pay. Over all, fun for the first 20 - 40 levels. Enjoy it while it lasts.',
       'Very fun and entertaining. I really like slow paced relaxing games and this is just that. There is no time limit so you can play at your own pace. Also there is minimal ads for a free game which is part of what makes this game so great. Such a great game for killing some time in a waiting room or just sitting at home trying to pass the time. This game truly deserves 5 stars. I love it!',
       'This game is great until you reach the upper levels. At that point, like most games, it requires purchases of boosters in order to progress. It\'s addicting, but I refuse to spend a fortune on games. I guess I\'m old-fashioned that way. ;) I suppose I\'ll take my bag of quarters and go elsewhere.',
       'I do enjoy this game but certain levels don\'t give you enough moves to complete the level. The ones you have to match the cubes with the colors makes it impossible to pass when the game doesn\'t give you moves to do so. You waste your moves on areas that doesn\'t give you the opportunity to pass the level and then you don\'t have any moves left before it does give you the moves you need it does get frustrating you get stuck on that level and can\'t pass it. Which will just make you want to unistall the game cause you will never leave that level.',
       'This game is great. I like blasting all the cubes. It reminds me of Super Collapse From back in the day. It is a cute game, with cute graphics and characters. Although I might not play it too much because it doesn\'t require enough thought, it\'s definitely something to play when I feel like relaxing.' ,

      'I love this game and would have rated it a 5 but suddenly the pause feature isn\'t working and I lost a game that was over 8000 points because I had a phone call. After I unpaused it set me back to zero. So aggravating. Also the 30 second ad for 30 stars doesn\'t show up anymore. Not sure what happened to this game in the last 2 weeks.',
       'This used to be an awesome game. I played it every day! But after the latest update, the ads at the top cause the game to lag terribly and make the ball fall very slowly and the pieces disappear slowly.  I can\'t adjust as needed due to the lag. I\'m unable to play due to this lag. Interestingly enough, when I turn on Airplane Mode thereby disabling the ads across the top, everything runs smoothly like it used to!! I am all for ads to support the developers  but this type they currently have causes severe lag which has rendered the game useless.',
       'I have paid £2.99 to remove ads and in still getting them. I emailed the developer two weeks ago and have still not had a response. You are forced to watch ads so often the game becomes unplayable and paying the money to remove them does not work. Save your time and do not bother even installing it. If you do install it do not pay the money to remove ads as it does not work!!!',
       'There are way too many advertisements every time I start a game or lose or win a game I instantly get an 30 second ad which I have to waste my time on to skip it until I am finally done. Overall except for the advertisements it is a great game controls and game play is brilliant I recommend this game but you will get a lot of ads. Suggestion: Lower the amount of ads showen',
       'Sadly, it could\'ve been a fun game if I could actually tap where I wanted to. The tap is off by like a few mm or something. I have to tap above the try again button to actually try again, or else I end up hitting challenges... So during the game play the exact same thing would happen, which makes the game unplayable.',
       'I love it but ever since I installed it ads kept popping up all over my phone. I don\'t know if it was because of this app. I want to uninstall to see if that\'s it but it\'s really addictive and fun.' ,

      'Quite Addictive. Played nonstop 6/7 hours and unlocked 40%. what u just need is time behind it. There\'s a rule of Fibonaceae in mathematics and if u follow the rule in the game you will make it in the minimum time. But the amount making system is quite sick. U don\'t  need that critical numeric use of currency just keep it low in the gameplay. Otherwise the game is good.',
       'Gave 2 stars more than last time...  Now i have all the mines but i think that i will delete this game..... Too much frustrating because of the instability of the game.... The game always shut down either i\'m watching an ad or just upgrading my miners.... When it happens on an ad it\'s thw worst!!!! sometimesi have to redo the same boosting to 3-4 times until it works once... So instead of losing 30-45 sec of my life for a game a lose 3 minutes in all!!!!',
       'I like this game a lot. There was a problem with one particular ad causing the game to have to be restarted, but they seem to have gotten rid of it.  Developer responded to my unhappiness.  Isn\'t that a good Developer? I think so.  Their game, Idle Factory Tycoon is really good also.',
       'The game doesn\'t keep cloud saved data.  Had this game linked to Google and Facebook. My phone broke and it took me awhile to get a new one and now that I\'m on my new phone went to download this game and I\'m having to start all over.  Thanks for all those months deleted. Won\'t be playing this again.',
       'Well although I like the game, I have to give such a low rating, due to the prices. I think the devs used the wrong currency. Otherwise it\'s hard to explain prices over 20€ for 1 chest or a boost for only a few hours. But that\'s the games we have to deal nowadays. Do nothing and pay a fortune for it.',
       'Game is fun but after opening 3 mines and prestiged 1, I mean it\'s always the same. They don\'t give tool for kickstarting mines when you start over. Its kind of boring to start over thousand times. So game is fun but gets boring quickly to me.' ,

Not that it happens often, but when you\'ve spent 50 diamonds for a one hour key and you lose 3 to 4 minutes  getting back in the game it sucks. How can your game allow this to happen !!! At least design a way to return the time lost to the player. Thank you.',

      'Once an ad on an app tries to trick me with a fake virus warning I\'m done with. Even without the fake virus warnings the ads do not give you a chance to say yes or no, you are taken straight to a site the Google Store. I find this extremely rude',
       'I really like the game itself but just now I after hitting the "Get Coins" button a webpage opened up and redirected a bunch of times then I got one of the fake google error pop ups about a "dangerous virus" that i needed to "click the link below NOW". So users please be careful, it looks like the apps advertising partners might be a little dangerous.',
       'Everytime it glitches when I touch it you guys really need to get the glitching under control I\'ve downloaded it so many times to get the glitcheing to stop but it will not work so please work on it and if you don\'t I\'m going to uninstall this app because I\'ve never had any problems with my phone or my apps so please work on it. Love you all! Morgan ps it just did it again I\'m deleting it if you run sausage run crew arnt going to fix it. Love you all!Morgan',
       'This game is fantastic! The style, sounds, and music set a fun and cartoon-ish tone, and the gameplay adds a sense of tension and suspense as the player does not know what the next obstacle will be and cannot stop the character completely as the sausage continues to walk onward. This game is fun to play and hilarious (specifically the sausage\'s dying cries/animations), and the obstacles aren\'t predictable, but the pace is initially too slow, making the game a bit boring at the beginning. I would like to see a game mode that increases the pace right from the start, like a speed mode, and new dying cries/animations and obstacles in future updates. However, as the game is right now, it\'s a lot of fun. Definitely recommend.',
       'I PAID $4.99 for NO ADS, and it\'s still playing ads when I die! 😠 fix this issue or I want my money back. I love this game, but if I can\'t play without ads Every time I did, I don\'t want it. I want to be able to do recordings of me playing. But the recordings stop when the ads start!!',
       'Love this game to bits the animations are perfect and when you die you just want to get further and further until you die again. Also love challenging my friends on it to see who can get the highest score. Entertaining addicting and a lot of raging fun' ,

      'So nice to sit and enjoy a game of challenge. Almost as much fun as chess, but easier to carry. Great way to relax while waiting for the zombie apocalypse or the bus to come. Thank-you and keep up the awesome work.  *UPDATE* 17 FEB 2018.  Have started my friends and family trying to get Top Score. No one is really trying as they are all enjoying playing the app to care. Brought a tear to my eye. Once again, "Thank-you"  for a truly  wonderful game.',
       'Simple tile game with a nice learning curve. Easy enough to be able to relax while playing and challenging enough to not be boring.  Instant gratification for finishing levels, packs, and difficulty ratings.  There are \'rolling points\' that I haven\'t figured out the use for yet. Coins to purchase hints and other stuff. The ball can have different \'skins\' that you unlock as you complete grpups of packs.  TLDR?  I\'m having fun. Maybe you can too.',
       'Great game. Starts easy so you can get your eye in and then gets harder. Fun to play and not so difficult that you give up and uninstal. Ads are over fairly quickly and I like that you can choose to watch some to get extra coins.',
       'This game is awesome,  a great puzzle game. I only had it for about 3 weeks and already on pacgage 20 level 10 on expert. I  will have the game beat in a few days. Thanks for amazing game.',

      'Awesome Game!! Really I like this game. I dont even have words to describe it. Totally Fantastic... Whatever you say, this is totally cool. But I have a request...please add a column of legendary bikes. Like there is Common, Rares, Epics, and Specials , there should be a column of legendary. Waiting eagerly for the next update. Thanks a lot of making this fabulous game. And I would also like to appreciate the colours and graphics of this game. Thanks to the team for making this game. I advice this game to those who are looking for cool new games. Please install it and have FUN!!!! Dont just look at the pics, install and you\'ll be amazed.',
       'Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death',
       'Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won\'t register your flips. These aren\'t huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.',
       'Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I\'ll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.',
       'This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can\'t seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn\'t be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it\'s not something you have to add, it\'s just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven\'t seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it\'s an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘',
       'This game would be great if it wasn\'t so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn\'t slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.' ,

       'I would rate 5 stars if you add more levels cause its a bit too short and if you make it more challenging This game is great and if you add more powerups and upgrade the heroes\' speed or something and maybe should add fighting villains',

       'Its great and all,  but it still have a thing I hate most---the way to get robux. Not every people can buy those robux, so why don\'t just complete quests to get robux instead,wouldn\'t it be better. It might not only attract person to play this game often but also get robux more easily...',
       'It\'s a awsome game I like it.but I am a chrome book user u have knocked people with chrome books out. 1.st the controls. apparently, on Chromebook to roblox you go backwards instead of forward and forward instead of backwards. and the rotate you camra it walks that way. 2.nd aswell, you can not see your mouse when your moving it. and if you hold your moving keys then let go apparently, it moves on it\'s own? I haven\'t play roblox since 2 months and 1 week . please fix this I love roblox and if you fix this it will be full rating from me',
       'I Feel Like its so unfair that we need to pay for robux at least make robux free so children like me can play  heres an idea: when you play a game you will get 10 robux. Please accept my suggestion because everybody in Roblox have been calling me a noob and being mean to me thanks.',

      'To everyone complaining about the ads, quit being so cheap and give the $2.49 to buy the game and remove them. Once the ads are removed, it\'s addictive and fun to keep getting the ball further. Fun concept and well executed. I\'ve already gotten more than my $2.49 worth of fun out of this game, and continue to play it.',
       'This game seems like it could be a great time waster... If it weren\'t for the whole crashing after every round when it tries to load an ad or when you try to watch an ad to upgrade something for free. I see nothing wrong with having these ads here.... As long as they don\'t affect app stability',
       'It\'s ok...not something I am going to keep. Good for like 5 min then the adds getting a bit much after every other at bat. I understand making revenue but a bit much after 1 or 2 hits. Plus I don\'t know if it was my device but the only sound I got from this game was the adds. No hit sounds or music or even hearing the sound of the ball hitting anything. Good concept, could have been designed and presented better.',
       'Way too many adds. The game its self looks rather fun. But after 5 minutes in the game, and spending 3  minutes of them watching ads it was time to delete. I have no issues in watching a couple of ads to help the developers, but this was way over the top. Other than the ad frequency though, looks like it could be fun.',
       'It\'s ok. The game is fun, but they didn\'t give it any substance. I\'m not a developer yet I see so many missed opportunities. Would be better if you could get powerups, say to make the ball really bouncy. Another thing is houses. I don\'t think you can break windows with the ball. That\'s disappointing. You should be able to and get some sort of bonus. Fun little idea, but lacks real substance. Also way too many ads christ',
       'I really love the game but the game needs some more optimisation because it eats a lot of battery. Also the game needs some sound effects and more options challenges so players don\'t get bored of it. When everyone reaches the last bat they might delete the game because is nothing else to do. So more updates and more stuff added to the game. Great work until now. Keep it up VOODOO!!!!' ,

      'Sometimes it makes no sense. You are coming from quailication as 7th, you jump to 2nd position so surely you cant finish worse than 8th? WRONG. You end up on 16th place which is impossible. There is no in between you either win or you finish 14th or lower. You have 30 pts lead in front of number 2. after 1st round, you slightly fail your 2nd jump, guess what? 18th place for you! If you jump for example 120m on a K90 in Q, you finish first because everyone jumped 20m less, sudennly in 1st round you need 130m to secure your first place because everone managed to jump extra 30m. All in all fun, but still needs a lot.',

      'I spent 3 consecutive days grinding to get most of the skins. I start liking the game, so I decide to pay for the premium version to support the devs. But ads are still showing so I decide to reinstall the app to see if that fixes the issue. After reinstalling, I have lost all my progress (skins) and 3€ because ads are still showing. Hehe xd  Edit: I had to ask Google for a refund and I got it immediately. If you want to know how I did it, just search for "Google Play Refund" in your browser.',
       'Love it! I play it all the time! You can play online or offline - online gives you a chance to revive. Has course like game play or continuous. No pause which is understandable but kinda sucks. Once you get the hang of the controls it becomes  addicting. Would like to see more land and background options... maybe on the next update??',
       'Entirely too many ads.  Look I understand as a free app you have put time into this and some money back is nice.  But this is way over board with the ads. The game is fun, easy, and plays well. However it\'s not worth paying to remove ads. Ads are a necessary thing if you are looking looking to make money from your creation, however this mean is just ignorance and the main reason I uninstalled.',
       'Holy Ads Batman!  This is ridiculously too much.  It\'s a fun game but it heats up my Google Pixel XL insanely hot too.  Can\'t play for long.  And you pay for no Ads and you still get the ads between games??  I PAID FOR NO ADS.  NO ADS doesn\'t equal SOME ADS',
       'A good concept, I love the gameplay and have a highscore of 589. But the ads are way too common, it\'s always a 30 second or 15 second ad after every death; It\'s like our motivation to keep the ball going is just so we don\'t have to watch an ad. Plus, sound would be good to add for Dune.',
       'It\'s a really fun and Addicting game for when your bored, and best part is... IT DON\'T NEED WIFI AND IT\'S FREE WOOO and there\'s not many ads, witch I think we can all be happy about. Sure there is a few ads here and there but nothing none of us can\'t handle, 😇😇😇' ,

      'I have seen this as an ad. I thought I should give it a try. It worked out. Before long, I reached level 15. Now I\'m on level 32 and I have 1.092 aa gold! I automated 100% of my farm!  I\'m already making lots of gold with automating potatoes. Potatoes give away so much gold! Good update.  Keep up the good work. Thanks, Idle Farming Empire. What a good replacement for Farm Away.  Idle Farming Empire is like the best simulation for farming. I gave the game 4 stars for a reason. I liked the game! Look under the review! There\'re many people rating the game 5 stars. It should really be rated 4 stars.  Over 97,800 people rated 4 and 5 stars. I like this game. Thanks for everything.',
       'This "game" is like empty calories. I ingested it ate it up and left hungry.  There is no goal whatsoever to this game. It is a glorified add campaign intended to keep you going on and on with a false feeling of accomplishment in order push ads on you or make you buy perks. Want to double your earnings for 20 seconds? Watch a 30 second ad. Want to improve earnings for four hours. Watch an ad. You get the point. Of course you can buy these perks but why do any of this? The "game" never really does anything whatsoever. No milestones, no real goals, no anything. Well after about 3 hours of game time and the equivalent of add watching time I am off to ingest something with more substance.',
       'AMAZING! I love this game. It is so addicting and a great way to pass time and boredom. I think though for one small improvement you could add a thing where there are like \'mini games\' and you earn coins for that. Using those coins earend in the mini games you spend it on things like watering cans, fences for live stock and more! This was only some suggestions for a bigger game if you can have or make a new game called like farm life or something like that....LOVE IT...',
       'I LOVE THIS GAMEE!! It\'s so addicting and once u get used to it, u can\'t stop playing it! It\'s a great time killer and it auto saves (not of u connected to Facebook.) Again, I love this game and I would recommend this game to EVERYONE because it\'s for all ages (unless u are a very serious person) JK LOL! :D',
       'OK, I love Idle clickers and this is a great game in this genre. Easy to get into, ads not forced on you, nice graphics.  There is one thing that is really bugging me though. You start out with your standard 9 crops and you can then unlock more for each plot. My issue is it does not tell you when you unlock a new one if it earns more than the standard one. Do they just look different but earn the same? Apart from this... Love it. Keep up good work devs',
       'Like so far But, 2 issues. 1- I don\'t Facebook or do any social media so needs to be a way other than ads for those bonuses. 2- daily rewards Don\'t happen. Shows that they were collected but will not activate unless I have enough diamonds. Please fix. Play offline on tablet and hotspot to get daily reward.' ,

      'The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn\'t make it better at controlling. I don\'t know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌',
       'this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It\'s so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It\'s just so addicting and I can\'t get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the \'play online\' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊',
       'I\'ve recently upgraded from cubot to galaxy s7 and unfortunately the game is not working properly like it did on the old cubot phone. The screen gets stopping and it\'s impossible to play. I\'ve tried uninstalling and changing Wi-Fi settings but nothing worked. Other than that the game is sick! Love it,my kids love it and it\'s fun to play.',
       'So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I\'ll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It\'s in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I\'ve ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍',
       'Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃',
       'I\'m highly addicted to this game. It\'s a thousand times better then agar.io in my opinion and it\'s really cool that you get to create your own skin. The only downer is that I just wish there was some music because you start to get a bit bored after a while.This game is NOT a waste of time, and everyone needs to download it to experience the awesomeness!' ,

      'I think I should make this game my favourite game and I could make the best high score of 2000. And thank you so so so so much.But I saw one mistake you were making that was if a player just tap a white tile you would make it out . So don\'t make the player out. Give it at least 5 chances. So that he can make his or her best high score. Please try to make it more interesting . And also when we reach higher you make it faster and faster. Otherwise this game is the best of all games.',

      'Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!',
       'Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm\'s Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!',
       'Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I\'m just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it\'s going to be good.  We\'ll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!',
       'This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10',
       'I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.',
       'Don\'t get me wrong, these new levels and songs are fun and addictive and all of the new stuff is awesome... but stop making new apps? Why not just update the original? It\'s kind of frustrating to have a paid version with stuff I\'ve unlocked but have to deal with an unpaid version (aka, ads) and have to unlock skins and colors all over again because new apps keep being made.' ,

      'Definitely not worth it. Was fun at first, but after the updated quests, the game took a serious nosedive in quality. Now you HAVE to beat the opponent in order to get anything, otherwise you\'re out 1000 gold. Before, you would get something just for playing. The new PvP just sucks.',
       'Pretty decent game, shame you need to pay gems for the second last ship. The PvP is fun but half the time reduces my gold when I win. Cannot see the devs replying to any messages so unsure if they care',
       'The forced ads are so frequent and annoying. Pvp either freezes and steals your coins or you win and lose coins. Probably over 100,000 coins lost this way. Game has potential and is fun, but company took this fun game and made it not worth playing',
       'WAY TOO MANY ADS. PvP matching is terrible. The disparity in ship level, ship strength and player level/experience is also terrible. It is a P2W (pay to win) game. ther than that, I enjoyed it.',
       'Multiplayer locks up every 2nd or 3rd game during the connection process causing you to lose your coins or diamonds without ever playing.  If you get the option to leave the game waiting for the other person to connect, the next game will be your ship frozen in the middle of the screen and you never get an option to leave without starting and the app must be closed and restarted to do anything.',

      'Great timewaster! There are a lot of characters to earn and you don\'t need to spend real money to get them, so that\'s a plus. However, rated it a 3 cuz there are sooooo many ads. I get that ads generate the revenue to keep a good game free but an ad populates for literally every action. Win a game=ad, lose a game=ad, go to the settings=ad, change the volume=ad... ok the last one is fictitious but it really seems like that\'s how it works',
       'Love the game, its fun, addictive, and challenging. It makes you actually think before you do anything. The ads really are a bit much, being that after every single round in a tournament there is one. Also, one major thing, keep up with the updates. IOS users seems to have gotten an update with new characters and pvp mode even but not android',
       'The game is simple to immediately start playing and fun. I shouldn\'t rate a game based off of this but, these pop up adds are tremendously common. Adds are essential so that the app can support itself but to have an add after every single play and then have an add to open a chest? Really? That\'s a bit much, especially, when the adds are not easily skippable and even force you to the download screen of the add. The game is simple, fun, and has witty, silly, and quirky characters. But the adds are a bit much.',
       'Me and my son have had fun with this game and made an attempt to collect all characters. The game is set up so you can not earn all of the characters but have to buy the last couple in a cash grab. It would be fine if they we\'re only available for real money but the game gives the illusion that you can win them in a chest. One that we have spun over 50 times without success',
       'The game itself is enjoyable and the controls are quite simple. Very intuitive. But Jesus Christ on a frosty log, the ads are way to much. After every round, ad, want your prize? Ad. Wanna do anything in the game? Enjoy the ad. Jesus guys, I don\'t mind ads and I understand that\'s how you make money, but you shouldn\'t have to watch an ad to get your prize for winning... Come on.',
       'Everything else is great, EXCEPT the amount of ads... I love the game, but I don\'t want to keep turning on and off airplane mode so I can actually enjoy it.  Edit: there are ads after I go into settings and more information, which doesn\'t leave the app!? Seriously? And the "messages" are all more ads for other apps too, lol. Bro calm down with the ads. This is why I\'m now uninstalling.' ,

      'I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It\'s pricey but we\'ll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn\'t need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get',
       'It would be nice for updated casino with new slot machine games and also some new restaurants.  Last one was quite sometime ago?  Are you still actively developing the game or you called it quits like some other games I had to uninstall because there was nothing left to do in them.  Just curious.....',
       'I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.',
       'This game is a bit boring at first since it is really hard to serve your burgers because they take ages to cook.  I, after 1 day,  got totally addicted to it as it gets really fun and especially when it lets you purchase the automatic cooker for just 10 gems it is easy and cool! You will see what I mean when you hopefully download the app as I would definitely recommend it! Thank you for making a fun, addictive app that I enjoy. 😄',
       'Omg I have just realised that it was 1 year ago since I wrote that! So I\'m going to write a new one!. I love this game so much it has such good graphics and I recommend this game for any age I am addicted to this game and I think that you should definitely get it. It is a great game and I love it! So what are you waiting for go ahead and download it right now!',
       'Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn\'t need to have the internet on. Don\'t know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.' ,

      'The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won\'t annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie',
       'Its a legit fun game to play but...  For me I get streshed because when I need to do it over again then u  streshed by not doing it...    Its still kind of a good game though..  Also on YT thanks for...   !!!! 2 SUBSCRIBERS!!!!  I know its not alot but I am rlly happy and I\'m thankfully to who subscribed to me on YT :)  My name was galaxy DJ but now..  Its AngelPlayz I haven\'t even uploaded any videos yet 😂😂 but thanks for the support!  I might be making new videos about roleplays bloxburg builds and games to enturtain u guys to not be bored!!   I LIKE TACCCCOOOOSSSSSSSSS.....  🍍🍍🍍 .. This is so long lol...   Sorry how this is so long 😂😂😂😂 Well yeah that\'s all I got to say..!!?  Cya peace GUYS🍍🍍',
       'Well, I admit, I\'m addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn\'t be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can\'t Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍',
       'It\'s a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it\'s super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.',
       'So rage inducing! But i am a comete noob at your amazing creations. When o first downloaded it 3 yrs ago i hated it a deleyed after failing the first level before getting halfway. Some how though my abillity for rage cam control itself and yea. So in a way you made a rage game that helped my rage. Huh. Anyways great game might buy full version. Only if i can become a good player though',
       'Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it\'s fun because it\'s challenging and there\'s super fun things in GD except hacking because that\'s no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I\'m super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂' ,

      'Whatever update you made to this game just made it suck more than it use to be. Graphics very bad like watching negative image,  someone can\'t change to another easily even at the end of the week as you so stipulated , The ads keep on stalking and crashing the game Unnecessary difficult missions, for what??? And many more.  For crying out loud, this should be a fun game, something to ease stress not cause one. Not to mention if you install it to a new device and login with your fb id, you can\'t start from where you stopped with your achievements Its becoming not-fun-anymore.',

You really should get it if you like really fun running game because this is the best one in the world . PLEASE GET IT RIGHT KNOW IF YOU DON\'T YOU\'LL REGRET IT .....just do yourself a little favor😋😂😛😜😝😎😄',

      'So I played it on my iPhone e and loved it. Recently o got a new phone and it\'s am android. I connected to my Nintendo account and loaded it up. My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I\'m not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr',
       'Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I\'m paying £9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn\'t make it worth the price being asked.',
       'I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',
       'This would have got 5 stars had I been able to share it with my 2 kids via family share. I refuse to pay £30 for all 3 of us to have access to all the levels.  Great game though. Fun, quick and easy to play. Many hours spent between us. So many levels too.',
       'Super Mario run is a great smartphone game it has the very addicting toad rally and remix ten and the simple, but very rewarding controls. The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars',
       'I beat world 1, and I have to pay for the rest of the game? Really? This is stupid.. If you\'re going to have a game you need to pay for, market it as such, not the ol bait and switch. Very deceitful.. At least make a trial game or demo game not lure someone in and then tell them they need to pay to finish the game' ,

      'Good graphics but the character movements are clunky.  I\'m a hardcore FPS gamer and I like to test the limitations of a game.  So tried shooting a shoulder and the bullet went for a headshot instead whereas I clearly know my aim would miss. Glitchy.  Clunky and not so realistic unfortunately.  So not sure why the high ratings.',
       'Still full of annoying bugs. The worst game I ever played. Earnings are exactly layed out so that you can\'t level up as you should and in a way that you should spend a lot of money... 👎 Graphic & other bugs, really not fluid etc. 👎 Full of annoying ads 👎 Some can shoot through walls; but you can\'t. Some can see you behind walls, but you can\'t. Starting pvp, you get placed on the map with the back to the others. Your oponents have 10x stronger weapons... Fairplay 👎 Nothing is balanced fairly in pvp 👎',
       'The latest version is so annoying. On the sniper arena, my men get killed immidiatly at the end of the countdown to begin. If i even shoot any sniper he wont die rather it will finish it shoutout and then turn to my soldier and kill it. I hate now i hate d game. Please do something about it.',
       'This was a fun game at first until I got to a mission that is impossible to complete. I have the Target directly in my crosshairs and my shots go right through him. The hint only tells me he\'s too far away but he never gets closer. Also the price for premium is ridiculous. Uninstalling.',
       'Yeah man cool game, however we must ask ourselves if weed is a gateway drug maybe shooting games are a gateway to more sinister things but no one give a hoot about it hahahaha I like playing games. Hi, 5 stars. Food next 2',
       'Is game could be so much more than it is! After a few weeks, PVP becomes a joke when you are up against paying users who have one shot kill guns and a barrage of armour.  Then single player is just rinse and repeat over and over again.' ,

      'Since no one reads 5 star reviews I figured I would rate as 1. Great time killer during those boring meetings or occasional bouts of constipation. Want to take a break from your mind numbing job? This is equally mind numbing....but hey, play on your bosses time. When you see a picture you can\'t figure out, lower your mental ability to where it makes an amoeba seem like Einstein......from there you will get every puzzle. Enjoy',
       'Really fun game! Just a couple of itsy bitsy things that get on my nerves. The coins you win are miniscule compared with how many you need when you use the Help function (even bumping it up to 5 coins for each correct answer would be better) & the other thing...I get that you need ads to keep these games free but does there need to be an ad after EVERY SINGLE PUZZLE??',
       'It\'s ok, I wish the words were harder. The pop ups are far less than many other apps and I like games like this, even more so when they are challenging. I give it 3 stars.',
       'Ads, ads, and more annoying Ada that can only be removed by using "coin". While I have no issue paying for apps or occasional chunks of content, this was annoying AF. I also didn\'t find it particularly challenging.',

      'One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.',
       'I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That\'s why if I\'m going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.',
       'Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn\'t get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.',
       'Hi Hay Day Creators! I personally love this game, it\'s very relaxing and a nice way to kill time and does not use a lot of data. However I am having issues with watching the trailers to getting free stuff, I have an android operating system and I\'m not the only one having this issue, please fix this.',

       'I really enjoy playing this game however you can only play it for short amount of times as everything takes for ever to cook or grow. Another thing I dislike about this game is that you rarely receive diamonds and you need them for quite a lot of things. Other than that I really like this game a day all of the animals and characters are very cute!' ,

      'My ONLY issue is we have a Pirate, Wizard, & knight "hat", but NO clothes to go with it. Can we PLEASE get those outfits made available?? I\'ve been playing for over 10 YEARS now (I believe) & it\'s been like this since DAY ONE. Also, I\'d LOVE more furniture options. It would be cool if we had a new set for each room for every 100 levels reached. 100, 200, 300, etc bc it\'d keep players having a goal to attain & it\'d make us thrive to achieve it!!! Besides keeping us interested, we LOVE a strong variety & set of options. It rewards us, if we have the ability to purchase it, & we play for reward. Just a thought that I hope you STRONGLY consider & follow through with.  I\'d give 5 stars across the board if these changes were made. THANK YOU!!!',
       'Okay heres the thing,every f game is with money and this game was so much better without those money,i was 1000 lvl and my tom is gone why? Cuz u didnt made that feature back in the days,also u made this stupid diamonds alll for money,and not coins like it was...its not all about money get it? This game was so popularbback in the days and now is trash with all those videos to watch all those money you need to spend on clothes for tom...its ridiculus...sry for my english im just disapointed cuz u turned this game in real money not coins where you can be able to buy everything by playing like i did....',
       'Used to play on another phone couldnt download to new one so had to start again. Game keeps freezing and sick of pop ups that wont go and i have to close game to get rid of them. Annoying',
       'Not good for little ones. Too many buttons leading ads or in app purchases. Might be good for kids 6+ who would know a little better but my 3 year old just clicks everything shiny which of course is ads or in app purchases',
       'The newest update is terrible with "to open chests". I must stop every game right after I got a key of four. Then, I can\'t play with my favorite, because Tom is sleeping. Also, it is very bad, the new chests opportunities starts not at midnight like before, but late afternoon (my friend\'s starts 11am) - ridiculous. I reached 99 - can I get back the old version? I don\'t care any firefighter cloth.',
       'What is wrong with this app,, I\'ve had it for over two years now and never had a problem, for the last few weeks it\'s freezing, closes and not to mention the fake virus that constantly pops up and won\'t go away no matter what I do, even though I have anti virus, I even uninstalled talking Tom (virus was gone too) I then reinstall a week later and even the virus came back with it. It\'s very upsetting since I loved this game????!' ,

      'Ok.....we need an aquarium just for the holiday\'s.  I cleaned out one aquarium and that\'s all I have in there is the holidays.  After this session I\'ll probably save one just for Christmas itself.  Love the unlimited times! Keep the surprises coming!! I don\'t like so many clocks in one game and the "timed" games are insane! It is definitely challenging.  I play several times a day if possible.',
       'Great game but would love it more if it kept track of when you bought something . Like a little quantity number in the corner after you purchase a fish or decorations. Hard to save up to buy things for guests, sucks when you buy something you already have when trying to complete a task. Other then that it\'s a great game lol I enjoy playing it.',
       'Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I\'m 32 and play this often so it\'s not just for kids . Give it a try it\'s very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen 😉',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.',
       'Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can\'t do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!',
       'I dont think we should have to buy diamonds that are ours already. The decorations are too exspensive and it looks like I, along with a few other players will be uninstalling Fishdom bc you guys are just con artist. We are hard working, good ppl that shouldnt have to buy the "bank" that is ours to begin with. Yall really nd to fix this before everyone stops playing' ,

      'Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don\'t like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option',
       'It\'s fun. It\'s actually more informative that I thought it would be. It kind of opens up you mind and is an amazing pass time stimulate. However I feel it would be more beneficial in and educational sense if you had more of an opportunity to review the answer list through the app. It\'s actually something I look forward to when the round is over.  So you\'re not just learning something from what you and your challenger have contributed as far as answers, but the game itself has also done it\'s part. Other than that, totally awesome.',
       'Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it\'s good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can\'t take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren\'t recognised either. I\'d enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.',

Lovee It!',
       'This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!',
       'Great game. Really fun buy id love to be able to play without having to wait for someone to challenge me or vice versa. A single player option would be fun. Also i payed 3.69$ to have no ads but i sometimes still grt the very long ad videos which i find a little annoying since i payed for no ads... But other then that great game 😊' ,

      'This would totally be worth 5 stars if it weren\'t for the ADS. I get it\'s a free game, but its one thing to put an ad on the top or side of the screen. It\'s one thing to optionally watch ads for coins and prizes. But its another thing when full screen videos pop-up, pausing your game and wasting your time. I was honestly thinking about giving this 3 stars just b/c of how annoying that is alone.',
       'This is the best game in the UK,it\'s like in real life.It is amazing. Don\'t listen to people who say that it\'s boring and it\'s a waste of time.Be normle(Ackt the same).Best game I\'ve ever played!',

      'I think this game is brilliant. An absolute pleasure to play and I never get bored. This game should be voted one of the best games ever. Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can\'t join my sister and were only five levels apart.',
       'It\'s fun because I  git to play with school friends, and the gaming is amazing so keep up the good work! But I hate the new update with levels to upgrade you wepons! On upgrade costs more than the gun! Not   every one in the game is rich you know!',
       'I really like it. It\'s fun and entertaining, a highly suggested game in my opinion. Although i would like it if the sandbox mini game had more maps, and more freedom to choose those maps as well. It would also be very appreciated if we could play games with lower leveled players because i really wanna play co-op games with my friend, but she just started the game and it says insufficient levels. It would also be nice if the options of private servers were back in sandbox and you could choose what teams you wanna join in team fight. But otherwise, it\'s really great and easy to play 😄',
       'I like this game, But there are TONS  of things wrong with it. It\'s impossible to win or kill people after you reach level 10. Everyone one hits you and you can\'t even Dent them. FIX THIS PLZ. FIX the matchmaking and make it easier to get things.  This game is honest garbage right now.',
       'This game is fun, fast paced. I love the option to customize characters. And all the little references in the weapons are astounding. I just have one MAJOR problem. There is no reset button. The importance of these is to explore different options of how you play the game. If I had a reset button, I\'d give it a full 5 stars. I want to re experience this game so I can feel the magic of when I first started. I was just a lvl 1 back then. Now I\'m lvl 27 and it\'s absolute hell having to deal with all the people with stronger guns. Oh and one last thing.

      'The game is designed to force you to spend money unnecessary money they\'ve already made millions of it you don\'t think of me to do stuff for free. The game is rigged so you cannot win 90 percent of the time. Ots a fun great game but the developers are selfish and very greed y at this point. Game 5 stars. Cheating 1 star.  Developers OVER priced items and greedyness earn another 1 star.',
       'I was so upset that i deleted this game!I had no idea how much i missed it! I was a big candy crush fan and still am today! Im glad i cleared up space to instal it! I recomend this game to everyone, i realy love that you can play it offline and with other players! Even if the gamers at school say this ias a stupid game, i think it is fantastic!.I live that you get candy powerups everyday instead of using your gold too!',

       'I came on yesterday to play CCS and noticed it\'d changed the background the colour and the game itself... I really don\'t like it... I prefer it the old way!!! It reminds me of a similiar game called cookie jam! But I\'ll get used to it. Keep them Candy\'s coming and crushing!! <3 <3 :-) :-)',

      'The game itself is very well thought of, highly addictive and is a great time killer. Plus, there are almost no ads in this game. However, there are just too many animations. It\'s almost impossible to play this hame st a consistent frame rate. Maybe add an ability to downscale the resolution or tone down the animations?  Edit: after the new update they fixed it. The game runs buttery smooth',
       'I really like this app. The first time I played this game I kinda liked it. But it has ads in it and I hate it. It\'s graphics are awesome but also you have to slice the fruit outside the real game.😃😁😘😀😱🙃😛😨❤💙💚💛💜🍉🍌🍍🍎🍏🍐🍓🍑🍇🍒',
       'Everything is good about this game but the ads are getting on my nerves... Almost makes me want to uninstall this right away... I know that the ads might be a necessity for the devs but If only you guys could possibly atleast reduced the number of times they appear, that would be greatly appreciated.',
       'AMAZING! I played this on my kindle a few years ago, then deleted it. After about 2 years I got a new phone, then remembered this game. I downloaded it and wowowowow lots had changed. Good changes. I LOVE THIS GAME IT IS SO GOOD DOWNLOAD IT NOW!',

       'This game is very addictive but it just seems like an ad watching game. All the company cares about is money so they spam ads on to the game. Why play mini games for Golden Apples when you could just watch ads for Golden Apples since they let you watch infinite ads. Why play Classic, Zen or Arcade for Starfruit when you could just watch ads.' ,

      'I really like the game, but as soon as I played multiplayer my phone crashes. I know it\'s not my phone itself but the program because my phone never crashes to anything. Please fix the multiplayer mode! It\'s really nice but constantly crashes!!! Only because of that, I\'m giving it one star. As soon as it\'s fixed I\'ll be sure to give it 5 star and share it with my friends.',
       '1. The online mode isn\'t letting join a match 2. There should be special moves, like when you fall down, if you press the slide button, you won\'t lose speed (like in Mirrors edge) 3. The courses/levels are too easy, make it more harder',
       'The game is good. I like this game because of the fact it\'s parkour. The fact I don\'t have a life means I can take time on the game,the graphics are great I can clearly see what and how I\'m doing. So the game play is good. I know what controls to use, what to do, and it\'s a good. But I can\'t get over the fact that there is not a lot of color. There is only red and black. So I think they should be color.  Good game otherwise',
       'Some of the player crashing in the game pls fix so they can\'t cheat no more and when you do that I can give you 5star',
       'So I turned on the game and I did some steps, maybe 30 passed and I laughed, I turned it off and I uninstalled it.  It is without a doubt hilarious.',

      'Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I\'m 20 just..😉😉 I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I\'m in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️',
       'I\'ve noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don\'t think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying.',
       'I really like this game. But here is why I gave it 2 stars.  I completed all of the challenges but still don\'t have have enough score to finish ranking up.  The 5 day to secret ball never works for me. It resets after 2 days even though I play everyday.  There should be a counter for how many times you switch lanes. Some of the challenges were impossible because you had to switch lanes exactly x amount.  Also I don\'t think you should have challenges that make you avoid getting the coins, because the whole point of the game is to win spheres and lanes...',
       'Fun little time killer. My only problem is that daily rewards fail to show up most days. It could be a problem on my end, but I don\'t know, and it\'s a pretty small issue so I don\'t really care.',
       'Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn\'t respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I\'m willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.',
       'This is the most addictive game i have ever played. I always play it when am bored and you can play it when your offline. Totally recommend it but pls answer this question..what is the world highest score?' ,

      'Honestly i really enjoy the game thus far thank you for all the recent updates niantic... but there is one thing that has been bothering me and that is 1v1 with friends and trading... both features were shown in the original trailer... yet again i love the care your giving the game niantic i truly praise it but i would like to know whats happening with my 2 listed thoughts',
       'Please have more legendary raid events with gen 1 and 2 Pokemon for new and returning players who want to collect everything. With regards to using GPS and joystick cheats you guys actually benefit by getting more players from rural areas or dangerous areas playing and spending money. Besides you still have to do all the hard work minus the walking so it technically isn\'t that unfair to others especially since everyone is level 40 these days with legendary Pokemon. The game is already balanced just needs more events. Please consider a premium service to pay for where we can use a joystick in game. We can pay monthly or something so everyone benefits.',
       'thx for niantic that always listened our sugesttion, but i wish we can trade or battling with other player around the world by staying at poke center or else... - and btw you should update the new gym and new pokestop... since when i was on holiday in Indonesia theres not so much pokestop and gym around :( even there are many landmark in there - another suggestion plz maked some item that can be used to summon legendary/raid battle in location that we want, so its much easier  for the communities to do raid battle in specific location',
       'I love pokemon go and always get pulled back into playing it. I\'m still getting use to the updates after not playing for a while and am disapointed in the gyms. While I love being able to use them like pokestops, I wish to recall my pokeon from the gym. I love I a rural area and my poor Vaporeon has been at a gym for 13 days. THIRTEEN. I want my pokemon to come back please.',
       'I love the game but There are fixes and patches that should have been implemented. That people have been asking for but Niantic won\'t deliver. Ex: There are small bugs everywhere especially in gyms and raids and medals.  They never added trading There is no direct PvP No ingenuity (they could have added Pokemon centers or more pokeball types) Thanks Niantic.',
       'Can you please make it so that some Pokemon spon even if you dont go out, I wanna play from home but no Pokemon ever spon . Also can you make it so we can earn coins. I can\'t buy coins but I want to have a chance to earn coins so I can buy things to use. Thanks I love the game though it\'s awesome!' ,

I hope my tears will help u guys. :)',
       'Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it\'s just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............',
       'For this game to be so simple compared to todays games and grafics, I love it. I spend hours sometimes playing this.  Not to mention they keep upgrading and making it beter and better, keep it up fellas....i havent experienced any of the problems mentioned withthe updates others have but until then great game',
       'Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!',
       'At first I wasn\'t sure how good the game was but after playing it several times on Android and Windows 8.1 phone, I like it.  It doesn\'t weigh down on the phone\'s processing power. A very addictive game!! Give it go.',
       'I love it and I\'m addicted to playing it.   I like the fact that you can earn points if you don\'t want to buy them.  It would be great if tilting the phone had an impact.  don\'t change much though, its a great game:)' ,

      'This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don\'t worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you\'ll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!',
       'This game is honestly a great time-killer and even has it\'s challenging parts, but from what I\'ve noticed as you get to the higher tier songs they just get slower and slower and are just flat with barely any challenge. I expected more of a challenge with a higher level but now this game is getting horribly boring.',
       'Great game. Played to level 120 and have over 500 gems but then I switched devices. This requires a Facebook account which I did not have. It worked for a little bit until Facebook disabled my account for doing nothing. They need to fix the method they use to sync progress. Now I am level 3 with 17 gems.',
       'I\'m in love with this game. It\'s challenging, you don\'t have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks.',
       'I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who\'s better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn\'t seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don\'t think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.',
       'This game has no WORLD\'S favourite song  DESPACITO  SO i m hating it tooooo much  when i see this then i think that let\'s download it bcoz it contains despacito song also but when i see all album of this app then i started hated it. So i would request from CHEETAH GAMES that plezz add DESPACITO SONG also in it This is my humble request from CHEETAH GAMES.' ,

      'Should be called adzy. During the level theres an ad banner at the bottom. At the end of every level there\'s an ad, some you can\'t skip and have to wait an entire 30 secs to sit through. To make matters worse, the chests can be boosted by 50% by watching, you guessed it, an ad.  They don\'t even give you a shop option to remove ads for a small amount of money or some sort of package. Pure plain greed',
       'It stopped working on my One plus! Help! I was excited about the side games! *********************************** Excellent, addictive fun. I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn\'t level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can\'t progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.',
       'Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It\'s nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don\'t want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn\'t get a key.',
       'All in all it is a really great game there are very few ads, its fun, the graphics are crisp. Its amazing except for one thing. On one of the levels all of the monsters have exactly 666 health and im not religious or anything but I\'m pretty sure that if some one who is religious see\'s that, well lets just say that it might not be good for the company, so I suggest you fix this.  Thanks.',
       'Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion.',
       'Fun game but takes forever to get gold to upgrade. The cost to pay for the gems to buy so you can buy gold is really expensive. Not much dynamic to the game. Same stuff on each level just takes longer to bet enemies cause of higher HP.' ,

      'I think it\'s a good game but sometimes the ball would go in but then it bounces out you should also add modes, one like there are walls all around and I like the game keep making these addictive games:D also all you guys stop with the adds just turn off your WiFi let them have some money after hard work on many game\'s like would you want to make a game and not get money and just get  ALL YOUR COMMENTS WITH ADDS! ohhh that would be soo annoying.',
       'Ya hate ads? Turn off wifi and play. Stupid phone/gaming noobs. Its a good game and dont hate on it for ads. The ads make the people who made the game MONEY. Give then a break. Let them have money while u watch something u might want. If u wanna turn it off, like i said, turn off wifi.',
       'Fun simple game burdened by a slew of constant advertising. Ads while you play, full screen timed ad when you restart (99.9% of time) and an optional 1 time 30s full screen ad to resume. Simply put too many ads!',
       'Would pay for the game to remove ads. I get you can turn off WiFi/data but it shouldn\'t be necessary, and is unfair to the company itself. Please offer a paid ad-free version!',
       'I genuinely liked the game it was fun and addictive but the ads is what kills it. Ad pop up like almost everytime you lose.. other than that its a grest game. The ads make me want to delete it. I hated giving this game a 1 star..',
       'Too many adds!! (data issue + annoying)...  or else 5 stars. I wouldnt mind even paying few bucks for this game w/ no add options.' ,

      'Why make the game if the people playing cant even use everything on it. How do you unlock the dance party or whatever the heck it is? In conclusion i hate this game.',
       'PRACTICALLY AMAZING!!!!! THE BESTEST COCO GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!!! I have played many coco games, (almost all of them) but this one is the bestest of them all (if that\'s a word 😜) mainly because A LOT is unlocked including the SPA!!! (Crazy, right?!?!?!) and there are so many things to do. Plus it also reminds me of subway surfers..... The one thing I love besides the spa, is the restaurant. As far as I know, only fitness girl has that..... So definetly, it\'s a plus..... 👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍😋',

      'The bonus spin is wriged. It never stop on any prizes higher 500k. Also, The options to unlock the cards chests are limited.  The food and pet potions claims are not enough.. It takes too many spins and lost and raids to advance.. Need more rewards and more interactive games',
       'I am not getting shields...  Whats the problem..  Either it gave me just 1 shield in 50spins or no shield in 50spins...  I am stucked on 1farm i have completed many times the same constructions but as i dont have shields neithr i get them people come and attack on my field again and again. Please fix!!',
       'how awful. need to buy building upgrades. building upgrades do nothing. buildings do nothing. literally do nothing. how do you get money? spin a slot machine. Thats the only way. There is no actual game here. And what happens when you run out of spins and realize you still need millions more money to upgrade worthless buildings? give them real money. this game is so lazy it might as well be classified as a scam.',
       'Game requires you purchase junk to proceed. There comes a point where the casual gameplay is passed by the amount required to progress further; either watching hundreds of adds to collect enough coins to move on, or simply emptying your wallet. Good for a few levels, that is it.',
       'I love this game. But please increase the numbers of spins every hour. And I also have come across one more problem- I get notifications saying that I have won spins and coins but when I open the app there is nothing or no way to collect my reward. I don\'t know what to do?',
       'Worst game ever. Developers blocked my spin. I play almost 78 spins and didn\'t get a single shield. Worst game worst game. I am invited all my friends . Thy join and all i got is notification. I entered my email id almost 6 times for coins and spins and got nothing from them. Coin master developers u cheated me. Worst game ever.' ,

      'This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!',
       'This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you\'re willing to go broke',
       'Lots of fun, creative and very easy!  Review update: I reinstalled in 2018 to find it has changed. You cant dig down very far like you could before, or down to water (it only floods a little bit in places) so I couldn\'t make a moat for the castle.',
       'Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.',
       'Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses.',
       'I have a significant concern with how easy it is to accidentally spend the gems. It has happened at least once, though I\'m assuming it happened a second time while I was quickly clicking building a building, since fifteen gems are now unaccounted for. I cannot feel comfortable with this game if at any given moment, all my gems might get spent because of one misclick.' ,

      'I\'m 11 and i love it so much.I have some Ideas for a toca kitchen 3. You can be able to make sandwiches and soups or stews. And more ingredients, more people. And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.',
       'Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I\'m sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP',
       'I\'m giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won\'t make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least',
       'I like how I can give the guests disgusting drinks and food a see and hear their really funny reaction! Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!😆😆 I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!',
       'This is the best game ever it is also funny because I was giving the girl food and I gave her some strawberries and I put a lot of lemon, hot sauce, Barbiecu sauce,Manas,keckup,salt, and pepper... SO funny, it also sounds just like a kid is playing with the food, that I\'m eating grapes right now,😂😂😂😂😁😀😊☺🙂😐',
       'I want YOU to read this Toca Boca I love it! But I have to ask, Why is there bread if you can\'t make a sandwich? Also can you make there a way to make soup? I really like your games but I am only 10,how do you expect me to pay for the games. At make 5 free like this!' ,

      'I kind of enjoy the game but would like it more if there were cheaper options to buying. After you buy some the prices jump to 99.99 and have yet to see cheaper prices. I\'m not unloading that in one go. The people of this game would probably make more money if they bring cheaper prices. I would buy several different little packs that eventually add up to 100 bit you ain\'t getting nothing otherwise. Also wish you could buy more things with the gold you purchased. Like have a choice to spend loyalty or gold',
       'When it\'s not crashing, it\'s fun to play.  Sucks when it doesn\'t load of locks up during game play.  Also it gets expensive as you have to buy packs at $99 a pop after the 1st 2.  The game play is addicting, but no fun if you cannot afford the special offers they continue to throw in your face every time you log in.  I love final fantasy games but this particular one is a money pit!.  Not to mention the constant crashing',
       'I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.',
       'This game has potential to be fun but it\'s completely ruined because IT\'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don\'t get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it\'s full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it\'s a complete money bucket!',
       'This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.',
       'The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it\'s free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15' ,

      'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn\'t one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you\'re better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖',
       'This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.',
       'What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I\'m in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can\'t push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something',
       'Really a awsome  addictive  game.. but its not a fair play..  It  offered me only one  legendary card as I am playing from the beginning.  In the other hand one of my friend started playing just 4 months ago but he owned 5 legendary cards. one from the crown chest, another from the legendary chest and recently he got another one in the super magical chest. Now you decide. Is it a fair play?.  Really Disappointed 👎. And on the other hand it is pay to win game.. In some cases skill doesn\'t work .' ,

      'I hate this game cause one, you can\'t even change the decorations or visitors. Two, you can\'t even get coins for completing a level and the daily wheel is rigged cause you can\'t get anything good. Three, if you watch a video for a reward or life, it never gives you anything. And four, they don\'t give you enough moves for each level, there are too many ads and everything\'s so overpriced. Hate this bullcrap game😡',
       'A great game, but WAAAAY  too many ads. Its the same thing after each level: AN AD. The game is fun, but its hard to enjoy when you\'re watching ads every second. And Im getting the same ads over and over! I want to rate five stars, I really do, but I cant if there\'s going to be this many ads in a game I think everyone would enjoy. 💛💛💛💛♡ (( pretend the hearts are stars )) I\'ll download the game again once I see less ads in your games, like My Talking Angela, which also has way too many ads. Please take this into consideration! Thank you!',
       'The game was great until they put the ads on there, there are too many and 90% of the time I try to "x" out of one, it takes me to the play store anyway, and the game freezes a lot more now. It\'s also frustrating you can\'t alter the decorations. Game needs some improvements, and I hope they address them because it\'s quite fun to play.',
       'I am so disappointed in this game due to the fact my 3 year old somehow bypassed my password and spent 79.99 on coins!!! I sent a message immediately to Google play and the developer and I was told it doesn\'t meet the refund requirements. WTH?!! So frustrating! 😡',
       'This game would be a whole lot of fun IF there weren\'t so many ads! My niece is not patient enough to wait for stupid ads to finish, and u can\'t play the game until the ad is finished! Very disappointed!',
       'Love this game. Super fun but how do you get rid of ads? I paid for coins yet i still have ads. This is highly annoying especially if i can\'t skip them. Still love the game just not the ads :(' ,

      'Very much a top game, graphics are in your face with colours and speed. It\'s a" please don\'t stop playing me mi kind of game" Thank you. 😱 Wicked game. Top buzz. For some unknown reason, the creatures aren\'t rolling. Still good. One of the most enjoyable games you can play with 1 finger. Thanks again. Not working is the bonuses you get playing everyday. Brilliant wicked. Excellent. Top one digit game. 👆 Great. Can\'t stop playing the game. Bravo. Thanks again. Wicked. Great. Funtastic. Brilliant',
       'It\'s a good game to kill time with, though it doesn\'t offer much. Touch controls work well although a bit finicky, and it hits the difficulty spike a bit sooner than expected. It might have you buying some upgrades through micro transactions. I\'ve also experienced some lag that caused some unfair moments to happen. Still, it won\'t stop you from trying to beat your or your friends\' high score every once in a while. Overall, it\'s fast paced fun (Pun intended).',
       'Simple, but the increasing difficulty gives the game an enjoyable skill curve that keeps me wanting to play. The unlocks are nice and the pressure to purchase things isn\'t too bad, so far anyway.',
       'Hey Sega, where\'s Monkey Ball? I LOVE THAT GAME! PLEASE RESPOND! But everything is good. The only thing is, I had Espio, but I don\'t have him now.',
       'No Wi-Fi needed.   Keeps getting better. Can unlock more characters as you play. Free to play style which mean you buy what you want. Looks like the game is always being worked on. Which in my opinion more new stuff or improvements to come later on ; as the game gets older and people keep playing. Which has been proven in more then one occasion.',
       'This game is one of the best out there. Now I know it might seem like a remake of Subway Surfers or any other endless runner game out there, but I must say, Sonic Dash is much more than that. You can do way more in this game than you could in Subway Surfers. I would recommend this game of you haven\'t tried it. It\'s occupies time and above all else, this is a great game!' ,

      'Great game. The games are more fun than Candy crush and much more fair. For example, they let you make moves you can\'t play in Candy crush and timed rounds don\'t start until you touch the screen. Also, while some of the games are really challenging, you don\'t get stuck on them for days and days.  There are no gems or gold bars, etc. You don\'t have to slowly earn some kind of premium currency or pay real money to get special prizes.',
       'Loving it.  Reached level 370, and am really enjoying the game. Fun, good graphics, good story. Nice balance of challenging levels and easier ones, but so far no levels that look impossible. On the negative side, 900 hard won coins for 5 extra moves is ridiculous. When replaying a level it would be nice if you could go straight to the game play without the screen telling you what you need, we already know.',
       'This is my favorite game. Absolutely love playing it whenever I can. However, why did the the flower growing from beating levels suddenly switch from starting on Friday, so we can enjoy it over the weekend to starting during the beginning of the week. Did not get to use my 6 hours of unlimited lives like I have been since this started. I would very much like if it could be switched back to the original timeline. Enjoy unlimited lives and contests over the weekend when it\'s more likely more users will have the time.',
       'I think that we should get more  coins for winning the levels. I find that the game can cost me money that I don\'t have, so I will spend less time playing your game. I love this game alot but why play if you are not getting enjoyment because it costs to much to play. (Otherwise I love the game) I also never got my horse, please give me my horse, I really need that horse btw. I already had a name for her to. I was going to call her daisy. The name goes great with the garden theme. (If you hadnt realized thst already) Please please send me daisy, I love her already. Peace.',
       'Playrix games are all generally the same.. They\'re good. But well designed to ensure and encourage the use of real money to play. Think of old arcade machine style of game mechanics and you\'ve got a general idea of what you can expect from any of their titles.  The only thing truely different is how quickly each game decides it wants to dig for your wallet.  Disappointing.',
       'It was a lot of fun the first few "days" but got very hard very fast. Don\'t bother with power-ups as it doesn\'t really make a difference. The only way to win is to get lucky with a big bomb. That\'s it. It\'s a shame because the game is nice, I just progress way too slowly now for it to be worth playing.' ,

      'This is by far the best chess "trainer" for me.  It\'s got a nice flow and the game isn\'t "stupid" like most other chess apps/games I\'ve played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I\'m making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.',
       'I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!',
       'I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn\'t show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.',
       'For the non experts, let me tell you that 5his game cheats. I sat with a real chessboard to analyse why wasn\'t I  able to crack master level.   And what i observed was it didn\'t allow you to make actual moves when you show high levels of intell8gence. Sometimes it makes moves which are faulty. I think there is some mistakes in coding, perhaps deliberately made.  So not a fair play but a foul play.',
       'So far it\'s o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It\'s not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game',
       'The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.' ,

      'I really want to love this game but the time mechanics in it are just too much. An hour for one game token and most of the maps after the tutorials cost more than one token to play. I have to wait 3 hours to play one round? I really like this game, the merging mechanics are addicting and fun! I find my self between kicking myself for popping something early and getting excited for getting close to going just one more level up, but I almost have to literally forget about the game in order to get any sort of meaningful play time out of this game.',
       'Reason I changed from 5 star rating to 4 stars is before a recent update, you only needed 1 dragon chalice to play any level. Got changed to needing more than 1 on most levels, which wouldn\'t be so bad if they didn\'t make you wait 1 hour to get 1 dragon chalice back. Used to only be a 15 minute wait between chalice\'s. If it goes back to old way......5 stars again! Still a great game',
       'I thought it was really cute until I found out that you have to use orbs to open some of the treasure chests. How do you get orbs? By buying them of course. You have to spend money of you want to play. And that really sucks because other than that it\'s a really cute game',
       'After reaching level 39 my camp game completely erased and I\'m back to level 2. wasted so much time making hearts. .update. I tried to play again. I even have cloud saving my game again. I reached level 30. Suddenly all my dragons are gone. Again. What the hell game! Update: once again  the updated and all my progress is gone. This time om at level 53. I\'m done. The creators don\'t even reply or show that they are listening to the players to come to a solution. I\'m not playing this game again. WASTE OF TIME!',
       'Purchased the 30 day gem subscription. Got the first few days then it stopped. No way to contact support from inside the game, help menu continually crashed. Emailed support from outside the game and received no reply. Hoping Paypal can get my money back. Cute  time wasting game but don\'t spend real money on it.',
       'Love the idea. Would love to have getting gems be a little bit easier without spending money, watch ads or something for gems, since they are required to complete some quests. Also, mine all of the sudden stopped working. Said the hardware in my phone couldn\'t support it anymore. Same phone. So, now I can also no longer play. Bit bummed about that.' ,

      'i would rate 5 stars... but.. something with the cloud save broke, i used to have the megalodon, without any cheats.. but now i have the mako. could you fix this somehow? And do i email the support team? Im not good with all the emailing stuff.',
       'It\'s a really fun game, but sometimes you\'ll play a video to revive your shark and the video will play but you don\'t get another life afterwards. It\'s hard to believe that it is a WiFi problem because if it was an ad wouldn\'t be able to load at all. Also, I have paused the game before and come back minutes later and the game had kicked me out and not saved any coins/gems gained from that round. They clearly have a few bugs to work out.',
       'IT IS SO GOOD, YOU HAVE TO BUY IT!Every level you get a new shark,though,you have to pay for them.But the good thing is you still have your old shark! You will be challenged throughout the levels! AND WHATEVER YOU DO,DO NOT SPEND YOUR JEMS!!!! You barely can get any jems,besides the five you get for downloading it.Anyway all I want to say is have fun be cool and be one with the shark! Bye,rsvp!',
       'OMG! I love the gameplay in this arcade game I love everything about it. It is very cool that you can evolve sharks that can eat more stuff. Keep the updates coming it would be better if you added more sharks in this game . I recommend downloading this game if you want something to do in a long amount of time. This is so addictive I can\'t stop playing it!',
       'My apologies for the negative review lately. But to be honest, I have to use VPN just to log-in in Google Play and enable cloud sync or else, I wouldn\'t be able to sync my progress. Just a little request, can you make the gameplay smoother for lower end devices, such as devices with 1GB RAM? It lags frequently during gameplay. Thanks a lot!',

      'This is an awesome game that gives you daily and weekly quest\'s and offers treasure chests. Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven\'t tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.',
       'Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a "slide," I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don\'t compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.',
       'Nice, good, adventure game.but some times your team irritating who one completed thirteen level they will easily get diamond  your giving master challenge ( now the challenge Chinese New year )who one complete your giving thirty diamond only.this offer will useful only for entry level gamers. Most of players finished fourteen level so they no need diamonds.so think about genius players.',
       'I love all the graphics it\'s a bit like the        piano tiles it test\'s your fast skills but except it is temple run 2 love it. Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.',
       'I love this game, very addicting. And I love that it has the daily, weekly and global challenges. As well as objectives and the daily chest challenges. Lots of things to work for and win. Makes the game more fun. Plus, so far, I haven\'t come across anything that I\'ve had to spend money on in order to advance in the game',
       'The game while I understand is a time killer, and is not meant to be the same as a mmopg, has a repedetive vibe after a while. All the challenges are the same, and the cups they have never seem to present anything new. The game does the same repetitive challenge especially when they are for holiday hats or valentine hat, the game is dying for lack of innovation and needs new life for lack of innovation and creativity to switch it up, there have been numerous running games out there since its creation, Subway surfer, and many other games.  This had that same old, same old, vibe.' ,

      'Very fun and time killing. I play with my bf and 2 friends and we all try to beat eachothers high scores. It can be pretty competitive. Im prob gonna try to get more ppl to play with me too lol. There could be more variety in the blocks, and there should be like different modes, just an idea',
       'Its cool and all but needs some extra features.  Maybe a way to store 1 brick for later or some level advancement.  Maybe challenges or a power up system. The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.',
       'What they show on the preview and what it gives you in game don\'t even match. They make it look like it so easy. You cannot rotate the pieces. The pieces they give are so random, and most games you can barely get past a couple of turns before you can\'t place anymore and you lose.',
       'This is very deceiving. It looks like it\'s Tetris, but it\'s not. The pieces don\'t come down like the pictures show. I hate apps like this who deceive people to believe its a certain game when it\'s not just to get people to download. Will never download a game from this developer again.',
       'I hated it. Just freezes my phone n have to buy a new one  for 4954  dollars. Its just stupid n u really need more tutorial. Make this game have more tutorials n stop this freezing part for a better game n have  a 5 star rating from me n not a 2 star rating. Do u want a 2 star rating or 5 star rating? Just to be clear, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME IF U ARE DUMB. Tks😒😒😒',
       'The 8x8 grid is limiting. I prefer a 10x10 grid (e.g., 1010! Puzzle by Gram Games) -- still challenging, but less frustrating.' ,

      'Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn\'t hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv',
       'First of all It\'s joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add "Edit and changing names"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱',
       'I realize y\'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don\'t pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I\'m pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It\'s a pretty good app and I\'ve sent many people to download your app.',
       'Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don\'t decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don\'t mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don\'t actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.',
       '8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don\'t win any games until those coins are over and I\'m only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don\'t know why this is happening but it sucks because it\'s putting me off the game.. it\'s like 8 ball is making sure I\'m losing hence the rate 3',
       'This is the most addictive game i have playing since a bought this phone. All the new updates are cool. Need to get rid of those hackers playin along. Also when we get a phonecall the game reopens, its better if you  reconnect it during the tier its self .. very plesent game give lots of happiness.. make sure you work with above mentioned glitches, then 5* is sure.' ,

I won for nothing seriously? Overall very good game but have squishy bugs to be dealt with.  Oh,  and add offline part too if possible just like Asphalt 8 on some casual activities.  Uhm optimize the graphics too for other gpu like mali and powervr devices =)',
       'This doesn\'t do the TEKKEN franchise any justice, controls are awful (mash one side of the screen), the layout of the title screen is painful and the fighter unlocks etc are daft. I would rather pay a larger amount for a proper TEKKEN game than this. To add insult on top it\'s just crashed and not given me the fighter it was unlocking.',

I\'m back to the tutorial. All my effort (and rewards) back to zero without me doing anything. Wasted playtime.',

      'At first, the game was good. But after time passed, there is a little gameplay between advertisements.  The game has been sold to advertisements where ads even come in between while you are playing. Very annoying.  Disappointed.   Uninstalling.',
       'Hi everyone!  I\'m really not a fan of this game, I mean it\'s ok I\'m not going to lie but is very boring. The graphics are ok but it is repetitive. I suppose it is quite addictive but I lost interest after a few goes. It wasn\'t my cup of tea so to speak. I hope this review was helpful and remember to give it a big thumbs up!!! Be sure to look out for my trade mark "Xxx" and I\'ll see you next time!! Bye! Xxx. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍',
       'Was super fun until you introduced balls achieved by watching ads and a luck based ball/challenge system. The devs got greedy and ruined this great time waster',
       'I like this game. I purchased it because it deserves, also I want to remove ads. 3,50 € and ads are not removed completely. I\'m disappointed, expecially for the "restore purchase" button that not works. Despite this I think that as a game is fun but monotonous in the long run, defect of 90% of apps of this kind. I hope developers will add something with updates that are not other challenges that ofter go to luck (and waiting time should e removed also). Sometimes there are some bugs but irrilevant for gameplay. The development house has made other interesting apps too. Sorry for errors, is not my first language.',

      'It\'s OK I love to play the game when I\'m bored and it helps me to be settled back and have a good time. But these all happens when I\'m offline. But when I\'m connected to Wi-Fi there\'s too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you\'ll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I\'m playing the game??!! It\'s too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.',
       'Well before I say my review, I would like to clear out a few of the negative reviews. There are not very many ads at all, in fact I barely ever even get any. Second, the controls don\'t suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.',
       'It\'s stupid. It\'s really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn\'t turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked.',
       'I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don\'t you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?',
       'I dont know why people are rating Ketchapp games below 4 stars... I agree games are difficult but one of the unique one\'s in every launch. Their creativity is awesome... Love to play each of their games. Kind of more chanlenging and unique ones',
       'This is an amazing game! But there\'s a tiny problem with the controls: they are hard to be used. In addition, there are so many advertisments and that\'s the only reason I gave 4/5 Stars' ,

      'Whenever you die in the game you start completely over again. And after each game an advertisement plays. Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It\'s a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It\'s very competitive!!! I swear my husband can\'t beat my score no one has lol',
       'It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone\'s or tablets I find it hard to control I don\'t know if anyone else thinks so but that\'s my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company',
       'It\'s good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it\'s my opinion so don\'t get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don\'t have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn\'t play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀',
       'Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface',
       'start to crash often when playing online. i think it need some sounds or music. playing silent for long time feels like going stupid after long time played. since it so addictive . keep repeating boring play but keeps ppl playing. is fun though, but I think everyone need to keep control how much time played. can\'t believe I can play for like hours haha. don\'t know why my Nick name don\'t show anymore. usually is \'eat uuu\'. but shows as nothing ____ now.',
       'Game lags way to much. I can\'t enjoy it at all. It\'s a waste of an app. You guys really need to fix it. To many people like playing but the lagging has got to stop so the game can be enjoyed. If this game coast two pennies, I wouldn\'t by it. I am uninstalling this game for the 2nd time. Never again. Sucks, cuz I really like playing without the technical difficulties' ,

      'Would of gaven 5 stars. But there some bugs that need to be worked out. Like connection and handling. But other then that this game is really close to PUGB for the phone. Massive open world. COULD do little better on the mechanic of the game but nothing to major. Would like to have a better money earn system like small amout per kill or something. This game is well dont. Ive played almsot all games on gogole play and when i say this game is fun I MEAN IT!!..',
       'I like the game, but I have a few things I would like added. One thing is instead of joystick controls maybe there could be an option that allows you to have buttons to move like in vehicle mode where you can switch from the gas pedal to the four buttons. Also I would love a first person mode, I think that would make the game so much cooler and better, just a new way of playing. And Maybe a mode like a TDM would be cool. Just some suggestions, thanks for reading love the game!',
       'Thank you for constantly improving the game. Id say at this point not to add more but to fix and adjust what you already have. Fine tuning before more additions would be great. Optimizing sounds, movements, vehicles, rendering, scoping, responses, all that good stuff would be great. Its a little laggy but thats just what you get for a giant game and 100 million+ players. Love it either way.',
       'Why is there no controller support!!!!! For a game like this it is imperative for good controls. Playing on a touch screen is alright but I would like to be able to use a controller and considering controller support has been out sense android 4.0 this wouldn\'t even limit your customer base as I doubt any 4 year old phones can even play your game above 10fps. It seems like it is deliberately being left out and it is baffling me. Please can we use our controllers it\'s such a simple api to implement!!!! Seriously I think monkeys can implement controllers in games quicker then you guys what the hell!!',
       'The game has so much potential they just need to make it easier to see other players and easier to shoot people close to you. Also the game doesn\'t need to look realistic they should make it more like fortnite graphics and gameplay wise.  My main point is that it is too hard to see others in the game. still a good game though',
       'honestly a great game. but dont get diamonds to buy their packs. not only are they really expensive but the chance of actually getting their special clothes is so small I bought 10 packs of the monkey king and I got the same 2 grey items from all 10 packs.... like wth???' ,

      'I played Game of War for appx 3 years.  The game started out great, everyone was on a somewhat even playing field. The game advanced to quick and left thousands of players behind. Other Players and I felt we could never keep up.  I hope this game advances at much more slower rate.  We all spend money to enjoy the game!    Don\'t be gready like GOW.  Thank you in advance.  Kirk',
       'Overall great game, however to play and be competitive ait is important to spend. In fact just to unlock some features you must spend at least .99 which is fine by me since I love to spend on this game anyways. I have been playing koa from the start and when this game came out I jumped on the bandwagon in the first 50 kingdom servers. So with that said yes it is LOTS of fun, I love my GoG family and definitely addicting LOL see you on the burning war field ;)',
       'It is a fun game and is the most indepth game I\'ve ever played. That all being said, unless you have a ton of money and a lot of time there is no way this game is worth it. I\'ve spend over $100 and play multiple times per day and I still find it hard to level up my estate. Even in an alliance unless they\'re all very high level it isn\'t much help. I\'m sure they\'re are much better games in this genre then Guns of Glory. To me it seems like a game for wealthy people and made by a company to just make money.',
       'What a great game!  Need to have introductory levels for newcomers, though.  You build your kingdom up and larger kingdom\'s just rush in and destroy you.  When you recover, they come right back.  Level into the attack mode, so people will enjoy the game more.  I am uninstalling after 6 weeks of running an Alliance, because it\'s just not worth the trouble.  Great concept, fantastic graphics!',
       'Love this game! Very entertaining, never boring. My only complaint is with some of the collecting events. You have to do certain things to obtain the necessary items to put together, but for some reason with the current one you don\'t get enough of one item, and too much of another. It would be great if you could trade within your alliance for things like this.',
       'Hey good game. Having played this type of game for almost 2 years, I\'m very happy with the rollout of this game. I only wish that the in game translator was better. So many wars start because you can\'t translate Russian, Chinese and most middle eastern dialects. Those wars often result in people quitting the game. All around, a very fun game. Even if you don\'t spend money!!' ,

      'Nice game. I like the concept of rebuilding but this game was meant to kill time, I hope so. Keep adding characters and what we require is a hell lot of mini games so that they may keep coming and coming and coming. I do not intend to harass you but try to add more and more mini games after each update. I\'m sure that in the course of  time you may be able to compete with the best games ever created but do not make the game larger than DWTD 2. Add more new locations too otherwise we will not be able to consume the tokens. The game is nice because you do not have to consume money for characters and get them through gifts instead. It is also nice because tokens can be collected easily. Please think about my opinions. I❤ this game.',
       'The character models are cute and all, but the games are getting a bit repetitive. WAY too many ads. Like, ridiculously too many. The app forces a couple right after you finish some of the minigames. You have enough to offer us - forcing even more ads on top of that is tiresome. Get rid of them.',
       'Dumb ways to die 3 gets 3 stars. No, seriously, I loved the first 2, but this one is not good. Only 4 minigames, not really different each from another. Remember FASTER FASTER FASTER ? It disappeared (I miss it), and is now ADS ADS ADS. The goal here is just to use money and play as often as you can for ADS ADS ADS. The main thing here ? Minigames ? Nooooo, just getting (or buying) tokens and use them to repair houses (no impact on gameplay). Why would this game be nice ? The graphics are still good. Yes, that\'s all. Have a nice day. ADS ADS ADS',
       'Best game of all time I mean you have to try this or else your life could be boring and lonely the 1st and 2nd are also really good check em out and you can\'t live with out this game. My point is best game ever',
       'Best Game Ever And After just adding Dippy and Pillock I finished all the characters even though before I got the update I finished collecting all characters by getting Dunce then I went to play it through app stores and update it And now I have All the characters again I love your really wonderful  games and they started off as an advert about being safe around trains my favourite song the games are my favourite games ever as well Thanks so much for brightening my day Metro.',
       'To be honest, I don\'t think this game updated at ALL. Dumb ways to die 1 and 2 were GREAT but this one... not so GREAT.  First of all,  there are only for games that you could play.  Second,  it\'s not as creative as the other ones. And third,  the only good thing about it is that for ME there are no ads.  The list goes on but that\'s for you to find out and for me to uninstall. 😐😐😐😐😟😟😟😟😢😭   Im VERY disappointed' ,

      'Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?',
       'This game is pretty good, for the most part. The only problem is the bots you go upagainst are  way to hard. I can never win. I would have gave them 5 stars but I gave them 4 stars because of the bots. And the game is kinda hard to control. When I move backwords on a veichel it goes up.',
       'New update stucks a lot and 1st time my mobile hangs a lot due to this game and btry drains faster than ever. plz crt these mistakes to continue njoying this game',
       'Ok. I admit this game is pretty fun. But the missions, especially the hardcore ones, are ridiculously hard. So if you want a challenge, I recommend this game. But if you rage over really dumb things like me, then I definitely do not recommend it.',
       'The physics is very hard to grasp leading to many fails and the bots often drive backwards and forwards until they can drive up onto my head. There\'s also no start timer, leading to the bot ramming into me before I can figure out what\'s happening. Great with human opponents, however single player makes me want to throw my phone out of my window. Great concept, horrible execution.',
       'I hate this game it makes me so stressed and the AI is rigged also the David and Goliath mission i try to win they win 5 out of 5 of the first 5 matches and I\'m afk they win 4 out of the first 5 matches this is f@#$ing stupid P.S impossible to get new cars the machines just gobble up your coins like the game where you try to grab a plush toy but it always fails because it\'s rigged' ,

      'Let\'s be honest. This game is very similar to every other choice game. You have to wait 3 hrs for another ticket and I don\'t mind that BUT the storylines are CHEESY! Like damn, I don\'t even feel  the chemistry between the characters, you all should work on that. Also, the why you all draw the Black characters is simply awful. Work on the way you color the lips and draw the face. I hate to say it, but overall, this game is basic. It\'s a work in progress, READ your reviews and actually listen to what they are saying.',
       'It\'s pretty good. I am going to save this application for now. Right now I am reading the Campus hacker story. I really do like the humor in it but I kind of find the characters rude LOL. I\'m only on the first book so I don\'t want to give up yet. I have four other reading applications and this one honestly is my least favorite as of right now but I would definitely recommend it and give it a shot.',
       'So far it has been interesting. As far as these games go, at least they have missions that allow you to win some diamonds unlike choices, what\'s your story and episodes. With chapters you can watch videos, but that only gives you one diamond, so this is still better . I also love the memory quizzes and living out my Nancy drew fantasy. The characters faces are a bit odd though ( especially their teeth ) but there is a similar problem with all these games. I am so drawn in by the mystery and fantasy stories that I hardly even notice the faces now. Also I love the aggressive lover options. For me fantasy means getting to do stuff I can\'t do in real life, like solving mysteries and aggressively pursuing my supernatural love interests. What\'s up with untold darkness 2 though, I wanted to spend more time with alex',
       'I kinda liked it. I finished untold darkness book 1 before giving up. I also started reading a couple others to be fair. I didn\'t really like untold darkness until later on in the book, and was eager to start the second but very disappointed in the second one. I felt like my choices didn\'t really effect the outcome.',
       'I hate this game. Just like all the others you need diamonds to make a certain decision. And what\'s the point of having an earn option if you never get the diamonds you\'re supposed to get!? I\'m not paying for them either! I also think 20 points to equal one diamond is a bit rediculous. Either 20 points is to high or 1 diamond too low!',
       'I really like the game and would have give 5 stars if darkness untold 2 would have been the following of darkness untold 1.... It\'s like the 1,you start from the beginning... But with another with the story taking another way... Very disappointing' ,

Even if you don\'t mind to wait 200 days, you will not able to afford it (lvl 10 military Def, Atk, Health cost 100m gold each). DO NOT GO FOR HIGH MILITARY AND T4 WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE GAME.',
       'Ive been playing for the better part of a year, and this game started out great for a long while. But IGG not only panders and gives better deals to Chinese people, cheaper packs etc. But literally 99% of all mega guilds and players are Chinese or Vietnamese. If your not asain don\'t play this game  you\'ll end up like me playing forever just to quit because of the obvious discrimination IGG holds with its playerbase',
       'This game is fun but be prepared for the mother of all Pay2win games.  These folks at IGG are experts at crafting new and exciting ways at fleecing their customers of every cent they can.  You CANNOT compete if u dont pay and pay often.  Players here ...just regular people... dump hundreds of rl $$$ regularly.  You have been warned.',
       'Gameplay is good, not a lot to complain about. As far as purchasing via in-app, BE CAUTIOUS AS THEY HAVE LITTLE TO NO CARE ABOUT THE QUALITY OR THE QUANTITY OF THE SUPPLIES YOU PURCHASE FROM WHAT WAS ADVERTISED TO YOU. YOU WILL NOT SEE REIMBURSEMENT.',
       'The game is awesome and there is always something to do  so you\'re never stuck waiting around for powerups or new lives. Unlike other games it doesn\'t require microtransactions to get stronger, but they do help you quicker if you\'re interested in paying. I\'m addicted and play every day.',
       'Misleading sale information! ! Current Fortune Ticket sale is misleading and horribly overpriced.  "Give your guildmates 10 Fortune Tickets!" for $19.99 should give ALL guildmates 10 tickets EACH. Instead it gives 10 tickets TOTAL for the guild to fight over!! Since MOST of the guild is left out, how can I give them a Fortune ticket as stated?? There is a comparable  $4.99 offer that gives 50 Fortune chest, 2000 gems, and resources. Each Fortune ticket is equivalent to a Fortune chest.... DO THE MATH! ! I submitted the error to online help and was DENIED!' ,

      'I just bought the level 4 crates. Some were delivered, then it reverted to level 3. I have a screen shot showing that I already had level 4. I cannot find a bug report feature in this game. Please fix this in my account. Otherwise, I love the game. Remember to buy something to fix the ads.  Edit: I sent customer support an email with a screen shot a month ago. There has been no response.',
       'Stay away unless you plan on paying money.  The devs force ads in almost everything you do, and I\'m pretty sure they aren\'t vetted as one of them seemed to take control of my screen. Great potential way to serve up malware to your customers.',
       'I like merging games, but this one has a huge ad issue that makes the game somewhat frustraiting to play. I\'ll click the store to buy a house and it will auto start an ad video. It\'s lacking a bit in the story line department too. For a base merging game it\'s simple and fun, but definitely needs some work.',
       'Nice mindless game, fun for when you want to just chill out. Would have given more stars,  but it seems upgrades are temporary. I won\'t be wasting my money getting better boxes,  the one I bought didn\'t even last 5 minutes! Such a waste of $4.',
       'Ever wanted to be Mayor? Ever wanted to run a town, develop the land, and see a metropolis grow? Well, look no further than Animal Crossing cuz this game does none of those things. You just merge buildings into better buildings. It is fun, if you spend money so that you\'re not bombarded with ads. But then you run the risk of being unable to watch ads when you want to to do things like double your earnings or unlock a better building from the mystery box.',

There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars.

      'Love the game. I hate that there is a ad after every end. If you have to restart, you\'ll get any ad before you can continue. Outta frustrating Ann\'s makes me not want to play.',
       'The ads are so Terrible they interrupt gameplay now so if you were placing a block forget it it just placed itself because it registers that you let it go. Good game but not worth the annoyance.',
       'Really you have no idea what\'s coming next, so you can\'t plan on your next strategic move. Its all luck if you make it to the next round or not. So theres no challenge. I do appreciate the fact it has no ads.',
       'It would be better if the adverts didn\'t stop you playing the game. Also asking for the rating every five mins pisses me off',
       'This game is good for a good time waster, but eventually it gets boring. The only thing really fun is trying to beat your high score. I think a way to help improve the game is have a high score chart around the  world. So we are going against everyone and trying to beat their high score as well as our own.  You can have many charts. A weekly, monthly, daily, and overall.  And with that being said I think you should incorporate prizes. Which can just be skins for the blocks. Trying to collect all of the skins.    Just a thought and idea. Because there comes a time where it\'s gets boring competing against yourself.',
       'Foolishly made game, many a times the three blocks they send don\'t even fit in the remaining blocks. I mean, u shud send the blocks such that people shud love thinking where they all will fit, if allowed in comments I would have sent screen shot of game where I lost in it, to ask u guys where the hell these three blocks fit. I wud suggest to take it as an error in ur game n resolve it.' ,

      'This games accuracy is worse than my atari 2600 and is 1000 times worse than my 5200. It seems like in 38 years with all the technology we have today , someone would finally figure out that when you go up, You go up and not right and when you go right it goes right and not down. Not the case here. Man we have games that live life for you basically. But still cant figure out how to fix pac man. REALLY? And the ads an ad after every board. Ads ads ads and then guess what? Another ad. Very shameless',
       'Came for Sonic, stayed for a good game. I suggest adding new ways to use coins, like for different variations of pacman or the ghosts. The only complaint i have is the loading time is quite slow',
       'It\'s everything anyone would want in a classic Pac-Man game! With just enough new features like daily rewards and missions to be modern, while also having all the original things too!!',
       'I am really surprised. The amount of new mazes I\'ve never seen before just blows me away. Of course you can just play the classic version thats why I downloaded it but wow love this game. And you don\'t have to spend money unless you want to its very kick back. Adds of course but whats a dollar to you?',
       'Fun game, except in some games it gets too sensitive and I seem to lose control of the pacman. Other times it gets stuck in one place. It can be frustrating at times.',
       'When I got this back in 2015 it was great! Now it a full of ads and tokens for people to spend money. As well as nullifying my previous purchases. Thanks' ,

      'I love this game!! "it helps a lot" with my shopping addiction because I feel like I\'m buying real merchandise. I really enjoy the updates and how you guys added more room to be designed!!!! Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))',
       'I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.',
       'Great application. Very enjoyable. Only complaint wish app had more international design furniture to match the themes and settings. Also need to fix the bug so that the design loading screen appears.  This is the only app that I have to reset my tablet to get my results, since the last update I have had this issue. I have made an inquiry adressing this issue and it still has not been fixed. I have changed my rating because of this issue, once it has been addressed and fixed I may change my opinion.',
       'The game is fun, but results take 2 and 3 days and if other people are on higher levels they have access to better tableware and vases, pictures etc, so their rooms stand out more and they have a better chance at getting 5 stars. And some items I\'ve purchased don\'t work it gives a message saying they couldn\'t find it in the warehouse. But the game never gave me my gems back and of money. NEED TO FIX IT',
       'O.k. the game has been fun. Love decorating. My gripe is why can\'t I keep the furniture that I have purchased with my own money? And why do I have to repurchase items that I have already bought? And why am I limited on purchasing if I spend my own money.  You guys say that you don\'t enhance the voting process but I tend to differ. Many times rooms that have scored A 5 are all in the same color tones and almost look the same. It has been fun but unless you give me more options to purchase I\'m? out.',
       'Great game! Love it! Only voting system is not accurate. I think  designs that not reflecting the theme should not get  5 stars. It would be nice to have experts inside the game who will review designs for THEME and reward those who follow the theme and get great result  in designing. I suggest to  give one point for those who is following theme, and get one point out if someone not. Fairness is important.' ,

      'Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!',
       'In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it\'s newer it\'s boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star',
       'No matter how hard I tried, I would end up crashing on my head.  Round would end, and it would ask if you wish too see an ad.  Expect that after every round. Even if you say no, it will do an ad break every 3 rounds.  I wanted to enjoy this game, but it was not challenging, and so many ads that I uninstalled it.',
       'Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can\'t just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can\'t advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it\'s basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.',
       'This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said "add break". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them.',
       'The game desparately needs to offer more coins as skill level increases.  The frequency of coins remains the same while the skill level demands more and more coins (in the thousands).  Watching ads helps, but the player finds themselves doing that exclusively, which defeats the purpose of the game.  Physics, graphics and gameplay are good.' ,

      'Most of the controls are excellent, I love the snap-to by selecting a ball, and the fine tune dial, however the "spin" mechanic is terrible to the point of being broken. No matter where you put the contact spot on the cue it is always maximum front spin or back spin, there is no diagonal spin or English, and no gentle spin of any kind. Fix this and you have a perfect pool game.',
       'I played without sound for a long time. After Upgrading my tablet, the sound won\'t turn OFF!   I have it off in the settings but am still getting sound after sinking a shot and at the end of a game.  I am very dissappointed that i wont be able to play this app anymore.',
       'It\'s not horrible by any means but it\'s basically the children\'s version of what the game should be. Way to basic way too easy and no points and buying system or any sort of upgrades every level just diffs with amount of balls and placement not difficulty Thanks',
       'Was disappointed when I reached level 816 and found no more game. Also, game could use some kind of "side game" to avoid boredom.  But still good time killer.',
       'I enjoy playing this game. I already reach level 400 but i don\'t know how many levels this game have. Do you increase the levels every time you update this game until it reach to never ending levels so that no one will stop playing this game because of the never ending levels. This game is fun and challenging.',
       '1st there are ads in between each play which is ridiculous.. I dont know how high the game goes up but there are NO hints or instructions on what exactly the goal is besides potting balls.. it\'s ADDICTIVE and fun BUT if this is all there is to it I won\'t keep game long' ,

      'Many games say they are free to play but you are limited as how far you can go without putting money into the game as long as you grind and have patience as takes time. . GoH is not like that. You can actually gain the better gear, the better characters, etc without dropping buckets of money in the game. All you need to do is regularly play the game, level up your character,and participate. Doing so you will get stronger characters. This game has great gameplay, awesome characters,fun PvP and it\'s just addicting overall. This game is truly free to play.',
       'Great game. Nice mix of action and turn based play. The fact that you can search for specific shards, gear, crafting parts is a touch of genius - no grind. Separate energy for two areas means longer play. Only downside is the rating for this is not high enough! Also, background music changes according to location, very nice detail. Massive amount of characters and variations of them. Great game guys. Really looking forward to updates.',
       'All the main movie characters and space ships to use. Wish u would make more farmable but over one of the best games out there. I actually prefer it compared to Xbox due to no issues with extensive network down periods. If u want us to pay then we gotta be able to play when we want right? Someone else should send that to Xbox they stopped caring long ago. Well done again for the game',
       'This update gave the players most of the things they have been asking for over a year now. The only issue i have is that EA is still pushing its pricing model with this game. 300 dollars to full star up a character + another 200 for gear. Its a bit much. The F2P is still full and while you will be hardpressed to make it to number 1 on your shard it is possible and gives great satisfaction. I would recommend atleast giving it a try.',
       'Best game in this style yet.  There are many similar games, some has better graphyc and etc, but this one is the most balanced. Many nice updates. Game changes everytime.  Not very easy also not very hard.  And the most important thing is that u dont need whole day. Just 15 minute  to do every daily mission. Best game yet. I wish if you give me beta test acc  for youtube channel.',
       'Just d/l this like a week ago. Very good game, the turn based RPG style works well, the graphics are top notch, as well as the sound is accurate and superb. The only thing is: I just updated it and now cant get past the Lucas film/Disney screen now. The update was not interrupted at all when I downloaded it, but I suspect it got corrupted, contacting support, hope they can help me I do NOT want to start over.' ,

      'The heroes should be for all players from the lower level. They can make their own choice to choose the hero or switch them. If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy? It\'s the strategy game, not for only the big or strong players. Thanks!!...',
       'It is a good family game and it is a way to play with lots of friends and even make some new friends in your clan. It does not take lots of money to complete they game it only takes skill and dedication. I have played this game for years and have had many different accounts on it, but you just have to dedicate your self to one on those accounts to get a good high level account',
       'Coc is on the first place in my games list. It is very addictive and enjoyable. I am looking forward till the day town hall 12 comes. I am not much happy with SUPERCELL ID thing. Because it is not much easy to use. I recommend using the normal GOOGLE PLAY sign in method because it is much more appropriate for me. Overall COC have become my life. I also recoomend to have a time limit for coc, like coc automatically switch off if the user plays coc more than 1 hour. Long Live COC!',
       'Its an awesome game. The new concept of supercell id is cool but switching is little time taking. I Would request you guys to make it easier or add some shortcut to switch accounts. Because it is really difficult to change if you are in poor network zone. Plz consider this. Otherwise the concept is really good it saves RAM of phone as u dnt need play games and services updated. 😀',
       'Awesome strategic game, love it. But I have one request to Clash of clans creators that pls update clan castle of coc village that there would be an option that how much treasury do you want to Transfer to your storage. I think all coc players would be love this option and it would be great idea because you can transfer required amount of treasury to your storage and the rest of it will remains safe in clan Castel. If you like this idea and will work on it then pls reply me. I would be thankful to all Coc creators if that happens.. 😊',
       'NICE GAME, NICE GRAPHICS,NICE GAMEPLAY.. Been Playing Since 2015 and I See A Lot Of Changes..  I Wish new content would Be Added More Frequently and I HOPE The Village must Have Village Houses! Cause A Village Is Not A Village Wihout Houses SUPERCELL. There should be houses that has different colors and traits, some which raises stats of barbs and valks, or reduces time to produce troops and spells like in Builder Base,there should be houses which raises defense or offense and houses which reduces building production. This May Give Clash Of Clans A New Spark and Would Be More Strategic than usual. Thanks For Reading Devs Godbless.' ,

      'Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I\'ll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily "less than 20 coins" reward. Sooooooo cheap!',
       'It\'s just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that\'s a good question.',
       'Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don\'t ever plan to, but here you also don\'t really need to. I\'ve won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you\'re not forced to watch them. It\'s not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.',
       'Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don\'t even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.',
       'Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn\'t be putting people in the "club" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this "club" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they\'re INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game',
       'Would be good if someone actually thought about what they were making. This is an over computerized auto random winning when that person didnt actually win game. Many flaws need to be fixed. Start from scrat ch and make a more user friendly uno to play with my actual friends, not random people until I make it to level 5. Not cool.' ,

      'Its perfectly awsomely COOL Im already level 27 and i have all of the ninjas but can u please add more space for the other ninjas? That cant get in even we need them somtimes we play it and we need a ninja and its not in the box to pick a ninja you will jut restart the game. Anyways but i still love it Ninjago is my  favorite have you guys watch the ninjago movie even there episodes. Thank you for creating this game.👍👍👍👍👍👍',
       'I\'m a big fan of lego ninjago♥. Its just hands of time I fight serpentine and when master Wu spoke I saw a timeblade. When I was chilling looking at my mission\'s then Lloyd hacked into Zane\'s computer he said something I just have a bad memory.',
       'I think if you could add a few extra spaces for more ninja then everybody would be happy .the reason I\'m giving this app a 4 star rating is because you can only have up to five ninja on a mission including your own .if anybody would like that to happen then give this review a thumbs up.',
       'This game is a very sofisticated & awesome one. Controls are now customizable & we can now choose two powers for the avatars Coolest game ever!!!!! 100/100 stars',
       'This game could be amazing if it wasn\'t for the awful camera angles which make it impossible to see what you\'re doing. Fix this and the game would be amazing.',
       'It\'s amazing I love it I like how you can make your own ninja and have any weapons it\'s one of the best games I\'ve ever played I have it on all my devices it always puts my in a good mood a job well done plus I\'ve saw every episode and the movie I\'m a huge fan got lots of the sets (5) stars keep it up' ,

      'This game is the WORST!!! The controls don\'t work and there is not even demonstration on how to play. Also every time I retried to do it a stupid add came up. I AM FURIUS!!!! Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don\'t get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don\'t mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!',
       'tbh it\'s a really good app! The only problem is that it gets a little boaring after a while (obviously that\'s my opinion) And I don\'t know if it\'s just me but there or tons of over 30 second ads.',
       'I think there is to many ads like u have to watch a ad after u die. And then if u wanna continue u have to watch ANOTHER ad. Its just so annoying. But other wise I love this game. It keeps me entertained while I am bored or when I am on the bus on my way to school. But there are way to many ads and I hope u guys please fix that. 💜',
       'I like this game  very much cause you dont know what comes in front of you which makes this game more interesting. But 1 problem is there that the second i crash to any obstacle an add popups',
       'This game is AWFUL!! There is no tutorial and every time I fail an unimportant ad comes up. What is wrong with you making games like this? Close this game down it is terrible. Just learn. Who would want to play a game like this you stupid idiot',
       'It\'s honestly a fun game, and I\'d love to use it as a stimulating activity (ah, who am I kidding, it\'s just a great time killer), but it makes my head hurt-- and that\'s a problem. I\'m not even the type of person that is negatively affected by fast-paced graphics or rapidly changing colors. It\'d be five stars if it didn\'t give me headaches, but, for now, it gets three; good graphics, smooth gameplay, but no matter how great the app, it isn\'t worth physical discomfort. (Note: if you are looking for something similar, try "Run". It has the same sort of concept, but without the advertisements and headaches.)' ,

      'I can\'t say I love it,maybe I can. But any way, this would have to be in one of top hundred games😀. There are a few things I would like added though. Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed this😀😁😀😁😀😁.',
       'I think you guys have messed up your game in the past few updates. Seems like there is some memory leak or something. After a while the steering wheel lags so much. Only the input. Graphics don\'t lag at all. Please fix. Also would be great if you could add some button to start and stop a timer in free mode so we can set time challenges for ourselves. I like the game but it is unplayable after a few minutes after the recent updates',
       'What you should improve is that YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ADD\'s I MEAN SERIOUSLY I WATCH MORE ADDS THAN THE GAMEPLAY. I ONLY PLAY FOR A LITTLE THEN MOST OF ADDS SHOW UP. I WQ5CH ADDS THAN PLAY8NG THE GAME FOR CRYING OT LOUD!!',
       'This has to be like, my 5th or 6th reinstallment of this game since there\'s no ingame reset, but darn well worth the data(little bytes). I usually like more realistic car games, but even the "extreme" warp in physics in the gameplay doesn\'t distract from the fun. These are the cars you\'d want if you\'re trying to beat the traffic, run from the cops, or solve a parking dillemma. Great fun time killer! One thing though, the other reviewers are correct in their complaints about how often and when ads pop up. That shouldn\'t happen smack dab in the middle of a maneuver.',
       'This is crazy like I understand that you need ads but the fact that they are popping up on the middle of the screen is crazy! Like I woodnt mind if you had a small one at the bottom is the screen but the fact it pops up at random in the screen is really annoying and finds the game. I do love this game but the ads ruin it. Please fix this!',
       'This game was just really really good! But please please make the exact same game but instead, if you do something illegal like crash into another car, the cops start chasing you. If you do do this I will comment on every single game that comes up on the adds. But, there is a tiny bit to much adds. Anyways, AMAZING fame!!!😊' ,

      'This is a great game but it has it\'s draw backs. Due to a glitch in the game I had some coins and trophies taken from me in a game that never loaded. The biggest issue with this game is there is no offline solo play. A solo or practice mode would be great to allow people to get a feel for the game and be able to make tweaks in certain scenarios when playing with others. Easily worth 5+ stars if some adjustments can be made. Very addictive, very fun and suspenseful, and a great time killer.',
       'I think that you should win the balls all so instead of just trophies!! You pay so much money to qualify for a tournament and you got to pay a 10,000 dollar entry fee and then 1000 ever hole!! The game is coming to how much you can spend instead of how good you are you shouldn\'t be able to enter a rookie tournament if you have over a thousand trophies!! Maybe it shouldn\'t cost so much to be able to get into the tournament!!! Besides if you spend a lot of money the people who can\'t spend as much!! I enjoy this game a lot I play it all the time I believe that it should be cheaper to qualify for the tournament!! And when you lose your game that you should loose the ball your playing with!! I really appreciate your time in listening to my opinion!! Hopefully this might make it a little more fair to the people who can\'t spend the money they would like!! Sincerely a Huge fan of the game!!! Thanks Joseph',
       'Awesome game. The only thing I don\'t care for is, why am I playing people that have 80 trophies but have played 2,000 games? I mean I\'m working with starter clubs and they are playing me with so much better clubs.. I just don\'t think that\'s very fare. And is there any other way possible to receive extra gems and coins or get extra clubs higher-ranking clubs? Thank you for your time and thank you for coming out with this game it is awesome',
       'I haven\'t been able to use the app since I updated the app a few days ago. So apparently they haven\'t worked out all the bugs.... it will load all the way to 100%, then it goes to a 2nd download screen and it only makes it to 50 %  before it stops downloading. So it was great up until that point',
       'Fun and entertaining game for sure. I wish there was more variety of courses, but I enjoy the competition in this a lot. They update frequently, and have very helpful customer service. One small change I\'d make, on shootouts, if it could show your distance from the pin next to your name or vice versa. I\'d like to see different clubs available for purchase as well.',
       'Really a great experience! The game play is awesome and very addicting. Only issue I have is when I finish in the weekly division standings I am not receiving my rewards. I just placed 3rd and was supposed to get a golden chest but I did not receive anything. That was a little disappointing after investing all that time, but still one of the best apps I have ever downloaded.' ,

      'Why I liked it? Because it\'s a simple game that doesn\'t make you addicted to phone but rather enjoy going forward focusing your attention entirely on your finger. What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven\'t listened to this game\'s. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I\'m entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.',
       'I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it\'s meant to be "skillfull" but thats harder than skillfull, you can\'t even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don\'t care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.',
       'This is game is ok if you are bored and don\'t know what to do.... however it becomes irritating after playing for a while.... overall its a nice game',

       'This is the best game to relax. But i have a problem i do i change the music there are some music that i like and i want only that to play so i request ro put a music option  Thank you',

I do believe giving an emergency C-section for an illegal is a bit much for a story line, but whatever. Totally makes sense. I love how we\'re able to take care of the premies and foster them until they\'re adopted! 6/10 - Would play again if bored.',

      'I really like it, turn based strategy, probably one of the best games I had on this phone yet. There are a few fun tribes you can buy (or rather should buy) and I think spending a few bucks for a game like this is absolutely fine. Just keep an eye on the time, half an hour flies away if you don\'t pay attention ^^',
       'Love game, but why the auto start, in my opinion, no app should auto start, app should only be turned on when in use, fix this or I uninstall. GEEZ, all you developers think your app is only one used, get a clue! Then why do I keep getting a "Poytopia has stopped" message every time I start a session on my tablet, even though I did not play Polytopia during last session.',
       'I love this game hence the 5 star. But the multiplayer needs some work, if I wanna play a game with a friend in 1 sitting I have to reload the map each turn. If the turns could progress without reloading the game that would be awesome. Also, I had a bug that made me replay a turn a few times in multiplayer for some reason after I returned to the game.',
       'Fantastic mobile game. It\'s a great pocket sized Civilization-style game. Quick games with the depth and variation to keep you immersed.  Unfortunately, the multiplayer update doesn\'t seem to be functioning very stably at the moment. My friend (Verizon iPhone) and myself (Sprint Android) have been trying to play some matches, but we keep getting turns where we can\'t move our units, or gain resource points to spend. As it\'s an indie-developed game, I understand it\'s tough to test every permutation of devices and connections. I\'m hopeful and looking forward to subsequent updates and bugfixes. Keep up the great work!',
       'balanced and very deep. You have fulfilled everything I ask for in the last review whether you read it or not. The \'modes\' list is a little sparse, however, and it would be great if you would plan some modes as a side project or something. Not that it is easy making a new mode. Well nonetheless, god job',
       'There have been 2 games in the play store that I have enjoyed enough to buy everything they have to offer The battle of polytopiya is one of them. This is a great game for Appers that like turn based, strategy based gameplay from very easy to impossibly hard. I was just thinking to myself how awesome it would be if this game had online multiplayer... woke up today to online multiplayer, very satisfied. I am sure that it will be expanded and improved so I\'m not going to suggest anything yet. Enjoyed everything about this game, would like to see some merch being sold soon, I would very much like to support the developer.  You have brought joy to my life. Thank you.' ,

      'This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn\'t as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn\'t there but now it\'s forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.',
       'I really wish you guys didn\'t update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can\'t listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!',
       'Amazing game... Loved it...😍 The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it\'ll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it\'s okay 😊',
       'It\'s an amazing game. Sure I run around my bedroom screening every time I fail next to the end.... but there is something about this game that makes you happy. Is it the music? Maybe. Is it the back ground and the way it moves?possibly. It\'s all of those things plus more   In a nut shell I really really really really really really really really really love this game :p',
       'Seems like controls tend to be problematic, and synchronisation has to be adjusted for every song. However the game is wonderful, precise, compelling and worth spending time on! Everything is well thought, new levels and lines are frequently added. So far my favourite app ever, looking forward to playing some new levels and the match option.',
       'Wow, awesome game. Great controls and idea. However the following levels all fall on the same points. Christmas, valentine, all about us. These levels have bad music, theme, and overall are not fun. I value the old levels more and find them much more fun to play even f2f or the millionth time than the new levels. (the maze was fine though)' ,

      'I have only had this game for a few days, so I can\'t write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it\'s up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.',
       'Man i love this game!!! So much better than wolfquest!!! I do hope tht this game soon be added new things like more animal to play as, better in performance. The ad free guys...keep it up!!! Just wondering if there\'s a add as mate system in multiplayer in the future? Anyways....this is the best wolf game tht i played!!! Do hope tht you guys one day add more animals to play as (like a snow leopard for example)',
       'Love it but pleeeeeaaaase make it possible to play as a boar or a rabbit or deer. Also I think it would be really nice to have a hunger and thirst bar because there is no real point in drinking. That way if you dont have enough food or water you start to lose health.  Also I don\'t think we really need stamina from the food we eat.  These are just suggestions but I really really love this game.  Best simulator out there.',
       'It just lags now. The new update made it to where my chat, my character, and my animations won\'t work. I run about as fast as a turtle, and I am not pregnant. Please fix!!!! I love this game. I have a few questions if you don\'t mind... Can you guys add in multi-player mode, like single player mode, that we can pick up our pups, it would be cool to add that option in the top left menu. Thank you guys so much!! Love the games!!',
       'On one of the quest, I think 11. There ia a syrange new animal and I went to the game menu for information and there wasn\'t any. It looks like a brown rabbit, I tried killing Rabbits squirrels and deer, but It wasn\'t the right animal! Is it in the snow biome?  Anyways hope you can help me and otger quest 11 users. It\'ll be great that when you get the same animal twice it counts as duplicate. For example "Wolf Common Duplicate +(however acorns). Thanks and the update is great!',
       'Could you add more animals to play as? And a world idea could be a dessert. I love this game, and the others you\'ve made, so I know you will make awesome updates soon! Keep up the good work. If you fixed the glitch were you eat and jump at the same time you fly, if you fixed that can you please put it back. It was fun... XD' ,

      'I played it a long time ago and i stopted like 5 months ago. Then now i reinstalled it and:  1. I could not enter my acc  2. I could not connect to facebook or google play.  3. I had to pay each time i danced wich sucks.  Till that update this game was the best game/app ever. It was so fun and so great that I just wanted to play nonstop.  I mean before this big update u payed for a song and u could dance on it as much as you liked. Now it just ain\'t fun anymore.   Please return to the classic game or your gonna lose much much more players like me.',
       'Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren\'t enough. And one of them didn\'t work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.',
       'I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.',
       'It\'s fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I\'m bored. I love the songs and dance moves it\'s awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it\'s awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don\'t know how to dance then you should download this game it\'s perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.',
       'Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn\'t have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!',
       'I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn\'t make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun.' ,

If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.',
       'The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don\'t get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new "enemies". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you\'ve lost some lives. But that\'s not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.',
       'I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It\'s more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.',
       'Completed all but just couldn\'t get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I\'ve ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.',
       'Amazing game reminds me of the old school games . But the only problem is the lives you give us to play. They are so few and they take a lot of time to refill. PLEASE remove the life or ball things from this game it will be the best if you do that cause I was playing and level by level I was getting exited and I wanted to rate this game 5 stars but suddenly this GAME OVER thing comes and I had to give you this ratings.please let us play without stopping and waiting for the life to come.',
       'I love this game 😍😍 it is my favourite but.... I don\'t like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it\'s a great idea😋😋 btw i loved it 😍😍😍 ill give it 5 stars then😊😊' ,

      'I think there should be option of chatting with guild members and other players not voice chatting but message ones.  There should be some research option in every guild or either there should be some Commander talent points by which we can increase some of the tactics of team & player.  Main Idea :  I think there should be some event in which 2 guilds can fight with each other & there should be option of ally & others.  I know it\'s kinda different game but it will make fun to game.   Overall this game is best and addictive,  Thanks for making this game.  Great effort by dev team.  Love you.',
       'This is a great game. My friends and I love it and it\'s probably the closest thing to PUBG that will ever be made. One thing though.. How do I add people to my guild. 😂😂😂  And considering improvements, maybe you could expand the map a bit, get it to 100 people on the map at a time but that\'s not exactly an issue, maybe something to work towards. Also, maybe add a chat room for guild members and not just the voice chat.',
       'One of the biggest online game I ever played...Graphics is a bit low and others are awesome... The Main thing I like in this game is the voice chatting with team mates... Commonly Only PC games has this program but now Android also has... And again i am saying that graphics could be a bit more good and I love playing this... Its a great game',
       'This game is so good! I love it but could you add some binding account so account will not be loss. Im in a high level almost level 37 and I accidentally delete the app then when I download the game again I cant play my old account! That\'s horrible try to fix it admin or whoever. And last thing try to put some servers country by country so we could play against other countries. Try to do this admin. I assure you that after you made this comments or suggestions this game will be the best ever!',
       'The game is developing good so far. Hope you\'ll add a feature wherein we can make a game with our friends and play against each other. It would be cooler 👍   This is a shoutout to the 5th friend that we have to sacrifice when we go play on squad lol, thanks!',
       'This game is good fun but pls can u stop peoee from running u over as when 8 get in top 3 some keeps running me over. It\'s still and amazing games but when people run u over its boring and wish u could stop people from doing this   is th8nkthere u should maybe be able to drive places but when u want to fight they have to get out and shoot and have a proper gun fight . Overall this is a great game my favourite mobile game and it\'s really enjoyable. But pls can u make people not being able to do this. Thankyou' ,

      'I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It\'s fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn\'t want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.',
       'Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It\'s reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series\' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis\'s and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I\'m offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,',
       'I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I\'d end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!',
       'Game it self is great and a ton of fun.   But, the system for showing ads is so annoying.  It\'s not just your normal video ad no, they make you watch 3 different ads and a min of 16 or 11 sec each.  After you have watched the minimum time, you have to hit next and repeat again',
       'Quite addicting. But does have partial microtransaction walls where it\'s extremely difficult to get past certain parts without forking over real money. Other than that it\'s nice. I only have two things that I think could make this game better: 1) boss battles and 2) ability to sort through parts by specific type, rather than just their standard class.',
       'The game was nice at first, the rewards system is nice and everything is noob friendly, but the most annoying thing that happened is that after I uninstalled and then reinstalled the game, all my progress and my initial account were GONE. A whole day worth of grinding down the drain. Please implement a fix for this. I want to like this, but if you\'re going to wreck my progress every time I need to uninstall, then no thanks!' ,

      'Gone to -3 Stars, since last update. The game is so hard that u can\'t even win the 2nd round in Arena without using spells!!! (Tower of fortune) is not more than a joke!!! Pig\'s gonna catch u in the very 2nd floor 6/7 times in a week. Hope that rovio think about the loyal players once, not only money!!! Going to uninstall if the bug not removed till next update!!!',
       'Great! Yoy guys made every arena match unwinnable (unless you pay gems for extra cards)!!! Your game is totally infected with hackers/cheaters!!! Arena is totally cheating money!!! 1 star? Not even 1 star! I will give 0 star for this game!!! Can you guys fix the bugs?',
       'Used to love this game. But now it seems that the developers have fallen to the PC agenda. This game used to be a distraction from the assault on my beliefs as a Christian. "BCE" and "CE" are simply part of the attempts to remove Christ from everything. Jesus Christ and I will find entertainment elsewhere. Uninstalling now!',
       'Is there any way you can let the animations skip with a tap? After a while, we don\'t need to be reminded of what just happened.',
       '1. Why does your yellow power line move slower the further you move on? It fills up and you get your bird back but you do a move that\'s almost the same with a more powerful bird on the very next move and it hardly moves. Is this the games way of cheating you out of beating it? There are hard enough moments in this game, you really don\'t need to be petty like that?  2. Why can\'t you talk 1 on 1 with clan members, like the leader, if you need to ask them something? You can\'t just ask "can I play in the big clan competition" to the leader. It would especially be helpful when your leader and none of your teammates talk in the chat when you want to get signed up to play.',
       'It\'s a lovely game. But the reward in clan even should go round. The current rewards setting, is unfair to some birds. That after all the birds participated in the even only some chosen set of birds get the feather reward. Please let is rotate.' ,

      'So far, I dig this game. Although, the individuality of it is scarce. I still play it and enjoy it. It\'s not identical to other games of this type, as the challenges are similar yet different. The scenario of the game is basic with the others. I have a variety when it comes to games, this one has similar sound affects to other games that I, personally, downloaded. (But they\'re also from the same makers.) This game is over all.... Good so far.. I would recommend, linked my account to this game and invited friends and family. (I only do so, if the game/app is worthy. I\'m a picky bull!!!!) Overall, you\'ll have fun! Cute toys and  unique power ups, with a slightly (10%) twist.',
       'Definitely addicting. The levels are challenging, the tools are fun to figure out and the reward set up is not unattainable. The only other thing is they grew more wise  for the latest update, you can\'t change the time on your phone to add lives anymore! Probably better that way, one (read: I) should pace themselves when playing....',
       'This is by far the most fun I\'ve  had with a game app! Its so cute and  colorful!  And each increase in difficulty  makes you want to keep coming back for the next challenge.  What also makes it awesome  is a no brainer,  its great for children and adults alike.  BIG THUMBS UP!',
       'Really enjoyed the game until I was entered in a two week tournament.  Now, the boards are incredibly difficult and I can no longer earn prizes on a regular basis. Of course, I suppose that\'s by design so I spend money. Which I won\'t do. I just want some "bubblegum" to past the time.  Now, it\'s making my blood pressure rise...  Also amazing how many 5 ⭐ ratings they get in one day without the user giving explanations on why. Seems suspicious...',
       'Really an exciting game. But there is a small problem. Sometime when I run the game it\'s not response (all animation are moving, but it isn\'t resopnse when I press the screen) , so I have to close it and run it again many times till it response. Hopefully you will fix this problem ASAP. Thanks!',
       'No really, if there were 100 stars this game and developer would get it! A word of warning....IT\'S ADDICTIVE!! if you ever reach the end of the game ( which is very doubtful) you might have to suffer "withdrawals" or you could play one of the other games...' ,

      'It\'s a fun game but the developers have made it difficult to advance high level characters unless you want to buy "chances" to get the necessary items to advance.  When I first started playing the game the items were easier to get, now the items are VERY rare to get and more difficult to get. Most of the reward items are basic items you get just from playing the basic levels.  There\'s no real incentive to getting the treasures chests because they don\'t give valuable items.',
       'It\'s a fun game. The challenges and levels are interesting and keep getting harder. But if you resource well and plan your strategies, you can play a lot smoother.   Only thing I don\'t like is the recent update... I now cannot play my regular levels. I can only do the Titan challenge and the raids... please fix ♡',
       'Absolutely love this game but my screen has now gone black after loading. Cant play it any more. Why has this happened? If i uninstall and reinstall will i start all over again? Very unhappy. 😯 Update: restarted tablet and is now working perfectly yeah 😁',
       'You totally ruined the raids.  Now it always puts you against higher players and gives them massive turns.  You messed it up it your newest update. No way to win and totally unbalanced.  You waste massive food never to get anyone your level and lose massive trophies. Bad bad bad',
       'This was great to start with, now I\'m getting in to the game I\'m finding most of my shots miss. Played one game misses about 15 shots in a row...... Its just stupid and since the update its got worse and the game is crashing alot too.',

      'Dear Pretty Simple,      I am a Criminal Case player, and I love this game! This was really enjoyable, great and fun! I hope their will be a 5th criminal case, and it will be named CRIMINAL CASE: ANIMAL PET INVESTIGATION .... Please... And the killer will be predator, and the victim would be pray, and all the officers, deputies, the doctors, and the other investigators will be all Animal pets.... Please... This is only my request and suggestion.. I hope you will read this... And i hope that my suggestion will be realize or to become true.. Because criminal case was very good and fun... I hope you understand me cuz i am only a 13 year old kid and I love animals so much... Thank you... I hope you can read my letter...😊😊😊😍😍  Sincerely yours, A player of Criminal Case',
       'This is all I needed: another Criminal Case game to take up my free time! I love the whole four of them. The the hidden objects tease my brain to no end. Each game  is intriguing with an original story line. I do have my favorite crime scenes,  and plenty of friends(all over the world) whom play as often as they can too!',
       'It would be nice if you level up and get full energy but your energy had some if not all left before you got it restored that you just increased by the full amount, the way it is now I lose energy when levelling up because it doesnt add any more to the 110 that is standard. I dont think it is fair to those of us who play daily. I never know when my pet will find that last batch of XP and cause the level up to happen. If I am over the 110 already, I don\'t even see the new energy. Some concessions need to be made for this. I love the game though, it is fun and challenging.',
       'DONT BOTHER WITH THIS GAME Played for 10 minutes before I ran out of energy, which you need to earn stars to progress! Then have to wait ages for it to recharge.  OR......pay to top it up. Don\'t think so. UNINSTALL IMMINENT',
       'I love this game. I have all of the criminal case games & love them all. The only things that I don\'t like is that when when ur energy gets refilled, it only adds to what u have, instead of adding an extra 110 to what u have. The other thing is that u can\'t buy none of the hamburgers, orange juice, chips or anything with ur tokens',
       '4th instalment of the Criminal Case games. I love playing them all excellent time wasters intriguing story lines. I\'m well & truly hooked on the whole series. Gainsborough, Pacific Bay, Save The World & now this Mysteries Of The Past........ all brilliant' ,

      'lnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'I love the game play and graphics. But I payed for adidas female clothing and an aquarium previously on the game, and then when I restarted, they have gone. I spend £3 on it in total and I actually spent more money on other things that didn\'t come back in the next game, but it\'s understandable because they were lifestyle points and you know it\'s currency not clothing or furniture. I uninstall sims sometimes a bit of always go back and before my items were there, but now they\'re not and that really frustrated me. I actually ended up in 2017 spending  £10 on sims freeplay and that\'s the only money I think I will ever spend on ot now because if you restart,  you don\'t get anything you wanted. Please fix this because I spent that money and I could\'ve bought something else with it but I didn\'t because I like sims.',
       'Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools "playable",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it\'d be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.',
       'First, I don\'t like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don\'t like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you\'re just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!',
       'im not sure what\'s the cause of the problem but what i know is the sims\' act a lil bit freaky. i just redownloaded this game bcs i cant log in this game before bcs i just updated it. before this, the sims is ok, but now they act really awkward. when they\'re walking, they legs dont even move! it\'s like they\'re flying, plus when they\'re doing any action like "clean the dishes", they dont move, they just stand still in front of the sink. this is freaky. please reply to my review bcs i really want to know more about this. i really like this game except what i said above. this game is really addicting:).',
       'I think the game it self is FANTASTIC,  I LOVE IT!! Allthough, I think this is a prob , I wanted to age my baby sim . But the problem is , that if i go , it says i have to pass level 12 and do a quest . Im fine with that , but im level 13 (nearly 14) And the quest hasnt come up yet . I think its bc i have to finish all the quest i need to , to do the toldder quest . Hope all is allright . Anyways , as i sais before , This game is my life! And keep up the good work!!' ,

      'Just way too many ads. Eventually you start having to watch an ad after every second other level. Its a free game, so I get it but the levels are so quick sometimes I\'m watching more than I am playing. Fun game, though. Easy controls and great graphics and sound.',
       'Good fun and very addictive. I see people moaning about the adds 😧 but what can you expect from a free game? You get an add pop up after about 5 puzzles and to be honest it is only for a few seconds....just close it if you don\'t want to see them.',
       'This game is outstanding. Love the graphics, simple to understand. Some appear quite easy and then you suddenly get a level that looks like it should be but has you scratching your head for AGES!!! Love it. I can live with the adverts, just wish i could put the phone down.',
       'This game is sooooo frustrating that the game made me through my phone on the ground. If you are good with controlling your stress then you should try it. But if your not good at controlling your stress then do not get it.',
       'I usually can find something "wrong" with almost any app or game, but this is about as close to perfect as I\'ve played or used. I did not find the ads to be *nearly* as bothersome as most games. Good stuff!!',
       'I saw this game on a advert on tap tap dash and started playing the advert I became obsessed with it and felt that when it finished I would have to get it. Ever since I downloaded it I became more and more addicted to it. I highly recommend this app' ,

      'It\'s nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it\'s not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It\'s just not fair.',
       'I loved flow free from a young age. I\'ve played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I\'ve tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs',
       'Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.',
       'The best, the OG, the original puzzle time-passer! (second only to Tetris) I love this game, I\'ve been playing it for years! The original starts to get boring after awhile, but with all the different variations they come out with, it never gets old. A very fresh experience with one of the recent updates, feels much more refined when compared to the one I used to play.',
       'Was a great game until about 48 hours ago. I didn\'t mind the ads but now after every level I complete there\'s a video ad. Even then I would deal with it but it closes my music player. So after the ad I have to go to the music player and start it again but then when I switch back to the game I have to relaunch and reselect the level. Gets annoying to have to do after every level',
       'Fantastic game. Real addiction game I\'d say. It\'s an awesome time killer. Different types of levels never make the game boring. Graphics is okay. Number of ads for a free to play game is less compared to other games out in the market which is a relief.Overall I would give 4.5/5' ,

      'Don\'t want to play hours of boring levels to get to (hopefully) more difficult stuff. I would have no issue if the levels were at least different from each other. It takes merely 10 seconds to get through the starting levels but there are just too many. It\'s wasteful.',
       'I think it\'s a great app because if your bored just play on it you don\'t even need Wi-Fi plus I like the music on it so that you don\'t even need to put music on your phone so you don\'t have any probs that is why I think it is the best game...five stars anybody else?',
       'I have seen Rickimus and Mortonimers shenanigans at least a million times, so it was no suprise that I completed the game faster than it could even load. Good way to save a few brain cells though.',
       'I like the game although the challenge level really depends on the person. My dad and i were playing and I can click a starting point and just kinda go with the flow but not be able to go and redo the level while he would be like woah what was that?😂 So yea great game :)',
       'It\'s a good game, but needs more levels. Also I\'d like to not be asked every 2 minutes to rate your game 5 stars',

      'Got to the moon in 2 tries,  mars took longer, though it was mars one way, Venus was a challenge. Now I want more, haha, fun game. Encourages innovation. Idea: with persistent modules already in the game, why not allow orbital modules like a space station? Or missions where you need to put a satellite into orbit. How about reusable rocket stages? Updates just make the game better.',
       'I am so addicted to this game. I love everything about it. I just wish there was a place to donate to you (developer). Also, I would love it if there were more rocket parts. Also, I wish there was a thermosphere you had to get through to get on planets. All in all, I love it! Can\'t get enough!  Edit: Thank you so much for the reply. I\'m sorry I wasn\'t clear on the thermosphere part, but i think the reentry effect would be lovely. I just can\'t stop playing. And I\'m SOOOO excited about rovers and things! Thank you so much again! :)',
       'Bee looking for a game like for my entire years ! this is the best rocket game, I have ever seen in my life travelling to space , I like the sound system , formation of building materials is compatible ,graphics are excellent to the 2D platform . I like the physics of the game. Please keep it , ur the best Space programmer of all times (GOAT). Is it possible to add a space shuttle and moon rover ?    Regards. Please fix up batrrey issues . my phone heats up a lot .',
       'Trajectory in orbit I really love this game you made. It would be cool if you could make the rocket face the direction of it\'s trajectory during orbit. Edit: Can you add re-entry effects when going to other planets? It would be more realistic. Also add heat shields for re entry situations. And when is docking gonna come? Hopefully in the next update.',
       'I truly enjoy this game. There is a learning curve at the beginning if you\'re going to have a successful mission. However, soon enough you\'ll be traveling the Stars. This game is challenging enough to keep you interested. You are solely in control of all of your missions, which I like because I don\'t feel like I\'m forced to jump through hoops to get to the next level. Very well designed. Now for the real reason why I\'m sending this review... Designers, please move the engine ignition button away from the acceleration bar. Too many accidental engine ignitions while trying to adjust engine power.',
       'Awesome work with this new updates.  I have an idea. Maybe you\'ve already thought of it.  Multiple engines under the same fuel tank.  For instance, I\'m trying to reenact the Falcon Heavy, but because you can only put one engine under each fuel tank, I had to put several boosters to reach the required thrust/weight ratio.  If we could put multiple engines under a single fuel tank, I wouldn\'t need more boosters.  Maybe, something for the future.' ,
    recentChanges: 
      'This update brings improvements to the build system.',
       'Parts now smoothly snap to each other.',
       'Parts now try to not be placed one on another.',
       'This an many other small changes I made should make building a LOT easier.',
       'Please keep giving me feedback about the build system, I still read all the reviews.',
       'Added side facing nose cones (under utility).',
       'Fixed performance issues.',
       'Fixed bug that caused some parts to load incorrectly.',
       'Sorry for so many updates, but this are things that I need to fix.' ,

      'What is this???? After every 1 or 2 game when the main menu comes I touch screen just frozes I can\'t even touch any button. Neither I can play nor I can go to shop it\'s nothing I can do but just to quit the game. My phone is Samsung S6  Pls do something it\'s really irritating',
       'This is a nice idea for a game but needs a lot of work. First of i couldn\'t even understand how the game works. Always saying "connection is slow" every damn time. Controls? Terrible. Before i even learn how to move i get eaten. Please look into these and you might have a good game there.',
       'fix the laaags please. I have high speed internet but still facing lags. I spent a lot in this game and don\'t want to loose it. Still lagging :(. It works with only high speed internet. Can\'t play with the data packages only strong wifi.  You didn\'t fix this in the new edition of the game and the rush mode is not working. The new party is sucks big time. Fix fix fix',
       'Ok. are you kidding me? i payed my money to get rid of advertisement and all the sudden it reappears again. i purchased some coins to get rid of advertisement and its still there. BEWARE PLAYERS: this is a bait. it wont made the ads go away. ads will also appear out of nowhere during my gameplay. delete it now',
       'If one of you game Creators survives more than 5 mins in that game where everyone is teaming up I will rate the game 5 stars again... Half of times i respawn  i get eaten before even the game starts. And one time i payed the X3 for 1 hour i was ever respawning on viruses . The game is nice but the performance is not nice.',
       'The game is way too glitched and it is frustrating. Any time I try to use the joystick it would go to another place on the screen, and other times would make my blob automatically go somewhere without me even using the joystick. If it is just my device making the game buggy then is it still possible to fix somehow? Please let me know.' ,

      'Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.',
       'Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I\'ve progressed it\'s just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I\'m not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!',
       'Fun at first, but you have to pay a lot of real money for it to stay fun. Otherwise you have to wait weeks and months to progress. Some events can only be fully completed by spending hundreds of dollars (yeah, that much). Not worth it. If you have that much money, use it on something better than this. Improve your life, use your time better, don\'t waste it here. Good luck!',
       'I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I\'ve already dumped into this game and the devs didn\'t give me my in game rewards. I\'ve submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.',
       'Wasn\'t sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to "farm gold,xp,mats". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it\'s an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don\'t be jealous, just play your game and have fun.',
       'Honestly gameplay and all is good but the game is so p2w it\'s not funny, it would cost u over a hundred dollars just to complete every reward for new Valentine\'s event. If you like this game play private server instead this version is a giant cash grab. Not competitive for f2p at all' ,

      'I love this game. Amazing sound effects, graphics. You guys did a great job that\'s for sure! But still couldn\'t give it a five star because of the lastest update. The entire screen goes black after playing the game for 5-6 minutes. That\'s pretty irritating not to mention how much slower the phone gets as well. Didn\'t have these issues with the last update. Fix it please!',
       'The VERY best game EVER..so fast to level up... Never boring.. Always SO much to do!!! ... it NEVER asks 4 money !!!!!!   NO pop ups or commercials. !!!. . the inventors are genius... i Love this game..  thank you for making this game.. Graphics are Amazing!!!   Best farming game ...Bonus Zoo !!!...and breed ur animals ADORABLE BABIES.. with a splash of Cityville  ..Gold digging..making ingots to use...  So many optional tournaments if u want to win more money n prizes in the Regattas... Township friends make it SO much easier n fast 4 everyone  .. and so much more You just HAVE TO Try TOWNSHIP ❣💞',
       'The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen',
       'RSYFJH Great game very addictive, and I don\'t know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats\'s kind of ridiculous. That\'s the only bad thing I have to say about this game.',
       'BEST GAME EVER! It\'s my biggest game but even though I have an old phone the game still runs really smoothly. There\'s always something to do, it never gets boring. I\'ve been playing for 8 months. Super easy to use and learn. It\'s addictive. You also don\'t feel pressured to make purchases like other games.',
       'This game needs the ability to gain more township cash. I have spent way too much real money to buy township cash and im not doing so again at this rate. Farmville isnt this bad and hard to expand.  You cant expand the barn without waiting on products by train or paying in township cash to expand. And that costs over a couple hundred township cash for each expansion. Getting a dollar or two here and there takes forever to collect. Plus the expansion makes small expansions so it doesnt help much.   If something dont change i may quit the game. I enjoy it and would like to continue but at this rate i dont see much point. I cant afford to pay more money to play.' ,

      'Lost all of my bikes when I re-download the app. It shows the 500+ wins I have, but I don\'t even see a way to get the basic ones unlocked again without paying for their stupid VIP package. It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven\'t bothered to update this in years.',
       'Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can\'t stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn\'t happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can\'t buy any of the bikes.',
       'After only playing a few short but addicting levels, I am already having a blast! The game may not look spectacular on a technical level. But the gameplay is so freaking fun! And the controls aren\'t too complicated either. Recommended for everyone!',
       'It\'s a fun little game at first, but has many, many flaws. You have to link it to your Facebook account if you wanna play all maps. There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can\'t play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That\'s just ridiculous. Not to mention it\'s very buggy. Sometimes you\'re racing someone who\'s in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it\'s just stupid.',
       'Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you\'re racing friends.',
       'Bugs and Glitches... Multiplayer links are not being sent back and forth properly. Some games keep giving me desert level 1 and not showing any replays or ghost bikes are doing a different levels then the one I am suppose to be racing against. Please Fix!!!' ,

Sorry, game crashed. Good game, right until it sucks. Would even be enticed to spend a little real cash if the game money I should be earning would actually be there. But alas no, the game crashed.',
       'Gave 3 stars on some area because i lost my city and i don\'t know what happened and how i can get it back. I hope someone from game dev will help and I\'ll the game a full 5 star rating.',
       'I don\'t want to be rude but all you have to do is click..... couldn\'t you add we\'re you can add your own buildings and get money of that maybe take some ideas from Simpson\'s tapped out plus there\'s no reward for anything but if u improve the game add characters and quest in mine I will start playing more',
       'This game in my opinion is the best game out there cause you really don\'t have to pay for everything you can earn diamonds on the regular and a good amount of coins you don\'t have to wait weeks or months to earn and build and evolve if I was going to put this game in a category it would be the equile category because your treated and earn everything equally I more then love this game because of that not because of the addiction this game has the style and features and momentum that no other game will ever have thank you so much' ,

      'Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn\'t really feel like you\'re getting anywhere.',
       'I really enjoy playing this game but it takes far too long to progress. Gems are way too far and few between to enable you to \'buy\' better vehicles to defeat the boss. Then you have to also use more gems to get weapons! If you don\'t spend money it takes a long time to get anywhere. If there were more gems available this game would be a 5 star game.',
       'Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it\'s only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that\'s bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it\'s a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I\'ll rate 5 star$',
       'For as repetitive as it is I can\'t seem to put it down, it\'s seriously addictive. Maybe it\'s the great graphics or the fact it reminds me of one of my old favs arcade game  Spyhunter. A few small things I would fix are; needs a running diamond total during race to see how many you\'ve picked up. A better garage showing a side angle of your car so you can see the paint jobs and rims better and the most needed item is when you click on your profile pick there NEEDS to be a experience total! Just having the circle showing your experience isn\'t enough, I\'d like an actual number total. Also another mode to think about is maybe a side scrolling mode or overhead track mode like Grand Prix 2. All in all great graphics, music and replayability!',
       'Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me',
       'Starts out fun but then you need to spend serious cash to upgrade . Takes for to refuel and a ton of gems to upgrade vehicle. Game is getting slow and old. Also stuck on Zoom mode on Galaxy 8 plus. It\'s impossible to play!' ,

      'This game is amazing! Everyone needs to play this. I would\'ve given a fifth star however you need to not only buy all XXL sharks to unlock the "!!" Sharks but max them out. Definitely download this, just one tip. Don\'t delete when you have progress. I\'ve downloaded, played, got bored, and deleted 3 times. Now I\'m never deleting it. I have so much progress, if I never deleted it the first time I would have everything in the game',
       'Finally! For the the longest time I\'ve been waited, the gaming performance has been improved! No more annoying lag and the gameplay feel a lot smoother now and I am so happy about it. But the graphics still needs to be improved because it doesn\'t look too good and some minor bug needs to be fixed.',
       'Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it\'s so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I\'ve had to start all over again... but the fun continues!',
       'This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don\'t play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don\'t make us wait foreverrrr!',
       'It\'s a fun game and I\'m enjoying it. However, I\'ve come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.',
       'Fun time waster, can get quite a lot sunk into it, and get e erything without paying up. Glad its always been grindable. Just has had trouble connecting for saves. I lost everything a couple years ago before they had cloud saves... They\'re here now and aside from a logout/in they are wonderous afaik. Good stuff!' ,

      'Great game, probably best talking animal game out for adults n kids... but sometimes u watch a video so u can spin the wheel n win gems or coins but the wheel not always comes up... ive had approx. 20x it has not happened in last 4 hrs... would like it redeemed n fixed plz...',
       'Really fun game. My 2 year old adores Hank. The only thing that I feel is missing is a way to save your progress to the cloud. My phone needed to be reset a couple times and we had to start over. Didn\'t mind so much because hank as a puppy is much cuter.',
       'I like this new update. Hanks now have His own happy meter like Tom and Angela. Nice. Also this is just my suggestion. Can you guys also make My Talking Ben and My Talking Ginger. Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that\'s it. You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It\'s not fair. Lastly good job guys.',
       'My three year old grand daughter got around my password and charged $40 of in app purchases and did a monthly subscription, too. I have gone through everything to try to remedy this, with no help from the customer service from the this apps developer.',
       'I hate this game when I download it as I came to level 15 hank turns in a kid and looks like a road pup his face 😫😫😫😫 is very. Bad I can,t see his face any more road pups also look good  but hank is 😫😫😫 when he is in level 1 to 14 at that time he looks normal but at 15 😫😫😫 all other games. Talking games are good but hank is not 😫😫 please let hank good not like a road dog please .😫😫😫😫',
       'I absolutely love the game,  but I have one question. ...why is it called "talking hank"? Hank doesn\'t say a freaking word!!! I realize that it\'s a spin off of "talking tom", it\'s just an observation and is a little annoying. .. otherwise GREAT, GREAT GAME.' ,

      'YOU GUYS ACTUALLY LISTENED!!! Im so happy right now because when I saw theres a new update, I immediately downloaded it to see if I can play it without crashing. I can actually play it now with my friends! A little bit of framrate drop but still... I can play this wonderful game. Im going to totally recommend this game to my friends. The devs of this game are the best devs in the Google Play Store. Again, Im truely greatful and I thank you guys. :D',
       'Hello! I\'ve seen this game many times from the ads and I tried installing it and later found that this game was really intertaining and fun. Anyways, I am having problems with the game\'s connectivity to the internet. I am using 4G in playing the game and it seems that it does not connect very well, other online games connect well to the internet. I think that is the only issue I have in mind. Just hoping for more smoothness though.. But I love the game, it is worth the time playing. Thank you!!',
       'I dont know why you chosen Retro style graphic and i hope for a change. There is a lot of IRANIAN players but PING is over 250ms and too much delay. Add iran flag. Google play sign-in is not working. Add more skins. Events are just bunch of objectives and prizes, add more artworks and stuff for events. Other things are good for now. Thanks for the revolutionary IO game. Congratulation on 10million downloads 💝',
       'simple, fun, addictive gameplay, good graphic with unique animations, great events that keep players active which is good, have great potential. dark adventure loading still takes too long, i already dead when the loading is finished. crashing and some bugs in event tab. talking about awaken system, man atleast dont downgrade the stars or reduce the percentage of downgrade, finding awaken item is already damn hard. this great game need new character and more feature but not p2w. keep the good work barbarq !!',
       'It is the best game I\'ve ever played! With simple graphics and gameplays, you won\'t notice how long you\'ve played! Generous with presents daily and very recommended to spend time. However with the new update, I can\'t connect and it stayed on connecting. Tried to change internet source, but to no avail it\'s still there.  I would like to ask the developers, to reply as soon  as possible, on what should I do to get rid of this problem.',
       'Feels like lots of players are AI bots. I\'ve won my first 10 matches with a 10+ holyshit mega kill every time. Looks a bit pay to win as a champ you must buy has a very OP skill. The amount of awakening to hit 5 and get the extra skill is astronomical and will require money to be spent. Also, not one person is speaking English. It\'s all Spanish/Portuguese.' ,

      'Hey RobTop, the game is ok, but there is one issue. im used to playing geometry dash with my samsung chromebook 3 (it doesn\'t have touchscreen) and when i press the spacebar on my computer (this is the same issue on geometry dash lite and subzero) it doesn\'t let me jump. And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.',
       'Got all the way to the end,  and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow,  and ended up having to restart all of the levels,  fix this,  it doesn\'t happen with the other geometry dash games,  just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted...  Fix then 5 stars',
       'When I heard that this was out, I rushed to the Play Store, freed up my storage and installed this app. This is fantastic, as I had been craving for 2.1.

      'Can I request you have a different way of changing your password? My reason is because I got hacked and my email address is not working on it! Overall a great game but please change how you change password to make it easier! For the people who don\'t know their email I am there for you! Also could you have one year vip less expensive plz thanks!',
       'I like playing this game although i find that male characters do not have many long hair/ girl hair options available to buy unless you are vip or have diamonds. I think i speak for many people when i say that boys and girls should have more hair options from the opposite sex, for starcoins, as some people may take offense if they are strictly only allowed "boys hair"/ "girls hair" unlsss they are paying for it. I think you could inmprove further by making it easier to earn starcoins and another way to earn diamonds because many people do not want to/ cannot afford to BUY items in a fictional world.. Overall, i think this is a well rounded game, with a few improvement points, however i enjoy being able to have my own unique style in a virtual world :)',
       'Become the best star on movie star planet! Message your friends and meet new people create art books and take photos ,make awesome movies starring your friends ! But can map add a private photo send so only People  you know well can see your photos! Thank you if you can x and please add more things to app x',
       'Great game honestly, I\'ve been playing it for about 4 years now (since I was about 9), and the concept of meeting new people, being creative and having fun all at the same time is absolutely perfect! But just one thing, please could you make the artbooks more compatible with phones and tablets? I ask this, because whenever I\'m not on my laptop, I\'m usually using my phone. Sometimes, when I\'m on my phone, i decide to play MSP, and I like to make cute artbooks or edits from the artbook page on my phone - however, there\'s no choice to CHANGE the moviestar\'s clothes, MODIFY their facial expression or make them do an animation. If I zoom them in, they\'ll freeze and end up not performing any animation I have chosen. Thank you for your time, have a great day!',
       'I\'m always on the game. Even at night I\'m wide awake just wish mine update.... I am now having problems. I want to make a new account but it says may not contain ur username BUT IT Doesn\'t ik that u will fix ot soon but plz hurry!',
       'This game is very boring! And why do the avatar have big head! Please fix this game not to be disrespectful but its really discussing when they try to ask for your password I hate to and can make the avatars 3D' ,

      'This game is wack. You can\'t reinforce your clan members. You can\'t send resources to your clan members. But after you start playing this game they start asking for your real money about 10 minutes in to it. Why would anyone spend real money to play a game after just 10 minutes? This game is no where near that good. Lol. I deleted it after 3 days. Not a game I would reinstall.',
       'Dont play this game, i binded my account to facebook and cant get back into it because the login in the game doesnt work. Ive tried getting a hold of developers, using in game help and gave reviews hoping for something to help me but of coarse they never reply so dont waste your time',
       'There are a few changes I would make to the game play. Since I upgraded my city the background glitches. Wish I knew how to another alliance or create my own. Kinda bad when my alliance members are all the way across the board from my city if I was to be attacked. The members don\'t attend much and don\'t make a enough of an effort to upgrade their city or help defend your city. When your city power and level is greater than the leader of the alliance..... time to be moving on and creating your own!',
       'Low rating bec it sucks when you have 10k power and someone with 80k + power and his clan attack you every day. Should be a range of power attacks on each other. Already had 4 of my clan leave and that was just today. DON\'T WASTE YOUR TIME',
       'Only thing I would change is make it possible to upgrade a little at a time(ability to pause/stop upgrade, hopefully without losing progress). Once you hit level 11 or so, the game can only be played a few minutes a day.',
       'C\'mon...look at what you guys had done? So many bugs after the latest update the stereo speaker was used to give free diamonds and now giving money???? What the...don\'t be so greedy like that Zero star' ,

      'My daughter loves this game and plays it all the time. I just bought her all of the last babies today for her to have them all and the bottle freezes and she can\'t play with her new babies. If someone could fix this for me or refund me that would be great. I just got 6 new babies and she can\'t use any of them which is ashame cause she loves this game.',
       'Bought all the babies when I first downloaded the app. Everything was working great. So when the most recent (3) babies were available for purchase I bought them, but now those babies don\'t work!.... I\'ll give five stars when you get them to work. In the meantime, I think I should get a refund on my money.',
       'I would like to give a better rating, since my 3yld loves this app.  But the newest babies are not working and there is no support on the Disney app page.  Would love to get this issue reported and fixed before they try to screw everyone over with 3 more dolls that freeze the game.',
       'Bought the game early on, then after an update with new babies they mixed the new babies in.  So you are left with a child constantly wanting the new babies.  A horrible money grab.  Otherwise a fun game.  Shoyld not show the locked babies mixed in with purchased ones.',
       'Dang, I wish the purchases I made on 6 more babies for my daughter would just work! She loves the app, but gets frustrated that the whole app freezes when she clicks to play one of the other babies. Wouldn\'t recommend this app because of that... it\'s just stealing my money..',
       'Like the others have mentioned - good game, daughter loves it but bought the 3 new babies and now itnjust freezes any time she tries to select them. Waste of £1.59 or however much they were and no means of refund or correcting it.' ,

      'Love the game, easy to understand and they have videos on how to use the equipment and make ur farm expand. Also, their customer service is great!!  Recently my phone was stole and had to get a new phone.  Familyfarm helped me recover my farm within a couple of days.  Their services were quick and resourceful.',
       'This game was good and fine then it crashed and when I reopened it it had lost all my progress from level 36 to 21. What a waste of time so annoyed. How the hell do i get my game back? It looks like it connected to a Facebook account and loaded an old game but I don\'t gave the option to disconnect. So frustrated!',
       'Fun game, but...What happened?  Don\'t like the snow,  it lightened all the colors of everything, they are not as vivid as they usually are.. With cataracts,  too hard on eyes,  all print got really small and can\'t read anymore.  Will have to quit til eyes get fixed.',
       'I love the game and have played it for almost 5 years now but for some reason it will not connect to facebook. Not sure what happened in the last update. Hopefully it gets fixed soon. I would hate if my phone got messed up and my progress is not saved',
       'PLEASE HELP,  my pet is somehow stuck & I can\'t get him free. Makes it harder not being able to move paths or his home whiles he\'s out or I could get him unstuck.   Please make an update where you can move these things while pets are out, or get my pet unstuck for me. Otherwise I won\'t be able to continue the game due the the inconvenience it\'s making.   (other then that the game is real fun & would like to continue it.)',
       'It\'s hard to progress in the game without enough RC (Ranch Cash) so I\'m basically stuck with the same quests for some time now. Not worth playing if you don\'t have it for the required items and you have to pay for more RC.' ,

      'This game was great until the most recent update now I dont play as much. Only being able to save 25 cupcakes when before tgere was no limit IS terrible! I\'ve purchased boost to pass a level & several times when I\'ve used them the game freezes so I lose the boost. I contacted customer service got a generic response & no refund but they want me to rate their service 🤔 no thanks! I loved the game before but not so much now!!',
       'Would of gave full marks but on a few cooking appliances when I tap on it doesn\'t work. Second I think it would help if you could carry money over from one country to another and convert currency. Some of the levels are hard to achieve and you don\'t earn enough power ups and spoons to help you through the levels plus restore lives take ages. Customer waiting is to quick.',
       'Ar first I was going to rate this well, it lets you get several levels in without pressure to buy the cheats, aka power ups.  That quickly changes though when you reach levels that must be executed flawlessly and without any delay what so ever. We\'re talking playing 100% perfectly in every way.  Enter the power ups. They go from optional cheats to required if you\'re a mear human. That\'s how they make their money.',
       'The game very addictive ... should be able to keep money you earned on next level... on some levels when cooking makes it almost impossible to earn enough points to beat the level... I\'ve been so close at times by a point or two and still lose tht level not enough customer to earn points..... I really enjoy it but this needs some adjustments...',
       'It is a great game and very fun to play but just needs a little more to it. The one thing I can\'t figure out is why do we keep getting coins if we can\'t use them to purchase anything after you get all the upgrades on your ingredients. There should be a use for them or stop giving us coins in the rewards of each day. I wish there more things to buy or if the coins could be transferred to the next level or something. Okay thanks. P.S. I was just enjoying this game until you guys decided to cut my cup cakes down to 25 only so that means I have been saving mine only to know that after I use them up I can only get 25 at a time well that sucks and I hope you change that back if not my time with this game has come to an end.',
       'Was a great,  fun game,  but now with the new Update things will not download.  I\'ve sent emails to them and nothing has change.  I did receive an email back asking to rate their and of course I told them you don\'t want me to rate something I never received!!  Can\'t open game,  this issue has gotten worse!!😡' ,

      'Great, addictive game! However, real fast, I was wondering how the free box worked. I always hope for something real good but ALWAYS end up with either raw materials or ONE coin. Now don\'t get me wrong, I LOVE getting free stuff, it just seems like the "spinner" purposefully chooses raw materials. Like, it\'s not random like it seems; it never chooses anything close to a weapon! In any case, I cannot play this game enough, very very fun!',
       'Honestly ive been waiting for close to 2 months. This game was like crack for me until the update left me no nice place, no hard earned stuff. I dont mind starting from the bottom again but at least give me some perks. This game is worth every cent and time. But until i get my account back or my stuff back im leaving 2 stars when really this game should be 5 stars all the time. I wont be playing this game til then. Thanks for the good times.',
       'The game doesn\'t load!!! 1.) There\'s nothing wrong with my internet connection! I don\'t have any problems playing RIFT, LOTRO, Neverwinter, Aura Kingdom, Allods Online, etc. or any of my other Google Play apps on my internet connection! 2.) Using Task Manager doesn\'t work! 3.) My device has way more than 200 MB of free space on it! 4.) I haven\'t been able to play for 14 days now!!! 5.) Jurassic Survival looks more promising since there are no loading problems!!!! >:(',
       '**UPDATE** Was an awesome game. Could use a few more perks (ie. Weapons and hard to get items) in drop boxes and yellow zones.Now the down side is if you die in a level your last position is no longer there to try and recoup some of your items. Players killing you as you open trunks in inventory screen. With that I think I am done with this game. Oh ya and the free spin box...give random prizes instead of coins and rope. People will get really into it if perks are awesome.',
       'Love the game addictive great grafx but after 2 months of playing getting up to level 77 and not being able to craft Chopper, Refined Furnace among many other items unless you pay real money and then you have only a chance at 1 part of those. There is a free item every hour or so but have yet to get anything of use from it.  sadness me deeply.',
       'I love the game. It\'s awesome. But I do have a few questions. Why are the bunker cards so extremely difficult to find? I\'ve been looking for days killing every zombie possible and looking through every crate without finding the cards. Also. Why isn\'t there a disclaimer that says if you die in the game, everything you purchased will be lost? I think that would be extremely necessary so no one over spends their money. Other than that, absolutely smooth running, fantastic graphics, and realistic deaths. I love every aspect except I can\'t find these darn bunker key cards.' ,

       'Used to be my favorite game.  The latest update completely changed the character of the game.  The ball is faster, bouncier, and everything is smaller, and it all adds to just randomness.  The AI got worse at the same time, so it\'s not really harder... just more random.  I now find that this game stresses me out instead of helping me relax, so I have to give it up.',

And I get even more coins. It\'s really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and' ,

      'It remains a classic, yet some parts are just too screwed up. After paying to remove the ads, the ad hoes with the play button still show up. The vase breaker was my favourite in the past. Now it is broken. 65% of the time ir reads actap like a double tap making it utterly unplayable',
       'It was good but then this happened. I was playing just like any other day. My phone had died while I was playing, so I charged it and left it untouched for about an hour or two. When I signed in, all off my progress was erased! Please respond and tell me what happened.',
       'The game was great than EA got to it with there sticky fingers and put adds everywhere, it isn\'t the same game I enjoyed ages ago. It\'s just another add infested game now, even if you do pay for it l. The charm is gone',
       'Irritating. At first it gives you an option of playing a video to receive additional help. Which works only for the first time. Next time onwards no way to cancel the video in case you don\'t want to install it. It is so frustrating. Either allows to cancel or tell the users what to do next. Worst way of promoting other apps.',
       'Why ask people to pay to have ads removed and still have so many features that you need to watch ads for? It just seems like a rip off to me very disappointed in this purchase',
       'I had to update it so I did and when I wanted to play after that, it says "watch video to get extra seed slot" WHICH I ALREADY PAID FOR WITH THE COINS I COLLECTED ALL THESE TIMES. Even before the update, it has so many ads but this is much worse. Definitely not happy with the update.' ,

      'It\'s a cool game, it just could be better and maybe there could be some other things in the update. Don\'t take it seriously! I\'m not trying to be mean but maybe there could be some other leotards and the update and some more hair dues because all of those buns and people may not like that\'s just buns people may want the braids that you always have in your other games. I mean the French braids and they keep going down into a braid, all those things would be nice!',
       'I downloaded this game for my little sister and the first thing she said was that there are way too many adverts and I agree because whenever she clicked on say the dress up or nail salon or gym and adverts would always come up. The game also lags too much even though she has a brand new IPad. However at this time I would not recommend this game. My sister said that she would play the game again if you reduce and have a limited amount of adverts. As well as the advert problems the game keeps telling me to buy everything and it pops up every time I think when you press the \'X\' button it shouldn\'t show again. Please fix this now. As much as my sister loves this game the adverts really annoy her. Would not recommend this game!!',
       'This is from my daughter, "I like the game but there\'s some things about it I kind of don\'t understand. Some of the controls are a little difficult like the one where you have to tap 1 or tap 2 when she\'s practicing. And its fun. Some of it I like a lot."   This is from me, "the app is annoying until you buy it. It downloaded a ton of icons (ads for other games) to my picture gallery without informing me. My daughter likes the game a lot and it\'s fun, but a bit intrusive with the free version. The gameplay is good overall."',
       'It was reqlly fun to play but it really repetitive doing the same thing! I wish the  vault and beam comes out and maybe a freeplay side of the game then a stroy and aslo bigger events!',
       'It is the best game i ever had!!!...the reviews says ut has so many ads..i had just a simple solution: just turn off your wifi or mobile data..and then u can play this without an ad...the problem i am interfering was just the purchasing item..u have to buy ut first...welp...this is the best!!!',
       'I\'ve always loved gymnastics, but have never found a game like this, fun to play, addicting, and not too childish. I really love this game!' ,

It says it failed because I would not allow them access to my friends list. Something doesn\'t seem right about that. Never had a game NOT allow me to login, after denying access to my friends list. Sorry, would prefer you not send messages to all my friends with my name tagged on it.',

I didn\'t get my prize and I\'m really very upset. I have a screenshot of winning cup also.. I hope miniclip will help me. I\'m expecting my prize from you. I really love this game.',
       'As football based game it is superb, in terms of gameplay, graphics etc. But the biggest idiotic part of this game is that if freezes like magic. The whole game main screen becomes unresponsive and stays like that no matters the game is restarted or the damn phone is. Get this thing sorted out Miniclip. You have a reputation to maintain or not?',
       'Used to be able to control the speed of the kick. Now no mater how fast or low I swipe it\'s either super fast or super slow. And it seems to be at random. I swipe the exact same speed yet the first time it\'s 200km/h and the second time it\'s 50km/h. Getting frustrating as it used to work so well. Can\'t remember the last time it just went in the middle.',
       'Every once in a while when I get on I try to click my free spin and it won\'t work. So it\'s like my phone froze but I can play every other app. So it\'s just this game that freezes every once and a while. I have shut my phone down and turned it back on but I\'m not going to do that for every time I want to get on the app. I do really love it. It\'s just that it freezes so I can barely play it.' ,

      'If you\'ve liked the first game you\'re probably gonna enjoy this one. It\'s more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it\'s built around microtransactions so if you\'re feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don\'t understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it\'s likely you\'re going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren\'t aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don\'t expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!',
       'Free to play games are always the same formula: Starts off addictive, gets more challenging, starts encouraging you to buy gem equivalent, forces you to buy gem equivalent. At least most other games are fair with it though, giving you a chance. PVZ 2 does not. Levels go quickly from fun to I\'m done, and become impossible. I\'d love to see developers or game testers try to complete later levels without gems, especially Big Wave Beach. It\'s a shame, as the first game remains a classic. Buy the first game and Garden Warfare if you like it. Leaf this game alone, it\'s a sprout at best. Oh and remember, if zombies try to break into your house, throw your money at them.',
       'I was unable to launch the game for some stupid reason.....i sent several messages to the developers email seeking help,but everytime i get a same reply,asking me to visit the ea gaamjng website. It doesnt work,and seems like the message the developer replied is auto generated. Does popcap/ea rlly take time to fix it? Pls help me,i dont wanna miss out on speacial events. Thanks',
       'The game lost all my progress when it crashes. It occurred to me thrice already and I had almost had more than half the plants in my collection. Not going to invest my time in this game anymore as I have to start from scratch everytime. HAPPENS EVEN WHEN I USE GOOGLE PLAY TO UPLOAD MY GAME STATS',
       'EA doesn\'t care about the problems of the gamers. Im not interested anymore in this game after my profile has gone. 3-4 years of playing and buying stuff and most of my plants are in level 10 plus 4k+ gems, but with one stupid glitch, all of my achievements are lost. the game does not deserve even 1 star. I DONT LIKE TO PLAY FROM SCRATCH AGAIN & AGAIN. STUPID!!! u dont care about our feelings, all u want is money..' ,

       'This game is kind of creepy... I was talking to a boy named Lucas and he asked "What is your last name?" Then I asked a girl named Jessica a question and she said "When is your birthday?" This game says it isn\'t looking for personal data but it is. It\'s not safe and it wants to learn more about people. I don\'t trust this game! Also if someone mentions \'Dr.Wallace" ask them who it is and then you will see what I mean.',
       'This game is supper creepy and if u ask for wallace enough times or continue the conversation about who wallace is it will say "you really want to know dont you" u cant use any of the rides either and in general its creepy.',

      'I used to love this game, very addictive but recent updates have made the game have too many elements (clubs - who cares???) Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels "fixed" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.',
       'This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.',
       'I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn\'t really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don\'t know how many more points you need.',
       'This game has many issues! It continually freezes and shuts me down. I can no longer play on my tablet, which I purchased just for games, and have to use my phone. I don\'t like using my phone because it drains my battery. I am so ready to quit this game and return to candy crush instead. Latest updates have rendered JP and other perks useless.',
       'Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the "boards" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it\'s addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It\'s becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.',
       'I don\'t know if a review is still available  after a game has been deleted. The game was fun to play I\'ll say that. I didn\'t need 5 push notifications coming @ me in the middle of the night however. The one that came through @ 3:17 a.m. was it for me, I\'m out.' ,

      'I have loved Hot Wheels for years and this is a good game. Fun and challenging. However I have been a bit frustrated because sometimes I just explode for touching a wall like on level 6. Awesome😒 Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don\'t reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie\'s handling. I cannot get up a hill with it. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.',
       'Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I\'ve never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.',
       'The game is good. There are problems though. D-muscle is absolutely useless. It\'s the worst car in the muscle set and has no business being the fourth car in that set. The final upgrades for the fourth car on all sets are far too expensive. It requires an insane amount of grinding to unlock the last cars. The prices of supercharged upgrades are all over the place. Why do all of Haulinator\'s cost 100 coins while Dune It Up\'s cost 1000-2000?',
       'Lost all in app purchases which amounts to stealing. Beware of doing in app purchases. Way to many ads. App also crashes a lot. Support said they would help then didn\'t respond after that. If my son was able to lose his progress and the money we sunk in the game because he was using multiple devices and didn\'t know what Cloud and Local meant which cause him to lose his progress then mabe this game shouldn\'t be labeled E for Everyone. Change the rating to Teen if they have to know what cloud means or risk losing there in app purchases.  Google change the rating on this game.',
       'The game is my little boys favourite but the recent batch of adverts in game (Yahoo specifically) don\'t close - meaning you have to force quit the game. Lazy programming and terrible QA process from the developers. Avoid.',
       'Whoever decided to put the HW Poppa wheelie in the game is an idiot. Loved this game until i came across that car. Im seconds away from fully upgrading and moving on but i couldnt let it go. That car is a load of frustration.' ,

      'Graphics are awesome, but the game itself is very monotonous. You can fall asleep waiting for something to change and make it more exciting. When a change such as an added bonus does come (bomb or a rainbow bubble) you realize that it wasn\'t worth the 20 or 30 levels you just wasted your time on. Progressive enticing events need to happen more quickly.',
       'On level 19 I scored three stars bit it shows only two. Aside from that, no other complaints... YET. I will say thank you, though, for not aggressively pushing ads, pushing to pay to extend the aim line. So far, its amusing😁',
       'Game is good without any aproblem it do works. It\'s not a game a advertising app, isn\'t this too much hance i know you developers make money on the game but just because of this much ennoying adds when people uninstall this app you won\'t be able to make anything out of your effort can you???',
       'I thought the levels would be more difficult by now I\'m on 143 at the moment. I enjoy the game but I\'m getting a bit bored with the easiest of challenges and without having to use the help button . I hope the game will  get more challenging soon.   Grandson aged 5 will like playing this game.',
       'This is a really fun game but my  my concerns are that when I have no balls left, for me it doesn\'t have the option to play a video to earn more but for my brother it does therefore it makes me start all over again. The other concern is that when I use a bomb for the chest it takes away a ball for example I have 12 balls when I use the bomb from the chest, I get 11 balls left which it doesn\'t do that for my brother. I hope you can fix this.',
       'Plays good at first then only gives u balls u dont need like 15 yello balls in a row or how i keep loosing cuz ill ame somewere and it firest were ever it wants or when u click on the chest it fires the ball or how if someone txts u the game has to restart no matter were u are.

      'Horrendously intrusive advertising I play this game regularly, and enjoy the gameplay. However, the advertising is a horrible and annoying part of the app, and probably borderlining app guidelines. When the advertisement is on between rounds, they block your entire UI, and there\'s nothing you can do to shut it down. They will frequently stream video, which can easily consume your entire allowed data from your telephone company. This is NOT how you should provide games, free or not.',

      'Best Drag racing game in Google play store. If you have a addictive personality don\'t play it. I do suffer from that first race was on Dec 312017 as of Feb 22, 2018 I have 208 hrs on the track 23 in the garage own 22 cars and spent over a Benjamin on it in less than a month. Ya gotta have some smarts to play and win. Money helps with extras. Only time I\'ve had a issue with it was this morning a season ended I was upgrading a Tier 5 car and paid with game money and didn\'t receive part. Still a 10 star game... Great job Developers!!',
       'Game is really great! Amazing graphics, amazing cars, lots of continuous fun! A few bugs and connection issues which can be frustrating at times especially when your team depends on you for points. Though I believe they\'ll eventually fix these issues as this is the BEST racing game out there and it\'s only getting BETTER!',
       'Love the new updates where you can carry on the trials without having to go back to the garage. It would be nice to able to trade up your keys i.e 500 bronze for 10 silver or 100 silver for 1 gold. And the stage 6 upgrades be not double up or get stage 6 upgrades relevant to the cars you have.',
       'Customer support has won me over. They have literally provided the best resolution can think of for the game removing all my fusion parts. Hopefully I don\'t have many issues in the future but this one time moment has definitely filled me with confidence that in future, zynga will fairly sort things out.',
       'IT\'S BROKEN It won\'t load up rare imports screen and when I tap on the rare imports button it doesn\'t do anything even when it tells me to go onto rare imports screen please fix this as I can\'t play otherwise. EDIT: as soon as I downloaded it on my phone though it has worked perfectly fine so now I am tons happier.',
       'Prepare to have your pockets emptied with very little support if anything goes wrong and trust me it will. From losing fusion parts to losing your account and connection issues that have been present for the last few months. Don\'t worry though you will get bombarded with cars that cost a small fortune from events and a new special offer every now and then tempting you to pay more money. If anything ateast the devs are consistent and are very good at taking your money off you but putting in as little effort to fix things as possible' ,

      'A lot of the male characters don\'t show up when I\'m playing. The dialogue and speech box will still be there but I can\'t see any of the male characters, and this only happens with the male characters. I have tried all that I can to make it work, but it won\'t and I have to go through the stories without them being there most of the time. Please fix this for me and I will change my rating, and please allow to create a story in Limelight for mobile, I really wanna make my story but all I have is my phone and I LOVE the Limelight versions.',
       'I never EVER been so absolutely in love with a app. I only read about 3 stories and spent $82 for gems and tickets because not only I couldn\'t resist it\'s the least I could do for the creaters for creating such a perfect game that seriously was meant for me in every way possible! (And I NEVER spent money on ANY apps so THAT is how much I LOVE this!) This brings me endless amounts of happiness! It\'s EVERYTHING a story lover could love! 😍💓 AND THERE IS NO ISSUE AT ALL ABSOLUTELY NONE! And I am so not lying when I say NO ISSUE! 😁 100/10 game! My only wish is I\'d love for another way to earn gems.',
       'Game is fun. Dont even mind spending money in gens every now and again. But seriously to get the outcome you want, this app is charging waaaaaaay too many gems. Like 50 for one simple choice. And its goes up higher depending on the amount of gems you have. If I pay $5.99 for like 60 gems.. that should get me through and entire story. Not just one chapter. Will delete app if they dont change it. Not gonna spend $40 to finish a story.. Sorry but I think thats outrageous.',
       'This game is really fun! I wish there was a way to restart a story that you are in the middle of or that you could change your appearance or other people\'s appearence at any time. Also when you decide what your character is wearing, sometimes you can\'t see it because dialog is in the way. Also when you choose what you look like. I would prefer it to be against a white background. It\'s hard to see what the darker colors look like.',
       'I love this app so much. I love all of the stories ive read  and am reading. The only problem is that although they\'ve added more chances of earning gems they Only give us 2 passes now every 4 hrs. That way to much time to wait for only two passes. Before the update they gave 4 passes every 4 hrs. I think that was better coz u got mire passes with that amount of time  11',
       'I dislike some parts of this game. one part I really dislike I\'d how you have to use dimonds to get the good answer. I never have enough dimonds to get it and my parents won\'t let me pay money to get dimonds. I would really appreciate it if you didn\'t have to pay money. Something that would be really fun is if you had to play mini games to earn dimonds,and then you would have a good story and live happily ever after.' ,

      'I love Beat the Boss 4! But there are some things that I would like to be fixed. For example, when naming your custom boss, the name duplicates. The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can\'t go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.',
       'I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i\'m asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting',
       'Too many ads. It\'s annoying especially when you are connected to the internet. The King Boss is not working and is always saying "Something went wrong, please try again later" and crashes the whole gane. On the other hand it\'s a super addictive and fun game to play.',
       'I\'d happily purchase this game but that doesn\'t seem like an option. Tge ads, especially the LOUD BLOW UP EXPLOSIONS game that go on for 30 seconds are especially annoying. I\'ll gladly buy it, if only to not deal with Fing ads all the Fing time!!',
       'It a geart game and fun to kill time but saying that, i\'m sick of the ad\'s popping up ever time i kill the boss. I know this a free game and that what you have to do get money from it but ever minute is kinda stupid and it stops people having fun. And to when kill the daily boss i never get my reward. It just comes up with try again later. I\'ll rate higher when this gets fixed.',
       'Game is now unplayable due to ads and KIIP rewards popups. The ads bring up my status bar so I can\'t X out of the ad, and the app hangs when trying to load the KIIP program. I have no interest in trying to play something that shovels ads in your face more often than you can actually play.' ,

       'The responsiveness of the controls I  this game make it unplayable... it\'s slightly more responsive than the original sonic dash but it\'s still no where near good enough for such a fast paced game.  I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it\'s the same on all of them',
       'Way too many advertisements. I actually downloaded this game because subway surfer makes start over everytime you download it but after my next tech upgrade I\'m going back to that, atleast the game not flooded with ads.',
       'Ads are back. I paid for a red ring bundle, which did remove them for a while, but they\'re back. The only reason I made a real purchase was so that I wouldn\'t have ads, so can someone please remove the ads from my account. On another note, I really like this, and nice to see Shadow playable again.',
       'I would give it 5 stars, I made an in app purchase to remove ads, but after the game updated non Sega ads started showing again and it asked me to make another purchase in order to remove the non Sega ads AGAIN... love the game, hate the ads...',
       'This game can\'t even load.When it\'s done loading it crashes my phone. GOD HELP US ALL FROM THIS BULLCRAP OF A GAY FREAKIN GAM' ,

      'I\'ve played for 3 years and this game has just gone way downhill, this is the biggest pay to win game that exists. It\'s enjoyable to see people have the ability to buy what I worked so hard during the last 3 years for a mere $10. I haven\'t enjoyed this game in months, it\'s a chore to still play. Download only if you\'re willing to drop a fortune.',
       'nice game for the others saying that this is a copy of coc it has a lot of difference this game is more easy to play than coc. coc is a hard game more time o upgrade more time on things in this in only 5 m its fast becouse it is free and you already have a hero if you start the game in coc you ned to be th lvl 7 to get it or 8 idk but dont say that coc an cc is the same becouse your wrong of saying that they are the same (^_^)',
       'OMG This app is annoying in all ways... And on Certain hack things I play this for 30 seconds but still don\'t get a pass! Tell CoTops to give me my credits',
       'It\'s a great game but there are too many things u have to pay for. Too many OP heroes that unbalance the game. Stop making new heroes so often. I\'ve been playing this game for about 6 years, and I hate that new players get it so easy. I had to grind to get where I\'m at, and that\'s how it should be',
       'Lol I\'m changing my review once more. I love the game but every new hero you guys drop completely messes up the game and makes things unfair. I don\'t know if your way of trying to fix it is by making more OP heroes but it simply makes the game less enjoyable. The last few heroes that came out completely made my account useless and if I don\'t put in a good couple hundred dollars is just gonna stay useless. I think that\'s unfair so for now I\'m taking off a few stars. I know you guys don\'t care but its the only thing I can do to express my opinion. In my humble opinion you guys should balance the useless heroes you already have rather than coming up with new ones that make the old ones  useless.',
       'Very unfair. D\'ont download it unless you want to spend a fortune. After four years of playing, the new op heroes available for cash, will crash your in a second. Be aware !!!' ,

      'I\'m really fond of this game and love the gameplay and quick paced matches. The new update is AMAZING!   There are a few things that would make this game extra perfect for me!   Must have character customisation. This would be of big amazing to me. Char customisation makes me bind more to certain characters. The rings we get don\'t have much value to them except for upgrading the characters.  Could have non-ranked matches. I would love the option to play/practice against rivals or my own friends.   Should have quick chat responses. Would like to communicate before and after the match with simple reactions. Like Good luck and I win, tee-hee!',
       'This game is if Sonic Dash mixed with Racing. And I LOVE IT!!! One suggestion I have that I don\'t think many online multiplayer games have, add some sort of singleplayer mode. Otherwise, great game! I like that it\'s free with ads being removable via in game purchases (which I did), controls, graphics, and soundtrack are outstanding, overall, I love the game, and I look forward to more updates in the future.',
       'Please add a custom character, there is one in the main game so there should be one here to. Also please add infinite, cubot, orbot, and eggman. Also some more variety of music and areas would be good. Thank you for reading and for the great game! :)  (Edit): we need a friending system and to be able to customize our characters so that we have SOMETHING to spend rings on. And Espio needs some serious buffing because right now, he is pathetic.',
       'To many ads unless you make some kind of purchase. Loading screens seem to take longer than I\'d like. You can\'t at this time play with friends as Opponents are automatically chosen. There is still some characters ability noise in the game even if you have music and sound off. I\'d like to see characters abilities not to be so similar, but it isn\'t taking away from the game at the moment for me. With all that said though the graphics are great, the game is fun, and it\'s worth the $1.99 purchase I made.',
       'This is one of the best mobile games I have played I a while. I probobly have a bias sense I love Sonic so much. However, if one thing could be added I would say it should be a converter for the Red Star rings to normal rings. Unless you want them to be payed for. I don\'t really care either way I\'ll just buy the Red Star rings but I brought up that idea because I currently have 23,000 rings just kinda waiting to be spent. Maybe incorporate phone backgrounds or some customizations for the game that cost extra rings? Thankyou so much for the new update and if anyone I\'d debating on installing it just get it. You\'ll have fun, trust me.',
       'Love the game, but there\'s something wrong.. Well... I think Cream is kinda rigged. Her items are a bit OP for the other players which makes it an easy stage into a extremely hard stage. And also, the deduction of trophies in 4th place is too much! Please make it lower (like maybe at around 5 or 8) and change the deduction of trophies in 3rd place 0 (These are all just suggestions I have). If you read this SEGA, your games are great and keep up the good work!' ,

      'Good, with a major flaw I\'ve ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I\'ll tap, and the game won\'t register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I\'m on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I\'ve closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It\'s an issue I\'d like to see fixed.',
       'I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME This is good game design. It rewards you no matter how high you go with a beautiful little tower. The colors are really satisfying. It keeps me engaged since you can "regrow" your blocks. That creates tension too--something to strive for. It\'s so simple but soothing and really addictive!!',
       'A Great Game For When You\'re Dumpin\'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin\' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I\'m in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren\'t too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I\'m happy to say that. I don\'t like to stay too long. Great game!',
       'So,  basically it\'s a pretty fun app to play when you\'re bored. It\'s a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It\'s a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don\'t really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!',
       'Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn\'t have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic.' ,

      'I like this game but there\'s so much cheating going on. It doesn\'t resister some of the moves you make or it\'s lagging and when you smash the minions they should fly away and not stick to the screen for ten seconds so you can\'t see what\'s coming next. Just stop cheating! Don\'t take 20hours to give the necessary tools when doing a double task in the jelly lab.',

All my progress in game was lost. All the money invested in this game was lost. I have sent them emails, tickets about it but no answer what so ever. The result is ---&gt; uninstall',

      'They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It\'s definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you\'ll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.',
       'Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don\'t be fooled. This is a pay to win game.',
       'I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that\'s cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!',
       'This game is more geared to people who are capable of spending hundreds of dollars but it is still fun.  More non pay for content would be nice as far as more weapons.  But it\'s still a descent game for a pay to play even if you can\'t afford pay.  I think you should be able to upgrade more than one item at a time though.  It only allows it if you pay to.',
       'Typical pay for play. Fun in the low levels then it becomes painfully obvious who are paying the big bucks and I am starting to believe They put the people who pay on the same teams. So after about level 7 unless you pay you will lose a lot. They will say everything can be obtained for free. While this is true. The amount of time and effort makes it not worth the hassle. To get the better robots you will pay a lot of money. $100 for a robot as a sale price in this game. It shuts off in the middle of the game tech support took their time responding and didn\'t address the problem. They say record and take pictures but they will not upload. In my opinion not worth the time.',
       'I totally like the game and all but there must be balance between different robots especially..... some robots have a big advantage like the haechi with 3 medium slots and its dash ability.. its like u cant even aim at it......  Also please remove the components so that everyone is able to buy newer robots... u can make them available in gold or silver or even workshop points' ,

      'Fut can not be developed with this building team. Football is one of the most attractive games but how this fut goes? In Vs attack mode, what the hell meaning do chances have? Players must creat chances by themselves not the game. You must let them play whole game and create the chances by themselves. EA is a big builder in football games and develop a lot but have you ever thought how your fut only stands at this place?',
       'The game is nice for every football fan.... Nice controls and good graphics...events are awesome... There r different game modes.. the only thing that I don\'t like after the recent update is that while playing campaign mode there are many stages which requires u to be in certain lvl in VS mode.... I think both the modes should be independent.. otherwise it\'s a fabulous game... The most awesome football game in play store right now.',
       'overall its an awesome game great experience. but Its hard for free to play players to complete and go through the events..... the icons are too difficult to get please make them a bit earlier to get, it will be awesome to have them in the team.... its difficult to get elite players in a pack of 500 fp totw pack n few others packs too... the vs attack mode is great.... EA please make sure that the free to play players to get a good experience of getting new and better players....',
       'Fifa mobile is a soccer game that lets you be a manager and manage the best team. This game have well made graphics and gameplay. The events are fun, campaigns are exciting and attack vs attack are addicting but, no games are perfect in this case it is hard for free to player to complete the team hero event and daily microtransaction are needed. I hope EA will adress this issue.',
       'Ya this is sure that this game is awesome but please make the gameplay same as real FIFA such as at a time 2players can play in a team and can control a team. One more request is that, that you should change the graphics because players in this game are not looking as the real one. I am waiting for the next version if this eagerly hope you make this changes in this game',
       'This season is much better than the earlier. The developers are doing a very good job by listening to the users through Twitter. The Free to Play users will find it a but tough to get the best of the players. In App Purchases will help a lot in this game. But even without paying this game has a lot to offer. Addictive if you are football fan.' ,

      'I really enjoy this game, but I have found a flaw in the design. The game speeds up as you go and after a point it doesn\'t go faster, but after around 10,000 you notice the ball start to move forward on the screen and after about 20,000 you don\'t even have to move the ball to not die. It just misses the spikes. I know you might be thinking Its not on the leaderboards, but that\'s my next complaint. Im currently 6 on the leaderboards, but I\'ve gotten a better score and it won\'t update. I quite frankly destroyed that score and it doesn\'t show up. Thank you for your time and I hope this helped',

       'I hate this game so much that I installed it and then uninstalled it after one round its so complicated and I don\'t understand why people like this game. Its a waste o ftime installing it so don\'t get it',

      'Good game however, once you\'ve taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world\'s and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.',
       'Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.',
       'This game is great overall and you have a great sense of progression as your ship gets bigger and faster. The problem is the controls themselves. I found it very hard( I noticed this when I reached HP or ship level 6 ) and sometimes close to impossible to fire at other ship even at point blank range. The game has a very hard time trying to focus on one ship and would often shoot at where the enemy was 3 seconds ago especially when there is more than 3 ships at once which often happens. I would recommend a fire button option to compliment the controls and the gameplay experience. As I said before, it is indeed a very amusing game and would be even more enjoyable with this added feature.',
       'please, please, please. update more maps or make it more challenging, ive already conquered all the islands and there\'s not much i can do anymore. so please, either more maps, or let others conquer my islands and let me reclaim it. i know you guys can still add up to this already amazing game. also, improve the controls, really cant see much when im steering. but over all, its a really fun, relaxing game. ;) thank you.',
       'One of me and my sister\'s favourite game. But we wish we could play together same team or against each other with bots. We don\'t  want to be against online players. If you guys do that I will tell alllllll my friends to play. Anyway great job keep up the work , you guys are great😁',
       'Very simple. Gives me a lot of nostalgia. Two things though, it seriously needs music maybe some Celtic tunes or shanties. And secondly it needs more stuff to do. When I first saw a whale I was excited about doing some whaling but nope. The whales do absolutely nothing. Maybe even some treasure hunting puzzles or something. Good game just needs a little more content.' ,

       'I love this game but apart from 3 gold, 500 money and 1 hero and 1 weapon crates, I never get any other in the casino spin even though I\'ve been playing with gold. Used around 170 gold just to spin and did not even get any other. Kind of pissed off actually but still playing.',
       'I had this game a while back, and must not have linked it to google play games at the time as my progress is lost, but all the same I\'m happy to start over and do it all again! Great game, keep up the good work!',
       'This is 1 of my favourite game but it\'s very hard to play this game without money...Coz you have spend money to buy components to upgrade gun and character...and if you don\'t buy them then you have to wait for 1 year. To collect components',

      'I kind of miss the old version because isn\'t that why they came out with a 2nd game so if we eant more we got it.  Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.',
       'I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I\'m playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can\'t complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍',
       'OMG BEST GAME EVERRR IT HAS SO MANY NEW GAMES IN IT & A SPECIAL VALENTINE\'S ADDITION! U CAN EVEN CREATE YOUR OWN DUMB WAY TO DIE CHARACTER!!!! PLEASE DOWNLOAD DONT MISS OUT! And about the ads there are a lot of them but if u turn of wifi and data then u won\'t have a problem with the ads cause they don\'t show up!              Please pledge to be safe aroun trains',
       'This game is both funny as serious it\'s a great way to make kids understand the danger of some things around them. Like trains and wires and different things. As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.',
       'I think that there could be less ads. When I\'m trying to replay he game an ad pops up which is really annoying. What I would say is that this is an excellent game but just less of the ads',
       'A truly wonderful and entertaining game. Very well supported with great updates over the years. Latest version (Valentine\'s) appears to be buggy (animations jerk ahead) ruining the gameplay. I\'m unsure it this is the game or my phone.' ,

      'IT DOENS\'T WORK ANYMORE!! It worked perfectly fine before the latest update. Now every time I open the app i doesn\'t load at all and after that it quits the game completely. Please try to fix this problem.',
       'Just turn off the stupid skip level pop up. It\'s extremely annoying. Or add a setting that doesn\'t make it pop up. Or just don\'t have it pop up every two tries. It\'s very annoying. Other than that 5 stars 😂',
       'It\'s a lot of fun but I\'d say about once every 3 tries, the app just crashes. It\'s pretty consistent too, I can\'t 5 minutes without at least 4 crashes. It\'s pretty quick to load back so it\'s still playable but it\'s definitely frustrating to have the restart the app constantly. One Plus 3',
       'The levels need more diversity. After a while it just the same level just faster or slower spinning. Maybe add challenges or spinning platforms. Also if you could pick a color then choose  knife that would be awesome.',
       'Ehh...made it to level 100+ and its the same difficulty over nd over again. It doesn\'t get harder... Thats lame.  It could have been a great game. Great concept. But naw... Oh well',
       'This game is wonderful! It is pretty much time consuming! It often passes my time when I\'m damn bored. Only one thing is not there, once you complete a level, you can\'t play that level again. It\'s a humble request to the developers that there should be a feature of playing previously played levels.' ,

      'Purchasing the other ponies is worth it. Don\'t know why other people are complaining. It\'s only 5 dollars, you could get a DQ lunch for 5 dollars. Anyways, game is amazing. What\'s cool is that you can reset your progress so you can have fun all over again. Amazing work Budge Studios!',
       'This game is my 5 yr olds favorite thing to do during trips. She loves the music and animation, and the gameplay is entertaining enough to keep her engaged. It\'s definitely worth the few bucks to get the add free version.',
       'Installed it, launched it, after the bungie screen was presented by a full screen ad for some game involving a woman + handcuffs + panties. Not a good look for a game aimed at children, my 6 year old was standing behind me.',
       'I bought all 4 purchasable ponies for $5 (which also serves to remove all the ads), and it\'s been worth it. The game is fun, true to the spirit of the show, and just downright well made. Well done, Budge!',
       'Ads popped up every 45 seconds. I timed it. Made the game useless for my son (4). And he really wanted to play it too.',
       'My daughter loves this game so much! Good job guys. However we need your help, i made a purchase to unlock all ponies, however, somehow they got locked again and we needed to purchase again to unlock everyone. It was kinda disappointing, please help us on this matter.' ,

      'Between ads completely over running gameplay and the new requirement of having to earn stars to proceed, Rovio continues to run this once great game into the ground. **Update** game now freezes randomly requiring a force close. This is beyond ridiculous. I HATE what this franchise has become. Rovio should be ashamed.',
       'This game used to be awesome, sadly I have just removed it due to the star issue. I used to be able to play for fun, however, due to the its current standing, one MUST achieve three stars in each level in order to play other levels. Madness! Great job for taking the fun out of a game!',
       'Love this game but keeps freezing, a lot! It\'s more frustrating since the update where it costs 30 coins for the telescope but only get 5 minutes instead of 10 now and half the time my games frozen and the time runs out FIXXX',
       'This latest update keeps freezing up. I have to close it out completely and restart it. I lose any powerups I was using when it freezes, too. I cannot even finish playing the mighty levels the last few days because of this issue. Very annoyed.',
       'Wth ! Game gets hanged, as soon as you use mighty scope in mighty league. Not one time, or occasionally. Everytime since last update. WHAT A MESS ! Above that it repeatedly cannot find internet connection, be it WiFi or DataPack.  GIVING 3STAR, for good old game. If no fix found, will keep downgrading.',
       'This is nolstaga.  I totally  love this game and rovio keep on doing what you are doing wow this new profile is kinda trippy.  Aslo my boys wow yall changed the name and an added classic.  Hmm good wow y\'all changed the layout and the amount of stars it really never bothered me  that Much.  But thanks anyway.  Anyway I earned the badge that said pop me/them.  Then I played a level I noticed that      rip.     the pig said pop them.  I was like WHATTTTTT I wondered what they used to say.  I thought it was something thing like Omelet it sounded like it.  Which would be totally Fugded up cuz you know the Eggs.  When I  imagine them saying pop them its kinda creepy and scary and weird. Anyway thanks rovio I totally love this Franchise/series.' ,

      'This so freaking awesome, a woo hoo maker! I kept mumbling awesome, awesome, when i passed a car. And this is first time i\'m very exited when i managed to finish a level, even after that, i repeat again till i can surpass it perfectly. Even i haven\'t sleep for 2 days, felt like an alien or zombie, etc. But this game cheers me up alot. Recommended ? Yes! Good job dev, just download it guys. Lu pasti hepi dah! Keren!',
       'Wow... as I was writing this review it suddenly all disappeared as it said unfortunately traffic rider has stopped. Wow.. nice. I cannot even open the game without freezing up my tablet. Real nice. And tbh I love this game! On my phone it works..... 😥😣😈👹',
       'Pretty cool..It was actually a little more than i expected.  The bikes are cool. They seem to be modeled after actual bikes, but perhaps didnt want to pay 4 the licensing to use actual manufacturer names.',
       'One of the best motorcycle game to date, weather conditions are great, bikes are great and handling is great, but the bad ai on higher difficulty level a few times are ridiculous and messes up everything.  Sometimes a truck speeds up to 150km/h just to close off that small gap, where you could slip through, but next time all cars in all lane slow down at once, so you can\'t pass anywhere, even though there\'s nothing in front of them. This is really annoying, when every second counts and there\'s no way to pass them for 4-7 seconds. Apart from this the game is great. The keep changing weather conditions is great too.',
       'There are some idiot missions such as combo overheading. I would give this game 5 stars if not those missions.',
       'Gave one star less because the missons lack mathematical accuracy There was this level to travel 8 kms in 130s and it was showing it an easy mission with a bike of top speed 172 kph 😂 The graphics and gameplay are superb I like the game' ,

      'I wish I could post pictures, but the game is too easy. I beat the first 2 levels both on one attempt. Though I am an experienced geometry dash player. But if I can beat a level first try, not knowing the course at all, that\'s some easy stuff. I highly recommend geometry dash sub zero though.',
       'I love every Geometry Dash version! And this one might be the best. But my only downfall is that the music, which is freaking awesome,gets ahead of the actual gameplay and I miss my jumps. Plz fix and I\'ll rate 5 stars! But keep up the good work!',
       'Great fun but needs more levels. I laughed when I saw a review made by an idiot because he said this was a copy of the Impossible Game LOL it\'s the other way around, dumbass.',
       'Hardly worth downloading. I love the full version of the game and figured this world be similar, or at least have some interesting levels, but much to my dismay it does not. The levels are easy and somewhat boring, which is unfortunate because Geometry Dash is usually neither of those things.',
       'THIS GAME IS AWESOME PLZ MAKE THE COMING SOON Levels Music kind of more like the seven seas music THANKS and also I rated 5 stars on every thing on this game and P.S. could you please make the coming soon levels more faster dear fellows, thanks',
       'Love the songs, especially The Seven Seas (I enjoy the Irish feel) and Viking Arena (dark and cool beats to it) not so much Airborne Robots, probably because it sounds so happy and joyful that it seems to mock your struggle (like Jumper in the original GD).   Only reason I ever uninstall is because I have beaten the levels and need space for apps, but it seems I always eventually reinstall and play the levels again just for the fun of it (even if it gets frustrating at points)' ,

      'Was an awesome game Very addictive game! Was well done.. until the update. Needs more pens and new themes as I have thousands of coins but nothing left to unlock. Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don\'t register as pineapple hits for the counters. There\'s a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it',
       'Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.',
       'Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.',
       'Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.',
       'BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn\'t have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What\'s bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I\'m not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game.',
       'How can I say this? I can not stop playing this!! Everytime I set a new and higher record I want to achieve and I only stop until I get there xD atm with 6400 coins and everything unlocked 😁😁 please release new content for months and months!! It will make me so happy! Thank you for this game.' ,

      'A great time killer with well-written, diverse, and addicting stories. I\'m far from the first one to say this, but my one critique is how often diamonds are needed to make choices that are interesting/clearly crucial to the plot. I don\'t mind paying for diamonds or playing chapters of other stories to save up, but 20 diamonds should last longer than just one chapter. I suggest either introducing a subscription based option that frees up all choices for a one time or monthly fee or reducing the amount of diamonds needed to make a special choice. An alternative way of earning diamonds, such as watching ads, might be something to consider as well.',
       'Great game but the only downside to it is, some choices need more diamonds to make it all interesting whilst you only earn 1 dimond per chapter which basically leaves you with no choice left other than reluctantly pick the one that is free.  If there could be more diamonds to earn ,without spending real money to purchase game ones, it would receive higher rankings of course.',
       'The stories are great but to enjoy them properly, you have to spend diamonds. Free diamonds at the beginning is way too less (25 diamonds). And you earn 1 diamond per chapter, which is less because to make premium choices you have to spend so much more diamonds (min. 12 diamonds for a choice). And you have to make at least one premium choice per chapter. Buying the diamonds is way too expensive. I think the developers should allow users to earn more diamonds in the game. Maybe make them watch a video to earn free diamonds. That would certainly help...',
       'Really fun but I wish you gave us more than 2 keys. I\'m not going to spend actual money on a short story but I\'m sure a lot of others will, which is great for you but I think 2 keys is a little low since there are numerous chapters to play and many stories to choose from. Would be cool if you would match most other games and give us 5 keys for gameplay.',
       'Love the story lines, the graphics, all of it. Would have liked to seen something that can be done to regenerate the diamonds or do something to earn more diamonds other than finishing a new chapter earns you only one. Did experience my diamonds disappearing and the timer of keys along with the keys reach zero and not returning. Hope this issue will be resolved. Other than these issues really enjoyed the game, it\'s highly addictive.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a few days, so here\'s my review. I enjoy the stories even though they use a lot of archetypes, and I don\'t mind waiting for keys. The biggest issue I have is with the gems and premium choices: not only do the premium choices cost an unreasonably high amount of gems, but every time there are choice options with at least one premium choice, the premium choices are always presented as the better ones. This is less like making my own choices and more like reaffirming my assumption that the premium choices are always the better ones. I\'ve come to the conclusion that I would rather pay once to have this app installed rather than install it for free and pay money for gems just so I could pick the premium choices.' ,

      'I know a lot of people seem to not like this game but I actually really enjoy it the only thing I don\'t like is the lack of sound.   It would be nice if there was background music of some kind and a glass breaking sound effect when you went through each barrier something pleasing to the ears  Oh and shorter ads would also probably be good.  It could also use more roads and balls and barriers to work towards. I feel like this game has a lot of potential though hope it keeps being updated.',
       'This is a very addictive game. I don\'t understand why people don\'t like it. Fast paced. As for the adds, you people should turn your internet off and play. It will help.. ##VOODOO## Would you accept a video from me? You can use it for advertising purposes. I thought it might be of great help for you.  Please get back to me by replying. I would be happy to email the video to you..',
       'The game is fine. But OMG the ads....they make you watch an ad every few seconds until you pay for the premium version. This is just sick. I mean games do have ads but the number of ads in this game are unbearable. Very frustrating . So if you are looking for a free game THIS IS NOT IT.',
       'The game is very enjoyable, and it\'s pleasing to the eyes. I like that you can fall off course and redeem yourself if you make it back within 5 seconds. The ads are pretty excessive though. I\'m all for supporting a free to play game with advertisements, and at first I didn\'t have a problem with the ads. You get an advertisement after every game but they\'re often just picture ads or skippable after 5 seconds. I draw the line when you go e me an ad after every game and there are 30 second ads that you\'re forced to watch. If you\'re going to make me watch an ad give me an ad every 3 to 5 games at least.',
       'Hey Developer! This is Great Job!. But, if there are other players who have the disease "Afraid of Heights", this game will not be suitable for him. You make players Cringe (Afraid), because there is no music. This game like a Dark Theme Games.',
       'Maybe you could add coins, for example each gate you go through could +1 Coin and you need like 290 Coins to upgrade your airtime by a few seconds or milliseconds, although the sound is not very good due to no sound at all. Very good game although!' ,

      'Enjoyable game. Don\'t have to spend money on diamonds unless you\'re after a top look. Best played when linked to FB which means you can borrow from friends\' closets. Would rate 5 stars but recently I am having issues opening results in my in box. Every time I receive a result the page opens halfway then I have to exit the game and reload. Playing on an Asus ZenPad, anyone having the same issue or have a solution pls?',
       'I have been playing Covet for 4 yrs every single day! Being in the fashion industry I find it so interesting that the products you dress your models in are real items you can buy in real life. They have a great collection of brands but Im excited to see more.   And contrary to popular belief you dont have to spend a dime to play. My strategy for this is I play the daily challenge with either past seasonal clothes or i borrow from my fashion house. If your vision and outfit is great you will win the free item regardless of whether it is in season or not. By doing this you save $500 a day and i wait till a covet series comes along and play it till my heart and imagination is content.   Take it from a Covet junkie, you will be hooked for years!',
       'In the beginning, I absolutely loved this game, but now, I do admit that it get\'s a bit boring and frustrating after a while because getting cash and diamonds without paying real money is incredibly difficult and time consuming. I do like that they fixed the reaction time for voting because it used to be sooo slow. But overall, I highly recommend this game for any kind of fashion lover who is willing to have the patience to play it.',
       'Im simply addicted to the game and i usually play like 5 times a day and i would\'ve happily gave it a 5 stars if i could vote. I ALWAYS get the error message "there was a problem communicating with the network". I contacted the support team several times but its useless so until i can vote normally i wont be satisfied',
       'Fun, some technical glitches, and loading issues but that\'s what is expected of such a large game. It\'s fun and entertaining, recommend to everyone:) oh but I wish you could add friends individually I don\'t like that they have to be Facebook friends',
       'I really like this game, but it does end up costing a lot of real money if you want to make progress. And it can make you feel bad if you are voted poorly and lose points all the time.' ,

       'Its not letting me retrieve my 2hr free play anymore. It has skiped at least 5 free plays over the last few weeks. As well as it robs me of my free boosters from time to time. What is going on? The commercials keep getting stuck, and when they do o lose out on my booster I was supposed to get from watching the ads. Pls fix  Thanks',
       'Im very very upset that I got to level 1488 and it took me down to level 705. How does that happened. I paid money to play this game. Now wont let me pass or get back to my level 1488. I love this game now not so sure. Got ripped off again. Please fix. So upset and mad.',
       'Im on level 1300+ and now its kicked me back to level 705 and keeps saying to "go online" to download more levels? wifi on, data on. This game keeps my brain going and i love it! Hopefully its fixed soon i will keep my eye out for a new update.',
       'As levels get higher the game gets difficult and sometimes gives wrong set of blocks on purpose to elicit money. To the creator of the game that is probably good business practice. To consumers like me it is frustrating experience and thus I am uninstalling it for good.' ,

      'Lemme just say ketchapp your games are soooo good!! And addictive including this one it\'s fun and ever since the first play I\'ve been hooked there are barely any adds and the graphics are phenomenal. I play it all the time plz don\'t change this, if u do your going to loose my five stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟.',
       'Most of my apps are from Ketchapp. Their creativity and style of games have just been wanting me to download more and more! Right now, Ketchapp is one of my most favourite game groups ever! Keep making more! I don\'t have any improvements, which means that their games are top notch!',
       'Patheitc. Being such a fast paced game you cannot have the blocks starting to move a split second before you\'re going to pass it. Makes the game pretty impossible from the first level. For something that was supposed to be fun, is more frustrating. You need severe luck on your side to get a win. Recommended do not download',
       'Its a good concept, but you need to update it, and make sure the blocks no longer move. Right now, it is by far the most luck based skill game. It is impossible to dodge the moving blocks, so if they are to move, they should move much slower',
       'Good, but difficulty is a bit tough. Unless I was a Jedi, it feels like I\'m starting on what should be a hard level. The AI is way too slow as well. I wish you could could change the color of your ball and race online with others in real time.',
       'I think it is a great way for amiee to get design for her Xbox 360 and help her get over with her anger with her sister and to help her to figure out what\'s the matter but what is the most important thing is to be a fantastic family together but why are we so lonely.... Well i think it is a great opportunity to make new friends to life' ,

      'The car will control itself... If you hold left it will turn left for a period but will start to try and straighten up... To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed',
       'I have a one plus 5T with 8 GB ram still the game hangs at the finish line and all my progress is lost. I have to restart the game to get it going. Please fix this I can sent you the screenshot is you want. I love your game and it would be great if these small thing is fixed swiftly !',
       'Fix the detection when you touch/hit in perfect drift mode. There\'s been hundreds of times where ive definately not hit and yet it ends. So Infuriating, love the game but that one detail could definitely be optimized better. The drift should not end unless you actually hit and it screws up your direction. 4/5',
       'Game is really good. Best drift game I\'ve ever played on the phone. But there are small bugs in the game such as season 7 second perfect drift track (should be Turin) the race is not 3 laps. Even though I finish 3 laps it didn\'t finish the race and it gives the "wrong way" warning Everytime I pass from start/finish line. I hope you can fix this.',
       'I love this game and so do all my mates. It dose have a few light glitches as most games do. I would love a night track of some kind in the future but other wise great game all together. Also out of all the drifting games this is the best one at of all of them.',
       'I love this game! The cars are some of my favorites. There\'s only a couple things I would like to hopefully see in this game. First, if you could upgrade the cars more and you didn\'t have to use the cards. Like us money to upgrade engine parts, buy body kits, etc. And there\'s some kind of a sound glitch. The sound stays on for just a few races and then all of a sudden it stops working but I can still play the game.' ,

      'Pretty good design, but there is a cheater mode which tells you when one is wrong even if it\'s not apparent. So the fastest times are always really fast even for the hard ones. Also the ad bar is right below the numbers so you accidentally hit it when you play. Pretty sure that\'s intentional to get extra clicks, but super annoying.',
       'My wife and I play this game like an old couple as we wait for our son to sleep, sure enough - we all doze off!  This game makes the brain go, sometimes my brain goes so hard that smoke comes out my ears.  Beautiful. Thank you for the gift of this game, we\'ve shared about the light it brings into our lives.   That\'s a good ending.',
       'Great game for keeping your mind active and gives me something to do on my phone.  If there was a way to get rid of the adds then it would be even better.  I wouldn\'t expect a free game to be advert free; but I would like a feature to remove them even if I have to pay.',
       'having lots of fun with the game, especially the daily challenges. But  ads that cannot be skipped pops up way too often, and its quite irritating. Also it would b good if u can ad d something like automatically mark (diff cotour, shade out) the numbers thats already been fully filled so we dont have to check it manually.',
       'I like this very much. I don\'t mind the ads in the game but the reason I gave it only 2 stars are all the loud ads in between the games. Unbelievably annoying. Specially when you get one in the middle of the night on the long distance bus.',
       'The game in itself isn\'t bad but I\'ve completed a puzzle in 10 minutes and for the past half an hour I don\'t know what to do next, does it pop up on the screen \'You have finished\' or do we just move on? I\'ve been looking for any place that I\'ve gone wrong but I haven\'t found any' ,

      'This game is perfect for anyone who loves magic, fantasy, collecting, and a whole new level of adorable! Dragonvale takes everything to the next level! I highly recommend it, as it is a amazing game, my most played, and I hope everyone else enjoys it just as much as I do. Five stars! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Edit 2: I was re-organizing my islands by Element the other day, and I had just finished the Plant Island. I put down a Oversized Oak Tree, and immediately, a image flashed through my mind: a young girl, sitting on a branch of the oak tree, a book in one hand, a baby Plant dragon sitting next to her. Stretched out in front of them was my Plant Island, the dragons freely soaring, the other islands in the distance. And that sparked a inspiration in my head. I just wanted to ask; can I write a Dragonvale book, which takes place at my park? Please let me know !  :)',
       'Cmon Backflip! Okay look I love Dragonvale, I\'ve been playing it forever. First off I lost my amazing park a while back and that really sucked. But now I am restarting and I go to buy the beginners pack for 9.99 and it says there was an error and i wont be charged...come to find out it did charge me and i didnt receive anything! Please help',
       'I have been playing for a while. After events you get a day to turn in your event specific currency for the prizes, even though the event has ended. Well for Gardenia\'s event, it turned in all my roses before I could exchange them. I had over 25,000 and was so pumped to get the new dragons. Now I don\'t have any roses and 25,000,000 extra coins i don\'t need. Please help. This is a very frustrating bug.',
       'I really love collecting all of the dragons and the fact that you can theme/decorate your park too. But the amount of types of decorations are unbalanced, the majority that you can currently buy in the market are just plant and earth type while there are very few decorations of the other types (such as air, cold, etc).',
       'When I first had it it was super fun. Then I saw a game I wanted so I deleted it I did that before and got it back I could log into facebook and go to my old island. But this time I could not. I was so far and looking forward to seeimg my dragons but it did not let me go to my old island. It left me im tears that I had to do what I did all over again. So I deleted this stupid game and gave this. If I could rate 0 I would',
       'its ok, and you might think you cant li e without it, but trust me.... after a while year of playing, which is what i have waited to wrote this review, the game play becomes very repetitive. sure try it out, its fun, but not something for the rest of your life. dont put money into it, you will regret ir later.' ,

      'Great solitaire game! If you want to play on and on, you need to buy extra credits, which I did because I could not wait+their CS is amazing!! Games are fun to play and challenging... You could still play without buying credits,,, it would just be slower. Highly recommended,! So grateful for fantastic customer service',
       'The game is very fun, but I only get to play one or two hands before I have to wait another hour to get more credits to play. Would be a lot better if you got more credits for wins or had free play. I\'m not spending money to buy credits. Also, it would be great if there was an option to turn off the fancy card movements; I get motion sick from it.',
       'If you like solitaire you will hate this game. This isnt a game of skill or strategy. Its a sort of a matching game and it becomes clear quick that they are going to drain you of your seed currency quick so you can start spending real money. You will just pull card after card that you dont need.',
       'Its great game love that I don\'t need Wi-Fi to play it. But some of levels just get so impossible to beat you spend four day on one level. Make the crops pay out more and levels make them a bit easier make the challenges be the hard ones.',
       'Great game concept, great graphics, however it really sucks that the amount of coins required to play  increases too much and you don\'t get enough coins. I wish it didn\'t cost so much to play, it seems like they just want you to actually buy more coins. No thanks. Will be deleting.',
       'I really like the concept of this game. Unfortunately I am not prepared to even give it one star as it doesn\'t take you long to realize that the only aim from this game is to extract money from all who wish to play. Pitiful really as there are many similar games available which you don\'t have to feel pressure to buy' ,

      'Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!',
       'I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn\'t get me board everytime i have different desins to do.',
       'A really nice game which also got me hooked up! Nevertheles, it frequently and automatically shuts down, deleting what was there.....this really broke my litlle sister\'s heart, even mine. For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....',
       'I  am finally at the final last level! Before I thought it was boring but after I reached some levels farther I thought it was awesome! And it is the best game ever! YEAH!!!!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💙💙💚💚💛💛💜💜💗💗❤❤ AND when I was playing my 1st game all things were opened but when I played in my small sister\'s tab all, things were closed! I got everything for free!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA',
       'Buyer beware, I purchased the "unlock all manicures" option less than a year ago, not only to unlock options but also to remove Ads for my kids. It\'s less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed.',
       'This game is amazing! I simply adore it. But sometimes, it tends to hang up my phone for a bit. If you fix it maybe i would give it 5 stars' ,

      'This is a really good game. got a great high score and it\'s good when you don\'t know what to do. But once you have been playing it for bit you get board or at least I do.and to the creators of this game to make it less boring you could put levels or different modes in it or add more  shapes. Please reply or just update. Thank you.',
       'Great game to pass time. Adverts are frustrating but necessary unless you want to pay to stop, BUT very annoying when they pop up as you just lifted a puzzle piece and because of advert it just drops randomly. Also being able to rotate pieces would be handy, granted not as challenging however.',
       'Your English is so bad it is insulting.    You need to hire someone to proof read before you post requests for ratings.  A definite turn off to the game which is actually quite fun and challenging.    Requires strategic planning.',
       'The app is fun but it needs a no ads option for purchase. Also if the game is muted the ads should be auto muted as well. Currently the play at full volume whether the game is muted or not. It\'s very frustrating.',
       'My four year old likes it and I feel like it helps him on making decisions. I can actually see him thinking what going to be him next move. I like this game and I love playing with my son. Only thing I hate is that it does have to many ads 😒',
       'I like the game itself, but way too many adds and they pop up in the middle of the game and then your piece you are placing goes wonky.  Do away with the adds in the middle. Whoever thought that was a good idea in a puzzle game was completely misplaced.' ,

      'The game is awesome. It is funny, has some challenges, it\'s community is friendly and you can collect familiars. Also you can use your equipment as costumes if you like a specific item\'s look. =D And I didn\'t even talk about the way the game looks like... It\'s the best pixel art I have seen in a while. =) So stop reading and start playing, have fun and thanks for making this game Developers! =D ( The only thing I miss is more coop gameplay =\'D )',
       'Great game and a lot of fun but... waiting for energy REALLY kills this game for me. I really don\'t feel energy limitations should be part of of a dungeon crawler where the object of the game is to run random dungeons for the chance of better loot.  I for one will never spend money on refreshing my energy in a game like this and the energy refresh costs are pretty high.   I feel like it be playing this game none stop if it weren\'t for the energy restrictions.   Otherwise good game and very enjoyable - when I can play.',

With its cute design, simple combat systems, dungeon patterns and loot systems, you\'ll find yourself easily sucked into the MMORPG world of Bit Heroes. Fight your way through the dungeons and gear up to strike fear imto the creatures who dwell within as well as the other players in challenging PvP matches.',
       'Spent over £200 in game and no legendary pet or accessory. This game uses RNG and it\'s extremely low you can\'t advance past a certain level unless you spend lots of money and even then you have to be extremely lucky to get legendary pet or accessory. Guilds won\'t take you without legendary pet or accessory. Don\'t waste your time on this PAY 2 PLAY game',
       'The game overall is brilliant! I love the pixelated graphics. The equipment is epic for a pixel game. It\'s an easy game to play, but is strategic as well! Also...it doesn\'t require much space! My down sides would be the controls. I have had them glitch on me before, but...that won\'t lower my rating at all! If I had to suggest one thing...it would be to add more customization for your character. I was looking for a long braid for hair, but wasn\'t there. So, some more choices would be an up. But, as I said, all in all...a perfect 5 star game.',
       'Perfect, very close to the perfect ultimate bit adventure rpg! I look forward to expanded versions. For this one the only issue i have is when i accept or decline a friend request, and i think duels, the request text lingers above for white someone even tho i already accepted/declined. Great work tho! I love this game!' ,

      'I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there\'s only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can\'t beat them! Keep making more awesome games!',
       'This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn\'t always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing',
       'I can\'t help but love a mobile game that doesn\'t constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it\'s tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.',
       'I really like the game. But there\'s one thing that annoys me: when I don\'t play this game for a few hours and then I do another battle in dungeon, the game crashes after killing last monster in that battle.  I found out that if I switch on mobile data it works. So I wanted to asked why is that. EDIT: now all works just fine. 5 stars',
       'Gameplay isn\'t disrupted by ads unless you want some free coins once and awhile. They aren\'t throwing the loot boxes in your face either.  The coins per hour/minute seems to be while playing only. Not sure if that\'s a glitch or how it is meant to be.',
       'Overall the game is really fun. A few minor issues like the controls being a little awkward and no way to remove ads, but other that that, a solid time-waster.' ,

      'I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I\'ve decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I\'ve upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!',
       'Really fun and addicting! The first time i saw this app was when my dad told me about this game, he said that it was very good. Literally the first 10 minutes i played this game my mind was blown and i beacame addicted. Around 2 years later(now) i found this game again and instantly installed it. I love this game and I have played it for a long time. The graphics and music are amazing. This a really good game and you should install it! Who could think that glass could be so fun. However I think this game would be better if some of the thing you have to pay for would be for free.',
       'So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn\'t save where I\'m at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won\'t be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!',
       'It\'s very addictive, one thing I am pod about is that right from the get-go they\'re trying to get you to pay for it . It would have been nice if they didn\'t try to sell the premium version so quick. If anybody could have tried any other levels without being intimidated to pay for premium maybe I would have been sold to buy a premium. As of right now I\'m okay with playing classic. Maybe I\'ll think about premium ..',
       'Challenging but fun The first time I played this I was like "This is easy" But now I\'m at level 8 and I can\'t beat it! I bought the full version so I can start at any checkpoint I want. I always start at the highest checkpoint I can choose, but for level 8 I died with 2 balls left...at least there are 2 perimids right at the beginning but there SO hard to get! This game is very challenging and yes sometimes it makes me want to throw my phone across the room, but it is still very fun, and highly recommend',
       'Outstanding and highly recommended Beautiful graphics, great concept. Very fun game to play it\'s a casual game. Super addicting but not like with other games where you want to play but are still bored. It will entertain you time and time again. One of the best mobile games I\'ve ever played, no doubt. It\'s not required but if you enjoy it a lot you might want to spend the 2 bucks on the "premium" which allows you to continue from check points among other things. There are no annoying ads even in the free edition which is a huge plus.' ,

      'I would put a zero if I could. This is by far the worst LEGO game ever, and like always it\'s very boring and has poor graphics and gameplay. What is anything creative here? The fact that you get to choose what you build? It is so stupid on so many levels. I do not recommend this game.',

      'I never had to pay a single cent for this game, and it\'s working out perfectly fine for me. Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don\'t like my non-responsive faction members and I\'m worried once I leave my faction I couldn\'t join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.',
       'Game is really good! Currently level 10 & I am doing pretty good. (For what I think) It\'s a fun game to play you can get free coins which makes it more fun and fair for players that can\'t pay for anything, except patience. I do wish it\'ll be easier to level up characters. But it\'s pretty easy. Just so difficult to get more characters to pay for level ups.',
       'This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn\'t make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!',
       'Company is a joke. Never play their games. Dont not install this game unless you expect to spend alot of money to even try to be competitive. There is massive amount  of hacking and cheating and support as no ability to help at all. I would never recommend this game to anyone. The cons far out weigh the pros. Scopley does not care about gameplay or its players at all.',
       'No one from the support team will respond. My game was unistalled and reinstall and I lost 2 years worth of data. Can\'t remember sync it and I know scopely can do it for me. I\'ve provided everything they need and still nothing via email or in-game support. Will change my rating if this is sorted',
       'I can\'t get passed the opening narration page. Therefore, I can\'t even play! The "skip" button doesn\'t work! The "next" button doesn\'t work either! I\'d have given 0 stars if possible. I won\'t change my review until after the issue is solved. I\'m using the most recent update for Android and Google play.' ,

      'I like it a lot but I hate how the drawings are so linked with pokemon go. I hate pokemon go!!!!! The graphics are okay but I wish they were a bit better quality. It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn\'t like how easy the drawings were and I don\'t think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn\'t recommend this game if you don\'t like colouring. It\'s ok!!!!',
       'I think there should be more cartoons to draw and color. And it should not always be right colors to trace it in. Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn\'t color the whole background, because what if you didn\'t want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!',
       'I love this app! It\'s sooo good. And its brilliant for when your bored. But its a little hard sometimes to go over the lines with our fingers as the lines are so thin. But overall I think it\'s a fantastic app!',
       'It\'s a great app however it keeps crashing and I have to start the drawing all over again. The whole app stops and my drawing starts over and it\'s really annoying. If this gets fixed I will definitely rate 5 stars',
       'I love this game but i don\'t like the characters tho .but it\'s fine . I like the way you can colour it in and then do the glow pen around it and at the end it looks amazing . You just colour and then press the pencil button ontop of the rubber in the pictures right bottom corner and then do the glow pen thing . Some people may don\'t know so that\'s why they don\'t like it . It\'s good when your travelling or when your bored . O THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!I like it',
       'Well the animals are cute and the drawings are cute, but I thought you could use the rainbow color like in the picture,but you can\'t😢you should still get this app and definitely of you like drawing. It\'s still fun though!😆' ,

      'A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it\'s a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you\'ve done them and reached level 10 on both, there\'s really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.',
       'Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I\'ve basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I\'ve got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.',
       'Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot\'s more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn\'t bother me that much. 5 stars for the team',
       'It\'s a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the \'colony\' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you',
       'Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON\'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!',
       'Well I was only shown this game last Friday and by today (Wednesday) I have reached level 10 on earth and Mars, both my rockets are fully upgraded. Nothing to do now, I thought you would be able to set up buildings and colonies and keep jumping to different planets. But no. If it\'s enjoyable but over quick, nothing more to it after you you level 10. Can keep taking astronauts up but to what end? You don\'t go no further, they make you money but you\'re maxed out on spending anyway. Shame, concave been really good' ,

      'This now a prize example of a freemium game that needs a premium option. I would gladly pay £10 as a one off purchase to do away with the need to say for lives. In the past games worthy of a one-off fee would offer it and this issue such game that should consider it. I will never pay for any in app purchases on any game and I am sure I am not alone. This has 5* written all over it but the long wait times and exorbitant cost of energy replenishing means this doesn\'t get anything higher than average.',
       'Loved the game but if the life was free this waiting for minutes to play again is not cool. Also noticed if you have to score more than 1 goal and you make a mistake you have to start from the same goal you already scored. If we can get the requirements before each challenge that would make it much more fun otherwise I love this game a lot keep updating for more seasons. Thank you. I am on Level 560 with 1257 stars I am awaiting Season 29. If you can also create a full football game with same concept. This is a Great game!!! Thank you developers keep developing Great games like these!!!',
       'Wonderful! Game by first touch   But I can\'t wait till the hearts 💚 are filled!  So Reduce the time. Improve this game more and more and create a new exciting games.  I have finished 390 levels. And I have a doubt what is the last level and what happens after it? All the best for ur future and I\'m a biiiiiiig fans of u guys!!  Hands off',
       'SCORE  HERO RULES This game is so sick dudes. It so cool that this gives us idea that how to play soccer or football. Gameplay is so smooth . They players show us some epic skills . It has an commentary. The worst part was the heart. I can\'t wait till it get refilled ❤❤❤❤❤ this. Graphics are great . Just reduce the time of refilling the energy . Overall this game cool. Thanks for the game FTG.',
       'Overall, the game is retarded.  Basically, is the goalkeeper Yashin or something? The goalkeeper just dives into my ball without running or jumping. Also, my team is just retarded. They can\'t even do a header in important moments when I have lack of hearts. Also, if I don\'t shoot right into the corner of the goal net, it never gets in. This is such an impossible game. The worst thing is that it crashes sometimes. This company was such a great company until this game got released.  P.S. Make CPU difficulties. The game is basically unbeatable.',
       'I am a football player and I watch alot of football so I know that a shot directed lowly towards the bottom far post must definitely get in. But this game won\'t let you score with that strategy. The keeper dives from one end to another. Ridiculous. And why do I have to repeat goals I have already scored? Pathetic' ,

      'Maybe the reason people think its boring. It\'s probably because they are boring and lame. I beat the first level without a problem, they didn\'t because they feel like everything should be easy and they shouldn\'t have to work hard for anything. The game is challenging and fun if you like a challenge. If your a lame, whinny, expect nothing to be hard, and can\'t handle a challenge as tough as making toast, then this game isn\'t for you.',
       'These other reviewers are jerks! Lol. The game is awesome! And my 4 year old can even play it well!  I like it so much, I\'m downloading it onto my phone (4 yr old plays it on my old phone)  just to see how far I can get lol',
       'I would get to the title page and that was it. It won\'t let me go further. I have turned my phone off and back on and I have uninstalled it twice and installed it 3 times. Please fix.',
       'The game controls are very annoying. The character won\'t go where you want him to. During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don\'t want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn\'t want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.',
       'It\'s an disaster game. It doesn\'t even open on my phone...it just stuck all the time.',
       'I really like this game it\'s so fun it was little hard on level 1 but I got trough this game is awesome and I\'m going to download more Lego games. Any suggestions on what game I should get' ,

      'This game is AMAZING! With that said, heres the problem. Stop with the obnoxious freaking monkey!!!! Im sick of him popping up every 30 secs with no skip button. Ill be getting up a good tapping speed and it will jist ruin it by popping up with no option to click off. If i want to explore the game further, i will, at my own pace. I dont need you to hold my hand. Its really spammy and ruining the game play. Tutorial based gaming is a waste and a headache. Also its laggy. Please fix this. I LOVE this game and i want to play but the spammy monkey is a deal breaker.  Rant over',
       'I like the game very much. I bought the starter pack for a dollar 99 and removed ads. After the update came out, the one that and the ability to watch a video to double your rewards, your offline rewards, I click to watch the video and then the game sends me to the store to buy a gem pack. I click off of that and then it says the video is not available. I assume it wants me to buy another gem pack in order to enable that feature. I will not be doing that as that is ridiculous. I already bought the starter pack. Please fix this as the game is very fun and addictive.',
       'One of the most obnoxiously money grabbing games i played. Commercials popping out constantly, and the rewards for watching them are more often than not just worthless. It\'s a shame because the game is quite fun to play otherwise',
       'It was fun, but im slowly starting to hate it. One moment youre just looking at youre businesses and the next they are shoving ads down your throat. I shouldnt have to look at ads unless i get something in return.',
       'The tutorial will not let me play the game, it continues to interrupt me and forces me to do what it wants. Graphics are also cheap and ugly looking. It also feels janky, and buggy to control. I wish I could enjoy this otherwise decent idle game.',
       'Game is great. There an ad that keeps popping up for "Coin Masters" that wants nothing to do with closing. So I gotta force stop my game. Other than that great game' ,

      'Would be nice if there was a redo button for the last move. I\'m very quick when playing and I often misplace a block. Also, why does the Apple version have stars and the android version doesn\'t? I was trying so hard to earn enough stars to buy the colour packs on my iPod, and I got quite disappointed that I can\'t do that on android. I guess I\'ll just delete the game off android since there\'s really no goal to the game now.',
       'Very fun and addicting but nice calm relaxing game. Ads only happen after each round and not a big deal. If you want to keep playing this game FREE then add up with the package. Quiet whinning about ads. Someonbe has to pay the creators for this game including the upkeep and updates. How else will the creator make his money? 2 choices, either gets ads or charge to download. So I can deal with the ads. It\'s a FREE APP.',
       'Way too many ads. I just need something for my fingers to do while listening to podcasts but this constantly interrupts my listening pretty much after every round. I really liked the game but I have had it with thw ads and am uninstalling. It\'s just not worth it.',
       'I really like the game but as many others have said their are too many ads. Ads after every round and sometimes in the middle of the round which makes you start over and that gets annoying. Too many of thr same ads. I also agree their needs to be a redo button. It does get a bit pintle after you hit the goal but still fun.',
       'Too many adds, and it makes me restart every time an add plays, I\'ve only had this app for 1 min, and have already played 50 rounds... Not. Cool. I would be okay with the adds if I could at least pick up on where I last left off.',
       'I\'m not quite sure what\'s happened to this game. It\'s very straightforward and strangely addictive. However, just today after Android\'s OS update, it performs much worse. Where before when you pick up a block, it is elevated slightly above your finger so you can see where it\'s going, now it\'s just under your finger, making this game frustratingly impossible. If this is due to an interaction with the OS update, then 1010 is due for it\'s own update.' ,

      'Really liked this when I first started playing. Honestly,there is no point me keeping it now. Can\'t perform my operations,as don\'t have bought staff and ward not on the appropriate level. I can\'t get any new staff,as I don\'t have enough hearts,and once you are at a standstill like this it take FOREVER to earn hearts back. Have loads of cash but nothing to do with it!! Game seems to be designed around getting people hooked initially (as performing operations etc is really fun), but then can\'t continue or progress without purchasing hearts!! Not wasting my time with it any longer.',
       'Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I\'ll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx',
       'It is definitely one of the best games I have ever played. The only problem is that it is soooooooooooooooooo addictive. Apart from that every thing is absolutely epic. I think there should be more operations available more often. I don\'t like it that there are a few bad words in it but that is just me. Some people might not think that hell and Dammit are bad words but I do. That\'s it really. Basically, this game is down right amazing!👌',
       'Your new update will not let me, or several people it looks like,  get into the game. I am currently doing the 12 day event and am on level 17 please fix it ASAP! I refuse to lose all my progress. This is the best game I\'ve had on my phone in a very long time.',
       'The game was working fine last night. Today it keeps crashing. I start the game and a minute later it crashes. When I start a surgery it crashes, so that wastes the energy. I feel like I spent my money on hearts for no reason. Please fix this issue!  **Update. I updated the app and it\'s still having problems. I\'m unable to do surgery on anything. As soon as it starts I get booted',
       'I\'ve played this game a few days now, all of a sudden it freezes and crashes. This file has corrupted my new SD card, has uninstalled it\'s self along with any memory on my sd card.... I even downloaded it again as I expected everything is gone... Gone! Great game just not worth the bugs!' ,

      'Good game, but they\'re some bugs that need sorting out. At random times the game just cuts off, sometimes when you are loading up the game it say ooops something went wrong write an email, Evan some of the videos freeze up or just shuts everything down. I would be happy if I could play the game without any problems at all. Thank you for your time and patients. Have a good day.',
       'Really great game but gets boring over time. I\'ve been playing for awhile and I just keep doing the same s*** everyday. Please add more content, I really can\'t tell what the game is lacking exactly but its just plain boring after a period of time. Maybe add clans or we should call it "club" for this game so we can socialize with others.',
       'Deleted, because on daily special thing it says so many hours left until I can do next daily thing, however I got a notification saying I got 2 hours to complete daily thing or I go back to day one. And what happened? It went back to day one. Truly and utterly miffed!!!',
       'This game is addicting actually, but your server is su*ks, I\'ve lost so many money when open it, said no internet connection too often, even when I on wifi. Please fix connection problem, I think there is a problem between your application and your server. And this game is using high resources on my phone, heating problem.',
       'The graphics are kwl but the game can get slightly boring. I leave my game for about an hour and then I come back with loads of money to spend. Then I leave my phone in my room for 3 hours and so on. I just wish there was more to the game than buying sports shoes.',

      'Bingo Blitz rigs games in boost levels. If certain power ups are in play and you have boosted cards the game is stacked against you. Will will not get a bingo with a 2x power up playing in legendary boost. The company knows, this was brought to their attention. They resolved it by blocking everyone from commenting on their FB page who publicly spoke out about the rigging. Do not buy credits, do not get sucked into this game. You will regret it.',
       'While I really do enjoy playing this game, I am quite displeased with several things. Namely, when the app gets frozen MID GAME  (for whatever reason), the system doesn\'t provide you the credits you\'ve earned, which feels like you\'re being short changed.  Also, what purpose does the cash value serve, if you\'re not allowed to use them for purchasing game credits? In addition, why are their limits to how many daily credits earned, no matter how many "level ups" one achieves? It would really be a better experience if these "quirks" could be modified. 2/25/18, still experiencing hiccups and the system is neglecting to replenish credits that are being lost repeatedly when the game freezes up for no reason.  You click on the number of cards you wish to play, it seems to accept, yet once the round starts you\'re not allowed in (while you\'re still able to hear the 5 balls drop, so it isn\'t technically "frozen".  So it\'s stealing your credits now.  REALLY BB?! There\'s nothing FUN about being cheated, even in a free game.  Get it together and credit your players accordingly!  Integrity speaks VOLUMES!',
       'Your New Video (& The New Jingle Blitz! Pretty Christmas presents, elves and more!) is so colorful with Blitzer! Excellent graphics in the New Video!  Exciting Bingo Blitz! Love the New photos in the app on Google play store! Your New App header it\'s Incredible & Unique like you Bingo Blitz! Kudos to your AWESOME game. Best Graphics, Ever!

       'Still greedy, not enough free credits, won\'t let you win, it\'s all about them making money, I \'ll never spend a dime on this game.',
       'I thought I was going to continue to playn but I have a serious problem with having to wait 24 hours for bingo chips plus when it\'s time to refresh your money it only gives you 18 that\'s not even enough to play but one card, then when you play the free bingo game it doesn\'t even pay you for your bingo games you won. Then it freezing all the time. I\'ve lost a lot of money cause it. freezes up think I have to uninstall sorry. Tonight I was playing the game and it keeps freezing up and all these ads keep popping up in the middle of the game. I have to uninstall it again and then you have to wait to long for your refill and then you don\'t get enough to even play several times I\'m done',
       'The several years I\'ve kept coming back hopeful of fixes, has it been too much to ask of you to stop calling a last ball with NO time to daub & hit begin BEFORE the round ends?! Twice, within 5 Minutes, I got ripped out of TWO bingos, that would\'ve given me only one item to left to complete that collection. No, this game is not addicting - when you know you\'re going to run out of everything and get ripped off.' ,

      'Look, I understand that you have to make money somehow, and ads are how you make money on a free game. But these ads are way too frequent and obnoxious. I listen to podcasts while playing games and every minute or so my sound cuts out completely to prioritize the ad. Earn the ad by giving me a decent amount of playtime before it and stop overriding my audio.',
       'Way too many ads after every time I lose or go onto another level an advert pops up. Verry annoying. But the gameplay is decent.',
       'I like the game itself but when you have 3 adds coming up after one game you hardly can enjoy the game. Super annoying, so if you download it for free be prepared to buy it otherwise it will drive you crazy!',
       'This game should be called, "cut the ads".  Unable to play the game due to excessive ads so I had to delete it soon after downloading. Sad I know. First world problem.',

      'This game is ok. The graphics are good. It\'s my favourite bowling game out there.  However I really don\'t know why this needs access to my phone contacts and other permissions.  As a result it\'s been removed. Apps and games need to sort out their permissions for what it needs to do. If it\'s not required I\'m not installing it. Other than that complaint it\'s actually a nice game for a quick 5 minute time waster.',
       'I just installed it and played one game. Seems simple and entertaining but it\'s WAY too soon to give a fair rating. It\'s annoying when games are begging you for ratings  before you can even have a chance to explore the game.',
       'I have this game on my note, iPad, and computer so it definitely should let you home much I love it.  Not including its wonderful to have when I\'m always at the Dr. for hours.',
       'So much fun to play! I am not a very good bowler in real life, but I love bowling so this game allows me to be a much better bowler.',
       'Needs to have better controls. Sensitivity to the roll, angles to throw while using curves. Maybe a power gauge for the roll, & moving your stylus or finger while giving it a curving flight on it\'s way down to the pins',
       'AWESOME!!! Crashes every once and a while but other than that it is the best game I have ever played in the world I love it it\'s so cool amazing' ,

      'A very fun and addictive game. I make bows all day, but it\'s nice to be able to shoot from my couch at night.  The influence of wind on the arrow is accurate when it comes to drift. A little costly on the upgrades for those that don\'t buy their way to the top, but all games are that way.',
       'Ok game, but bingo mode is a huge pain.  My shots filled out the opponent\'s card better than mine.  Stupid way to lose a lot of progress/coins.',
       'I personally would like to see my opponents record like you can in other games. I understand that in the higher price games its difficult to get even matches but when im a level 12 and i end up playing someone ranked 100 or higher thats a bit much.',
       'It\'s really pathetic that apps like this only allow Facebook login... At least provide Google login too.... Not everyone uses Facebook.... Google should make it mandatory on Google play store apps to provide Google login....',
       'It feels like I\'m playing a cpu, because the first cup is easy and my opponents only score very low points. I mean, I score 8-10 and my opposition have a hard time hitting the mark at all! (I\'ve repeatedly played it a handful of times.)',
       'Game was fine. Lately, keeps freezing and somehow opponents are getting 10\'s when I CLEARLY see them hitting nowhere near the middle. Matches are freezing while i\'m ahead, then match ends and says I lost. Somehow i\'ve lost 20 million coins, and not from legit losing either. I also just played a match for 1 million coins, i had over 1 million in the bank. I know sonehow have 0 after I clearly won the match but it said I lost. Either people are using cheats or the game is not functioning properly' ,

      'There should be a technical scoring piece during each skating event (such as when your practicing in the game\'s Gym in hard mode in hoping to leveled-up..."perfect", "cool", "missed", etc.). The program component can be a standard score from the AI judges yet will be under review by fans (other players who can add to the overall score, max 4 points only). Lastly, there should be a season that features state, regional, national, world, and finally olympic competition based on the current judging system for the short program and free skate 150-164 meh, 165-174 is okay, 175-189 is very good, 190-199 is excellent, and 200+ is "strictly Russian" (Weir, NBC 2018 Winter Olympics)! Each event should have qualification rounds to add to the nerves of each skater! ( =',
       'Its a good game and i enjoy it but the graphics are bad because my game gliches and i dont know whats going on. Also i dont like having to pay to get the thinks and to many thinks are whach a vidio to get the thinks it takes to long so i dont l0play it that often. I hope u understand what I\'m going through please fix the game up a bit 😄',
       'Very dissatisfied... I unlocked almost everything I could through watching videos yesterday, and I open the game today and NOTHING is unlocked! So EVERY time you close the game you have to start over? No thanks! Good bye! YOU SUCK with your ad ridden games! Will not be downloading another of yours!',
       'Ok lmy phone then I fell asleep guess what they did they put the game a start over then what!!! Nope I ilwill not play one of games I will play Roblox and Roblox good fame but I still have cocoa and the point is that I can\'t delete it bye bye Coco',
       'What a nice game coco made, love the pair mode. Amazing ice skating moves too. But what i don\'t see from the app picture is the holiday (Christmas) items in the game? Other than that, make more gamez of this...😄😉👍👌💙',
       'So It\'s a good game and all but after I reached 1687 fans my coach keeps saying after each round "let\'s make me the best skater ever!" Shouldn\'t it be changing up? And also should it be me saying that instead of the coach??' ,

      'Extremely fun game to play with your family and friends. Only 2 suggestions: 1) The final game is boring compared to the rest, and it\'s annoying I cannot avoid playing one mode and 2) It should be possible to personalize questions with the 4 images, too. One minor issue: it\'s not possible to change the language of the application. I downloaded it with my default EN language but I use to play it with my family in IT language. Is it possible to fix this issue?',
       'This is a great party game that gives hours of fun. I am unsure why they covered up "Sargon of Akkad" from the backs of one of the choice cards since release, I\'m guessing that\'s the bug they fixed?',
       'Fix online play.  1 player only? Come on... That is absolutely ridiculous. Couples want to play online. 1v1 is not really fun.',
       'Potentially a fun game but unable to play it properly as the app will does not work with my Galaxy Note4 selfie camera properly.  The pictures produced are so dark and off centre you cannot see any expression, yet the camera is fine normally.  There are no settings to help change this.',

      'So nearly perfect. I tried several and they all had too many ads... some (others) with startling loud sounds that you couldn\'t turn off! Very upsetting! THIS game, however, has only ONE ad at the start of each game, and allows you to mute the sound "once" for all future ads. It\'s simple to click the ad off before the game commences. *wink* The background is lovely and the graphics are wonderful! So relaxing. The happy little "card dance" animation after each win is nice, as well. Thank You!',
       'It\'s a fine enough game, I mean it\'s solitaire.  However the app refuses to allow Pandora to run in the background unfettered.  I listen to a lot of music, all the time and if this app can\'t work my life, I can\'t work with this app.  Also too many adds.  I understand that some one needs to pay for the development and what not... Just make me buy the damn app.',
       'I agree with other comments the ads are awful I\'ve tried several of these type games and all are to much ads .. But this one i seem to have higher scores than with the other ones.. It\'s a great pass time and over all a better choice',
       'I grew up with all I had to do so day long was teach myself how to play Solitaire.  It\'s not like I didn\'t have friends but was bored with the ones I had to play with.  I think the game is very realistic.  And completely challenging.',
       'Downloaded this app this week.  Can\'t stop playing it... and it helps me decompress when I get stuck on a level of CandyCrush!  Good job guys!',

       'Addictive and challenging It makes me put the score I wanna get in mind so I can work towards it and that inspires me to read my books......... If I can determine that I wanna pass my high score who says I can\'t get better grades....... I love the game keep doing  what your doing and make more games..... To everyone  I advise you to play this game 💖💞',
       'Very fun, I love it In this game you can choose your players, Tom or Angela. Then you can ride and you try to get as far as you can throughout the obstacles and challenges. You also try to collect stars along the way. However many stars you collect determines your score. This app will keep your scores and will let you know if you get a high score. When you run into something you have the option to keep going if you watch an advertisement. This app is not boring at all. It works great and doesn\'t take up much space.',
       'Oh please shut up. It is a very good game and a nice distraction for kids so stop saying it\'s not good enough.  If you are still so sure it sucks then try making your own game see how people reject it',

      'It\'s a very great game,Nothing but love.   But I got a notification  that there is an update,I updated the game but I still can\'t find the new added missions in the game. Secondly I am on day 87 and my day 90 supposed  Reward changed after I downloaded the update.',
       'I don\'t understand why  diamonds are required to craft materials. As a F2P player it is difficult for me to craft new materials. The old updates never had this rubbish. Please fix ASAP.Will install again if it is fixed.',
       'It is a really good game but I have 1 suggestion. Can you not make people waste lots of money. When people are rich in the game, when you die the game makes you waste alot of money and when you\'re poor, they make you waste little',
       'This game is fricking lowkey lit. But could you add stunt trick such as backflip or frontflips that gives you money any time one of these are perform on motorcycles. And cars could get cash as well by drifting or something. Also can we buy one or two houses that have a garage so that we are able to store vehicles there. Thanks and keep up the good work. Oh one more thing can we deliver the car we own for free and rent the others for a certain amount of time that would be awesome.',

      'It would be a real good app if they didn\'t have so many ads popping up. Budge needs to reevaluate this because it\'s not making my kid want more games...its making her hate this game. It\'s not an effective strategy...and no parent would download another budge game after seeing one ad a minute.',
       'It\'s a good game but I\'m telling you. There are way too many ads. 30 second ads without a skip ad button seriously I spend 80% trying to exit the ad then I do playing the game. I see that everyone else is complaining about the same thing. So Delete the ads Please. And please make all of the Ponies free. Some of the levels required a different pony but you have to buy them. Drag and drop is broken. Please fix it.',
       'Don\'t buy anything in the app cuz it doesn\'t sinc with other devices and when you complain NO ONE responds back! This app won\'t get another penny from me cuz you\'re a rip off! And if it wasn\'t for my granddaughter liking ponies, I\'d delete the app all together! Seriously crappy customers Service!!!',
       '"drag and drop the broken bits into the right place" game locks up and little 4 year old girl cries. Now I know why these games get hacked by little sisters older brother. People get pissed. Enjoy your money budge!',
       'Let\'s talk about ads. I downloaded this for my kid. She would love it except for the fact that EVERY 30 SECONDS THERE IS AN AD! I realize that\'s how money is made, but that\'s ridiculous. One at the end of each level would be fine, but this 4-5 inside the level is overkill. And they play upside down. She spends more time trying to exit the ad than playing the game.',
       'AMAZING Now don\'t blame me for loving this, I know there is not many levels, too many ads, but this is very active for kids. It can make thier reflex better! Can season 2 just come out already?' ,

      'Graphics were generic until now for x86 devices. Thanks for that update. And that moving data to sd card, it is really appreciable since now a days even 32 gb  not sufficient. Hope other game developers get inspiration from this. And downloading just updated part is also an improvement instead of downloading whole data again. 4 stars because this game just wont allow to play older version once it finds out new version is present.',
       'Asphalt 8 airborne is a very exciting game to play. The addition of bikes is mind blowing. Wish all time limited events could be on mobile data rather than wifi. Thumbs up gameloft for an exciting game. After the recent update of this app it keeps crashing with a pop-up message "unfortunately asphalt 8 has stopped working". Please fix this issue.',
       'I\'m addicted to this game, I love it. And with this new story mode update  I\'ve got more excited, I won all the starting races and now waiting for the refill. Only one thing that is negative, it is the upgrades are too much expensive and takes a huge time to gather coins versus the escalating events and this is depressing. I hope that game developers will fix this problem and make it fair enough.',
       'Munich update completely ruined what was previously the best driving experience on mobile. EDIT: Fall Out Boy update basically makes me unable to play the game altogether, with the game constantly freezing at the Gameloft splash screen. Talk about letting the junior devs do all the work unsupervised...',
       'This fallout boy update really sucks. Two stars for past glory but this needs fixed. Wont load multiplayer and takes several tries to launch the app at all. Either a white screen or gameloft logo hanging endlessly. And tbh I dont like the blurry nitro thing. I get it, but hope it goes away in the next update.',
       'As racing games go, this is probably the best. The graphics, sound, gameplay are excellent. Race solo, against friends or the world. The variety of ways to race is big. The selection of cars and now bikes, keeps getting bigger. The only down side is buying something from the shop or on offer. I purchased a special offer and never got it. They got my money, I never got the goods. Trying to get in contact with them is a joke. All replies to my emails were automated responses telling me to do the same thing over and over again.' ,

      'TOO MANY ADS!. I don\'t mind the videos if you want to get a second box after a rave. However having to watch one for the first box gets annoying. Just open the box so you can get to the next race. Also it would be nice to know what special each car has. If it\'s a ram special or invisible special. Other than that the game it\'s self is great and fun. Oh a cool idea would be coin donations upon  liking the track you raced on.',
       'This game is dope I play it all the time! Alot of ads but I may just pay the 3 bucks to remove them. Only thing I would request is maybe an option to view the race stats at the end of each race. to see who we raced and their times rather than just a quick glance. So say I beat a high ranked player I\'d like something to show for it. Besides that I love this game!',
       'This game was worth 5 stars until the updates... More than half the time i try to connect to a race its doesn\'t work and doesn\'t give me back the 20 energy it requires to race. Also, I watched 50 videos to get the new car BLADE and i received absolutely NOTHING!!!! Until they fix this issue its getting a 1 star from me.',
       'Lately the game says searching for players but the game goes back to home screen does not give my fuel back... i would say it was a fluke but it happens all the time. Resets twice keeps my fuel then it works. NO IT IS NOT A DROPPED NETWORK PROBLEM.. ITS YOUR GAME NOT FINDING PLAYERS AND STEALING MY FUEL TO MAKE ME BUY MORE',
       'About 50% of the time I try to play the game loads takes my 20 gas then backs me out because it didn\'t find the opponents and it doesn\'t give me back my gas. Then I try again and it just freezes and takes my gas again. 40 gas to waste. Over the last few days of playing this game I have lost over 200 pointless gas now and I\'m very upset. Please fix. Only reason why it gets 3 stars.',
       'I really like this game when it actually lets you play it. It has so many connection issues that most the time it wont let you race it just takes your fuel and kicks you back to the main screen. Very frustrating' ,

I am a 76 O.A.P. & have paid £1.79 for ADS FREE, but I am still having to sit through 30 second video ads. This is unlawful advertising, I have sent the Play Store an email explaining the situation with the so called ADS FREE. A neighbour of mine has also paid £1.79 but still having to watch 30 second videos, she is 75years. I have looked through the reviews & I have found numerous other people who are complaining about paying money for nothing. A few have even mentioned the word ripoff. How right they are. Still waiting to see if the Play Store replies to my email, for I sent 3 emails to the developers without reply. If they are not going to remove the ads then they should return our money, someone somewhere needs to do something about this wrong doing.',

      'It\'s an OK game. If it doesn\'t lock up in the next few days I\'ll come back and give a better review.  So many of these games end up costing you a bunch of money, then the errors start. I\'ve already put 3 games on my pad, spent money on them, and now they\'re useless so I will reserve my review until I see what happens with this game.',
       'Move forward, flip over and die Move backward, flip over and die Fire the canon, flip over and die Hit by another canon, flip over and die Ram a tank, flip over and die Rammed by another tank, flip over and die Sit perfectly still, flip over and die.  Terrible, terrible controls.  Edit: I\'m happy to say they removed the Flip and Die feature and now the game is quite enjoyable. Well worth playing!',
       'Online mode is pay to win and people quit mid match. Going in reverse causes glitches',
       'I like the game. Nice little time-waster. But *please note* that just before the Barracuda/Moon/ability-cards update I was rolling in in-game cash, had upgraded everything physical and had just started to buy the different paintjobs. Then the game reset me to zero earnings/kills/vehicles/upgrades. So it took time to get back up to speed and get everything (except painting) upgraded. Which I did. And was swimming in cash again, with nothing but visuals to spend it on. Bought a couple of those and then gpt Zeroed again! Was going to blame it on the paints, next time I checked in online. Maybe a subtle bug? Except now I find an upgrade, with something else to spend my (lost) game-coins on. Hope it\'s not /that/!  So, anyway, rather than remove and move on, I *will* grind up again. I\'ll get everything, along the way. *Except* the paints. And then see if it zeroes again before the next update, anyway. FYI, both developers and potential players. It\'s entertainment enough that I\'ll put myself through this, but note the mild frustration of the situation. ADDENDUM: Strangest thing - opening after update (but offline again, never yet opened whilst online) I seem to have regained about *half* the updates I thought I had lost, with coin level about where I might expect mid-grind. Also, you\'ve rescaled. Things look smaller, except that level-chooser now has two level-\'icons\' on this (wide) screen rather than three. Usually the left one is the active one (as confirmed by background layers, which goes through odd but maybe intentional \'assemble into position\' effect upon side-scroll selection of a new one). FYI.',
       'Fun little game. Seems p2w in later levels like most but still fun',
       'Great game, but advancing through the game is SOOOO slow and you loose interest pretty quick' ,

      'While the game is fun, it definetly has its cons. My biggest problem, is not earning rewards. My first encounter with this was watching an ad to get 4k for free, after watching, i got NOTHING AT ALL. My second encounter was with the ranking system, after my second rank completed (reward 4 gold) i had earned nothing! I had my previous amount which was 2, instead of 6! Fix this for a better rating.',

      'I love this game but I have a couple of requests 1st. Could you add u YouTuber skin back like boy,girl,animal then YouTuber 2nd. Could you add a button that you can press that alows you to make your own custom paint job for any vehicle that would be amazing 3rd. Can you make and road that ends come back into the city at the other side example the road behind the hospital 4th. Could add like 5 houses around the city that you can go into 5th. More vehicles   If you agree with what I have sead in this comment like so the developer can see!',
       'Ok I get it but why do the army kill you for no reason? I like this game because you can do roleplay and I\'m a girl and there is girl skins which is amazing but can you start with a girl skin and a boy skin to be fair with the girls  Pls do these. Love your company :-) but can you add a roleplay mode that would be great DO MORE:-) but now on my new tablet it won\'t let me play it please fix that and reply',
       'Good. However, the apple versioned platform overwhelms us by many advantages: They can earn coins and cash quicker n easier. They get options on what currency they use to purchase things. They get to higher leagues easier. Their weapon description overpasses ours as ours literally gives us damage and capacity whereas theirs comes with fire rate, trait etc.',
       'I love this game. But for the next update, u should give each skin there own special ability. Like the flash and hulk skins. Give the flash super speed, give hulk super strength and etc. So that everyone can get a different type of advantage. Plz make this happen next update also make a goku skin. So u can turn super saiyan. And have other transformation. So can u plz have every skin to have different abilities that match the skin',
       'I have been playing the game for 6 or 5 years and it has been the best game i have played. So, i  think you have to make this game better in the next update.Here r my suggestions 1 make the graphics better. 2 day and night shift. 3police attacks bandit in adventure mode.4 add a clan.  I hope u will add these in the next update.Also too many players that hacked their health so plz fix it.Thx',
       'There is an update but still, single player enemies are OP, 3 clips of ammo didnt kill em or zombies. Too many hackers unkilled. Maybe it\'s time to say goodbye to this game if next update didnt even solve the problem' ,

      'This game is very fun and addictive but should have offline mode so we don\'t have to deal with a hacker every game.  Also after new update I\'m having issues getting into the game. It says "check comnection" and my connection is fine even tried uninstalling it and all. Other games work on my phone and so does my Wi-Fi. The game just worked last night for me now it doesn\'t! PLEASE FIX!!',
       'Could you please add an offline mode...would be nice to practice on the go. Also please please please add more guns. I have been playing this game for a year and still no new guns but glad you are keeping up with the maps. I have this HUGE problem, it says check connection when I have good connection. I tried to restart my phone and reconnect but still doesn\'t work. PLEASE FIX.',
       'Just good. This game is great. The controls are completely customizable so you can make it work the way you want it to. Graphics are on point, better than 2nd Gen consoles, lesser than 3rd gen. If this game came out in the age of the PS2 I would have bought it. Also, buy a box because this game couldn\'t have been cheap to make. This game should cost like $25.',
       'its a great game. i loved it , but old brewery map was better than the new one ,that was my favourite but after the latest update it had  been altered and this "new brewery" is not liked by gamers, all of them want the old one brewery ,old one was awesome ,so much fun , i wanna request you to please. change the new brewery with old one we all commented to u and complained about this. many of my friends uninstalled critical ops  we all are waiting for the old brewery i wish you will make a read at all the comments and take the required action against it with in time ..........',
       'I love this game....  But I would like if there we can play offline....  And there is so many hackers!!!!!!  Try to band them..... And please Change that there is two missions in a day so we can open chest.....  So we can get skins...... Please..... Thank u of u guys change....  Love this game....  It\'s like counter strike...... And one more old take off the lag I can\'t take it......',
       'It was a great game. Until you guys updated it. It\'s now extremely laggy. It causes there\'s if my phone to lag. I personally don\'t like the newly revamped maps. Im really good at this game, but I\'m on a six game losing streak due to lag. Please fix . Thanks' ,

      'The game is good and i like it..  But after every fight you must connect to internet,, honestly this sucks.. Fighting game needs much comfort ability but every being online its really boring and it eventually slows which makes the game awful Please fix this up  Shadow Fight 2 is more portable and nice thought this will be better than two but for this update Shadow Fight 2 Is the best...',
       'Ok now this is getting really ridiculous. I don\'t like being a jerk but I just gotta complain about the latest update. Ever since I updated the game, all that the opponents have are always katanas and glaives. And those are two really annoying weapons in the Heralds chapter, especially with the AI problem and them always wall spamming the player. And there\'s also the crashing which after 5 updates, still isn\'t fixed. Look, I like this game I really do, and I just hope this game gets it\'s bugs fixed soon so I can enjoy it again...',
       'This game made me rage. Insane difficulty is literally impossible.The loot is trash, upgrading armor and weapons is better. In the fighting system, when you get cornered, your basically screwed. I miss the mechanics in Shadow Fight 2 where you cant hit him when he fell on the ground. It a really good mechanic to give your opponent a chance. But thus game, there is no mercy at all. You still get hit when on the ground which sucks. C\'mon developers, you gotta fix this!',
       'Classical pay per win game. Once you advance (e.g. lv 4-5), winning against the computer in the main quest is only possible after several days of waiting for free cards and random levelling of the weapons via chests (gained via duels). Glitches in skills usage are also observed.',
       'Great game in terms of graphic and gameplay. The only thing that sucks are the paywall in this game. Almost impossible to pass the story mode with weak weapon that we are given. The box drop rate also terrible. The only way to level up is by completing the main story. I will uninstall this game till they fixed this system. Really bad system.',
       'You guys made a really good game honestly. Just one thing that gets me tho, when you win fights you get to fight stronger and stronger opponents that\'s a great idea btw. It\'s just that most of the time I ended up fighting someone that has 800 + power and I\'m at 550. Like bro. Come on.  One more thing. The chess take to long really you guys need to fix that. Other than that it\'s an awesome game. No lie' ,

      'Overall a great game, there\'s one feature though that I feel lets this game down. Just the small fact that a father can copulate with his daughter, then again with their inbred child if you so wish. I currently have 4 generations of inbred mutants running my castle, if anything the extra fingers actually help with certain tasks such as cleaning. Do you happen to have a designer working on this with the surname Fritzl?',
       'Why in the f**k does this require an internet connection. Fallout shelter is the same thing but doesn\'t need internet. Sure you can use internet for purchases and rewards but it definitely should not be required. Please consider making this offline compatible and I will change my review to 5 stars and a positive actual review of the game. Thank you.',
       'Definitely worth downloading and trying out.. It\'s just like fallout shelter but a little more. You can do a story line and attack other players rather then just sending people out and HOPING to get something good. It\'s a little slow at first but it\'s really quite alot of fun and the creators actually listen to its players.',
       'AWESOME GAME! Time killer, infact it takes all your time away from you. Relationships will suffer due to this game, marriages will fail, you will forget to shower. I\'ve been married 24 years, or should I say I was married 24 years, Theresa left me today, and she took the kids. I lost my job at the firm, but who cares! My castle is level 50, all my subjects rejoice at hearing the sound of my voice! I am a good king! Being a loving father and husband is for chumps, why take care of your family when you can be absorbed in a beautiful fantastic world of orcs and wizards and princesses. I could probably just watch Lord of the Rings but that is fake, this game is real my subjects! REAL!!!',
       'Good game but when your rank gets high all of a sudden most enemies are too powerful. Then it takes forever to gear up. Solution is to deliberately lose and lower your rank. Not good. Also you will find yourself with a lot of gear after you played a while. Would be nice to able to sort it, not only for your different warriors but also all the production gear. Would be good to be able to more easily compare gear in your stash and what your inhabitants are wearing. It\'s a bit messy now.',
       'Seriously, what gives with the battle system? If you can\'t beat someone 75k below your power rank because they have no real life and spend 20 hrs a day grinding for equipment - what\'s the point? Ofc I could buy that equipment with real money but would I support another pay2win crapp? Uninstalling.' ,

      'I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn\'t have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn\'t get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren\'t vigilant of their customers and don\'t take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.',
       'Great game with a lot of potential.... There can be so many more additions to make this fps better. More grenade varieties? A spectator mode? Clan levels that allow more players to join when we reacher higher levels? Gun balancing changes? I feel like the Cerberus should be buffed. It is expensive, and the 3 shots at once doesn\'t allow for many attempts for kills. Adventure mode for more gunbucks? Death match option? Allowing us to pick the map? I understand the game is fairly new, so keep on adding changes and new improvements. Thanks for listening!',
       'I REALY LOVE this game but the only thing is that I\'m on level 10 and when ever I play in a battle and win I only get 200 gun bucks. PLZ can I have money transported to my account.My name is PRO_ADMIN.I would REALY HAPPY if you do😕.By the way this is also for my FAMILY and they would love it if you do ):  . I am only 10 and I know I\'m asking for you to do a big thing but my family would really be happy😊.My brother\'s acount is PROGAMER and he is only 6. PLZ if you don\'t reply or do something then it\'s ok ):  .',
       'Game is really tooo gud, graphics also nice n smooth controls but u guys released only one game mode(Team death match), but in lot of fps games they provided free for all, bomb mode, Flag capture n many more modes.. If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games 😀 n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area.',
       'Very well made game! One of the very few game\'s that will remain on my phone. It\'s brilliant fun. It\'s got a great feel to it. The maps are so colourful and well designed. My only gripe is the weapon system... Some players obviously spend a fortune on this game and so their guns just wipe the floor with you. Good game though.',
       'The best shooting game ever. Lobed each and every single thing about this game but there a little suggestion that we can see the player if they are online or not but how is this if we can see there live going on matches? That concept will be great and games lag sometimes so if you can fix this and add my suggestion in guns of boom that will be hell great!! #the best game' ,

Turn it down a notch.... edit to developer reply...that doesn\'t explain why more and more ads are popping up. What was wrong with it before?  Getting greedy with get you nowhere.',

      'I never write reviews, but this game really deserves a high one. I got this game because my friend Emily adores it, and I have been playing NON STOP. It\'s so beautiful and high quality for just a dress up game. It\'s absolutely wonderful. My favorite thing is that you can really enjoy the game without having to use real money on in app purchases. Yeah, you can if you want to, but your experience isn\'t less if you don\'t. A high quality and fun game. I adore it',
       'I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I\'m a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events.',
       'In depth in both gameplay and attention to details of awarded items. Continuous hours not required but with once a day of incentive activities. Controls are  sometimes unstable. If a glitch does happen, its fixed fast and your also awarded for time spent. Very happy customer. Enjoyed the best dress up game I\'ve played so far. Thank you makers!',
       'Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted',
       'I love the game. From its cute and addictive style to its unique and original dress up gameplay, it turned me from a dress up hater to lover. But I feel like there\'s a Paywall especially during events, and diamonds are forced to be bought, but they can be earned, which is good. But so far, you seem to have listened to feedback, from the skin tones to the bug fixes. But I love it still.',
       'I had seen many ads for it and was kind of interested, but I didn\'t think a dress-up game could be that fun. One day I couldn\'t find any games I wanted to play, so I decided to give it a shot. To my surprise, I am really enjoying it! So if you\'ve had any inkling of interest in this game, give it a shot. You might enjoying as much as I have.' ,

      'The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I\'d like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.',
       'Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It\'s very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again',
       'Game is basic in its features. The worst part of the game is the trade hq. Rather than letting you buy directly off the hq menue you have to load the other players city. If your phone doesnt load it as fast as someone else they can snipe the goods you need to buy.',
       'I love this game but I want to tell you. You Simcity global HQ building have a problem . And I think all through the world of simcity player face this problem . Your global HQ trade only  View u wanted things like if I want Cement than I searched one HQ building than HQ bulid view me More  And more same thing like burger and sugar and franch FRi and etc things  And few other things like glass and etc I want that the HQ building show one type. Of things like if cement 1 and 2 glass 3 matel 4 cap etc etc than like I want so sir please 😅 try',
       'This is a great game,very addicting, but can you please fix the glitch that makes everything either too big or too small. The contest of mayors screen doesnt even show up  only shows up one third. Will rate higher once this is fixed, its very annoying',
       'Simply the BEST city building & city management game on the PlayStore.  It\'s great fun and many things to build and do.. Weekly events to keep you occupied. City management so you need to actually think before you do. (Example, don\'t build sewers near suburbs or inner-city) Beautiful graphics, plenty of various types of buildings, leveling and so much more.  Love it.' ,

       'I really like this game and its one that I can play continuously, my only problem is that I can only play once a day.. the game will work for as long as I play but as soon as I exit I can\'t back on until the following day. It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can\'t just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...',
       'Good but buggy Good but buggy, one can earn infinite money in no time then u can upgrade ur vehicle to the max in the very first level. That destroys the fun of the game. Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.',

Contact me as soon as possible.',

      'I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.',
       'this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It\'s a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that\'s it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame',
       'Funny characters, endearing cartoon aesthetic and enjoyable game play, but after a couple hunts forces you to wait over 8 minutes before you can actually play again (in order to entice you to pay to make the wait times go away). What kind of game compels you to QUIT out of BOREDOM after playing it for 5 minutes?',
       'Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn\'t came in two years it probably isn\'t. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don\'t pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges.',
       'Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.',
       'It takes way too long for the levels to reload and I\'m not sinking thousands of dollars into a game just so I can play it. It  is ridiculous the a put of money you need to pay to even play this games. There should be more drones for a cheaper price (if not free.) Although the game is fun you don\'t get to play it much unless you are willing to shell out thousands in the long run' ,

Only problem is that friend invitations are limited, which means you can\'t add new guild members as you play longer... It is ridiculous to artificially limit invites without also providing a mechanism to add new. For example, lose a guild member, gain an invitation. Or, gain a guild member, gain an invite.',

      'I absolutely love this game. It\'s so addictive and a really good game if your bored. I\'m really curious to find out what happens when you have collected all the balls, does the game just carry on or is their more challenges?? Overall, this game gets five stars from me 😚',
       'Its a really good game. The only thing is, that I wish there was maybe some instructions that appear at the beginning, because I didnt know that you couldnt hit the black lumps etc. Maybe if you add little phrases that say what to do and not to do, then it would be almost perfect.',
       'Great time killer I love everything about it and it is a great game to wake up to. The only down side is that you fall off the ledge and that makes it harder to dodge the black. Everything else is 5 stars so that is what I think about roller coaster.',
       'Its really fun and addictive. Awesome game play and good for passing time. Not always so friendly to my battery and too many adds. Other than those little hick ups I absolutely love it.',
       'This game is amazing! It is addicting and fun to play!! The only thing is that I was hoping for some sort of introduction to the game, to tell me how to play etc. Also, I was hoping to be able to choose what kind of ball i use, the black one is plain and kind of boring. But overall its an amazing game!!',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH   I love this game because it is exciting and addictive, it has easy controls and it is so many different colors as you move on and on! Try to beat the next high scores and HAVE AS MUCH FUN AS I DID' ,

      'The game is very good but the thing is that when merlok is like "hmm, not sure if Ava gog all the bugs out..." and it tells me to go on the Nexo scan thing (it\'s the only thing i can do anyway because its forcing me to) and it plays the nexo scan sound with the screen dark at the same time and then it suddenly goes all quiet with the music stops playing and it does NOTHING!!!! ITS REALLY FRUSTRATING!!! FIX.   IT.    NOW!!!',
       'I played it on my Dad\'s phone, but only until I got my own tablet. But every time I try to play it on my tablet,(at the title screen)it crashes, and sez:Error. Unfortunately, MERLOK 2.0 has  crashed. PLEASE FIX THE ANNOYING ERROR!!!!!!!!!!!',
       'This is good but you need to reduce the price of the upgrades the knight have. One little question how did Axls battle suit be free because you  unlock it with the Lego Id?',
       'My younger cousin really enjoys this game and it keeps him entertained for hours, which is gr8 as he has ADHD. The only problem that stops us from giving this game a 5 star rating is a small bug, on the fact that he can\'t get through to arronville which upsets and annoys him when the game crashes, please fix this problem as it would be a brilliant help to us. Thanks. Btw I would recommend this game , just beware of some small problmes but dont worry as they always update this app to sort these problems out.',
       'Loved it easy and challanging.now i can create my own combo powers.i like that part and the lavaland bosses are my favourite.those bosses even has no weakness! and that makes it challenging      love it ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺.also very fun.i also like the fobbiden powers.i really love the graphics \'conrols and gameplay.i want to rank it 5000 stars.also on the real series season 3 and 4 has been better than series 1 and 2.👍☺😅toooo fun.can any one make it better by adding stone clay.after the update I lost most of my nexo powers and cannot scan merlok power.I lost like 70 nexo powers!I even lost my favourite combo power.😠😠😠😠😠😠😠',
       'It\'s good except I keep trying to scan nexo powers but I don\'t knowonome of them        I put them bymy window so it\'s light enough and try to scan it for some reasons it doesn\'t work    other than that it\'s Excellent      Awesome       great     Love It' ,

      'This is a great game and is challenging it definitely requires some focus and concentration. There is a bug that needs to be fixed it is on the gold game mode and it\'s the game that asks you to select which colours are more prominent out of all the squares but the coloured squares don\'t appear. Please fix this as soon as possible because I really enjoy this game.',
       'I really lived thus game because it isn\'t just tapping something but it\'s actually training your brand and improving your attention, memory, logic and your mind in general. If you need help in any of those subjects (or you just like a bit of fun ) I would dwfinately say this is the game for you.',
       'Very great game, I can pic some logic questions here and ask it on my friends ang classmates. It really gives me a brain exercise. Wheneve I feel bored, this game takes my bored away',
       'I just started playing but so far i am truly loving it! I\'ve always preferred games that teach and/or exercise your brain rather than the largest number of games available! Within a few rounds it is obvious this game will promote brain activity and help in every aspect of life! I highly recommend this 💗',
       'Simple but fun. These games are challenging and do make you use your brain without taking much time. You can play a few levels in just a few minutes easily. Ads are not too bad either, not too obtrusive and are sporadic enough.',

      'Great game if you wanna run low graphics for a smoother gameplay on your phone. 40 instead of 100 is great for mobile games as well. Maybe make the controls a tad bit larger for default size. Otherwise really fun. Maybe add a first person mode? Unless I haven\'t found out how to haha. Great game. I seemed to like this one out of all the others tbh.',
       'Good game, but after the last update the game game is riddled with bugs and glitches, making the game next to unplayable. Will often come up with queue error and kick me from the game and the screen constantly freezes. I can move, but I can\'t pick anything up and my teammate position is also frozen. Pls fix or I will uninstall. Also, you got rid of the aim button which sucks. Was way better before the update. You\'ve ruined the game for me😭😭😭',
       'Well I love the potential. Has a lot of bugs. Dual or quad mode doesn\'t work and overall it takes too long to wait. I waited 10 minutes for quad and then it just stopped and put me back to choosing game modes. I think thi s game can be the best if it had more work put into it.',
       'I honestly liked the game better before the update. You got rid of the aim button, the game is full of glitches like taking damage inside the safe zone, and I get lagged out all the time even though I have a pretty good Wi-Fi connection. To be honest,  you kinda ruined the game.',
       'I love this game but a few problems 1 don\'t drive cars in this game i was driving a car and just died out of no were and the cause of death was getting run over by a car. 2 sometimes the lag gets real bad and some players have a massive advantage over others and that makes it a bit unfair if these problems are fixed i would rate 5 ⛤',
       'Good game. Takes a bit to get used to controlling but after a while it\'s OK. I think it has a great potential if devs will keep working on it. There are some minor glitches in graphics and gameplay which hopefully will get fixed over time but apart from that it\'s good game. And you could add voicechat. That would improve it  a lot. Keep up the good job.' ,

      'Yes this is addictive, yes it\'s fun, and it\'s great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don\'t have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it\'s not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it\'s clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.',
       'Way way WAYYY too laggy. It\'s an easy casual game though. I wouldn\'t say it\'s "fun" but it does pass the time and make you want to achieve the little goals. Only goal, make more money in game. That\'s it and you achieve that by not even playing the game so there\'s no challenge whatsoever. Uninstalled after first day reaching about 500 Trillion and force closing 100 times.',
       'This game is enjoyable, but like many have said, it drains battery life. Moreover, it hangs too long when switching planets. I suspect, like many areas of technology, performance testing new updates with older devices is not even a consideration. If it runs smooth on the latest and greatest then it is ready to ship.  Like many mobile games this is a casino. It\'s main existence is to make money. I do not have a problem with this so much, but the events give rewards based on leaderboards. Unfortunately, they are pay to win. You are bombarded with options to pay cash. Making the top charts without spending money is not likely to happen.

       'The first time I played I easily got over 800, now I swear the game upped it\'s difficulty like crazy, I can\'t get past the 200s. Not sure if it\'s a bug, an Easter egg feature or what, or if it\'s because I completed challenges but I don\'t appreciate the inconsistency especially when playing against friends and I don\'t feel evenly matched :(',
       'The problem is that every time it asks me if I would like to continue I say yes and then kicks me out of the game',

       'I like the game and the idea of it, but the only problem I have with it, its the ads. Dear God there is a lot of ads, even when I\'m in the middle of a game, an ad pops up from the bottom. Just try to lower the amount of ads especially on the challenges, I hate to be asked and forced to watch an ad everytime I fail a challenge or complete it' ,

      'Using galaxy note 8 and the graphics are all skewed. I keep getting docked lives and having to restart  a level because the circle of off to the side of where the difference is. What\'s the point? It would be awesome if I could actually play it.',
       'The idea of the app is very nice, however, I am disappointed in the fact that the app requests to access my calls, contacts, and other data. I fail to see why is that necessary for a simple game like this. Moreover, when I listen to music and play the game, the ads come interrupting my music with their own. When I mute them and press X, the music on my phone stops completely, forcing me to leave the game and start the music again. Again, this is inconvenient for an app which I expected to be very simple.',
       'It seems that the touch is way off on my Galaxy S8, when i touch the differences i get a X, but get O for random spots mid-screen! This would be a great game if i could actually play it!!!',
       'Sometimes it\'s like it didn\'t detect the correct difference.  You have to hit it twice, so you lose a life when you shouldn\'t.  Might be phone screen sensitivity, but it does impact playing.',
       'Fun game to use your brain. I really like that you don\'t have to buy hints!  Don\'t really like the background music, but that\'s nothing major.',
       'I like the fact that I\'m not racing against a clock so I can relax and enjoy til I run out of lives. Nice!' ,

      'Overall super fun game and I\'m really enjoying it, however some of these levels are really easy, and then there are others that are super challenging and nearly impossible to find out. I just wish there was a difficulty setting so you start off with easier games and then it could get harder as it progresses, because at the moment I can\'t pass 70% of the levels without using hints.',
       'They made me misspell Rabbids, including "games" like Sword Art Online and Attack on Titan, and had obscure art that gave really bad visualization of very simple things. Just play a better trivia game. Moreover. Don\'t give us awful games like Unity, Watch Dogs, and League of Legends. Anime is anime. Video games are video games. Video game adaptations of anime are still, at there core, anime. Leave those out of these kinds of apps.',

      'I wish I could give this game 10 stars. It\'s amazing all around.  It\'s adorable and fun. The graphics are amazing too without any glitches so far. Haven\'t noticed any bugs either. The developer\'s done amazing. It does get repetitive after a while but so far by the time it happens something new unlocks so it\'s still fun. Can\'t wait to see what else you guys do to improve the game play since everything else has been flawless so far. Great job, keep up the great work!',
       'This game is super cute! I love my lil ninja friend! Lol. Nice story, and plenty to do to keep you busy. Will def take time to master, but it def has the potential to keep you interested in playing. Even got my wife playing it, and she usually only keeps games for a day or 2, cuz she gets bored with them. I think she\'ll play this one a little longer than most of the other games she\'s tried. I\'m really happy i found this game!!',
       'This one is probably my favourite, with minecraft and clash of clans. If you don\'t have this Virtual Friend game, then it is you who is missing out. Install and enjoy. There\'s nothing bad about this game, and if Naturalmotion do want me to suggest an add-on, then maybe enable me to link the game with a new device. I was LVL 52 once but I lost it. Now I\'m level 17. Hope you liked the suggestion. :)',
       'I love this game, it\'s simple and sweet. However, there was a middle row in the item-picking menu in which I had invested many coins into to help me level up faster. Today, when I logged in, the row simply disappeared without a trace. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the backgrounding of my app, but nothing seemed to fix it. Now I only have the Training row and the Fun stuff row. It took me quite a while to get those coins and I\'d really appreciate it if you brought the row back or gave me a solution to get it back. If it helps, you should also know that the \'I\' on every icon which used to let you see how an item was used has also vanished. Please fix this, thank you.',
       'You should add a dog and a cat wearing ninja suit they can be like the chicken and the squirrel the dog can run around you and bark and find bones and sell them for coins and the cat can find fish and sell it for coins. It just sounds like a good idea  the dog should be a husky or a smaller dog like a beagle so it is small like the other animals and it can sleep with the ninja the cat can just be a cat please look into this *^* looking forward to this',
       'This is a great game that I\'ve played off and on over the years. I just redownloaded it, and it\'d still fun to play. My only gripe is that there\'s no place to save your progress. Cloud, Facebook, etc. I hate having to start from level 1 every time I have to wipe/switch phones. Even an account that saves your data would be great. Fix this and it\'ll be 5 stars all the way for me.' ,

      'It\'s like Cooking Mama from the Wii, but you don\'t have to be accurate at all. There are SO many ads. I mean... They send you an ad like every 30 seconds or so! It\'s a lot. Good game four a you get crowd I think I because it\'s not really a strategy cooking game where you have to time manage and things. It had a decorating feature that I think kids would enjoy. Also, with that feature, a tablet would be better. Or if on a mobile, a stylis.',
       'Good game but too many things locked and that makes it 3 star from 5 star. Please coco tab tale unlock the whole game. In competitions always I am third because things are locked. You know money is very precious can\'t spend on a game. Please please please please unlock things. Ok bakeries we will do but others you. And yes when I have not reached that bakery then the orders come in which they can be completed in other bakery only?😟😞',
       'Nice game... everyone who love cooking should download it. But there is only one problem that the things which are the main are locked and we have to pay the real money or watch s 40 ad. For ex:- In the doll cake we don\'t have the doll so how are we going to bake it.Please fix this problem, otherwise the game is nice.',
       'At first, I was pleasantly suprised this came from TabTales. The lack of pay walls at the beginning is wonderful for their games. Though I\'m not very creative, the game demands it for making food. The graphics look great, gameplay is realistic. I was sad to see a paywal at the princess cake though. If you have 10 dollars and a young girl who loves to cook and bake, by all means buy it for her.',
       'This game is awesome!!!! It makes me go hungry every time I play it!!! The graphics are awesome and very realistic. I luv the fact that it is automatic so you don\'t have to waste your time in perfection... Please keep it automatic like this forever. P.S, for those who are worried about unlocking other stuff like the princess cake, etc. Well, don\'t be, you will get a chance to play it when you unlock the other new bakeries and when you also compete in the competitions.... 😉',
       'Most of the things r automatic so I rate it 3 or 4 stars. Pls guys pls,pls I want u to make it nonautomatic so that we can play it properly .that\'s all I want to say about this game and most and things are locked these r the two things which I did not like about this game. So guys pls make it properly. Then I will rate it 5 stars for sure. One of the best game I have ever played. Thank u so much' ,

      'Amazing app! My sister broke my old piano 2 years ago and I gave up. When I started thinking that I need to start again in my piano career, I started looking for piano apps that I could play my own music. Unfortunately, a lot of the apps didn\'t work for me until I came across this one. Just to say thanks for making this great app. :)',
       'This, after 6 years of playing piano has narrowed all my work down to half the size.. I\'ve been a musical genius, and then tragedy struck, and I lost my ability completely half my life... wasted. But this app helped me to relearn how to play. Thank you. Thank you immensely',

      'First up the images used as what the game looks like are fakes. I saw too many polygons.... (Shudder) Secondly there is no start menu. NOPE! Just some fancy loading screen and boom you\'re in the game without a chance to look at the controls. Plus your first mission is ruined by the tutorial at the worst places on the track.   Bad game knockoff. If you download this just delete it. This game is EXPLICATIVE',
       'Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that\'s excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.',
       'Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?',
       'Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can\'t without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.',
       'Update: so I\'ve been playing for several weeks now. You cannot win with maxed out mods, racing the same level cars. They\'re twice as fast and you can only knock off 3 cars at the beginning of the race and you\'re unable to catch with others. Even if you spend money, you will not get 1st place in a lot of the races. Very unbalanced game. Whoever programmed the ai should be fired  Fun game, but the intrusive ads are ridiculous. It pops up in the middle of a race, before and after the race, finished off by asking you to pay to remove ads.',
       'I don\'t know what the game is even like. I couldn\'t even get past the loading part because it won\'t let me tap on the screen.  I find this very irritating because I like trying out new car games. But please promise me you won\'t play this game any further as its a waste of your time.' ,

      'They keep killing you to make more money. You can grow as much as you wish, whether you pay or not, these devs will just create more fake accounts to create revenue. Very unethical practices and immaturity is at the peak too. They have absolutely no professionalism. They openly admit that you can\'t beat them at their own game and will tell you in a very shameless way that the money is all they care about. Kids with ego keep buying stuff and they keep fuelling racial hate through their Chinese profanity all the time. Literally the worst game devs I\'ve ever seen. Would be 5 stars if this was not a fraud scheme of a game.',
       'After a week of play , I am getting to attack smaller cities , KILL KILL,  grate time filler,  some sexier clothing options for the (ladies) would be nice,  lots to do and manage, clans mates are important, so chose wisely. I am enjoying this immensely.  Edit after (time seems like forever,)  I am really enjoying this,  Negotiated a couple of Peace Treaties, built my crew and strength, I am getting to be a force to reckon with... But there are still bigger fish, frustrating  Would love a feature to hunt the attacker, but then that would backfire too,   Great game...lots of challenges and opportunities for growth,  Highly recommended   *****',
       'It\'s your standard "GOW" clone with a Godfather ripoff motif.  You know the formula: spend money, build fast, get stomped by the kiddies with access to daddy\'s credit card who spend thousands of $$$.    Guaranteed to trigger the easily offended due to scantily clad women.  Hilariously bad "Engrish" text throughout the game.    Just get your currency for whatever other game it is you play as fast as possible and move on.',
       'I have been playing for a little over a month. However I feel there is some cheating going on and I have a feeling it\'s by some of the larger clans. I\'m starting to question the security of the game. My clans game clock is causing issues. Some good some very bad. All of my resources were collected and 2 hours later it\'s full. Another clan mate bought a 24 hour drive and was attacked by the leading clan in my city. All of these were experienced just before and while the attack was going on. Shame on the game for allowing this to happen in the game developers clans favor.',
       'Newbie dont play this game. It\'s was fun at first then you follow the instructions as normal. But at the end of the day you will get stuck and you will run out of supplies.. Their idea is to make you buy.',
       'I think this could possibly be the worst game for GM support ever. If you need help after paying, Don\'t worry someone with broken English will appear, answer a different question then leave. Mind blowingly stupid.' ,

       'Found a game called "Infinite Balls" on my friend\'s iPhone, we loved it. This is the best Android alternative we could find, but it\'s not quite as satisfying. Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls. Would be nice to turn off the help lines, too.',

      'To many ads, even if they make the game free.. Pathetic. Conflicts with game when trying to back out of them and even crashes. Inconsistent game play, twitchy controls at times. Unplayable shots where one number on power scale is to hard the next one down is to soft.  Multi player has a feel of being rigged at times.  Potential for a good game but not yet in my books.',
       'Super fun game, but WAY TOO MANY crashes. I\'ve been struggling with a level several times only for the game to crash mid-level and I lose all my progress getting booted back to the beginning. Infuriating!',
       'Some observations: ball does not rebound off rails as they should, especially the back and side rails near the hole, where the ball hits the rail and stops dead. Part of miniature golf mastery is using the rails but not in this game. And when the ball is against a rail a shot is allowed as if the rail was not present. After a shot the screen should automatically rotate close to what the next shot would be expected so as to minimize manual rotation. I was making a long swipe to rotate almost 180° and my finger hit the power slide and an errant shot was made. Most hills are not smoothly sloped but instead very angular. Hitting the bottom of the slope causes the ball to jump in ways unanticipated rather than roll. This is golf, not basketball. I uninstalled the game because it just wasn\'t as fun and realistic as I had hoped.',

      'This is an updated comment. I already loved the game just thought it needed better controls. Have to say after the update I gave it a perfect score. It\'s sleek smooth and just all around fun. It\'s very clear they took consumer complaints into consideration and it\'s good to see. Highly recommend if you love GOT and these style of games. Only negative is the farther you advance into the game the more I get the feel of a page of wind kind of situation which is sad but it\'s still worth it.',
       'Would like to see some cut scenes in the game... Probably would have tried it earlier if Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen had been displayed instead of the ugly wrinkled blue guy...',
       'Game is interesting but lots of issues with save games.  If you use a friend code to join someone in a different kingdom, you HAVE to start over with a new game.  If you bound your old game to your Facebook account, you CAN NOT unbind the game!   While there is an option to bind to IOS gamecenter, there is NO OTHER OPTIONS for android players to backup.  Seems to be the trend for developers to release a game to start taking your money then limp along with updates',
       'Poor customer service. Have had contact Google in order to attempt contact with the developer. Still no response after 6 says, this breachers there DDA agreement the. Would like like to speak to the developer in order to sort my problem.',
       'Had issues as of 22/02/18 again. World and War room access constantly loading. Before then, the tool bar on the right flashing and lagging. Since update at 18:00 on 22/02/18 have not been able to log back on. I have submitted tickets about this issue before and the reply via email is that the ticket has been closed. Go to support via website and forum and tired every step and more. No help.',
       'Game keeps glitching and bugs galore. Customer service has been helpful in regaining losses and they will need to continue until gameplay and battle mechanics are fixed. Now since the latest update I can\'t even open the game.' ,

      'Time killer. B&W colors are a bit hard on the eyes after awhile. I wish the controls weren\'t so touchy. Even if I\'m using my stylus it\'s easy to move into a wrong corner by accident when you know it\'s not the right direction.',
       'I\'m not far into it, but it\'s fun so far. My eyesight could be why it\'s not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It\'s still a very good game though.',
       'If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It\'s by far the best maze game app I\'ve come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I\'ve tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It\'s the only maze puzzle app I\'ve found worth playing! 😀💜',
       'I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven\'t played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I\'ll have to download a separate kid version for her.',
       '5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes',
       'Where is the challenge? This game is as lame as the rest of the maze games. If you would  try make the game more challenging then maybe I would not have deleted it.' ,

      'Downloaded this through another app (free golden eagles) where if you downloaded and played this game, and got castle to level 10 would be rewarded. Sent off request to support a number of times with proof and no reply, and after a week still no reward.   So if you are downloading this to get reward from another app don\'t bother as you won\'t get it',
       'I like the game but it is hard for players who can\'t buy a lot of packs. Some slight tweaks to make it not so slanted towards big spenders.  Maybe make some exchange rate for silver to gold without changing the silver availability or price. Someway that gold can be acquired beside the little in the ground. I understand the game has to make a profit and so you should but more people would continue to play instead of giving up Anyway just a couple of thoughts. Got plenty more on just general gameplay  that I think would be useful. Again, not hating as I like and play the game.',
       'Pure pay tto win. You will either pay or quit out of frustration. Build times are hilarious. Seriously, our Earth\'s sun will die before you max out your hero\'s knowledge or most any other knowledge.  The Stronghold is worthless and a huge waste of resources. It\'s more of a trophy.  Sure you can join a clan, get some bonuses and buy some shields with points, but you will be destroyed by the winners. Me, I had a gift card and blew on this game, now I just start fights and make people quit.',
       'Great time killer, I love the interaction and concept of the game. It can get a bit laggy at times and at it\'s worst, it will crash on you. The wait times are unbearable though. No ads at all since the first time I played too!',
       'The game itself is great. Zero complaints there. But the fact that it I am unable to ever log in is infuriating. I\'ve literally been zeroed out because the app won\'t let me log in... multiple times. It\'s absolutely ridiculous. Needs to be fixed.',
       'Was never able to connect to even set up an account to try the game. Messages to support only returned with irrelevant form letters. Tried my Wi-Fi, data, and Wi-Fi at Att store. No luck and can\'t get an actual human to respond just a form letter telling me to uninstall, reinstall, use different Wi-Fi or get a different phone. All to try their game. LOL If that\'s the support you get when you are a perspective customer, imagine the "help" if they already have you hooked on their game. STAY AWAY!  (Galaxy S-7 Active Phone)' ,

      'At the rate you get coins it would take youbabreally long time for you to redeem for five dollars, but the ads are not very intrusive, and the game works.  If I can get an extra 5. Bucks by the end of the month, I\'m happy.',
       'The amount of ads is truly ridiculous. And if you intend to actually make any money at all with this game you will have to play for probably over a year to make 1 dollar. don\'t waste your time',
       'There are far too many ads in game that you have to deal with, and game limitations basically force you to purchase stuff in order to even approach something resembling actual progress. What makes things worse is that there really isn\'t much of an actual game to be played here, just spin once, wait for the ad, spin again, wait for an ad, repeat until you uninstall the game permanently. I\'d only recommend this game to someone looking for an actively painful experience.',
       'Nice game it\'s nice to make a bit of money. But.. there are just to many ads. I do not have a nice and normal experience while using the app. If you can lower the ads it will be a good app. I uninstalled because the ads where way to annoying. Please lower the amount of ads. Thanks',
       'I really like this game. It\'s a great time killer but can you please not have the double reward and x2 thing pop up all the time. It is really annoying',
       'I just do not enjoy how long it takes to redeem a card.   Also,  the "claw machine" needs to be updated so it ACTUALLY works.   I have used so many coins on it and not once has it given me a prize.' ,

      'Great way to waste time. The ads are annoying, especially when you are given the "one more chance" option and are told there are no ads, only to have one show up a minute later. The home button on the pause screen is also a trap, especially if you accidentally touch it and lose a very high score. Annoyingly clickbait-y for ads, all in all.',

I don\'t know if it\'s my own problem or the game\'s problem, but I deleted the game once and got it back again thinking all my balls were still saved. Once I opened the game and checked,I found nothing. I exited the game and tried again, but still nothing. I really hope it\'s all a bug or something...',

      'I hate it! There is only three looks to do, and the make up! Literally you have to click on it a thousand times until you get the one you like. The cloths aren\'t that bad, but they can be a little more pretty. They should make it for boys and girls, so you can dress up boys, and maybe the boys can take a girl on a date so, they could get married and then they can have children but, it would be a life cycle! They would start out as babies and grow on and get married!!! Hope you like my feedback!! P.S. Plz update the game!!!',
       'I gave you 4/5 star\'s, if you make a second version then i will install it again and play it then make it 5/5 star\'s, if not i will move on to more dress up game\'s and other types of games',
       'Really! you could only do their makeup and dress them up! BORING! Hmmph!',
       'this is a good game. even if you only have three looks it is still fun to make up different looks each time you play. invent and try out new styles x',
       'It\'s boring because you can only do three themes and all you can do is makeup hair and dress up sorry not the best game',

      '3d camera the game is soooo cool but it is the camera. 3d camera is soooo emberrsing after awhile, the the game gliches.  i don\'t really understand the that a person on YouTube built a hot air balloon in the air. You can\'t do that. but, I still think that this game is very cool!!!! I give this game a 5 star even though my review is about the 3d camera.',
       'Happy, then let down. I loved the app. It\'s exactly like minecraft. However, After about an hour of game play it kept freezing up every 5 minutes or so. Every time it froze up I would have to exit to my home screen then re-enter.',
       'It\'s gr8 and all, but there are some things that I want. First is crouching, it\'s impossible to build bridges if I\'m always falling, Second is sound FX, for me it\'s too quiet and the fact of footsteps and moos and oinks and clucks is very good. Last IS everyone\'s game enemy, ADS, ads pop up in a few seconds and when building my first house you can forget what part you were on. PLEASE ADD OR FIX THESE THINGS!!!',
       'GREAT GAME BUT WE NEED FEMALE VILLAGERS , SOLDIER   HARBOR CONSTRUCTOR , CITY CONSTRUCTOR ,  MATERIALS OF A MODERN CITY  AND MODERN SOLDIERS . FINALLY BOAT MATERIAL,  WE NEED MULTIPLAYER , WHERE WE CAN FIGHT FOR CITIES OF OTHER  WORLD\'S , USING END PORTAL AND OUR WORLD.',
       'Amazing game that doesn\'t need much space, very interactive and simple, but I wish you had furniture in creative and that you could use the crafting table. But overall amazing game keep up the incredible work world craft  master',
       'I like this game! But can you add some skin in this game?this game sometimes show the chat but i don\'t know how to open the chat so please fix it.Oh, and please add some block and food in creative mode because it don\'t have or maybe it have but i think it don\'t have many of it.Please do it like in minecraft pe but not all of it.😊😀' ,

      'Such a shame. The game is great, really enjoyed the concept however it is a prime example of how monetisation strategy can ruin a game. Gems too difficult to earn without buying them, and purposely easy to accidentally spend them. Too many ads too. I\'d rather have paid for the game. Deleted it after a  day or so.',
       'Not What It Used To Be  The second to last update I did for this app switched the aim of the ball to slightly off from where you point it. So now have to compensate (guess a bit) when you\'re aiming which makes play more challenging.  Likewise, levels beyond about 440 are becoming impossible to beat w/o saving like a weeks with of bonuses to use on each level. Beating one level a week is hardly fun anymore! I may be uninstalling this app soon.',
       'Game has so much potential and is a blast. I\'m giving it a bad rating because gems are insanely expensive and they have so many buttons to hit to "use 200 gems to remove 3 lines" as one example or another to lose 200 by placing the button right above the back button on a phone. Super lame move on devs to intentionally take insanely expensive gems from us by mistake. No confirmation or anything, just boom, gone. Lacks ethics to say the least rinow',
       'Games fine. I refuse to rate a game well when it\'s annoying ads start pushing political agenda against gun owners. Will go elsewhere',
       'I really this game, plenty of challenging levels, very addictive for sure. I just got a new phone and was bummed to have to start all over (had gotten to level 360) but my new phone came with an updated/better version so now I\'m stoked on it all over again. Sometimes I wanna quit this game but I never do.',
       'Would be worth a better review if the \'rubies\' weren\'t ridiculously overpriced.  Don\'t bother earning them, you can only buy them in any meaningful amount and due to the outrageous placing of a re-try button it\'s super easy to blow €4 worth of this stupid microtransaction currency with a slip of the finger.   A gret example of a good twist on a previous style of game ruined by greed and woeful business decisions.' ,

      'Fastest uninstall ever. 15 seconds of gameplay, then 15 seconds of timed add. Can anyone spot the fake reviews? Really developer?, ya cant wait a tad longer to stop the game and make us stare at a cat puzzle? The worst. I didnt even play it long enough to appteciate the poor controlls. Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.',
       'Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)',
       'I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn\'t have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it\'s Definitely Not a game you\'d wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!',
       'Too many ads. I just downloaded n was very happy to check this out but first thing that came on my screen was advertisement. It\'s sad that even after so many feedbacks given for excessive advertisements still developers are running with it. I\'m uninstalling this game n not recommending anyone to try it unless you want to watch commercials',
       'Overall....Great Game, but with Controls of Shooting & Moving around....It\'s Not Exactly Easy to Around. And when it comes to Movement just in General....my Main Problem, But NOT the Only Problem was the Movement in Exactness of where I\'m Trying to Move my Guy (My/the Shooter) just Stinks!! - The Game itself....I Love It!!!',
       'Good game and all but the pictures shown for the view isn\'t what it seems, and this game has some flaws, such as inaccurate hitmarkers. When an enemy shoots from behind me, for some reason, it points to the front, I almost died one time, pressed medkits, I got back up, and I couldn\'t turn the camera for the rest of the game. Also, add the guns that are actually in the pictures... :/' ,

      'I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.',
       'I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn\'t work.  So I pressed the \'X\' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I\'m pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE \'X\'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I\'m triggered.  Please fix that.',
       'I really, really love this game, but, I keep losing my ball count and I don\'t understand why this is happening. For instance, I have 90 balls and I\'m supposed to have 92, I don\'t get the 92. I will give 5 stars until the bug is fixed. The ads I don\'t care about because that only happens at the end of each game which is ok. Please fix this so I can give you 5 stars.  Update- I figured out why I keep losing my count with my balls. Everytime I get the balls by the number blocks, it wouldn\'t count them😐 I could get a lot further if this was fixed. If this keeps on happening, I\'m going to uninstall this game. I hope it doesn\'t come to that because I really love this game. Please fix asap!!',
       'If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.',
       'It\'s good at first but you\'ll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.',
       'Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I\'m not spoiling it, but I will tell you it\'s a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don\'t know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.' ,
    recentChanges: 
      '◉ New "Speed up the game" option for the balls to go faster. The option appears automatically during the game.',

      'I thought it was pretty fun and loved it...but just the game played slow paced. Menu systems get confusing sometimes though. Needs a simple easy lay out and design for the menus... dashboard layout gets kinda confusing in the beginning. But other than that it\'s pretty smooth playing game....like game of war sorta.',
       'Their is a definite distinction when people in a new battlefield less than a day or two have a million or two power rating than those that can\'t pay has much and only have 100,000 or so. There\'s not much in strategy when all you have to do is buy your way out and crush your opponent\'s corps and wipe them and thier corps out of the game completely. In meaning way higher hq\'s in the mid teens or higher should not be battling way lower hq\'s that just got out of their agesis. Why not create a PC, playstion, or Xbox cross android iOS platform to recoupe losses and create an even based strategy game that wouldn\'t discourage players into quitting all together or find a way to cheat. I\'m just saying....',
       'Game developers only care about your money. Custom service will not help you. Any problems you take to them gets you the standard, "Dear player, we are sorry for your loss. Please update the game". Bonuses suck, and will never give you anything good. DEVELOPERS ONLY WANT YOUR MONEY!! Dont start playing',
       'Game is filled with ppl higher level that attack the weak to level more. Hard to get anywhere in the game. Just not enjoyable',
       'Well, I\'ve changing my review. I have now been active for several months, and am disappointed in the lack of development. The events are not touched, it\'s showing Christmas and Thanksgiving for the titles.. hate to point this out, but it\'s almost March. The building scheme is outdated and slow, when you have someone help you out, the difference in building times is a laugh at best. The pack prices once you spend on the lower end packs, never come back down. The minimum price I see now is $9.99. And the game mechanics are a bit slower as well. Customer Service can take up to 24 hours to respond to something in-game, so be prepared to wait, and remember that English is not the first language of support. I\'m still playing for the moment, but it\'s getting to be more of a job then a game. And without paying, be prepared for some waiting. Some of the research even in tier 1 is 11 days of waiting before you can do something else, unless you spend the $25.00 it will be for a second research slot. Oh, and the rate that they open new battlefields up destroys the older battlefields with active populations. So be prepared to see no growth within a week of a new field opening as it\'s the way they keep you in game and spending. I\'m critical of a game that doesn\'t bother to change events, or address the issues in the game. Guess it might be easier to open another flawed battlefield rather then fix the issues across the entire game. And no, I don\'t expect a response from there customer service either.',
       'I like it but, I feel it should be easier if you could tell what over all lever is and level up a little faster' ,

      'Since the latest update I cannot get the game to even open. I really miss it. 😢 I have deleted and reinstalled twice now, but I still cannot play.  Any suggestions?',
       'Love the concept but ads after every round? And to make it worse.. Bloody too blast ad 4 in a row. Lower  your ads, get rid of the too blast ad and I\'ll uprated 10 fold. Also you could make the game better with a timer ;)',
       'I really like this puzzle game! Ads aren\'t annoying because you can close them in 5 seconds and then reward you for watching with hints. Game play is engaging and addictive.',
       'Since the update on the game I can not get the ads to go away. You have to completely exit the game then go back into it in order to go to the next level. Little frustrating, aside from that I really enjoy the game itself.',
       'DO NOT INSTALL!! Way too many ads they expect you to sit through, the ads are way too long, even trying to skip them early takes way too long. Just a never ending commercial pretending to be an app. The developers only want money and ought to be ashamed of themselves for this ad bloated app.',
       'When ever the movie trailer comes on it shuts down the game and I have to reopen it. Also if I push it to the background and try to do something else for a second it shuts down and had to restart again also.' ,

      'Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can\'t play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.',
       'It\'s a lot other games of this type. I haven\'t been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you\'re looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn\'t find any more connections, that would be great!',
       'My big complain is that I cannot enable notifications, I\'m on a pixel phone and it is no where to be found in the settings menu, I just uninstall and reinstall the game to see if it shows up. It\'s really inconvenient as a guild leader to not be able to get notifications. Thank you',
       'Brilliant game. I\'ve played this longer than any other free game. You can pay if you want to but it\'s not necessary at all if you join a good guild. The tutorial could be better though, some things aren\'t explained at all e.g. how to awaken characters. But apart from that it\'s really good!',
       'Its so sad that  they have ruined the game by being to greedy. When you power up it is almost always 5% unless you want to watch an add. Only graphics are good.',
       'Hey love the game and clearly has lots of effort pit into it. I can\'t say anything bad about it but I\'m having trouble with a high server load and I wasn\'t able to get on after multiple attempts. Would love for clarification for my problem and if I\'m the only one experiencing it' ,

      'Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh',
       'I love the game but its frustrating when you have all 8 Spartans and the sword guys get in the way so maybe an extras set of controls to control where your men start or something. Also for me the screen keeps jumping I try to look at enemy and I catch a glimpse but then it jumps to my side then back again and again and again please fix this.',
       'I think that this game brings back memories of the times that we all played on the first one and seeing this new one with more actions and abilitys and many more things to do is just what I would expect from something from the old stick war 1 game and I just would love to see more stick war games like these overall I love this game and I think it was the best',
       'This game is amazing I love war games like this please make more levels and more characters and online battles it will be fun and make a castle not a camp like...  A tower defence mode where you defend your home castle',
       'This is one of the most awesome game of all time and thanks to the creators you can play it on mobile too. But it still lack some awesome components, 1. Add Chaos Empire, 2. Add multiplayer!!! Overall still AWESOME!!!',
       'You know,  its a shame because this is a fantastic game. There is ZERO balancing. The entire game is designed to force you into using gems and micro transactions to get past abnormally difficult gameplay walls.' ,

      'The 30 host cap immediately becomes pretty difficult to work around, especially when you need to have duplicates of the  hosts to increase their max level cap/attribute score as well as duplicates of hosts for hat colours. I\'m hoping there\'s a way to increase this later in the game. Also, synthblood is incredibly difficult to obtain especially when you need more to fix higher level hosts. Overall though, the game is pretty generous with currency, so I don\'t think I\'ve ever ran into a hard building wall that made me think I had to spend money on it to progress further. So far, I\'m enjoying the game and looking forward to the updates',
       'Pros: 1. Good design and SFX 2. Balanced currency and gameplay 3. Detailed and reasonably complex  Cons: 1. Unnecessary level cap (level 25). I noticed that after reaching level 25, no additional exp is received for doing stuff.  I hope this level cap is removed, as there are still Escalante missions that require level 30, 35,..., 50 to take part in.  I feel like I am wasting my time and effort by catering on hosts when my supposed XP for those actions are neglected simply because the limit is at level 25 right now, when it should be at 50.  Please fix this, I really like playing this game. But because of this premature level capping, I\'m afraid this would significantly lessen my motivation in playing and spending on the game. Thanks.',
       'Great game and pretty entertaining.',
       'So far so good. Few glitches but its fine.',
       'im stuck on the loading screen and im at level 13. overall its a pretty good game. but it lacks something. may i suggest: trait inheritance of a target host. sending gift/social points shouldnt restart from the top. warehouse to an inactive host human worker characters hard swipe to change location/map delos room upgrades',

      'Such a bad game. Nekki never gets enough of money so they show ads nearly after every fight. You can\'t earn gems from watching videos as it\'s never available. Tapjoy offers have been completed, but never awarded. All the weapons gets worser as you level up. Nekki wants you to BUY the good weapons. Bad game. Shadow fight 3 is worser than this one.',
       'The AI spam SO much! All they do is throw a suriken at you till you die. They won\'t even let you get up! 2 hits and I die yet I hit them like 10 times! There should be unlimited energy who wants to spend $20 for unlimited energy. Plus the controls are trash.',
       'Challenges ruin the experience. Mandatory in order to progress and level up. Some challenges are just ridiculous, and frustrating when you\'re given five tries and having to watch a thirty second ad to get one back every time, even if you make a simple mistake. Other than that it\'s good.',
       'Let me just say I don\'t mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high',
       'The game crashes unexpectedly even in the middle of a fight and when I return the energy I used for the fight when it crashed is already consumed when I didn\'t even finish it.  It evwn crashes in the middle of a raid =(    The game is good but I hope the crashing is fixed. I restart my phone and it works smoothly after that but I can\'t have my phone restartung every time I want to play. Please fix this',
       'Worst controls ever!!!! Seen in present times. Your thumbs literally pains like hell while playing. It\'s a button smashing game & makers haven\'t give a thought while design, the left directional control loses it effectiveness frequently!! It\'s designed so that player can spend more for upgrades or its development issue, whatever it is, it\'s really painful. There are no such graphics in the game anyways just 2D fight, atleast they should have got that right!! Don\'t know which Google\'s editor has made this game his / her choice!!' ,

      'Okay game. As a musician of multiple instrements, I can say that this game requires no musical talent. It is just a tap fast game. But if you like games like guitar hero from the 2000\'s only without the weird hippies and nicer music, then this is the game for you. In my opinion the game is okay, not very interesting but a definite time burner. To many ads but if you dont mins that, then its fine.',
       'This game is rubbish I would not recommend this to anyone with a Samsung. It flashes black, and makes my phone freeze. Don\'t get it',
       'I will give it a five star rating if there weren\'t as many ads because after every song there is an ad, which shows down my phone. Plz fix it because its an awesome game its just the ads❤',
       'This game is awsome i really love playing piano and this is a good helper cause the other piano is at my friends house😄',
       'I really like this game and the songs. There are some glitch\'s like when your playing it will go to an AD half way through the song and tou lose all the rhythm you have gotten, if they could sort this out then it would be a fantastic game.',
       'the game is awesome i loved it but  i want one change that is please give the feature of recording it would be a great game with recording function yet it is best piano game I love it so much some levels are quite hard and some are quite easy but still its an awesome game please download it if you love songs and piano😍😍😍😘😘😗😗😙😎😎😎😋😋😀😀😀😀😚😚😚😙😙😘😘🤘👌👌👌👍👍👍👄👄💋💋' ,

       'Too many bots and the game keeps asking me to give it more access to my phone than it really needs to run.   Other than that it is fun.  If they fixed these issues it would be 5 stars.',

If there is reality, this is what it would be: this is the worst app in the world! I hate it so much you,can\'t do anything with it it\'s just a boring junk app ,but that\'s not true I really like it just saying it could have been better!',

      'This app won\'t load at all. My son really wanted to play it. He was very exited only to be very disappointed.  I tried deleting and downloading it again but it still did the same thing. I would not recommend this app because all it does is disappoint.',
       'Boring and repetitive and poorly designed. The obstacles are hard to see. After starting a (new) stage, you don\'t have enough time to avoid the very first obstacle. The rooftop stage is unfair, you cannot avoid obstacles because either the controls don\'t work or because you don\'t have enough reaction time. And restarting from the beginning gets very boring very quickly.',
       'Love batman, I live for anything lego... this is an utter failure. The first level is beyond difficult for a seasoned veteran. Game to difficult, plot line staging is beyond negligent and shame on the creators for designing such an impossible game to progress through.',
       'we love the game but it stop working time to time it starts over and closes by it self. doesnt let us report it. would love for you guys to fixes it. our five year old loves batman games. and this one makes his day.',
       'It wouldn\'t even load past putting in my son\'s age. He is very disappointed. He earned the game and I uninstalled a bunch of my own apps to make room for the app.',
       'This is a good game and would be great if the controls would respond every time.  When you are playing a game where responsive controls matter, having them fail about every 20th swipe is unacceptable.  The other disappointing thing is that Batman is the only one that says anything.  I worked my way to get Robin and when he didn\'t say anything, I was completely turned off from the game.' ,

      'this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates',
       'I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.',
       'LOVE this game!! Literally, I don\'t think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it\'s just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜',
       'A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it\'s really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it.',
       'The game is addictive. Mediocre ratings are because there is a bug. On all games on all levels I\'m getting a network error and I\'m not connected to a network viewing a hint. I have been connected to numerous networks and reset the phone. This needs to be sorted.',
       'Quite addictive and challenging isnt just about solving the puzzle though because requires a certain amount of precision in drawing various shapes that work within the games physics. One mistake and time to restart. Addictive nonetheless and provides some good challenges and perhaps outside the box thinking. Perhaps the drawing tools could be more precise e.g different brush thicknesses? would help but bloody bloody bloody good anyway..' ,
    recentChanges: 
      '- Bug fixes',
       '- Added 2 new shapes and 1 new goal to the level editor',
       '- Increased the number of levels per tab on the community screen to 100',
       '- Increased the length of a community level name',
       '- The screen won\'t turn off after 30 seconds now' ,

      'First off, they obsessively ask you to rate the app which I did not like at all. Secondly, the in-app purchases doesn\'t translate to other devices downloaded in the same account so be warned. Thirdly, the gameplay was nice enough and everything else.',
       'I really like the game. I got hooked on it. I didn\'t like that I had to pay to unlock the other levels especially since the game was so short. I passed every level within 3hrs. It was daeasy and fadt. Wish there were more levels. To unlock the levels it was kind of expensive.',
       'You should be able to earn what it takes to up grade.. You don\'t get very far in the game to even see if you really like it.. Your just stuck',
       'I love this game I love this game and I\'m a boy wow this is so cool like there\'s no like ads and it\'s crazy how it is like you can make lots of treats and you can tell the customers to come up and get their traits and the love it I\'m sure can tell them to come get the tree and they\'re really loud seriously they\'ll be the best traits that ever tasted',
       'This game is really good pls download.......one problem only, after u finish all ur levels it tells u to upgrade........i don\'t c any sense in tht.....pls remove the upgrading part that\'s the only reason I hav given it 4 stars otherwise it\'s vry exciting',
       'This game is really awesome. I would have given it 5 stars. But it includes app purchases and you need to pay for upgrading. That thing I really didn\'t like. Thus I have given it 3 stars' ,

       'Fab game. Wish you could have the option of it fixing into place as it turns the entire cube (diagonal facing) but brilliant otherwise. Saved me buying a real 5x5 since its pretty much the same as solving my 4x4 and 3x3. I like the timer too great app 😁',
       'The controls are actually quite ready to use! After only one solve, I got the hang of it.  Great game if you\'re waiting and you don\'t have a physical cube to solve.',
       'Camera control is confusing. But overall it\'s a good app to solve cubes you don\'t have',
       'I have one word for this game rubbish I tried playing it and gave up in 5 mins it is fare to sensitive and it doesn\'t let you turn the cube Evan though it is supposed to .',

      'Very realistic and nice game. Missions and descriptions are entertaining. Controls are also great.   Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!',
       'Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!',
       'Its quite good but a little bit of fixing will do. The part "Slow Down thing" can you please please place that where it can not block the view of the player. It is very difficult to see whats behind it so it causes us players to crash. T.Y',
       'Why the hell they add brake when we cannot see the brake option even after landing which forces us to crash. Total stupidity do not waste time in downloading. Previously was better when there were no brakes just reverse it and stop or keep brake button always active.',
       'Its really boring... You have to do missions you cant just fly around and do whatever you have to fly through the squares and make it to the end... And who wants stripes?! Why are they so important?! Plus its really hard to control!!',

      'Several times now I\'ve tried to type in a logo name and the app has told me I got it wrong but I thought it was right and couldn\'t see why I was being told I was wrong. So I hit "solve" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I\'ve recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you\'ve ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?',
       'First Level at Barbie and Twitter, even if type the words correct, the app tells me that there\'s a mistake. Solve shows me exactly the same word I\'ve typed in before',
       'Not a bad game, but would be great if you could simply type the name down, instead of slowly searching for each individual letter. Makes it all sluggish and takes away the fluidity of the game.',
       'Several times I have tried to use a hint and it  wouldn\'t take it off and it was difficult and easy. When I type in the logo it would tell me I\'m wrong then I hit solve and it was the same thing I wrote also and if people don\'t know some of the logos what is the point of the game.',
       'It\'s too easy to amass a huge number of hints and use them. I\'d like not to be able to complete every level without doing some online searches.',
       'This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further.' ,

      'So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game',
       'A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job \'fun games for free\' 👏👌🖒☺',
       'Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you\'re having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.',
       'I\'ve been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn\'t force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game\'s development! :)',
       'Pretty cool app. I\'d like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it\'s pretty cool so far.',
       'I am actually a private pilot, though I didn\'t have the chance to accumulate enough hours to earn my license. I also have several editions of the Microsoft Flight Simulator(tm) for PC series, along with a yolk & rudder peddles to make it more realistic. Their flight sim program is widely considered to be the top dog among all others. This app, though not in the same league as the afore mentioned, is still quite fun!' ,

      'To anyone saying the magnometer should be free; no, it shouldn\'t.  You guys are requesting it be free because it is in demand, which is exactly why it is for sale.  Parents don\'t let you buy things on the app?  Good. The magnometer is something EXTRA that is absolutely not necessary for the app to function.  Sure, it can help make the right move; that\'s why you have to pay for it... Without the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app.  With the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app and paying for it to help analyze your moves.  You are not entitled to a free move analyzer to help guide you simply because you want it to be free.  That\'s not how economics works, hate to break it to you.  There are many, many ways to analyze moves, positions, and get better at chess; the Magnometer is not and will never be the best way to do so. It is simply an added convenience that you can choose to pay for to help you find or analyze a move/position.',
       'Feels great to have a simulated match with a Magnus-like computer AI opponent. Will definitely destroy you even at the lower age levels. The only thing I don\'t like in the app is the gray color graphics of the board and the chess pieces. The upside about this is you can surely change that setting if you got the appropriate in-game currency to purchase a different color scheme, with some playthroughs that are needed first to be able to get them.',
       'Good job It seems like that you are not paying this app any attention anykmore. I dont understand what was the need of another Magnus Trainer app. You coukd have very well integrated the same fuctionality here. You closely missed the opportunity to create the best chess app in the world. Alas....',
       'This chess game is very good, I would give it five stars except for an internal error that will not post my record of wins, losses and ties against Magnus. Maybe I fried the memory with all my losses...😁',
       'Sound effects and graphics are distractingly poor. Missing basic features like turn confirmation. You can see a video on YouTube of Magnus himself making a mistake in placing a piece using this app.',
       'Love the idea behind it. Well executed and a really fun feel to the game. Wish there was a 3d board option- have always found flat 2d chess board graphics frustrating to read.' ,

      'I think this game is pretty cool! Also they added more houses to play in. I love multi-player because I like to see all the scores and I don\'t like the office because their\'s spiders and I hate spiders. I beat the Christmas level and I\'m trying to beat the other levels too. But when you start the game, it says choose cat and press it and there\'s a skinny cat with the ears    down. I choose the kitten. But I LOVE the garden level because you go on the slides and you can go in the house and go out of it and go on the carousel and more! But on the picture when you download the game, the cat is in the washer and in the fridge. But you can\'t do that in the game. I tried too. Its boring at first but it\'s fun! I also don\'t know where the cats house is. Is it in the first house? I TOTALLY love it.😀😀😀😀😀😀😁😁😁😁😺😺😺😺😺😺😸😸😸😸😸😸😻😻',

      'This game is fun and entertaining and time will pass by you playing this. The only downfall is you only get so many chests locations on main screen and take hrs to open them up. So you have to decide if you want to play or wait the hrs. You can free up those chests by using your gold that you have but if you run out then you have to buy more with real money.',
       'It always seems that luck favors your opponent and gold is extremely hard to come by. Wind totally inconsistent, almost like it screws you purposely.  It would be nice if they gave you gold rewards for achievements but that\'s where their money grab is. Some courses have bugs and it\'s extremely frustrating, Win or lose money always seems to be pretty tight.',
       'It\'s a great game but I was up against one person and it usually gives the other person a chance to hit but this time I would have won but it didn\'t give me a chance to go another round. Don\'t know if this is a glitch or part of the game but it irritated me',
       'Game is rigged! Don\'t get your hopes up on being the next Tigger Woods when playing this game. All they want is your money, give them nothing. This game is only fun when you win. That is all I have to say. Even my girlfriend agrees with me on this, and she doesn\'t EVER EVER agree with me.',
       'The one star is due to their challenge a friend. If the friend is not online when you challenge then you cannot play against them.  When you challenge a friend you should be able to play the level if they do not respond to challenge after the timeout.   In this event the hit opponent ball will do nothing, and mystery boxes will only benefit the collector instead of opposition actions on opponent you challenged.',
       'I got hit with the rocket and both times they hit my ball and their ball went straight into the hole. I\'ve gotten it 3 times and each time, it bounced me backwards and always put their ball in the best position. I\'ve lost over 6,000 coins for just those instances. Why is it when they get it, it always works out? And when I get it, it messes me up?' ,

Then it came like - video unavailable check your internet connection... Dont know why.. Mobile data is on then also. This is the bad point of this game',
       'The ads are forced onto you, and that is the worse system I\'ve seen yet. The controls are pretty good if you have an s pen. Most puzzles are way to easy.',
       'Don\'t get me wrong this game is fun and gets your brain thinking but I hate how many adds it has. Plus every time an add comes up it takes me straight to Google play with out me even tapping on it. It gets annoying. Another thing I don\'t like about this game is after a certain amount of levels you have to watch a video (add again) just to unlock more levels. And it does this more than once to. On the flip side it is a good game that gets the brain running and the levels do get more challenging throughout.',
       'Too many ads and it glitches like crazy. Needs more levels, other than that it was a good game.',
       'The ball is super hard to control. Half the time I\'m swiping over and over again just to make the ball move. The game acts like it is super easy when it is the hardest task to do. I\'m also being spammed with ads because once or twice you restart the level because you lost an ad plays. Plys the ads take me to Google Play without me touching the screen or tapping on download. And since the controls are a nightmare because of lines glitching around the ball, (thus making it not move a single centimeter) I have to watch an ad. or lines just glitching themselves. And finally, this game spams me with notifications to "thumbs up" you and download your other games. I\'m obviously NOT INTERESTED IN PAYING YOU WITH ADS!',

       'Love the Game, it\'s fun and addiciting. But, it seems to be a bit \'rigged\' and NOT just me. But me and a friend of mine always have our game \'Lag\' at 304. Please fix the lagging. I don\'t appreciate it being lagged on the 300\'s, especially when it REPEATS on the EXACT number.',
       'literally every song fails you at 402 because it freezes on the 402nd note you hit, then skips ahead a few notes and fails you. Would have been fun if it wasn\'t for that major defect.',
       'Vey addictive and fun... good practice on focusing and sitting still got my twin girls.  They love challenging each other,  until MOM comes and beats them both.  :)',
       'If your a beginner the first song get too quick, and the music is displeasing. I find this game to be laggy and it messes me up.',

      'I love this game. Just like other reviews say, it is addicting and because there are constant tasks to complete. Plus!..unlike other games, there is no way you ruin out of coins/money. The cities bring in alot. I can\'t agree with one reviewer that megabucks are hard not come by.  I began with 25 I believe (now at 32) and some of the tasks to complete give megabucks without spending actual money to even purchase some.  All in all, try this game and you won\'t run bored of it.',
       'Great, but really needs "sell all" function for dealing with store house and "pecial buildings" components.This is a really quality game, looks amazing, works well and has good timed construction projects. However, as others mention it takes SOOOOOOO long to accrue the assets for construction and the mega bucks for expansion. You have to be VERY patient if you are not willing to part with actual cash. An idea might be to offer a conversion of coins to megabuck, maybe get 1 buck in excahge for eg 5,000,000 coins?',
       'lnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'The new update is great! Really appreciate the chat system. But it could be better... maybe add some functionality to the capital buildings and states.... maybe bonuses to taxes nd pop, loans, and coop science and military missions. The prices of capital building materials is ridiculous. Fixing these will make the state system look more complete.',
       'Best game!! Very addictive, Been playing this game for over a year.. although, there are still alot to improve!  I hope the developers will include edit mode in the next update so that the players can rearrange their city..Also, I hope they will also include a 360 rotation of the city and add factories that can also create materials needed in the game like the railroad materials and steels. I am looking forward with this updates!!',
       'Been playing for more than 3 years, i lost count. But this is a wonderful game which encourages teamwork and neighbor support. There are barely any paywalls in this game and  if you have hundreds of facebook friends who have this game you can easily get the materials you need to expand your city. No limits so far. I give ★★★★★s' ,

You can\'t collect the food even if you grow it. Since I did have enough gems wood or food to build the warehouse I\'m screwed with no options  but to quit the game. Sucks it could have been good.

Additionally their ratios for resources are all over the place. I often found it didn\'t make sense to use the "higher" option when a lower faster option was more cost effective.

      'It\'s addictive and fun. I love that I may freely swap teams but it sucks how much is locked, but the price is reasonable so I will unlock mine ASAP! But can you add more songs and stuff? Only 5 choices will get boring for some people. Over all great game!',
       'I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!! ITS LIKE FOR REAL IM ON NUMBER 32ND AND I ALWAYS WIN!!but... i dont win when im a hiphop. IM ONLY THE BEST WHEN IM A BALLERINA!!!!!! and also i tried doing hiphop but i dont win. I hate hiphop. BUT I LOVE BEING A BALLERINA!!! MY DREAM IS BECOMING A DOCTOR BUT I WANT TO GO IN DANCE CLASS!!! SOMETIMES WHEN MY FAMILY IS NOT LOOKING I PRETEND TO BE A BALLERINA!!! HAHAHA!!!!!!😄😅😁😂😀😊☺😉😇😆😸😹👧👩💖💗💘💝💞💟👍👍💎💎💍💍💍💐💐💐👏    👑                                          👗                                           👠',
       'Great game! 🙂This is a great game but I just have one little problem. That is I should be able to get a locked thing when I watch an ad(the one mentioned as,  get for free). In the beginning it was working well, but after some time it would not work. It shows as you can get for free, but even if I click on it many times it would not show an ad, and so does not unlock. My mobile data is  working properly. Plz kaka sure to check on this.Besides, it is one of my favorite games. I absolutely love it. And thnx in advance.',
       'Can Coco games stop being so racist and steriotypical? What ever happened to diversity? Its always the main character as some white girl with blonde hair! My baby sister loves the games but always wants to choose what her character will look! Where are the asians, colored people etc?! Please fix this CoCo!',
       'Why do we have to pay to get everything? Tbh the game is not all that I ain\'t trying to waste my money. It gets so boring with the little choice of everything we have. I\'m sure a lot of people agree with me I mean come on...If you can make these games better I\'ll give a 5 star but rn its a 3 star sorry.',
       'It is mostly fun, but a lot of the things you can do to your dancer cost money. Some say that you can get them free if you watch an ad, but about half of the time when I touch them for the ad the screen goes black and won\'t go back to normal until I close the game and reopen it. Besides that, it is a fun game.' ,

      'Pretty cool! I hate that there is not enough reward to play more.. at least victory chests should be always available or an option to erase a chest so you can use the slot to win a more powerful chest. Idea of the game is good, but for the player becomes more frustrating than enjoyable. You wait for all cards to load then you can\'t use them, only one.. the rest need another reloading.. crappy gameplay.',
       'Don\'t bother playing unless you\'re made of money.  If you play without paying a lot of money you will lose a lot and never win a tournament.  The lag is terrible which also causes you to lose a lot. When you decide to pay for some gems watch out cause they will charge up to 4x the amount, then you get to go through the process of emailing idiots and taking days to get your money back. Plus they don\'t match you to your equal the person could be the champ and you\'ll never win against someone that has played it years longer than you. Well best of luck to those that this review didn\'t scare off.',
       'If u don\'t spend money you will never be a big winner! Everytime a new card comes out everyone buys them up and you can\'t win. That makes this beautiful fun game suck turds!!!!',
       'It\'s a fun game, but don\'t waste you\'re money. If you\'re going to charge $25 for a chest at least give someone a legendary character. Waste of cash, never again!.',
       'Been playing for a year now,very addictive. But its very unreasonable .. ive spend more tha  R1500 on the game and im on 2400 trophies for 5months. They put you against players that\'s much stronger then you..',
       '☠  The  Best ANTI - PLAYER GAME Ever!😆1 yr + of play= GUARENTEES/  No PROGRESSION,  To be robbed,  To be cheated, To be underleveled,  To be overmatched, To be lied to! To be insulted & ignored,  To be taken for a fool😤BUT most importantly........TO BE UNINSTALLED 😋!' ,

      'Do not spend any money on this game. This used to be one of the best slot games until the developers got greedy. Payouts are small and events are nearly impossible. They try to make it all sound good but it\'s not. They also changed the customer service on here where it\'s hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!',
       'I have played this game for many months I have purchased and yet with all the updates you all do it keeps getting worse the payouts on the slots are horrible. The group event games are picked I think to take all our chips so we will be forced to buy I believe that until you make the payouts on the slots better you are going to lose a lot of customers.',
       'Disappointing, Unless you purchase chips.. you can not keep up with the Club event games.  There is no real incentive to continue. IN order to even play you will need to Start with chips over 5 Billion chips.( which you don\'t get) Otherwise you will never even have a fighting chance, as you will be betting low and never gaining.... Or get high.. lose all quick. And then quit.. Or You can Pay out of your pocket.. over and over....',
       'I urge people to stay as far away as possible from this 1! They are robbing lying cheating scumbags, using illegal and and fraudulent tactics to get money from your bank account in to theirs! Such as offering deals and then not giving you what you have paid for! Investigation underway!',
       'Considering the game is called BILLIONAIRE CASINO, the payouts are too little to support the name.  In the first couple of weeks on starting with the game payouts are great then like all other games you are on a continuous loss to PURCHASE COINS. Happy gaming.',

      'The thing that makes this game great is the visuals and the audio. It is absulutley beautiful and the art style works so well with the type of game. Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I\'d very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there\'s a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style',
       'Good graphics, but can get boring after only like 3 minutes. Also the makers of the game should add a another different mode where your running away from a villager/camper and see how far you can get. You could improve or modify this mode that i have made if you want',
       'First off, I\'d like to give a big thank you to the developers for this game. It\'s amazing.  However, I\'ve been encountering quite a few bugs lately. One day, picking up a hover feather crashed the game. Today, I can\'t pick up llama horns, and the background blur that happens when you go into the workshop stayed into an actual run. I took this as a challenge and continued playing. I\'m on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 9.7 running Android Marshmallow.  This is just to tip you guys off on some bugs.',
       'The game is addictive, but i cannot play it more than 10 minutes at a time, because it gets boring. The awful part is that since 1 week, i dunno why, it crashes while i\'m playing.. Anyway, it\'s addictive because after you start playing, you start thinking about it while you\'re not playing',
       'Was really enjoying it until the most recent update. You guys broke the ad version. Now no ads play to get a revive. Disappointing as it was working fine. Why oh why did I say yes to the update? It\'s as if you wanted to force free players to buy the paid version.',
       'I have \'noisy\' brain and anxiety and sometimes the world is too much to bear. This game keeps me calm and collected all the time. The music and gameplay soothe me up. I do get frustrated over the goals but I have nothing but praise and love for this game. Thank you to everyone involved. You all helped a lot. Cannot wait for Alto\'s Odyssey for Android!' ,
    recentChanges: 
      '+ Improved the Premium Alto\'s Adventure experience! To get back into the action faster, Premium users now receive one revive for free per run.',
       '+ Fixed an issue with watching ads for coins.',

Had to close out of the game every time so I just quit playing. Typo many similar more challenging games out there to try and work with this one.',
       'Some things are hidden in such a place makes it hard on note 8 due to curved screen. Level 89 doesn\'t work, as well as other levels where touching the same place over and over and over might get something to work.  Most puzzles are extremely easy,  it\'s just a matter of the game not working.',
       'Good concept but a lot of the puzzles are stupid or they totally don\'t work unless you restart the game which is annoying. There\'s so many glitches I felt like uninstalling so many times! I\'m just glad it\'s over so i can get rid of this app. 3/10 wouldn\'t recommend',
       'Fun and challenging for awhile, but I found most of the levels after 50 impossible to figure out without a cheat sheet. Got frustrating. I\'m at level 60 and about ready to throw in the towel.',

      'This is the best game I have ever played! This game changed my life. The controls are great, and so is the gameplay! I get a deep feeling of satisfaction every time that pigeon eats that delicious fruit. Also you have a great art style man! I\'ve never seen such good, original art in a game like this! Truly amazing! Just kidding, I know you stole that art. This game is horrible.  I hope it gets banned soon.',
       'Listen, I only have this five stars because I want everyone to see this. This game is blatant plagiarism! There is an artist who animated these birds, and the creators of this game stole their art from them! DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. Lawyers have been called, and I expect it to be taken down soon. Please leave a negative review so this game fails! Thank you for reading.',
       'Had to see for myself if it is really plagiarism and I have to say it is so.  I had some doubt at first, but I know for sure now that the animation work is completely stolen.  Now if only you made your own animations you wouldn\'t have your game in jeopardy!  It appears the whole appeal of this inherently bland gameplay is the visuals of dancing birds.  Shame!',
       'This is not a legitimate game. All the artwork and animation featured in the game design is plagiarised from Kevin Gemin, a freelance artist on several platforms. To take and profit from the hard work of an artist and not credit them let alone ask permission is below the scum of the earth. Don\'t download this trash and instead allow me to redirect to the proper source of "inspiration." YouTube - kekeflipnote Tumblr - k-eke Tumblr Twitter - @Kekeflipnote Facebook - @Kekeflipnote Deviantart - kokorokeke Patreon - Keke',
       'All artwork in this game was a ripped animation from kékéflipnote. Do not rate this game high. It\'s committed a crime. It\'s not even subtle about it. The game literally uses the exact same animation but retextured. If you want to help go to the bottom of this page and report it for copycat/impersonation, or go into other and write plaigarism.',
       'The animations in this game are blatantly plagiarized from Kevin Gremin. You would think that a small indie studio would be respectful of freelance artists and their work, but that\'s not the case with Fortafy Games. This is shameful and needs to be removed from this platform, along with apologies and compensation to the artists you stole from.' ,

      'Lots of fun. Simple yet difficult to master. I play everyday. I like the variety of targets. Purchasing option doesnt work. I tried to buy $4.99 of coins in the app. It took my money  but it never added the coins to my score. Google Play credited the amount back to me. Good app overall.',
       'First higher stakes multiplayer and it appeared that the opponent cheated. The time ran out for them to shoot but the game then froze. I was able to change guns, sent emotes, etc. and I was connected to a stable internet connection. I waited 20 minutes until finally sending the game yo the background so I could google if it was a cheat. Low behold I instantly lost all of my coins. Dont waste your time with this game, poorly made and cheaters will take all of your coins in multiplayer.',
       'Uninstalled after 10 mins. Too many pop ups for other games plus the lengthy ads that you can\'t get out of. Great game otherwise.',
       'It is about slowly balancing your gun to release and take the shot within a set time limit but not quite as easy when you actually try. This makes it a challenge to perfect hand eye coordination so that makes for a good game.',
       'I suppose I need a stylus for this bc using my finger makes it too hard to get the accuracy right... However, it\'s a really fun game. I\'d suggest lowering the amount of drift a little bit. Thanks mobrix for a enjoyable shooting Sim!!!',
       'Unable to determine how to use controls. Time control set before gun goes off is wrong. Bad game set up need to update controls' ,

      'Your game is cool and addictive. Just what i was looking for. Nice graphics,decent gameplay,fun racing and awesome rewards. It\'s my favourite game, i play it everyday. But only one problem, everytime it asks to download additional files. I had already downloaded it but still i recive this pop up message. Is this game online ?? If it is then please make it offline..plzzzzz.',
       'Its an overall addictive game but instructions wise it needs to be more giving. You dont really understand whats our task sometimes. Also i think there is a problem with the sensor or something. I mean i do swipe my finger across the screen but the car doesnt move. I have to literally do that twice or thrice sometimes. This makes me lose out. Its not really my phone as everything else works fine.',
       'It\'s a nice game to play, i always play with my son.  But do u hv new update on this game? Ive reached lvl100 and my cars were fully upgtaded few months ago.. and it start getting bored already if there\'re no new lvl',
       'The tracks have unnecessary curves that makes the whole game very disorienting when at high speeds. Also, the app seems to not sensing my finger and never switch tracks at the right time. Hope you can improve.',
       'I like this game, it\'s fun and my son loves watching me play! But it sucks that I have to be in the game in order for the gas to reload itself.. why can\'t it do it outside of the game? It kills my battery having to wait and it also makes my son want to play more and more not understand I need more "gas"',
       'Game crashes when you watch a video to continue, as in nothing on course just road or it shows the front of the car and does nothing. Lastly it will say you failed level if you don\'t get all three goals. I completed level 91 three times on the first and second requirement but always tells me failed level' ,

      'It has a problem, on the map it shows a guy with a hat, but when I go there it is just a building with no one there And I can\'t get any new missions.i have only completed about 4 missions so they can\'t be finished. Please fix this.but great game',
       'Great game but more like a sandbox game. The way you are looking will go off in random directions. Few glitches. Wish the sniper rifle had a scope. Wish there was different shooting mechanics. A little lag and too many damn ads there is even an ad for no ads.',
       'Great game, but it\'s annoying how you have limited ammo, I mean yeah! It\'s realistic, but Ammo is also expensive, and I hate how You can\'t jack a car because if they\'re at a red light, and you\'re trying to jack their car, they may start going, or when you toss them out of the car, they annoy you and sometimes KILL you. So even if you do kill them when they\'re inside of it, you\'re doing damage to the car, not to mention you can\'t even Rob stores like I thought you could. But still. Awesome game!',
       'I love it! Except, when I blow up a police car while it\'s parked, it respawns and about 18 police cars are after me! Although, when that happens, I get killed and spawn on top of the tower with the helicopter and when I do, the police car that I blew up is driving around, crashing into walls, blowing up and then going back! I couldn\'t stop laughing. So... Nothing wrong (except for the load of police after me when I blow up that car), I love it, C ya!',
       'I hate this stupid game I have just played this game and you know what happend it crashed everybody do not play this one game and the second one of this it is a stupid game i never even got to play it and i still think it is stupid sorry for the words just fix it plz JJJJJUUUUUSSSSSSTTTTTT fiiiiixxxxxx ittttttt if i could put no stars i willllll',
       'I loved it because you can get into people\'s car and then get out again then kill them because they are trying to kill you so kill them. and there is a tank and a helicopter in this game and I like it so you could kill people walking and get money or there bullets and wepends. that is why I love this game.' ,

       'ADs??? WHY! this is useless on a toddler game. I also couldn\'t find an option to get rid of them. If this game was better with more options there should be an option to remove ads and have a perfectly mediocre PLAYABLE game!!!',

       'I just do the same thing over and over again. I mean play ,feed ,bath and put baby to bed.',

      'Good I hope they fixed the bug where you double buy a car and it gives you the same car but still takes your money. But its still a great game. Ohh! And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.',
       'Good, but has some bugs I\'m sorry if I\'m being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall',
       'It\'s good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn\'t too much skill involved but it\'s a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I\'ve lost countless games because it doesn\'t stop or doesn\'t back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!',
       'Awesome It\'s a very good game, great graphics even for a bunch of cubes, but I also have an idea. You guys should make a game called smashy water, where we can choose from a wide variety of different boats that run away from boat police. Hopefully I helped you with my idea and I will download if made;-). You can work on the title if needed. Please reply:-)',
       'Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it\'s a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can\'t go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I\'m out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!',
       'Shalom there, The game is awesome. I liked it very much and hoping that in the future they will be more cars to be added. I really hope that "military helicopter" can shoot something, it is funny...so idle. Last thing, a HOVERCRAFT can go "river mode" ! Wrecked... because of...water. Hope you\'ll add the " police boats " in next update. Overall, abundant of thanks and good luck.' ,

      'Awesome game!  Earning money is easy especially with online play and watching ads.  ONLY downfall is earning gold can be a pain,  seem like the only way to get gold is by beating a boss, buying gold with real cash and levelling up which can take some time.  Other then that it\'s a very addictive game if you love BMX that is.  Folloq me on instagram @evans_customz',
       'Very good game but I wish there was a better way of getting gold without having to pay out of your hard working money. Since when did games start asking for cash? I would pay to buy the game but buying gold is stupid as hell.. either way very good game',
       'Stats are meaningless. I was getting beat consistently by a bike with lesser stats. My bike speed was rated at 16 and the other bike was 10 and I got no separation whatsoever. The stats are misleading and only serve to get you to spend real money.',
       'Great game that I would really enjoy putting some time in but it constantly starts to shutter and the frame rate slow way down and makes it impossible to hit your marks. I had a subscription but decided to cancel it because the game is unplayable. Please fix and Its a 5 star game and worth the subscription. (Galaxy Note8)',
       'Cool little game with very few ads. The only downside is you have to buy gold to upgrade your bicycles so if you don\'t pay to win that\'s just a great time killer.',
       'Game has great potential but you can\'t get past the 3rd level without spending money to buy gold. I understand the free game thing but come on. The 3rd level? Really? Stats are meaningless. I keep getting beat by a bike 2 levels under mine. Save your time.' ,

And I LOVE how you can change the hair colors! the reason I didn\'t rate this game all of its stars is because, I can\'t find the pictures of the girls I made and saved, and you can\'t change the girls outfits, but don\'t let that stop you from getting this game because it\'s great!',

       'you need more choices for style like maybe theres  should be clothes lvls too and maybe more hair coloring the colors that you picked are kinda un useful you need more hats  too  the three hats hats are kinda ugly an dwere trying to make it pretty so maybe a funny section of hats and a modern section of hats and necklaces they need more like maybe you could costumize one for your character     and maybe you could choose more charcters  for your desighns i know i know this isnt a quick review but it was just som ideas',
       'I like game because we are free to create hairstyle in our own way there is no copy mode and i like that i think you should add more colors and some more accesories and hat for a complete look in game and last thing is add new accessories  and colors without deleting old ones they are also needed in game and KEEP YOUR GAME FREE SO WE CAN USE OUR CREATIVITY.',
       'Its very good game for children and I make different hair style. And most good thing is we do everything in this game by our',
       'I like it I do the best salon I can for the girls and my pics of them for when I finished r amazing but I think that there should be some boys in the game as well because I am a bit of a tomboy and boys are good in hair games and I think that there should be a shaver item so that you could cut of all the hair because I really want to cut of all the hair and do a complete redo ok' ,

      'It is inexcusable to allow ads to make such noise when both my phone is in silent mode AND I have the sound off in the game settings! I went over other reviews and the developers wanted to know which ads. Seriously?! How about all of them?! They have to be aware yet refuse to fix the problem. Do not download this intrusive app. Also I get a migraine with the annoying "Ready? Let\'s go!" voice when the sound is on.',
       'Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you\'re given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.',
       'Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.',
       'Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.',
       'The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item.',
       'Game is fun until you run out of lives. Then you either pay money or watch a video. I\'m ok watching an ad to get extra things, but just to play the game? Disappointing.' ,

      'Great game. Loving it. I noticed when you go into the Alter, there is a note telling you your capacity limit at the bottom but in the Mana gem screen it doesn\'t tell you. Are you able to add this feature? I can never remember my mana creating limit.  If you make more mana than can fit in your mana storage line, you lose the excess.',
       'AWESOME!!! Originally, I was very reluctant to download this becuase I though it was going to be where you just sit and watch your character do everything for you. I HATE those types of games... This however is actually how I was really hoping it would turn out to be! You can move freely! The levels are linear and its not very open, but thats okay! You see each piece of equipment on your character when you wear it, which is absolutely essential to me! I will not play a game where my appearance does not change, so this has all in all met my expectations! Another RPG worthy of my collection! Thank you!!!',
       'What started out a 5 star wonderful game has dropped to a prime example of how Not to treat loyal players and followers. With the latest update to "rebalance" which stripped long time players of attack powers, levels and hit points the developers should take notice of how many people no longer spend valuable time on their offerings. This is sadly another one for the uninstall button because after months of grinding to improve my character to now basically start over isnt worth it',
       'It was bad enough what the update did to players characters.......but after your patch to supposedly take into account players objections about how their characters statistics were lowered,  my character lost another power level and 2 million in power after the patch. Absolutely pathetic how you have treated the players who have played this game. Perhaps I should contact some of my friends that are Bratva to represent me and voice my complaints. Have a nice day!',
       'Think I\'m the same as most people who have been playing for a long time. With the new update its just to much of a un-enjoyable grind for nothing when for all we know the game will update again and we\'ll be set back and have to grind all over again.',
       'Result of your update, invisible walls,  player getting stuck running like a idiot, you created a algorithm for a headless chicken, good thing I advised my friends NOT to download it, if it ain\'t broke don\'t fix it, g___dy b___s__t artist. I bet all the good reviews you got were done in your offices, shed or bedrooms, back to ye olde ps4.' ,

And you become a monkey watching adds rather than participating a very simple game of would you rather.',

      'First of all rooms option is not working as expected.. it\'s just waits for a while and exits. We definitely tried it correctly.. but still did not get connected. We cannot play with FB friends.. and the dice is always favourable to others.. all my 4 pawns just sit in home while other players almost complete the game.. I really don\'t know why I don\'t get six.. even after several chances.. too much of heart breaking game.. 🤐😓',
       'Thank you for developer who made this game. My friend recommend this game for me. This game is really fun, I really enjoy it so much. This game also reminds me about my childhood in the past. Anyone who rated this games below 4 stars are really doesn\'t have a good childhood memories. Keep it up with the games like this. I don\'t care about ads and anything, I just want to play and reminds again about my childhood memories. Thank you very much for create this game and have a nice day!.',
       'PUndoubtedly this is a wonderful and simple game...  Got addicted to it....  I love ur game graphics it\'s simple and superb....    And I would like to suggest an idea....  For suppose if only two people are available to play in a room, then its little boring as rest two slots will be no danger for coins....  For this I suggest if two players are selected then the other two slots should be automatically filled with any other player or computer....  Same with if three player selected....  The other one would be anyone or the computer....  Then all four slots will play and it will be interesting....',
       'I love this game.. I do get addicted few times.. It certainly reminds me of my childhood... i suggest if d admin can put on few updates such as: 1. Showing d coins of all d players on table 2. Transfer options of coins 3.  The option to connect to the table where a online friend is playing and 4. For definitely, you should provide live chat options I hope my comment gets published and my suggestions are taken into account. Thank you so much for this app admin :))',
       'My best wishes to the Game development team. It\'s such a nice peace of work. The game\'s pro\'s makes the game player\'s to get addicted to it. But the cons which I noticed is that, several times due to heavy traffic it shows multiplayer time-out without our knowledge & game in-between stucks randomly making the player\'s win cheaply. Hope if this concern is looked into. Everything will be smooth & awesome. Try to secure the coins earned by player\'s to progress while updating the app & make sure it won\'t be vanished. Thank you!',
       'The game is all nice and good, but with some bugs. Sometimes it is unable to connect to friends when playing on a room. At times the game has connectivity issues and just stalls with no UI notification. Also I\'ve found other player\'s tokens sitting in my house. Otherwise, this is a fantastic game. Would love to see the suggestions by other reviewers implemented.' ,

      'I do like this game. The support team is good and are helpful when they can be. But the silver and points awarded are much too low in my opinion, when in comparison to the costs of modules and supplies consumed during battles. Also the supply crates could stand to be better. The ships are pretty awesome and are very well rendered. Very good graphics. Everything runs smoothly with no lag or server issues.',
       'This game is great, it\'s a lot of fun. Until it decides that you\'re not allowed to pass the loading screen.  Then there\'s the premium store. The pricing is pretty outrageous for a mobile game. $35 for a t5? I paid less than that for my Matilda IV on WOT. Please address this issue. So we can actually show you our patronage. You occupy our spare 15 minutes. Not hours daily. Think of where this is played and charge accordinly. That\'s all I have to say.',
       'Haifuri brought me here I am sure this will be a pretty interesting game. I heard hsf harekaze and hsf spee is going to be here cant wait for it....  I encountered a game bug.. I was using a destroyer class ship and the steering wheel won\'t turned after I  pressed the left steer the ship just went on spinning left...please resolve this issue\'s',
       'Connection issues. Don\'t bother with playing on hotel Wi-Fi. The mcDs or the coffee shop. Forget about it on 3G. Because you need to have a full wired connection just to not hop around the map with the superb lag spikes. Spending tons of time shooting and hitting the enemy getting zero registry. In short good looking game spent hundreds of hours on the desktop version. But this doesn\'t seem keenly executed. Not connected to my desktop account? Why bother?',
       'This is a great game!!.  Yes, computers have issues, yes its short then the PC version.  This is not a PC.  This is a great 5 minute break.  I play the PC game too.  Its flipping fantastic.  The programmers at WOW are brilliant  and they care about the product.  If you love histroy, Warships, strategic games pitting you against other human players.  GET THIS YOUR GAME.  There are other warship games.  None get it more right then WOW.',
       'The games mechanics and controls need an overhaul. The secondary weapons should be automated as fast firing ships operating in touch screen controls requires immense micro management. Second, the post battle screen graphs extremely limited battle details and the UI is equally as lacking in features and navigation. Finally, the battle time is far to short and the majority of battles are ended with ships still in action on both teams. Potential to be a 5 star rating when the mechanics become as user friendly as they they are on PC.' ,

      'Great concept but it takes an eternity to make profits, level up, replenish supplies, and be able to afford appliances required to accommodate the demands of tje  clients. In about an hour you can come back to the game and have made 60$, but you need 1800$ to buy a freezer to make iced tea. The objectives can be difficult  because one person will say "you need to put these French style chairs before I can give you diamonds" whereas another person says that you need to have the entire cafe Chinese style. This game is fun for five minutes at a time but too slow to play more than that.  It\'s a game you have to come back to every so often to buy stuff you need to progress',
       'Well, I\'m changing my review. This game quickly gets to the point where they push you to spend real money in order to proceed successfully. Special orders require many diamonds which soon run out so you need to buy more to keep your customers happy. They also push for you to buy up to VIP  status. So, if you dont mind spending your own money, then its a great game! Addictive and fun. It certainly keeps you busy!',
       'After months of playing this game I realised  no need to keep gems but to spend them snd rewards are amazing when you got gifts for fulfilling the tasks. So slow pacing. Could have been more exciting but I like this game and I belong to a township that\'s competitive and kind. Awesome game!',
       'This game is a scam. You have to spend a lot of money in diamonds just to move to the next level. Once your out of diamonds, if you don\'t win a pink or gold box, you can\'t buy the tea spices needed to boost your level. The competition rarely plays and the group\'s are inactive.',
       'So far its good. But I had to figure out on my own how to serve the blended specialties to my customers. An editorial would have been nice, but overall great game! One more thing, the character Bill keeps asking me to rate the game, even though I\'ve already done so. Please fix this.',
       'The game lags sometimes and you have to redo all the progress you did during the half- hour if the game closes by itself after the lag.  It\'s just disappointing when you\'ve done something with the spice orders and when you go back after  the lag and re-do it, the spice orders are different so you can\'t do the exact same thing you did before lag. It would be ok if you were re-doing everything starting off with the same inventory in your spice both as before, but there\'s always a part that has changed.Like if you used a spice before the lag, it might not be there anymore when you open the game. Other than that,  I really enjoy the game. It\'s fun and doesn\'t get boring no matter how long you\'ve played. It\'s just the lag-close-changes in inventory and progress that\'s always disappointing every time it happens.' ,

      'This game is brilliant my only problem is the fact that I cant stay in a match for more than 2 seconds without being kicked out also im not entirely sure what the point in the 1st question is, why ask if a game scared you if it isn\'t scary? Either way this game Is jaw dropping I hope you improve on it and add new gamemodes aswell. One more thing I suggest adding a zombie survival mode or defence.',
       'Im pissed of. I deleted the game bcz the server keeps crashing. I redownloaded it and same issue. Im afin pissed of rn. Ive sent an email and freak it didnt help. Update? It didnt help. Man..u guys stink. U guys deserve no star at all. Waited a whole month man.',
       'Great job on a well made game, but your balancing is awful. And to top it, paid players ruin everyone\'s morale. I understand that you tend to favour them because they are your revenue, but that does not mean that you completely ignore the others.',
       'Worst game ever always disconnected me from multiplayer gameplay . Always says network connection lost. I have High speed net then also says network connection is not there.are you serious. But the game is awesome.but multiplayer worst.hate it.',
       'I Really Love This Game, But I Have Problem! Everything Is OK, Just The Lagging When I Play The Game, When I Meet Other Player It\'s Start Lagging, And When I Far From Player, It\'s Smooth, But, I Don\'t Know Is That My Phone Problem Or The App.',
       'It\'s an absolutely wonderful game but the synchronization error is back and it has made me make like 5 accounts. I would have quit but I\'m to addicted to this game and now it\'s back I cant restart im 2 for in, 2 much progress. Plz fix it once more' ,

      'Quick fire is the best but theres only one down fall, the seconds. When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..',
       'Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven\'t gotten very far yet. Thing I DON\'T like is you don\'t get an average..... IF you do, I\'ve yet to find where it is in the game. That\'s in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯',
       'Does exactly what it says on the tin....great wee game. What are you looking for??  To zone out from your reality for ten minutes? To forget about the job, the crap pay, the partner you don\'t really fancy anymore? To stop you actually having to talk to your friends and family... Well download this game and feel like a winner.',
       'It\'s a  fun game but it\'s rigged. I think if you have a billion chips you shouldn\'t be able to play on lower lanes. I thought you were supposed to be matched up with people who are the same or close level. How is it I\'m bowling against someone who is level 171 and 8 billion chips and  I\'m level 43 .',
       'Amazing.  It\'s just fun watching the bowling hall whizz by and get a strike.  I\'ve played and uninstalled this game, but the only reason for the uninstall part is storage.  For all of you who are new, try getting the ball between the front pin and either of the pins next to it, it usually gets strikes, but by strikes I mean doubles against level 7 Russians.',
       'This is a fun game however it allows people to cheat or it\'s rigged. It\'s no coincidence that the better I play the better my opponent plays. I think half the time we are playing a rigged computer. I spent $50 on this app in a week and I am deleting it now. Sorry crooked people that run this app.' ,

Please fix these couple of things and I will rate thus game 5 stars. Thank you☺',
       'Its okay, but the lighting is very poor. The reason im writing this is because for some reason I get on here and all the wolfs are misshaped... the body in on the floor, the legs are in the middle and the head is on top... its funny but creepy. Please fix the wolf and the lighting.  THANKS!!',
       'Theirs one thing that keeps happening taht is annoing Plus I half to wait 1 day for it to stop.Its hat out of no where I start moving foward and I cant stop and when I try to fly I go state up its horrible it just happend.   :(',

       'Why waste $ on Minecraft when you got this? This ones free, better and perfect! Love building homes in caves, and all I want is a horse and maybe a mutant!',
       'Really Awesome Game. Suggestion: Can you add a boat (a rowboat is fine), remove the top height limit (which is just 1 block below the clouds) & include the night in creative mode cuz I rly want to see the glowstone, lava & torches that I put fulfill their one true purpose. Please grant me these wishes. But if you wont then...ok. No pressure tho.' ,

      'Some of the objectives are impossible complete. Like collecting the snowflakes in the big air. It\'s easy to find them but the locations they turn up make it impossible. And completing the rail slides in the halfpipe... I\'ve done more than enough board slides of every type and it won\'t complete. Still gave 5 stars though. The game reminds me of the original Shawn white pro snowboarding games.',
       'Love the game. Disappointed that after making the quad exp purchase I am sti seeing ads. Kinda makes you not wanna play a game when you realize a developer is only out to nickel and dime customers to death...',
       'Really fun game with one glitch. Great graphics, great sound, really fun gameplay. However you cannot complete all the challenges. So as long as gamification completeness is not your goal and you can leave things showing as 14/15 complete then all is good.',
       'Ok so the last time I uninstalled was because the tutorial sucked and the menu was bad and the controls were horrific. Now with the new update, the same tutorials are finally finishable, the menu looks so much better. only thing keeping me from giving a five star are the controls, too sensitive',
       'Love it. Reminds me of my ssx tricky days, combined with the game objectives of Tony hawk\'s games. Played it once & immediately bought it. Well worth the money, I\'ve already spent hours playing this',
       'Some of the mechanics of the game are broken. There are multiple goals I have completed (such as do a double backflip with any grab) that you don\'t get the credit for, and there\'s even a stage that won\'t unlock despite me completing every goal in the prior level while it apparently only needs 8 of the 15 to be done. Also, one of the goals is to complete a "penta flip." I have no idea what this is, and it isn\'t included in the diagram of how-to\'s. As far as I know, this can\'t be done within the game. It\'s a decent game, but the freestyle tracks are very open and repetitive to the point of boredom. I do like how many modes there are though. If you\'re willing to deal with occasional ads you could do a lot worse than this game.' ,

    description: 'Children\'s doctor - we all love when people around us smile. We become well and happy when someone on the street gives us a smile. But for a smile to be beautiful, you need to take good care of your teeth. This applies to your pets, because in childhood they were for every kid. Like people, they also sometimes need to treat their teeth. This can be done by a special doctor - dentist. We present to your attention an exciting game for children - a dentist (vet clinic). In this entertaining game, your child is a real dentist, under the guidance of which there is a hospital for animals. The kid is entrusted with a very important and responsible task - the treatment of teeth of his four-footed pups, whose teeth began to ache heavily because of their love for sweets. You have to treat them in a real dental office, use various medical instruments, such as tongs, scalpels, Burmashin and many others, to clean your four-legged friends of teeth from plaque, align them, do operations, remove cavities and fill them. After all, they all just need your help. For her, the animals will be grateful to you and very grateful. Developing games for children, such as a veterinarian, contribute to the overall development of your child. They help to develop fine motor skills, coordination of movements, visual perception, attentiveness and observation, will show the baby how to treat animals, take care of them. Our games for kids, such as a dentist, will teach them not only to treat their pets with love and care, but also to protect their own teeth, do not forget to clean them several times a day, because going to the dentist is not the most pleasant pastime. For the purpose of comprehensive development of the child, we create applications and educational games for children that are aimed to help boys and girls develop basic motor and other skills, and also have fun, fun and useful to spend their free time. All you need is to download games, install and start playing, and in the future your child can choose one of the most needed professions in the world - the dentist Be sure to visit our http://yovogames.com and also we are at:Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZruadkJJTuD4Bgb1F6pa3ATwitter: https://twitter.com/YOVOstudioFacebook: https://facebook.com/yovogames',

       'My 3 year old loves it but she can\'t play it by herself because of  the constant full screen ads that she can\'t dismiss without my help. Useless',
       'My daughter loves the game but keeps touching the ads by mistake and then all game progress is lost when you go back to it. It\'s incredibly annoying.',
       'Too many ads and the animals teeth issues never change just the same issues for the same animal at least mix it up a bit it was very lame',
       'Ads are super annoying because 4 yr old keeps accidentally triggering therm.  He loves the game though.  Improved his skills with touch screen.' ,

      'Whenever I try to open the app the screen starts flashing black and it\'ll stay like that or keeping turning back to the screen I was on and off, which ends up somewhat strobe-like. The actual game itself is amazing despite having a hard time trying to beat the bacteria level but, what\'s the point of a good game concept, if the game won\'t work properly',
       'I thought the new scenario was a free-trial only like the simian flu. (At least you can unlock it after being a brutal pro at the game) I\'m gonna enjoy playing this a good few times and unlock even MORE scenarios. Keep up the good work! I wanted to make a suggestion, but I just can\'t remember now. Oh well...',
       'Fun game. I wish the rate of death was more consistent. 37,000,000 a day at one point, but waiting 6 months for 100,000 to die towards the end. The disease didn\'t change, the rate of death shouldn\'t decrease just because there are fewer people. Good game otherwise',
       'I didn\'t buy the new plague, i might need to. The first 2 difficulty settings are easy, the 3rd not so much. Good game to me! Just have to read what it is that you spend your DNA points on and you should do just fine',
       'Really annoying ads keep repeating and covering controls.  So annoying. Pity as game is unplayable like this. It never used to happen before. Why can\'t developer just charge for extra content rather than make game unplayable. Will have to remove.',
       'Awesome game! Very addicting! You can replay over and over and it doesn\'t get boring! Just keeps getting better!  There is no need to buy if you don\'t want to.... Just because you suck doesn\'t mean it isn\'t beatable... You shouldn\'t give low stars because it\'s a difficult game! It\'s very beatable without purchase!!!  5 stars!!!!  Just keep trying!

      'Had I read the reviews,  I probably would\'ve  second guessed getting the game. However, the gameplay is very different, its really interesting,  and highly addictive.  Despite people saying its a pay to win,  it is not. Its actually pretty fair as long as you can keep up with it. I have yet to pay a cent in this game and have advanced just as fast and even have better and higher level birds than many that ive seen.  Hands down my favorite game ever.  The events are also a plus plus because they give you a good amount of rewards.',
       'Great in a new twist with more directives and challenges as well as strategy. Downside is costs and rates of h9w much gold is found leaves inclinations to be geared toward in app purchases or a lot of waiting time in between. Nice update would be to ease the cost of leveling birds and adjust the amount of gold found daily and for battles to equal out the waiting for scouts and such.',
       'The game so fresh and really fun but honestly.. the screen sometimes hang or stuck suddenly while I\'m playing it, it\'s not caused my phone or internet connection, I\'ve tried with different phone and the result is similar.. and I have high spec phone 2gb ram, 32gb rom, cpu 1,25 ghz and 4g line.. make it better and better again cause I love to play it without hang screen, for now I only give u 3 stars',
       'Used to be beyond awesome. Beware before playing this game... There are great rewards but it costs money and there is no guarantee of getting the rewards. It\'s the luck of the draw... Plus you are forced to play against stronger players, and therefore struggle to progress in the game. I used to love this game... You have been warned.',
       'Addictive!  Sucks because they changed it to make you have to spend money on  a "FREE" (NOT) game,  ads ads ads...... made it so new players get any advantage, the AI in arenas is rigged to make you lose when you shouldn\'t.  Special events are a joke,  unless you spend big bucks you are not getting anything above a 3 star bird! Update they changed it again!  For the worse! Just a money grab game beware! Updates continue to make things worse,  people are quitting the game because of it.',
       'The game itself is really fun but I despise the gambling form of monetization. I realize there needs to be a way to finance development, but just because it\'s widely used doesn\'t make it right. Let me buy the birds I want instead of relying on luck and I amp up the  rating.' ,

      'It was undoubtedly one of a kind and perfect game at the time of it\'s release. Everything from balancing to controls and gameplay was perfect. Until.....until developers thought of this "awesome" idea of putting it on steam and allowing PC community to play it. The game that was originally designed for mobile users now overwhelmed with PC users. I mean how devs thought that\'s a good idea to compare PC to mobile??? PC players are right now literally annihilating every mobile gamer. We have no chance against them they\'re better in everything from controls to aiming shooting. Once beloved game now lays in ruins conquered by PC community.',
       'I would like to have the game on my phone that way i can spend money on the game instead of on tablet as it is more comfortable. The game costs over 3gb! My phone has that but with all the apps that come with the phone that you cannot remove. I have only over 1gb. Sorry wargaming the game costs too much data. Once that is fixed ill change rating given and review. I would play the game if it costed one gigabyte.',
       'This game has great graphics, great controls, great features. Why only 3 stars then? It seems to be so heavily rigged and winning is almost never. With premium account you will advance quicker but i don\'t believe i am alone with my opinion that you will quit this game frustration winning. Since writing and thinking 3 was fair i have now reduced to a 1 as the email sent to the developing team bounced because their mail box is full. Wonder why!',
       'This game is great in my opinion. Once you understand how everything works and the techniques while playing, winning becomes more common. My only little complaint is that since the last update i dont always recieve my 10 pieces of gold. Ill watch the 5 ads a day but only recieve 30 or 40 gold total. It would be nice if we got paid the 10 gold after every ad like how it used to be. Not everyone has the money or is willing to spend the money on gold. It would be great if this could get fixed. Thanks',
       'Before update it was easy to play on 100 to 150 ping. It was smooth. But after 4.6 ... It cant be smooth like before. It lags alot...and cant defend myself properly. Barely i cant shot someone with laggy gameplay because of ping. My normal ping is just b/w 100 to 180 ....and i cant get lesser than this. Plz do smthing. #wargaming',
       'They muted me for 20 days bcs some a hole reported me for small arguing. F%=k WG bunch of low life lazy pigs. Get life A holes. I cant believe some bunch of morons think to judge and they cant even have proper lifes. Disgusting.' ,

       'I was forced to view 10   DIFFERENT ADS before ever even getting into this game.  I refuse to support money grubbers.  They (including Google) lack integrity are ruining this country.',
       'This is pretty sweet.  Its a great way to make stylized graphics  A lot of reviewers were complaining that it has a ton of ads tho, but you can get rid of them for 99 cents.  If you like this, dont whine just pay the piper or play something else.  Develepers have to eat, ya know???  If you want a free alternative, (or if you are curious about how this stuff works) i suggest looking into the open processing language.  You can learn to make your own cool stuff like this by finding a couple of algorithms online   Also, if you have a good graphics card in your pc/mac and you are interested in this stuff  check out touch designer.  You can make some really amazing realtime art  But seriously, support these developers if you like the program.  Its that simple.  99 cents is not much money!!  Ok luvya byebye',
       'If you love beautiful sights, you should download this app.You get to watch your creation from video! Also, as it has in the app pictures, there are different choices of design! The only bad thing is that there is kind of a lot of ads.But, that\'s fine! Its SUPER satisfying to me, and my sister! So, as you think, you should download this app.',

      'I really do enjoy playing this game. It\'s a great time waster. Good for breaks at work. Public transit. Bored at home. Good graphics. You can choose the controls method. Great car selection. I enjoy it so much, to help the creator I spend a few bucks now and then. It\'s one of the few games I actually play. Just wish there was actual racing. Or if you could have police chasing you, rather than being the police. Either way, good game. Those would be great to implement. 😁',
       'THIS GAME IS OVERPOWERD I\'ve been finding a game that is  A Leagend Car game. Then i found this cool game and  I PLAYED IT ALOT. But not forever.   🎵THE STORY🎵  When i\'ve played it i saw a !alarm At the gifts then i liked you at facebook Then i subscribed you on youtube  And i liked you at twitter too. Then theres a free luckybucy thing. The free watch and then you will have $500.THANK YOU FOR THE GAME',
       'This game is getting boring. Yah, Next Generation Endless Racing blahblah. But is this all about endless whatever? I think you must put some thrill to this game. This is nothing compared to Traffic Rider which is you also create that game (Yeah. Traffic Rider is one of my fav game.) I HOPE YOU PUT SOMETHING THRILLING LIKE MISSIONS *NOT DAILY MISSION* AND PUT SOME CAR NAMES IN IT. ONE MORE HOPE YOU MAKE THE CARS IN TRAFFIC MORE REALISTIC IT LOOKS LIKE A MOVING BOX... AND I WANT SOME FEEDBACK.',
       'Hello, 😊 I really love this game, my favourite actually! I have play a lot of games, but this one is the best so far! PS.:I never spent real money on games! But in this game you don\'t really have to, so it\'s even better for me and for people who can\'t spend real money in virtual things. I know that there are 1 or 2 cars in the game that you can only buy with real money, but it still is a perfect game in my opinion! 😉',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a long time on a couple devices and it\'s been a lot of fun. There seems to be some variations in scale of one compact car to another. The models themselves don\'t quite seem to be in scale to each other. You might have two hatch backs that should both be small, even very near in size but when you\'re looking at cars to buy you can tell that the model itself just isn\'t quite the right size compared to other similar cars, and then when you get out on the road with it, it looks bigger than it should compared to other vehicles on the road around it. But.. That\'s not too big of a deal. Great game!',
       'Fun, decent selection of vehicles, graphics and controls look and  work great. But theres a car with no way to get it but paying 15 actual dollars and I hate that. Everything should be earnable even if basically impossible to earn and $15 is alot of money for a single vehicle in a small limited android game. Even the dlc cars in major games like gran turismo and forza are cheaper and those games are way better. That aspect of the game is just confusing is all. Still fun to play.' ,

      'I liked the game more personally before the recent update. I have a newer phone & since game play mostly in shooting basket race is glitchy, along with buying things on the app, I hate that you can only have room for so many bags it makes it me want to stop playing after a bit. I can see waiting 15 min, 30, 45min, maybe an hour but not up to 12 hours. I used to like being able to buy the standard bag for old gold bar gave me something to look forward too if I won gold in a match.',
       'Fun game. But constantly asking me to buy something is annoying. Also, good graphics but control are not good enough. It malfunction, player with bad connection has advantage and wins game and money. That\'s problematic.',
       'I effing hate the new ways, they just made me pay 25,000 to upgrade my ball when it used to be 2 gs. But other than that this game is badasss',
       'Well... sometimes when I play some people I think mite be hacking the game or cheating. they don\'t miss one shot and I make none or sometimes one or two, that is the only down side but other than that it\'s a good game (suggesten have people by gold or game coins with the money in the game)',
       'So, be prepared for this, Miniclip will suspend you for gaining an advantage on their system. How you do that? I have no idea. But, today I was told that I am suspended from getting credit for my wins. Yeah, what a waste of money to spend on this app, do not do it',
       'The new bags won after a win are meant to get you to spend real money to open them up quicker by using gold. It\'s so obvious a money grab for mini games, it\'s sad. Also, the more real money you pay to get a better in game basketball, the more skills you\'ll have to beat anyone. That\'s why so many people scream about cheaters. There aren\'t any cheaters, just those who paid real money to pad the pockets of miniclip and make the game a true pay-to-win clustermuck.' ,

      'DON\'T EVER. EVER  EVER EVER DOWLOAD THIS GAME. This game is a disgrace. This game is a ripoff of a good game called shooty skies. All the "good reviews" are from cringey 9 year olds or their parents. Nick has never been good with game. ESPECIALLY in this dark age. Parents go get your kids shooty skies. Not this hunk of garbage. Also (my opinion)  Cartoon network is much better than Nick.',

       'This game is awesome! For haters who are saying this is a ripoff of shooty skies you probably never watched game shakers.Anyway shooty skies is stupid and has add this fame doesnt',
       'THIS GAME IS AWESOME !! I beat the first place! and i love nick! (or maybe Nickelodeon) yeah but the power ups maybe limited because it\'s very important to fight bosses and enemies and why it\'s blocky? Thanks To: Babe, Kenzie,Hudson,Trip.' ,

      'Cutest virtual pet game around! I\'ve never had an app so simple, yet it never gets boring. The controls are simple and user-friendly. It\'s easy to earn money, food and useful items just by shaking trees in the community or watching ads. I\'ve gotten many things from letting my Boo sleep and watching ads, then getting to pick a gift. The customization of your personal boo is also fantastic. Great way to entertain children or unwind at the end of the long day.',
       'Do you have a pet? If not, My Boo is a great way to know how it feels to have something to look after. With loads of awesome mini games, it\'s so fun to dress your Boo up in cute outfits and hairstyles! Feed it and play with it and it will love you! Honestly, I don\'t know how else to put this: My Boo is the best (and cutest) game ever!',
       'This game is really fun and cute!! I love it, its great when you\'re super bored, or something. The only problem I\'m having, is the when I go to change my boo\'s name, it won\'t let me delete any of the letters. Sooo... Yeah, um, other than that, its a great game. Also... WHY NO DELETE!?!? 😲 plz fix.',
       'I love this app. I have searched long and hard for a perfect virtual pet, and I found it in this cute little game. I LOVE the minigames, and the cute little sounds and faces the boo makes add to the charm of this game. Also, I love how there are a TON of options for customization, and even different kinds of food. I only wish there weren\'t so many ads and in app purchases... Oh well, a little thing like that won\'t stop me from loving this app.  My little Boo is named Marcellus, and I care for him as though he were a real animal. Lol',
       'It lets you change the style/look. And you can name your boo and lots more! I at first didn\'t think I really would appreciate it. It  is fun it is also sooooo cute you can name your boo anything you like l think it\'s the best game in the whole world!',
       'I love this game. It is like taking care of a real child. I\'m glad this is a free game bc now that ik how this app works I don\'t think i would be able to live without. The only thing I don\'t like is how it takes so much time to move to the next level. 💖💟🖤💜💛💚💙💞🐞😻' ,

      'I think SA should do a better job than what they are doing. Including me we all be screwed not once not twice but at least five times each player that did not mod and/or hack. You change the damages on skills that should be left alone and over half my friends is in Hacker Hell so my question to u guys fix this and give us some gifts cuz we\'ve been faithful for giving you guys money and it be nice to receive some compensation.',
       'This game is very nice! But I would suggest adding a single player, so that you can find your mate, make pups and bring them with you on multi player! Also add more wolf colors and designs! You could also make different landscapes if you want and if you can, you shouls also add bosses and dens for us to live at, this game is very nice and addictive, but I think that if you add all that I mentioned it would become even more popular and addictive! Please hear my plea!',
       'If you\'re looking for a great game, this is not it!!! It\'s a pay to win, with NOTHING to win. Unless you\'re into running in circles chasing woodland animals for months, having your money stolen, or having your stats lowered by the devs after you\'ve worked on it... I suggest finding a different game. Really look at all these reviews if you don\'t believe me.',
       'Well, the graphics are amazing! There are nice views in the game and the animals look cool aswell. There are a few things I would like SA to add and the first one is: mates and cubs. Second is: add friends. Third is: you can eat your own prey and drink water. The Last one is: to make your own separate packs (atleast 5 wolves in each.) That\'s all! If you do any of these I will rate 5 stars! Other than that this is an amazing game. I like the way you can choose your wolf. Recommended for sure!!!!',
       'This game is amazing the best game I love it so much. But I wish the game look like loading screen and plz plz plz make them the wolf better like the white wolf should be fast and stronger where as the the grey wolf should be strong and have more health and the Mexican wolf should be good in defences and health and black wolf should be good in strength and health and speed and there should be multiple maps and are there holiday skins. And it will be nice If you can add friend plz add some different skin for the white wolf. Like the mighty wolf should be in the white wolf category. Edit- I would love it if you .ca  make it night with different animals. And one more thing the creates of this game can you plz plz plz plz make a Dragon game like this cause there are not a lot of nice dragon game out there. Like the white wolf have an ice dragon and plz make a lightning Dragon it is my favourite element.  If you can do all of this I would be so happy .',
       'Too much lag. we won\'t receive each others messages. People will appear offline when they are on. I\'m not the only one with these problems some of my friends have it too. Could you fix it like I\'m not joking. I love this game but cmon fix it. Also, add more wolves pz. Best simulator ever.' ,

      'I think this game is amazing! And is perfectly good in every way!! I can\'t stop playing and look forward to getting new cars. There is just one tiny error that bugs me a bit but I can cope with it. The error is the color of the Ford fiesta xr2. When you race someone else and they have this vehicle on the card the car is black with a tiny red trim on the side but when it\'s on the track it is completely red. I do hope you can will fix this small mistake but apart from that this game is great!!! Thanks for reading :)',
       'Definitely a game for car buffs. It requires using your "mind" to win. I\'m not to sure about my rating yet. But, will definitely change if needed. It\'s unlike any game I\'ve played & I like it! Someone wrote a review that this is a lazy person\'s game... LMAØ, I wish they would show me the games they play while they are running, swimming & mountain climbing "while" they play, smh HAHA!',
       'Game is great. And like every game had it\'s pro\'s and con\'s. To sum this game up in short it is Top Trumps with the race.   Pros: game is different to all the rest out there, car list is really well thought out as well.  Cons the only things I have to say is, it\'s so hard to win decent cars sometimes. Seems quite a pay to win game as card packs are alot of money/gold and you don\'t win alot of money either.   One thing to bare in mind is that once you\'ve completed a level you can go back and claim all the cards from that event giving you more money, cars and rq.',
       'I love the concept and it\'s been great to see how far this game has come, but I\'ve been playing since beta and nearly every update wipes my save data and forces me to restart. Luckily, I don\'t get too far into the game each time, but it is frustrating and enough of a buzz kill for me to drop two stars. If there was a cloud system implemented for saves this game would be a five star in my book',
       'Multiplayer is not fair. Have the same car with lower 0-60 time better traction, and higher mph but still lose. Match play is getting worse. I either have to spend a boatload of money or always come in last place.',
       'The game is great until you finish the campaign. All you have left is daily PvP events and the game quickly ranks you up until it\'s impossible to win with out buying packs for better cars. I have started two and accounts and they both are the same. Starts out fun but quickly turns into a strictly pay to win game.' ,
    recentChanges: 
      '"Two iconic British manufacturers in one update! Jaguar brings everything from the stunning XKSS historic racer and beautiful E-Type to the brutal Project 8. Land Rover gives you some brilliant new options in those tricky off-road races.',
       'We\'re also unveiling the brand new Canyon environment with a mix of on and off-road races. Look out for it in Events and Challenges soon. Happy racing!"' ,

      'An interesting game, it gives the planes a slightly paper feel when viewing them. However, the actual controls are smooth although they can be slightly twitchy at times. The addition of game modes recently was a welcome change to the game and has helped me through many hours of boredom. This game overall is very good and I advise you download it.',
       'Paying doesnt remove ads, not worth it.  UPDATE 2/24/18, still no reconciliation from the developer on the pay scam. I\'ll be going to Google for a refund. I do not recommend this app.  This is a fun game - one you can pick up for a few minutes, or for an hour. I played it before the challenge modes and was still entertained. The ease of use combined with incresing intensity keeps you very engaged. Heres the catch - TOO MANY ADS!   I paid the $3 for an "no ads" experience, only to encounter the same ads that appear in game and after every round, and on screen. The only thing paying for it does is shorten the ad run time, so you can close them after about 5-10 seconds. I am not pleased about this and would not have paid for it if I had known.   Buyers beware...',
       'Last update killed it. Can\'t even see the bottom row to select anything. It\'s covered by an ad and the aircraft selection covers it as well and won\'t go away. Makes it unplayable.',
       'Way to many adds and when I paid to remove them they were still there. Tried to contact them and they never replied. Had to get a refund through Google play. Don\'t waste your time with this app.',
       'Hate this app because of too many advertisement. The game is good but too many advertisment make it worst cant play much because of it. Google play you should work on the advertisment.',
       'So you deleted my initial review. I paid to have the ads removed and yet there\'s an ad after each game. Total rip off. This is quite upsetting. Think I\'ll report you now' ,

      'I play real poker and do pretty well. This game is clearly made to force you to lose your chips and buy chips. They are obvious bots, and the amount of time I have a great hand on a turned and get called by absolutely  nothing but lose on the river is just unreal. I understand it happens, but it happens way too often in this. I have spent alot of real money on thia game in the past, and now I just remembered why I actually stopped playing it',
       'I would like the game very much never had to spend it on time kind of addictive. I can figure the game out sometimes very easily other times not. You can usually tell whether you\'re going to be lucky (those are the times to hit the slot machine while you\'re playing). Sometimes the hardest part e dealing with it dummies who think it\'s bingo. And sometimes I got to admit how you had enough time and I\'ll play that way too but that\'s usually when the game teaches you a lesson at other times it\'s very predictable and I know that I\'m going to get that hand but it\'s fun',
       'Fun game. Most of what I know about this game, I\'ve actually learned by playing it on this app. And yes, it\'s very addictive!! And yes, anyone with negative comments???...they haven\'t taken the time to REALLY know & learn the game & it\'s rules. Just because ya lose...doesn\'t make it a bad game!! LEARN THE GAME & ITS RULES, SPEND A LITTLE TIME ACTUALLY PLAYING, (WITH GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP)...AND YOU\'LL LOVE IT. The more ya play, the better it gets!!',
       'More ad pushes and Facebook posting than anything I\'ve over downloaded. Posts without asking and you can\'t play a single game without 20 notifications asking you to spend money or share it with friends. Popular game but can\'t do anything for 10 minutes after opening app until you sift through all the nonsense they throw at you.',
       'I just left a table after winning big with four 3s. Next hand got beat by four 9s. If you can handle ridiculous hands, bad opponents and repeatedly getting bad beaten by 1% chances on the river then you will love this game. And for some stupid reason I do 😂',
       'There\'s a small bug - once you lost all your money in a tournament, you can\'t see the cards of the other opponents after the show down... Besides that, the app is perfect. I wish I could have this interface in real life games.' ,

       'Love this game.  Dev: you need to update and fix a few bugs. Check both inventory counts .. know the product count is off ... check the add/sub code.  I have maxed on level and would love to move on in this game. But if no update Soon will become bored and uninstall.  When will it be updated? 😐',
       'I think this game is brilliant for all ages not had any problems with this game kn my s5. Only trouble is im upto level 55 need to build some where to b able to craft paint but cant as everything is at max level need a update to carry on as cant visit any other islands due to none bein available but got pleant of flags n maps to b able to open them. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE UPDATE!!!',
       'It was semi fun when I started it in January I had earned 4 pets and paid for all the visiting traders. Those have disappeared along with other decorations I had won and placed. I\'m giving the creators to Friday at noon my time to fix it. If not then I am uninstalling it.',
       'It\'s so laggy it would let me play for 5 minutes then it freezes and it leaves the game and I can\'t get back in! I love the movie but not this. I had to reset my tablet just for this game. Do not download',
       'I have been playing this game for a long time. I have  invested time in expanding my island and now I\'m past level 40. But tonight  all of a sudden my entire Island has reset and I\'m back  to level 1. I can\'t figure out how to fix it and I really  don\'t want to start over. So frustrated.' ,

       'I really like this game. I\'ve never played Minecraft and since it cost money to download the app, this is something fun for me to play and not need to spend money. The only issue I have is in survival mode there doesn\'t seem to be enough cows, and I have only managed to make some shoe armor. But then again, there\'s a lot I haven\'t figured out yet, but it\'s been fun learning.',
       'YAY! FINALLY A GAME LIKE MINECRAFT!!!!!!! Except it doesn\'t have stuff like the animals, buckets, iron doors eg. But what is the Nether react core? It is just a made up block. But please add stuff like levers, iron doors, animals, Redstone, Buttons, iron trapdoors, texture packs, adventure mode,  Redstone torch\'s, Hoppers, Ripeters, dimensions like the Nether and The End, And other stuff from the game, "Minecraft". Also, add skin packs and make it like people can see there hand, and add mobs like dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, and foxes. Dogs, Man\'s best friend. Cats, Always cute. Birds, Watch them well you build. Rabbits, See them jump. Foxes. See one on an adventure. Please Also pay for Minecraft if you want it for stuff like Creepers. Also, add farm animals like chickens, sheep, cows, And other stuff like that. But plz do it. Also, add all paintings, pictures from Minecraft, and caves. I will Enjoy the game more if you do. Bye!',
       'Love the game! My only problem is that for some reason, when I grow wheat and try to get a cow to follow me, well they just ignore me. I haven\'t been able to find carrots for the pigs either. Frankly, I would like to be able breed animals pure and simple. Otherwise good job',
       'It is a nice game but it is just shot of (some) things.. e.g animals, red stone ,pail (can contain milk ,water and lava or it can be empty) , red stone torch, paintings (diffirent sizes),mobs. Also, it would be nice if you can label the items that we picked so that it would be easier for us to pick the item that we want. I hope you can add some more items into the game.it will be more thrilling to play. Thanks' ,

      'Add compatibility with the Disney Party Just Dance games and then this\'ll be good. It works exactly the same as the non-Disney so supporting these games couldn\'t possibly be that difficult. Edit: now the app will not give me the choice of what system I\'m playing on. It\'s stuck on ps4 and I don\'t even have one nor have I ever set up the app that way. I play this game on xbox one.',
       'READ REVIEWS BEFORE INSTALLING! Just downloaded because I haven\'t played in awhile. It wouldn\'t read any of my movements. I had my husband  install it on his phone to see if it would work and it kept disconnecting right before song. Please fix.',
       'I used to love playing just dance, now I hate this stupid game and regret buying it and the Xbox one. Horrible. Can\'t even get the wire to connect a kinect to it so this is useless. This game is the only reason I even bought a console. Seriously wish I could get my money back!',
       'Update-It started disconnecting a lot.  Now I can\'t connect at all making this a $60 waste of disk space.  Please fix!!! Very buggy.  Only app that despite being on same network reqquires I reboot the pjone each time to play.   Can\'t just work.',
       'Ever since I got this game we had no problems playing with the android phones as controllers and now since last week the game keeps disconnecting both phones no matter how many times we reset. So sad as wanted to own this game for so long only to have to deal with these problems now! 😢😢',
       'This is horrible don\'t ever get this app. Every 5 seconds it keeps disconnecting and you can\'t even enjoy it. Microsoft makes it to were you have to Kinect to play just dance. Also now Microsoft doesn\'t even sell Kinect anymore.' ,

       'Enjoyed it at first, and short adverts were expected, but recently adverts have become longer, and now last longer than the game. The latest video advert lasted inbetween games lasted 8 mins....ridiculous!!!. I understand the need for adverts, but if you can\'t play the game, the adverts are pointless, espeacially if it makes players quit.',
       'I just wanted to play Tetris. Happy to pay for it, was hoping I could pay a $5-10 purchase price and then have the game and play it to my liking. No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It\'s TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred',
       'Trying to play Tetris with these abysmal touch and swipe controls is an absolute abject mess. Just add some virtual buttons in, since your loot-boxing asses are supposedly so focussed on \'player choice\' lately.',
       'Great game, but there\'s an annoying window that pops up everytime I try and start a new marathon. The window is pretty much useless and wastes my time. Would give this 5 stars if it gets patched',
       'Since you really really want a review, when I adjust music and SFX to minimum, I expect no sound at all. Please allow for sound to be muted. Very annoying to have button that serve no purpose. Sure you need ads to survive EA big company like you, go ahead but you want to play the ad with sound over what I have playing that\'s annoying enough, at least optimise the sound so that it doesn\'t play at max volume.' ,

      'The game is alright, but I  have some frustrations with it. For one, sometimes when you release the ball, the aim will move suddenly and cause it to hit off of your intend target. Also, it isn\'t cool when you start a new level and you have no available moves (you can\'t pop any bubbles! ), Sometimes for a number of turns, sometimes in the middle or at the end of the level. Usually it is manageable enough. Still frustrating tho. Maybe it is an international challenge of the game..  Overall a decent game',
       'Uninstalling. The controls are imprecise (ball would slip off the desired direction occasionally) and the order of the colours would make it impossible to win on occasion. I can forgive the first thing (muscle) but making it impossible to win is not forgivable.  Work on the algorithm.',
       'Too many ads. Devs are getting greedy with how many ads they put in, I got 3 before I even got to play. Don\'t bother with this junk.',
       'Games really nice good mind challenge, great for color match making if color blind. You may not know what colors your matching however, ever since i started playing i\'ve also been getting better at matching my clothes and random day to day organising of colored items. Love the game however the ball simetimes seems to go where it wants to instead of where you released it... I noticed this a few times i would aim let go and the line would randomly jump to a new spot and the ball shots almost a completely diffrent location',
       'I loved the game before they updated everything. I hate the new levels and the slim and ice balls. I enjoyed this game bcz it was easy and calming but now its just annoying and frustrating!!😫😫😭😤😢',
       'It was great at first. Addicting. I was really looking forward to more levels but they suck. Too many kinds of bubbles. Why did the update change old levels too? Major disappointment.  Edit 2/19/18: it was back to being great when they took away all the extra kinds of bubbles. But after a few hundred levels...they\'re back. Balls with three locks, slime, water bubbles or whatever that is. Lured people back in and then disappointed again.' ,

       'As bare bones and as simple as any other bog standard clicker game. By The time it ever gets interesting you\'re already bored. The music is cheerful but gets old fast. There is a special item to pick up randomly like in other clicker games, however in this one you can collect the same one over and over to no benefit to you. You have to spell out a word in order to get a bonus. A bonus that you can easily get every 10 minutes or so by simply watching an ad. Speaking of ads, they are too long for how much gold or gems you get.  Overall it\'s not a bad game but it\'s just not great. See the weapon thrower series for a similar yet better game.',
       'It\'s ok. Time during battle should offer something to do instead of just watching it happen and waiting. Something to get a bonus to crit chance, or even just a clicker mechanic to slightly speed up MP regen.',

Definitley not a freemiun , though purchases are available. The tech side of combat it is very refined..think Diablo 2 with attack rating bonuses, critical hit %\'s etc.Though skill use is limited so far. Fun time killer though. Isn\'t a lot of d.i.y. in the combat but it still satisfies. Lvl 220...do you ever get out of the forest? Think it might be a little unbalanced in it\'s resource use as well.

      'This game has highly disappointed me.  It was super fun and interactive at first then it gives you the option to pay to continue to play or to complete free offers to unlock the game for free.  I have found that you can complete as many offers ad you want but the game won\'t ever unlock and emailing the support web site doesn\'t do any good either. They don\'t ever respond and it is a complete waste of time.  Don\'t waste your time on this game.  Go out and find yourself something worth playing because this surely isn\'t it.',
       'DO NOT DOWNLOAD CAN NOT BE COMPLETED DUE TO A BUG!!!!!!  After buying you eventually get to the accordion level just before leaving the prison roof only for one (or 2 on some phones) ball being outside the play area which makes the mini game impossible.  Many reviews all over the internet highlighting this bug but the developer has not bothered to fix it.  AVOID THIS DEVELOPER !!!!!!!!!!',
       'It was super fun and interactive at first then it gives you the option to pay to continue to play or to complete free offers to unlock the game for free.I tried  to complete many offers such as surveys, installing a playing another game for certain level, but this game never unlocked no matter what! They don\'t ever respond and it is a complete waste of time. This game has highly disappointed me.',
       'On a serious note, you need to give me this game for free. I downloaded and played two different games to get the game for free and 5 hours later I still don\'t have the full game. I\'ve had to install 5 different games just to get this one for free and I STILL don\'t have the full game. I\'m not impressed!!!',
       'Game is ok.  Tasks are sometimes unclear.  After a few tasks you have to pay to keep going or complete some offer.  Tried several times, but never lets me continue.  Should say it\'s a trial version in description.  No clue how it got a 4+ star rating.',
       'Game would have been ok, however I got to a point where you have to either complete an offer or pay to continue with the game. I completed 2 separate offers and was still unable to continue the game, after which I contacted someone about this several days ago and have yet to hear back or be able to continue with game, very dissatisfied. Horrible customer service.' ,

      'Other than a few of the "encouraging" phrases being the opposite of calming ("buck up"? Really? How is that helpful when I\'m depressed?) its a pretty great game. I like the feature of being able to change time of day and weather. In general pretty calming and I gave 5 stars. But about half the messages just make me feel worse or make me roll my eyes. I tend to ignore them. The rest of the game is fantastic.',
       'Love the game but with the latest update one of the songs I love has been lost. Since hearing it been trying to find it and now I can\'t even listen to it while relaxing on my oasis. Please bring Sogaksgak, Tell you something. Or if it can\'t be brought back can the dev team let me know how to find it please it\'s such a lovely song and I keep coming across deadends trying to find it.',
       'I like this game but there are some aspects of it that confuse me. I don\'t understand the point of resetting the Oasis if I\'m just going to lose everything I worked hard to earn and upgrade. Is resetting the only way to play in the other worlds? Also I reset and am now in the star world and none of my blessings stayed like the game said they should. Please explain the full point to resetting the Oasis, other then remembrance shards.',
       'This is a really nice game! But I find the controls a bit wierd it always relaxes me...I\'ve not been able to stop playing ever since I got it! My Oasis reminds me of Abyss Rium relaxing and the graphics are very similiar and same with the gameplay c; It doesn\'t make me rage this relaxes me I reccomend this if your ok with loads of ads coming up and guaranteeing rewards -_- yeah I don\'t like that part :^ But this still is really nice game',
       'This is a good game for those which are wanting to become more mindful and less stressed. It is very relaxing and calming. I think that the game would be a lot better if it were slightly more complicated and if there were more controls. For example being able to zoom in further,being able to look at the animals up close,being able to walk on the oasis. Etc. Overall It a good game that I can get repetitive.',
       'Fun at first, and recent changes are nice.  However, endgame balance is quite poor.  If you get near or above level 1,000, there is absolutely no reason to upgrade virtues.  I don\'t even know why dandelion seeds are in the game, as they offer no value.  I\'m stuck at 1151 because it takes 6 journeys to get one level.  Oh, and ditch the reset idea.  No way will I reset now.. give a way to just start a new island.' ,

      'I think the game is great but when it says no ads available is a little unpleasant but besides that it is very entertaining great time killer and I enjoy playing it and think that there should have you should be able to enough coins that you can change the backgrounds or create your own puzzle to play with friends🐈',
       'Felt this was too easy. Finally had enough after getting to level 20 in just a couple minutes.  Not challenging as I thought it would become as I got higher in levels.  Also, I thought this would be a type of game that would be timed as well.',

       'Great graphics, good storyline, campaign mode is challenging. It would be better if more scenarios could be added for skirmishes. Overall enjoyed it. I will recommend even for those who don\'t wish to spend money on games.',

      'Great game for its genre. However it desperately needs some events maybe a daily login bonus and some form of vip ladder. I like the nostalgic of the old game but I feel like the developers made the game and just walked away from it. Please for love of games add new stuff and throw some events to us who are almost maxed out. This happens and I\'m totally cool with a 5 star rating',
       'Pretty fun. But I don\'t think drivers or taxi drivers should drive like that, let alone be rewarded for hitting other cars like they do... Lol in the car it\'s cool but I wouldn\'t want to be physically in the game. It\'d hurt and be scary. Lol',
       'This is one of thee worse remakes of a classic I\'ve ever seen. To have a iconic game such as this and reduce it to a one tap game as oppose to actually driving and controlling the cab is ridiculous luckily it was free. So now I don\'t feel bad deleting it.',
       'Fun game, cool animations and graphics. Good music and sound effects. Can you help with diamonds and sell out features just a tad bit more. I enjoy the game. Awesome job developers and programmers. Nice twist on the classic crazy taxi game',
       'I think this game is great. The only problem that I think everyone will agree with is that you notice the taxis get stuck in debris often and you have to wait 2 minutes for it to reset itself',
       'Great game, it\'s fun to play. Would rate it higher, but it often crashes when I\'m trying refuel or double my earnings by watching ads. Then the game restarts, and I can\'t refuel for awhile, or I list the bonus earnings. FRUSTRATING!!' ,

       'Game is fun but just as others say it takes forever to get through a round due to big pauses between questions. The ability to write in your own question sounds interesting but I don\'t think it really adds much in the end. The game is worthwhile when it\'s on sale but don\'t pay full price for it.',
       'This game is the best family interactive game I have ever had the pleasure to play   The developers should design more like this ie catchphrase , family fortunes etc  Fantastic game play  We have many nights of good fun   Can\'t understand the poor reviews they obviously haven\'t got a clue how to use or play the game   A decent Wi-Fi connection from the router is required don\'t blame the game   It last an average of 40 minutes a game which is good going   Extremely happy please develope more quiz games like this',

    description: 'This is by far the most flexible word search app on the market. Multiple configuration options create a game that exactly corresponds to your device and your expertise.Play with an English word list or choose one of 23 other languages.Designed for fun games from the smallest mobile phones up to the largest tablets.Bored of seeing the same words appear repeatedly? Frustrated at looking for bizarre words that are not even English? Struggled with grids that are inappropriate for your device or difficult to read? Word Search Ultimate solves all these problems. You can configure:1) Grid size    Specify exactly how many columns and rows to use (from 3 to 20). Even non square grids (e.g. 12x15) are possible.2) Screen layout    Choose how much screen space for the grid and how much for the word list, using our unique movable split bar.3) Difficulty of the game    Specify approximate proportion of words that are written diagonally, backwards or vertically (e.g. allow no diagonal or backwards words, ideal for introducing children to Word Search).4) Difficulty of the words    Specify the size of the dictionary to generate a game, from the 500 most common words (good for kids and language students), up to 80,000 words.5) Maximum # of words    Choose the maximum number of words to find in one game, from 1 to 150. This will provide enough words to fill a 20x20 grid.6) Minimum & Maximum word length    This helps avoid searching for many small words (a common problem in word apps). Also useful for specifying really difficult games (e.g. set both minimum and maximum word length to three).7) Highlighting    Mark the already found words, or keep the grid unmarked and easy to read.8) Word list layout    The word list can be arranged in columns for easy reading, or close to each other to minimize screen space.9) Language    Choose the language of the word list, from a large range of downloadable dictionaries.  24 languages are currently available (see below).10) Orientation    Can be played in portrait or landscape mode. Just rotate your device and the display adjusts automatically.11) Word categories    Choose the words to find from a range of categories; e.g. animals, food etc.This app gives you the ultimate power to play the game just the way you want.Each game is assigned a difficulty level from 0 (easy) to 9 (very hard). The difficulty level is determined by the settings. Each difficulty level maintains the high scores (measured by fastest time to complete the game). The game displays the best 20 scores for each difficulty level.Compare your high scores with others around the world by using Google Play\'s "Game Services".Other features unique to this app:1) Two methods of selecting words: (i) the classic swipe (ii) by touching the first and last letter of the word from the grid.2) Game aid if you are having difficulty. You can choose to reveal a word that you cannot find.3) View the definition of the word from an online source (e.g. Wiktionary), optimized for viewing on a small screen.4) When you play with a word list in a foreign language, the word definition will (where possible) be in your own language. This is great for language learning!Additional Features planned for a future version of this app:1) Blind mode.  The word list is hidden. Instead you must find the words within the grid. Useful in combination with word categories.2) Play against others.3) Give us feedback on other features you would like to see.Dictionaries available are English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, French, German, Italian, Indonesian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Serbian(Latin), Serbian(Cyrillic), Slovak, Slovene, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian and more coming later',

       'One of the best games I have played on Google play. Or rather it is the best games  Cons: 1. There should be a storyline with this game like a real superhero(and not someone who helps bad guys too)something I found awkward.   2.The area is descent but please add the underground train terminal with some action there too. It will just take the area to a whole new level   3.There are no days and night. No whether change, nothing.   4. Add more fighting style for the protagonist.   5. Please add more buildings and the climbing up is lethargic.   Else it is a great 100 mb game. Keep it up!!!!!! 😎 😎 😎',
       'It\'s fun but you should offer a paid version and Bluetooth controller support. If you did I\'d buy it but since I doubt this will happen I\'m uninstalling. Looks fun but too many ads and touch-screen controls for these games suck.',
       'It should have cheats and rope is some time not come and more exciting  miss ion and very hard more devlopement ,big maps more cars and  wanted the mission is to  long and there should be a boat and ship in water and mission of them and airplanes mission and airport  also. Game is best👑',

Maybe every 40 levels add a mill purchase option. When selling on the market, we need an option for a blind add or a neighborhood only sell or trade.. make these upgrades and so far game would be perfect!',

The for sale paper needs to update quicker.  Also, it\'s very hard to accumulate any \'west bucks\' in this game and you need them to do almost anything, so the game is a big money suck too. I\'m deleting it.',
       'I love these type of games just like hayday. I have noticed it freezes and takes ages to load the newspaper. Also would be helpful if it could tell you who needs help in the newspaper would help filling orders quicker. Also I have noticed alot of people selling the same parts and harder to get others and it\'s extremely rare to get the land parts without paying',
       'The game doesnt give enough case vs things to buy or fix.  Also have issues with getting product into the alloted spaces.  I thought it was my screen but had it cleaned thoroughly and it still happens.  It takes several attempts!!!  The story is cute.  The graphics are cute as well.  Ive noticed it has a couple of choices from other games Ive played on older phones. I would suggest the game to others but get the issues fixed and itll be a 5star game.',
       'I love playing these games. I\'m not sure why we are rating gameplay they offer apps not a game. It\'s crazy how they ask us to rate game at the beginning of game. We haven\'t learned the bad points. This game makes us pay for treasure chest instead of giving us to them free like most games. Which means we have to pay for everything. Totally not fair. Takes the fun out of game.',
       'Was totally looking forward to playing this game, the graphics were so cute that I couldnt help but download, but I havent even gotten past the tutorial and its frozen? The game started panning to the billboard right after you sell your first visitor the cream and then it just froze and now it won\'t let me continue on.' ,

      'Pretty cool game. Like the simple concept of taking something we have all done at one time or another and turning it into a video game.  Genius. I really like the sense of accomplishment I get when I make a trick shot like a bank shot off the boss\'s head and no rim just straight in! It\'s like he shoots he scores! The crowd goes wild! ..fake crowd roar...',
       'The game makes me feel things down in my nether region super fun to play. When I throw the paper ball I\'m like sweeeeeeeeet. I daydream about playing when I\'m at work. The second I get home I get undressed and play me some paper toss.  Thanks you guys over at paper Toss you really know how to have a great time. If you guys would like to hang out some time and toss some paper I\'d be down. hit me up some time',
       'Wow, this game is fantastic! How have I not downloaded this before?? The controls are easy to use and very responsive. So far I haven\'t run into any bugs so that\'s good. I really enjoy using different objects to throw in place of the paper ball, which is actually my favorite. The fact that each object is affected differently by the fan makes this game flavorful. Really great job with this!!',
       'Disappointing. Paper Toss Boss used to be known as Paper Toss 2, though the name isn\'t all that has changed. For one thing, there are now WAY too many ads. Every time I change a level, an ad comes up. Inexcusable. And to make it worse, the game lags more. If my old Android 2.2 phone can run Paper Toss 2 with no problem, then the same should be said with this version and my new Android phone. Considering it a classic game ruined.',
       'After the last update the game sucks so bad. Tons of add, lag, the interface moves poorly, after 5 minutes i just gave up and uninstalled it. Used to be so much fun before. Please go back to the previous versiob!',
       'Great except two things... ... the fact that I can\'t turn off that tab on the left that flashes at me when I suck. No I don\'t want a hint or buy some gimmick. Just let me throw the ball in peace. It\'s nagware and it is so annoying it makes me not want to play the game. Make it appear *once* then give the option to banish it.ALSO there is a game breaking glitch that happens frequently where I throw a ball and it goes in but then nothing happens, I don\'t get another ball, I can\'t access any menus, the game is frozen. This happens every' ,

      'Potential to be a great game but wayyyy to many ads, like every 10 seconds of gameplay there\'s a 30 second ad, and when you choose to watch an ad to get a reward you never actually get it. Waste of time. No idol earnings so you have to have the app open to advance and forces you to watch more ads.i get you want to make money but this app is basically unplayable.',
       'Far too many ads. And being forced to watch a 30 sec ad before continuing! Sorry, uninstalling. Try banner ads only, and I will play this game for ages. Now you won\'t make any more money out of me. Also, look at the reviews, you obviously haven\'t got a clue about what irritates people.',
       'A sad ad bomb. Not even going to pay for premium since that doesn\'t seem to work from 90% of reviewers who tried it. Lower the ads, or be considered just an ad platform. Edit: After uninstalling and terminating, my launcher started responding properly. Potential virus as well.',
       'The game itself is good but seriously the devs are so greedy they have an ad every 15 seconds or so. If it was an ad every 5 minutes or so I\'d probably end up buying no ads and maybe even spending more on microtransactions, but I won\'t support this game or company when they are so blinded by greed they don\'t realise they\'ll have many more consistant players watching more overall ads with just a longer delay in between...',
       'Invasive ads, after most actions. Skippable after 5-10 seconds, but come way too often for this type of game. Games cool, but I uninstalled it after my tenth ad in about ten minutes',
       'The amount of ads this game throws at you every few seconds is just unacceptable. Too many ads! Seriously, every 10-15 seconds a video ad plays when you tap anything. The game would actually be fun but the ads completely ruin it.' ,

      'I really love this game. Of course it WANTS you to spend real money on it, but you don\'t really have to to make progress. Just set stuff up then go back to it later. As per other reviews it does take a while to load, but due to the excellent graphics, music and overall feeling of happiness I get playing this - they are forgiven.',
       'Okay, this is probably the most honest review I will ever take the time to write. The game is beautiful and entertaining...just like everything Disney does. The other thing Disney does EXTREMELY well is suck money from you (I live in Orlando - I KNOW this, Man). I\'m not proud of what I\'m about to say but I just spent $30 on essentially a "Russian Roulette" for Alice in Wonderland characters. It\'s like this...the game is entertaining and enjoyable to an extent...but if you\'re money concisious don\'t download this game. I\'ve played a lot of app games and this one FAR surpasses the need for real money. The game is entertaining and fun if you semi/kinda love Disney stuff because of nostalgia or whatever...but if you\'re a die-hard Disney fanatic...this game will bankrupt you. So, fear it.',
       'I used to love this game, but, I don\'t anymore. It can get kind of lengthy and sometimes tiresome. They make it near impossible to get some characters and attractions without spending real money for them. And if you don\'t, you will take a very..very long time to progress through the game.You may not ever get through it all. After almost 2 years, I\'m tired of it.',
       'I did love this game. However since the jungle book update, it takes forever to load, which is very frustrating especially when there\'s an event. The events just keep coming so never get a chance to catch up with main storyline. Some special characters are unobtainable without spending huge amounts of real money. Gameloft are just too money grabbing and don\'t seem to care about gameplay.',
       'I\'ve given it 5 stars but really it would be 4.5 stars. The prices of things in this game are stupidly high and they don\'t make it easy for you to get money and gems. It will take you months just to save up to expand one square in the kingdom.',
       'Its a good game just think it should be easier to get gems for the people who cant afford to spend money for them. Some of the characters are unattainable and its really crap for us who likes the games but dont wanna spend that much money on it. I really enjoy playing it but dont think i will anymore unless you make it easier to get more character\'s. I miss the old games where. Nobody had to pay real money on it' ,

      'Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning',
       'Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.',
       'Absolutely amazing game!!! I\'m a huge petrol head and this ticks all boxes considering it\'s a phone game. Love the controls. Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress. Literally one downfall... upgrade costs when you get higher spec cars. Apart from that... GOOD JOB!!!',
       'Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I\'m just going to name some things that I\'m sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I\'m just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!',
       'This game is brilliant. Have been playing it for ages. However the updates are messing with previous games, especially NASCAR I\'ve been playing previous events but with update they\'ve gone and replaced by new ones, I\'ve been working towards cars etc....all gone. Slightly annoying guys. Keep up with the good work etc but leave the previous ones alone please.',
       'I love this game but, I download it several times! And the download process is always stop at 98.8% and not finishing. And its say Download Error please check your connection setting! But my wifi connection is fine.Please help me ASAP i want this game so much' ,
