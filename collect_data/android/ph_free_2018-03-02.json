     [ 'I love the game over all. There is one thing that ticks me off the cars. people get them then chase u and knock u down. Once u r knocked down they get out of the car and kill u. IT\'S RIDICULOUS. The fact that you cant shoot through the fences makes it so others can use them as coves while u move to them and get killed',
       'This is F ridiculous!! I experienced more glitches after the update!! The updates didnt do anything much about the glitches!! People will just appear from nowhere!! I played this game everyday and every single day i always experience glitches!! The sound is also confusing even if you try to listen.You hear sounds that coming from the back but the enemy is actually in front.',
       'After the update, I have yet to experience getting shot when hiding behind a house. Game became smoother in some way. I hope that this game allows more mid range/old high end chipset to run the game smoothly like on the iOS platform. üòä',
       'I play these game when it released  it was very bed performance but these time or these update is supercool i love the guy who made it amazing. .. Guys if you fix small bite of lagg. My internet is fast but some time it lag a very small bit......... Hope you reply these comment....',
       'Update: This is another update.  Seems like they fixed all the issues I had problems with. People shooting to the wall and the Bluetooth headphone option and not being able to hear anyting. I moved there rating from 1 to 4 stars because they are actively developing this game and seem to care about players. I need one star off because the Bluetooth sound doesn\'t sync up with the game actions. If they tweak that I\'ll have no issues with the game. Keep up the good work.',
       'It\'s an absolutely amazing game. A really good set in which the game is based upon and also a great replacement for fortnite which is another game which has a similar game play on the pc. I think this is the best mobile game ever made and all the guys who hv given a bad rating, I think their internet or device is slow.' ],

     [ 'Sooooooo addicting ,I love this game so fun,  relaxing and has great music. I can\'t stop playing. So awesome,they should make more word searches or word crosses like these kind of games. All though  you have to pay for some parts of the game but out of all the games I have ever played this on is #1üòçüòÇüòÉ',
       'I love this game! It\'s a real challenge and better than the normal ones because of the backgrounds and how it\'s a crossword. You could add an online player vs player thing too. I love the daily challenges. Maybe add something to win instead of coins? If you love a good daily challenge defiantly get the game!! üòä',
       'Game itself is good but to have an advert appear everytime you get to the next level is a bit much. It\'s always the same adverts and it\'s not easy to close the advert. It directs you to playstore to install the app that is being advertised.  I know you need to make money for making this app but the ads are spoiling what was once nice to play. I use it less and less each time I see an ad.',
       'The only bad thing about this game is the sheer volume of ads. I understand it\'s to push you to spend money but it\'s more likely to stop me playing. Tone them back a little and it\'ll make for a much more enjoyable experience that I would be happy to recommend to friends. Ads are a fair trade off for a free game, but not at this current frequency.',
       'Fabulous word game. The whole family is addicted. Could do with a slightly wider vocabulary in that sometimes you find a perfectly good word that is not in the grid but it\'s not allowed in the bonus bank. But that\'s just being picky. Overall, well, well worth the modest price to go ad-free. Highly recommended.',
       'Got me hooked way too easily, then got so many people I know playing it too. The simplicity is what makes it work and the irritation of finding a word you (should) know makes me keep playing, over and over and over.  One of the best games I have played in ages!' ],

     [ 'It\'s a pretty amazing game, like league of legends but what makes it amazing is that you can play it on your phone. The only problem is the prices of the heroes and skins. Most of the heroes are 32k battle points.. So it would be fair if it was at least 5k cheaper than that. Also the game lags sometimes which interups gameplay which can cause you to unexpectedly die.  For anyone who is reading this, I highly recommend this game to anyone.  It\'s amazing and extremely addictive!!',
       'I think this game is great! I play It Almost Everyday And My Mum Always Has To Scold Me For Playing Too Much! Its Addictive And Fun To Play! Just A Few Things You Guys Could Work On. 1)I Hope That You Guys Will Let Us BE ABLE To Sell Hereos And I Bet Others Agree. 2)I Also Hope You Guys MAKE IT EASIER For Us To Get BP\'S I Really Really Hope You Guys Get To Fulfill My Request! Its a good game!',
       'Not enough with unskippable tutorials now you want us to level up till lvl 8 to be able to change account? Here\'s some suggestion, make a button just before the tutorial, for login purposes for those who have old accounts. I mean, people sometimes reset their phone and you want us to play till level 8 again just so we can play old account? Be realistic developers.',
       'Quite simply a super fun game. This game does exactly what it is supposed to, which is provide a fun portable moba experience condensed into short bursts of fun. This is one of the few games where even losing is a fun experience for me. Pros - wide range of heroes, fun over the top cartoon graphics, multiple game modes, great community and incredible speed of matchmaking that still some how retains quality of matchups. Cons - I am personally not a fan of the joystick based control system, the heroes require quite a bit of time playing before you can get enough in game currency to unlock them. So if you haven\'t already started playing this game then you are definitely missing out',
       'Being Honest this game hasnt really been up to date with others competitors. One thing I think would be lovely is a training camp/single player bot practices to do with new heros. Maybe a small revamp to the art style like 5% realism. And to decrease the amount of gold heros cost, really turns down the tone to play more for new heros',
       'Edit from my earlier review.  I re-downloaded this game after giving yall some time to work through some issues Id been having.  Lo and behold... All of my progress is gone. I was a high level with numerous heroes and skins I cant get anymore. Yet when I relog in from my google account and my FB account, it still has me at this new level with none of my stuff. What the heck yall.' ],

I can actually play it now with my friends! A little bit of framrate drop but still... I can play this wonderful game. Im going to totally recommend this game to my friends. The devs of this game are the best devs in the Google Play Store. Again, Im truely greatful and I thank you guys. :D',

Anyways, I am having problems with the game\'s connectivity to the internet. I am using 4G in playing the game and it seems that it does not connect very well, other online games connect well to the internet. I think that is the only issue I have in mind. Just hoping for more smoothness though.. But I love the game, it is worth the time playing. Thank you!!',

Thanks for the revolutionary IO game. Congratulation on 10million downloads üíù',
       'simple, fun, addictive gameplay, good graphic with unique animations, great events that keep players active which is good, have great potential. dark adventure loading still takes too long, i already dead when the loading is finished. crashing and some bugs in event tab. talking about awaken system, man atleast dont downgrade the stars or reduce the percentage of downgrade, finding awaken item is already damn hard. this great game need new character and more feature but not p2w. keep the good work barbarq !!',
       'It is the best game I\'ve ever played! With simple graphics and gameplays, you won\'t notice how long you\'ve played! Generous with presents daily and very recommended to spend time. However with the new update, I can\'t connect and it stayed on connecting. Tried to change internet source, but to no avail it\'s still there.  I would like to ask the developers, to reply as soon  as possible, on what should I do to get rid of this problem.',

     [ 'I could have given five stars. The only problem is the number of players per drop/game. Please change it to 80 to 100 range. Pretty sure youll have a lot of players and ill be glad to recommend it in my facebook page if youll be able to increase the max players. It tends to become boring when you see only 12 players left when the safe zone did not even appear yet. You will look like a rat looking for a cheese around the map. More players means more fun. If you\'ll take this suggestion seriously, you will thank me later.',
       'I love this game, today i jus download the game, cause my friend ask me tooo download this game and he also said it was fun! So I download it, and he was correct, this game is fun, I just become level 4! Not so soon I will become level 5! Yay for meüòÅ And I already bought the 1500 Diamond suit! It is so expensive!üò≤ but I just want to show  I am not a noob and I like to show at people who dosen\'t heve it, lolüòÇ and also I loved the game very much, so thank you for making this game and shout out to my friend Imbran! And byeüòÅ',
       'The best survivor royale esque game you can find on the play store. Takes up immensely less space than others like Rules of Survival. Anyone can play this, no matter the quality of their phone. It\'s intense solo, duo, and squad gameplay will always have you coming back to take a shot (no pun intended) at another win. An amazing feature is it\'s voice chat communication system. You can talk to your teammates (though unfortunately, I find most players speak Spanish. You may have more luck.) though i wish there was a text chat as well. It will hopefully come in the next update, bur I would definitely recommend getting this game. My only other suggestion is new maps, a night mode, more weapons, and attachments.',
       'This is a really great game, I think it can go to heights where it\'ll have a PC version with a bigger city, more weapon\'s and kill tactics. It should really consider creating a store which has more item\'s though . Also can you add gas cans strategicallyy to the game, I\'d love to blow up someone hiding in a factory :) . Other than that, its a gteT game , I\'m at Level 13  and have tons of kills already in all modes so I figured you deserve a review at this point.   Keep up the great work, I love this game so far.',
       'good game. but I think u garena should add more trees, buildings, and others. and I thinks its good if we can play 5-10 players in one team in squad game cause in GUILD the max. members\'re 20 players. sorry for my bad english',
       'Loved this game so much! A tip for dev, You guys might wanna try to block/disable cheaters from the game on the next update though. It\'s starting made this game unjoyable to play anymore. Hope you can see my review, thanks for all the effort you gave to us guys!' ],

     [ 'Awesome strategic game, love it. But I have one request to Clash of clans creators that pls update clan castle of coc village that there would be an option that how much treasury do you want to Transfer to your storage. I think all coc players would be love this option and it would be great idea because you can transfer required amount of treasury to your storage and the rest of it will remains safe in clan Castel. If you like this idea and will work on it then pls reply me. I would be thankful to all Coc creators if that happens.. üòä',
       'Its an awesome game. The new concept of supercell id is cool but switching is little time taking. I Would request you guys to make it easier or add some shortcut to switch accounts. Because it is really difficult to change if you are in poor network zone. Plz consider this. Otherwise the concept is really good it saves RAM of phone as u dnt need play games and services updated. üòÄ',
       'Hey supercell,no doubt your game is awesome but I didn\'t like the supercell id technique in the new update...why did u removed the Google play login system? It was easier to change coc account in it...but in the supercell id it takes a lot of time to change the accounts plus we have to write our email then wait for the password....please fix this issue..... Probably I m not the only one who is facing it......    So I hope that your team can fix this issue..',
       'This is a very good game and I highly recommend it but there are two small changes I would make.    1) I would make it so that you can move the object in your village i.e. trees, rocks as there are afew seasonal decoration that I would like to keep but they are getting in the way of my village.    2) I would also make it so that you can put more then 1 builder on a construction to cut down its time or add more builder.    But other then them 2 changes I think it\'s a great game and I\'ve had lots of fun with it.',
       'The heroes should be for all players from the lower level. They can make their own choice to choose the hero or switch them. If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy? It\'s the strategy game, not for only the big or strong players. Thanks!!...',
       'Super game my favourite game really nice guys download it .I have A small request if we have got any bonus in war or Multiple battles it automatically goes in Clan Castle ,and when we want withdraw it give whole treasure comes out. So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.' ],

Want to take a break from your mind numbing job? This is equally mind numbing....but hey, play on your bosses time.

Thank you Racing Fever: Moto team...',
       'This game is so good. But only problem I\'m facing is that after playing some time I can\'t control my bike, it keeps on going one particular direction (left or right).Guys please fix this issue.',
       'Nobody can beat the game without expending money. This is horrible. At last levels , with the best bike and full upgraded situation , you cant beat the no traffic side missions. It is unfare. There is some sort of "you shall not pass!" situation at last levels. That was bad. Very bad.',
       'Must note this:- Controls are a little bit glitchy. Bikes automatically moves towards a side of a road and crashed.. Besides police and some cars are sucked up the whole race.. Make a little bit easy races....and remove line changeable vehicle and police cars...they are motherfu****s!!!!! Disgusting!!!! That\'s why I have to uninstall it...Damn it.. I was so close to end!!!',
       'I am not going to spend a dime to get further in the game. Therefore I will never be able to progress. I would rather spend money to buy the game up front so that I know how much I\'m going to have to spend. The way this game works who knows how much I\'ll have to spend to Beat It. Good bye...your game sucks.',
       'I\'m almost @ the end of level 4. There is no more races after. When are you adding more levels? Also Nitro should be more visible when being used. Rain stages are to noisy. Can hardly hear the bike engine & even after the race the rain noise still goes on' ],

       'This game isn\'t so scary. Like u get scared when u nearly espaced bumping twice by any train, wall or signal and when u escape from death\'s hand. Rather than that it is game is very addicting and a fun game.

     [ 'Love it! It just needs some adjustments. Too many levels that are way too hard, that takes you 50 tries to beat when you only have 5 lives in the first place. And it should only be beat one level to unlock one task instead of needed to beat two levels to unlock one task. If it\'s going to take 2 stars to unlock a task it should be something big not 2 stars for unlocking a task for cleaning up a little mess!',
       'I love decorating the rooms but I am having to pay too much to get enough points to do it.   I also don\'t like that each room requires more points to do the tasks than the previous room.  I have changed my rating to low because you end up spending too much of your own money to get powerful to get your stars to complete the tasks.  They also lose your purchases.  I bought a desk chair yesterday and now it is missing and the task is gone too.  Rip off.',
       'Never thought it would be this addictive! At first i thought "Oh, its THAT game that always pops up in advertisements." but after deciding to give it a try, i am hooked!   I introduced homescapes to my mom as well and downloaded it for her and she finds it adorable and fun as well. We both take time to chill out and have fun with the puzzles occasionally when we are together.   I cant find a single flaw or critique for this game, its amazing :)',
       'Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it\'s advertised too much, but it\'s definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That\'s slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.',
       'Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I\'ll be playing this for a long time! I\'m working on the living room right now, getting close to level 600. Can\'t wait to see what the new character, Jerry, has in store for us! Thank you Playrix!',
       'I really like this Game so Far. I will play for awhile to See how it Works & If I like it. Absolutely Love Your Game. Play it ALL THE TIME!!! I Must Admit that I Really Do enjoy this Game! Sometimes I find myself Having a Hard Time With Certain Levels. I Could be On that Level for Days or a Few Weeks. I think with Some Improvement that Would make People Play. This Game More.

       'I really liked it at first. But now all I get are ads. it\'s so irritating to be playing and then ad pops up at the bottom. You\'re clicking on your character to jump & you click on the stupid ad than every time you die you have to watch another ad so annoying. But I could get pass the ad      after you die but not at the bottom of the screen. Makes me not want to play it anymore. And I\'m only on day 3. It was a cute to relieve stress and now it just gives me stress.',
       'This adorable & addictive game is very fun to play at any time of the day! It is definitely a close competitor of the infamous"Candy Crush" trend. For such a simple concept, it never ceases to amaze me; especially since I can\'t seem to get a long enough winning streak to increase my stack count. I admit, I suck at this game... Yet I can\'t stop playing it! 4/5 stars for me. Loses a star for excessive ads and lagging during the game.',
       'Very very addictive pass time. Only a lil disappointed with the adds popping out every now and than. I know its a free app and adds are inevitable but try reducing the number of time it should appear not after each and every round.',

Like when am I going to be able to play again? Was just updated? So I\'m going to have to delete it and start it all over and re gain my high score??',

     [ 'I enjoy the game greatly. It\'s slightly different with  the chest and stuff but it is sure nice to get bonuses every now and than. There are new adds though which I\'m not super stoked about like the brake time adds but they keep them short and can be skipped quick if you have already watched them. All and all great game',
       'I love this game. Every game I\'ve had, I played for a week or so, and uninstalled. But this one? Ive had for almost 6 months. Been playing every single day. Finally reached legendary 32, I\'ve unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so. Or at least a new adventure spot. Making a modded version of the rally car would be fantastic. Also, an upgrade on the formula car where it doesn\'t almost dead stop after it lands from a big air.',
       'Well done with stealing the boxes idea from clash royale wow you didn\'t even Change the opening times, I think the next thing you should do is offering legendary and epic chests with legendary and epic cars. I have loved the first part of this game it was funny and doesn\'t make any pressure on you, the second one should be blocked from play store, shame on you..',
       'Superb game! Too bad, the elements of hate like to hack good things and cause frustrations. For this reason, constantly run constant updates. I wouldn\'t mind paying through my rather expensive data to diffuse the damage by these bored, small prick nincompoops! Africaüòùüòùüòù',
       'If you don\'t want to give away free stuff from the chests, don\'t. But stop wasting my damn giving me these "free" coins for watching a video only to have the ad freeze %95 of the time. The are plenty of other free games out there, might be time for a change.',
       'Pretty good game the Ads are insane and they want a ton of money per month to get rid of them. Seems to be the way all the games are going. For the Chinese new year could have mad a tuk tuk I think it\'s called a mini taxi. Or something cool for China.' ],

     [ 'Very fun and time killing. I play with my bf and 2 friends and we all try to beat eachothers high scores. It can be pretty competitive. Im prob gonna try to get more ppl to play with me too lol. There could be more variety in the blocks, and there should be like different modes, just an idea',
       'Its cool and all but needs some extra features.  Maybe a way to store 1 brick for later or some level advancement.  Maybe challenges or a power up system. The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.',
       'What they show on the preview and what it gives you in game don\'t even match. They make it look like it so easy. You cannot rotate the pieces. The pieces they give are so random, and most games you can barely get past a couple of turns before you can\'t place anymore and you lose.',
       'This is very deceiving. It looks like it\'s Tetris, but it\'s not. The pieces don\'t come down like the pictures show. I hate apps like this who deceive people to believe its a certain game when it\'s not just to get people to download. Will never download a game from this developer again.',
       'I hated it. Just freezes my phone n have to buy a new one  for 4954  dollars. Its just stupid n u really need more tutorial. Make this game have more tutorials n stop this freezing part for a better game n have  a 5 star rating from me n not a 2 star rating. Do u want a 2 star rating or 5 star rating? Just to be clear, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME IF U ARE DUMB. Tksüòíüòíüòí',
       'Love the game can\'t seem to put it down. Great time passes while you\'re waiting for your washing to dry at the laundromat, beats watching it spin around. Not happy with all the adds popping up after every game and sometimes in the middle of a game.' ],

The new customization is very cool üëå but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn\'t make it better at controlling.

It\'s just so addicting and I can\'t get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the \'play online\' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated.

Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven\'t tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.',
       'It\'s my favorite app. I love it a lot. My only issue is that it doesn\'t quite accurately update my stats especially my highest score without using a \'save me,\' longest run, most coins & gems. I would really like the developers to look into that but otherwise it\'s a brilliant game.',
       'Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a "slide," I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don\'t compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.',
       'Nice, good, adventure game.but some times your team irritating who one completed thirteen level they will easily get diamond  your giving master challenge ( now the challenge Chinese New year )who one complete your giving thirty diamond only.this offer will useful only for entry level gamers. Most of players finished fourteen level so they no need diamonds.so think about genius players.',
       'I love all the graphics it\'s a bit like the        piano tiles it test\'s your fast skills but except it is temple run 2 love it. Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.',
       'I love this game, very addicting. And I love that it has the daily, weekly and global challenges. As well as objectives and the daily chest challenges. Lots of things to work for and win.

     [ 'If you\'ve liked the first game you\'re probably gonna enjoy this one. It\'s more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it\'s built around microtransactions so if you\'re feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don\'t understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it\'s likely you\'re going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren\'t aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don\'t expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!',
       'Love this game so much! I am a huge PVZ fan anyway and I love playing this. You do need some boosters to get past levels, which feels a bit like cheating sometimes, but you can earn plenty of coins. There is always a new quest to play so even when I\'m stuck on the other levels I can still play. This is a great game, well done devs!',
       'Ok its annoying and frustrating if you accidentally press a power up button and waste your zombie coins can you add like a thing lile when you press the power up button down below there would like something pop up like "Are you sure your gonna use this power up?" "Yes or no" to lessen accidents :(',
       'Please help! The game crashed so I reinstalled it, now none of my progress is saved even though I\'m signed in to Google+, this is the 2nd time this had happened and I can\'t start from scratch again. Can someone suggest a resolution Please?',
       'If you\'re quite a gamer, then you should have no problem in facing these brain enthusiasts without the need to buy anything (with your real money of course). Overall, this is a great game, but it needs to improve how they display the plant\'s health/damage/etc. Maybe provide with digits rather than stating the damage is light, normal, moderate, and so on. Oh and i fell that the pinata party is a scam. You will never win the grand prize.' ],

This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can\'t without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.',
       'First up the images used as what the game looks like are fakes. I saw too many polygons.... (Shudder) Secondly there is no start menu. NOPE! Just some fancy loading screen and boom you\'re in the game without a chance to look at the controls. Plus your first mission is ruined by the tutorial at the worst places on the track.   Bad game knockoff. If you download this just delete it. This game is [EXPLICATIVE]',
       'Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that\'s excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.',
       'Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?',
       'Update: so I\'ve been playing for several weeks now. You cannot win with maxed out mods, racing the same level cars. They\'re twice as fast and you can only knock off 3 cars at the beginning of the race and you\'re unable to catch with others. Even if you spend money, you will not get 1st place in a lot of the races. Very unbalanced game. Whoever programmed the ai should be fired  Fun game, but the intrusive ads are ridiculous. It pops up in the middle of a race, before and after the race, finished off by asking you to pay to remove ads.',
       'I don\'t know what the game is even like. I couldn\'t even get past the loading part because it won\'t let me tap on the screen.  I find this very irritating because I like trying out new car games. But please promise me you won\'t play this game any further as its a waste of your time.' ],

My one gripe is that recently players have been given multiple oportunities to get 3 crowns or very high scores with ad powered resources. I feel this takes a lot of the challenge from the game. Anyone can get 3 crowns in 4 or 5 goes where us old guard of the game did if in 1 or 2 Still an awesome game though and well worth the download anytime.',
       'I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who\'s better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn\'t seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don\'t think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.',
       'This game has no WORLD\'S favourite song  DESPACITO  SO i m hating it tooooo much  when i see this then i think that let\'s download it bcoz it contains despacito song also but when i see all album of this app then i started hated it. So i would request from CHEETAH GAMES that plezz add DESPACITO SONG also in it This is my humble request from CHEETAH GAMES.',
       'I\'m in love with this game. It\'s challenging, you don\'t have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks.',
       'Amazing!  It\'s very time consuming and very musical, interesting, and you get to play with people from around the world.   One of the reasons it\'s so good is that there are no ads. (That is if you click on something that involves an ad) Amazing 5 STARS ALL TIME' ],

     [ 'I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It\'s pricey but we\'ll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn\'t need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get',
       'I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.',
       'I think it would be better if you got more gems. You can barely win anything on that little slot machine. I also noticed that you no longer get gems for every day you log in to play. Sure, the money is nice but you can\'t upgrade with just the money you earn while playing. I spun that slot machine 80 plus spins and barely won anything. Do the gems even pop up as a winning combo? They used to but not anymore.',
       'It would be nice for updated casino with new slot machine games and also some new restaurants.  Last one was quite sometime ago?  Are you still actively developing the game or you called it quits like some other games I had to uninstall because there was nothing left to do in them.  Just curious.....',
       'This game is a bit boring at first since it is really hard to serve your burgers because they take ages to cook.  I, after 1 day,  got totally addicted to it as it gets really fun and especially when it lets you purchase the automatic cooker for just 10 gems it is easy and cool! You will see what I mean when you hopefully download the app as I would definitely recommend it! Thank you for making a fun, addictive app that I enjoy. üòÑ',
       'Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn\'t need to have the internet on. Don\'t know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.' ],

It\'s one thing to optionally watch ads for coins and prizes. But its another thing when full screen videos pop-up, pausing your game and wasting your time. I was honestly thinking about giving this 3 stars just b/c of how annoying that is alone.' ],

     [ 'Great game, lots of fun. Would give it 5 stars but it is WAY TOO SHORT! More cities and continents to conquer, please...I\'d conquered everything and wasn\'t even halfway done upgrading all of my unit types, and had barely even touched all the general, base and army upgrades you get from leveling up. More achievements would be nice too!',
       'It\'s an enjoyable game, I\'m near the last bases to conquer and wondering what happens afterwards. Took me about a week to get there. Big minus is, despite muting al game sounds and music, the app deems it necessary to limit the master volume of my phone while playing, quite annoying when listening to my own music while playing',
       'I like the game style, the graphics, it\'s very fun and addictive, but it needs more to it. I played this game for about 4 days, and I no longer have any use at all for gold. I\'ve conquered all the territory\'s and have everything unlocked and maxed out aside from my leave. This game could be a lot better if there was more to do. Over all, it\'s fun, and has a lot of potential, but could definitely use some additions.',
       'The game is pretty good. Not terribly long but yes it\'s addictive which makes it shorter. I wish towers and catapults were automated. In later levels I\'m trying to click so frequently I can\'t focus on watching the fights.',
       'The concept is good but its just too easy. I am level 9 and took out the level 75 city in 1 try. Its not very challenging and you don\'t make a ton of money so its boring',
       'Playing game was Fun but as soon as a rated game 5 Stars I couldn\'t go back to map to take over other lands it just played music but screen was blue.. this is why I stopped playing games in the first place because it\'s a waste of time!!' ],

First, each level seems to be different in terms of which words they will accept as "bonus words". Some levels accept certain words, while others don\'t. Second, this game has a ridiculous amount of ads. An ad will pop up after each level you complete. I understand the devs need to make money, and I don\'t have an issue with ads themselves. This game just seems to have an excessive amount. Otherwise it is a fun little game. I like playing it while waiting for Word Cookies updates.',

     [ 'I never had to pay a single cent for this game, and it\'s working out perfectly fine for me. Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don\'t like my non-responsive faction members and I\'m worried once I leave my faction I couldn\'t join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.',
       'Game is really good! Currently level 10 & I am doing pretty good. (For what I think) It\'s a fun game to play you can get free coins which makes it more fun and fair for players that can\'t pay for anything, except patience. I do wish it\'ll be easier to level up characters. But it\'s pretty easy. Just so difficult to get more characters to pay for level ups.',
       'This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn\'t make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!',
       'Company is a joke. Never play their games. Dont not install this game unless you expect to spend alot of money to even try to be competitive. There is massive amount  of hacking and cheating and support as no ability to help at all. I would never recommend this game to anyone. The cons far out weigh the pros. Scopley does not care about gameplay or its players at all.',
       'No one from the support team will respond. My game was unistalled and reinstall and I lost 2 years worth of data. Can\'t remember sync it and I know scopely can do it for me. I\'ve provided everything they need and still nothing via email or in-game support. Will change my rating if this is sorted',
       'Awesome game based on the comics. The only set back is that I can\'t seem to be able to download the content for the third chapter on the story map. It goes so far into the download and then stops.   I have already uninstalled and reinstalled the game three times. And I have even deleted unused/unwanted files from my phone to free up some extra space, and it hasn\'t made any difference.   I don\'t know what else I can do.' ],

I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn\'t hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv',

Dislikes -  1) It\'s also a game of money so....  2) When you win too many games       you get tougher opponents.  3) Despite having good Internet      connection the game disrupts in      between by disconnecting it.  4) The game starts controlling you        in winning or losing.',
       'I realize y\'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don\'t pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I\'m pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It\'s a pretty good app and I\'ve sent many people to download your app.',
       'Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don\'t decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don\'t mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don\'t actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.',
       '8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don\'t win any games until those coins are over and I\'m only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above...

    comments: 
     [ 'I really like this game, kind of wish the progression system was a bit quicker though, other than that, the tight controls, open world and variety of creatures you can eat make it a solid game. The special sharks look really cool, and I even considered buying one until I saw the 50$ price tag.   On a side note, what\'s the difference between this app and the Hungry Shark World?',
       'i would rate 5 stars... but.. something with the cloud save broke, i used to have the megalodon, without any cheats.. but now i have the mako. could you fix this somehow? And do i email the support team? Im not good with all the emailing stuff.',
       'It\'s a really fun game, but sometimes you\'ll play a video to revive your shark and the video will play but you don\'t get another life afterwards. It\'s hard to believe that it is a WiFi problem because if it was an ad wouldn\'t be able to load at all. Also, I have paused the game before and come back minutes later and the game had kicked me out and not saved any coins/gems gained from that round. They clearly have a few bugs to work out.',
       'IT IS SO GOOD, YOU HAVE TO BUY IT!Every level you get a new shark,though,you have to pay for them.But the good thing is you still have your old shark! You will be challenged throughout the levels! AND WHATEVER YOU DO,DO NOT SPEND YOUR JEMS!!!! You barely can get any jems,besides the five you get for downloading it.Anyway all I want to say is have fun be cool and be one with the shark! Bye,rsvp!',
       'OMG! I love the gameplay in this arcade game I love everything about it. It is very cool that you can evolve sharks that can eat more stuff. Keep the updates coming it would be better if you added more sharks in this game . I recommend downloading this game if you want something to do in a long amount of time. This is so addictive I can\'t stop playing it!',
       'My apologies for the negative review lately. But to be honest, I have to use VPN just to log-in in Google Play and enable cloud sync or else, I wouldn\'t be able to sync my progress. Just a little request, can you make the gameplay smoother for lower end devices, such as devices with 1GB RAM? It lags frequently during gameplay. Thanks a lot!' ],

I know I logged in yesterday and didn\'t miss a day. I also was moved down a bubble level. Updates should not make you lose everything you\'ve earned.',
       'I have completed level 705 but game won\'t let me move on to next level...keeps saying I\'m offline! I\'m connected online but nothing I do will let me move on to the next episode. Please KING fix this problem!  UPDATE as of 21st February: the message "go online for more episodes" is still showing everytime I try and play. So still not fixed in the new update! PLEASE FIX!!',

Really makes me want to uninstall the game. I will give it another try, I\'m waiting for the game to divvy out more tries.. I mean 35 tries is stingy for a hard level, how about 45 tries instead?',

I hate to Uninstall being I\'m at level 727 & Hitting the (X) does nothing but frustrates me & I\'m just about to delete. üò† Please change some how some way.',
       'One of my favorite games, but after the most recent update, just like most of the reviews in the last several days, I\'m stuck at 705. I should be at 1153. Tells me to go online and download new episodes when I\'m constantly online. Need to patch it or rework the coding.   Edit: finally fixed, everything is running smoothly. Thanks!' ],

       'One of the best sports games available on the market right now. The graphics are awesome. And the player realism is good. The challenge of acquiring Elite Players keeps you going.    EDIT: This game is a perfect example of how not to screw up a top notch game. Used to love it to death before the update, now every aspect of the game has been worsened; Auctions, Gameplay, Teams. Just name a feature and you can be sure that it\'s been screwed up. Just hope they resolve this the next year. Will just uninstall till the new yearly reset.',
       'I can\'t see myself EVER giving EA mobile games anything but a 1 star rating, the game is geared to cheat unless you\'re spending actual $ on paccs & players. How many times can an event rob you of stamina to only rob you again by redundantly giving you the same fucc\'n collectables over & over & over again!!! By the time you actually complete the set either the seasons over, or there\'s better players @ the position that you\'ll probably never end up getting either... Unless you spend some cash. EA succs man, SINCERELY!!!',
       'I think i\'m dissatisfied with this game of rule. You should change this rule... when the all people can feel comfortable, and can be feel happy, free and enjoy it. This is so very very bad news with you EA. If you still use this rule, i think... this game can be game over forever. You should back this rule like before. if you can\'t, everymonts, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, this rating of Nbalivemobile always down, decrease, and fall, hopefully you can understand if you feel this game very important for you! Trust me!. Thank you. Tru',
       'EA, the game is official and is above average as far as graphics, gameplay go etc. etc. but food for thought and I think it\'ll be a gamechanger really...it\'ll take the game to new heights on a consumer level.

     [ 'So I am a major mobile gamer.  And I must say this game is awesome in a number of ways. My cons however is: arena battles are way too long.     : more clarification should be emphasize on "finish daily or unfurnished daily", I can\'t seem to understand when my daily is completed by looking at the daily chart.  : too much pay to play going on. Mix it up a little plz.   Pros. Great story line.            Epic fighting styles.             Awesome mounts.             Super clean graphics.              Will keep u entertained.',
       'Its a good game. One of the nicest mmorpg on the market right now. However, my only nitpick is the lack of customization of the characters. You get new armor but your actual appearance doesn\'t change except with outfits, but everyone has those so at the end of the day your character does not feel unique at all. The combat and navigation are on point though. Overall a good game but just lack of personal input.',
       'Man I gotta write this again &gt;~&lt;... The only thing u need to fix is the bug that doesn\'t allows you to see the characters... It really anoys me b/c I\'m a girl and only the boy characters are visible so please fix tgis in the next game update! That\'s the only bug that I have experienced! Anyways everyother thing is *AWESOME* btw my character is the puppeteer if that helps in something',
       'This is actually a very good mmorpg game, i\'d like to say it\'s the best mmorpg, but, the bug isn\'t fixed yet, i can\'t see my character when playin, also the puppeter and bountu hunter. Fix this bug quickly, i want to play this game so bad. I can\'t enjoy the gameplay if the characters are invisible.',
       'The last blessing event is a scam!! I spend a lot to get rank 1 and my point was 2x rank 2, but never get the reward til today!! The first message from the CS was to be patient and wait but the last message i got from the CS was maybe someone else got rank 1. Really? On a dead server?? Rank 1-4 was won by all by my guild moron!! My point was 2x rank 2!!! Someone else my ass!! Its a scam, ill report to google!!',
       'Apparently, my first review is gone. It was just a few minutes ago. So basically, I wanted to create a puppeteer but it does not show the avatar in the character creation screen. Same thing goes with the bounty hunter. I\'ve restarted the app, my phone, and re-installed the game. It\'s the same thing. I only see the scythe and shadow for the puppeteer and shadow for the bounty hunter. I\'m not gonna play this game until this issue is fixed.' ],

     [ 'Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn\'t came in two years it probably isn\'t. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don\'t pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges.',
       'Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.',
       'I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.',
       'this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It\'s a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that\'s it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame',
       'Funny characters, endearing cartoon aesthetic and enjoyable game play, but after a couple hunts forces you to wait over 8 minutes before you can actually play again (in order to entice you to pay to make the wait times go away). What kind of game compels you to QUIT out of BOREDOM after playing it for 5 minutes?',
       'I would have rated this game 5 stars but for the fact that I\'m at level 82 and it says more missions coming soon... Who does that? This is the best game I\'ve played in a while so it was a bummer when I saw the message. Explain why this is so or just fix it already. I have no issues with the game itself - control, graphics etc, but this pause is driving me crazy. There\'s no game without a mission. It defeats the purpose.' ],

This game needs strategy and teamwork, unlike MLBB, it\'s a very easy game that doesn\'t require brains. MLBB has a lot of cancer players, trashtalkers, and stupid players. Although, you can never remove those kind of players but at least they stay in MLBB, and smarter people plays this. This is the best MOBA on smartphones! Kudos!',

       'Better than ML. Honestly, I play all sorts of Moba (or any video game), but this one really is different.  This game has issues, no argument with that. But when you compare it to "Mobile Legends: Bang Bang", you really see the difference. This one has top-notch graphics that I can probably compare to VG or PC Mobas. This game has awesome gameplay as well. There are almost overpowered heroes, but there are always heroes that counter them. ML looks like sht compared to this game.  The only downside that I can see is that, the controls are kinda off. Probably with an update, they can fix that. Will give five stars once that happens.',

       'One thing that keeps it away from 5 stars for me is that I wish to see a LAN version of it. When you\'re on the go with friends and there\'s no network signal or something. It would be nice to have an "offline mode" option right in the login page. Just sayin\'.' ],

     [ 'This is all I needed: another Criminal Case game to take up my free time! I love the whole four of them. The the hidden objects tease my brain to no end. Each game  is intriguing with an original story line. I do have my favorite crime scenes,  and plenty of friends(all over the world) whom play as often as they can too!',
       'It would be nice if you level up and get full energy but your energy had some if not all left before you got it restored that you just increased by the full amount, the way it is now I lose energy when levelling up because it doesnt add any more to the 110 that is standard. I dont think it is fair to those of us who play daily. I never know when my pet will find that last batch of XP and cause the level up to happen. If I am over the 110 already, I don\'t even see the new energy. Some concessions need to be made for this. I love the game though, it is fun and challenging.',
       'I love this game. I have all of the criminal case games & love them all. The only things that I don\'t like is that when when ur energy gets refilled, it only adds to what u have, instead of adding an extra 110 to what u have. The other thing is that u can\'t buy none of the hamburgers, orange juice, chips or anything with ur tokens',
       'Love Criminal Case and a True Fan!! One thing I think should change is that whatever score you have when you level up, the 110 should be added to it. We deserve it  because we Earned it and the only reward we get is to share juice with other players. Give us a Happy Meal and 110 pts.!!',
       'DONT BOTHER WITH THIS GAME Played for 10 minutes before I ran out of energy, which you need to earn stars to progress! Then have to wait ages for it to recharge.  OR......pay to top it up. Don\'t think so. UNINSTALL IMMINENT',
       'I was over the moon when they put Mysteries of the past on. I hope they can do the same with The conspiracy as well. All 4 games are a must have. You\'ll never find another game like these. I love playing them because they\'re brilliant & addictive, I hope they continue to make more.' ],

     [ '!ATTENTION!   Your newest update broke the game. My skills do pretty much no damage at all.. Used to do 130k+ now only 7k damage. All my skills are significantly useless and it has ruined my PvP/farming experience. Please fix ASAP üíô  Will change to 5 stars once the bug is fixed  Edit: it\'s completely ruined arena, making matches last 1 minute + that should be finished in seconds. It\'s unfair to players like me trying to rank high in arena. Please get rid of this terrible balancing update..',
       'Seems great at first. As you progress you find that as you get higher in level things COST a LOT more, almost requiring you to buy something. Whatever happened to a game where you don\'t have to drop a ton of money? I can understand a few bucks here and there because there are game developers trying to get paid, but (for example) 5 dollars, just to use one of the characters? Really? How about 1 or 2 bucks, guys? Finally, everything you looks at in the game seems like it is designed for you to purchase something. I feel like I\'m at a bazaar. Could the devs possibly look at making those possible actions a little less imposing? Just saying. Honestly don\'t know how much longer I\'ll play this game if that\'s how it\'s gonna continue.',
       'I rated this game 5 stars initially, but the recent update has made the game very tedious, mainly with the Arena.  I am currently #5 on the leaderboards and ive spent over $50 into this game because i loved it so much, but now i dont find enjoyment in fighting in the arena because it takes so long to complete one match in the time i could complete 2-5 which makes it nearly impossible to climb the ranks.  I think the game is too balanced right now, meaning that characters with lower stats now last so much longer against characters with higher stats such as mine.  I would really appreciate it if you would either go back to the old system or look further into the balancing of the game so I can enjoy the game like i used to.',
       'Bought the archer character after I tried it then it shows that I still didn\'t bought it when trying to choose it as my character. I was already charged the amount. Not a very good one.',
       'Can you fix matching pvp battle. I\'m level 70 and my opponent lvl 100. 15k dmg,10k def,100kho vs 20k,15k,200k. üò§',

     [ 'Good but ¬£4 is a lot to not quite remove all the add. Some pictures are still locked behind and walls. Easy enough to unlock but for the price id expected all add to be removed. Also really would like the pictures to be sortable by category with more fantasy and space stuff in the complex pictures. Also there appears to be no way to sync pictures across devices. If I\'ve paid ¬£4 I should be able to switch between the phone and tablet at will. Both are android.',
       'In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it\'s just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.',

(also this is the longest thing i have EVER typed on my phone!)',
       'I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It\'s kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.‚ò∫',
       'Awesome app, its oddly satisfying and can either be really challenging ir really easy. Its constantly update with new pictures to do, and already contains probably hundreds lol, if dont 75+ and in saving the really detailed ones for last. If there even is such a thing. But, i think a counter for how many blocks of each color are left would be a really awesome alteration. There are many strategies to use when you do a color by number. So a counter for how many blocks of the selected number are left, it would be such a life save.this game has taken enough of my life already as is lmao',
       'Way to many ads, was hard to enjoy. Would have been more bearable If the ads weren\'t 30 seconds each, and played everytime I open/close a drawing. And, to prevent any ads you have to pay. I just want an easy, accessible, relaxing game. And by either making one pay, or making them suffer is not really my idea of "Relaxing". Thank you for your consideration.' ],

     [ 'It\'s really really really fun game.  But I think if you guys do some more improvements so it will be much fun.  Here\'s what I think:  1. I think you should make the house much bigger.  2. You should add more enemies for example:  child o\' slenderina,  slenderman and the spiders.  3. You should add an Adventure mode.  Where you need to find some books or something like an emblem like that stuff to make them uncursed like that.  4. Last but not least, you should add more weapons for example:  Pistol,  sword,  injection etc.    If you do that,  it will be super cool and fun.   ThanQ üòÉüëç',
       'It\'s definatly one of the better (more fun) horror games on the store, but I feel like there could be some more improvements. Firstly I think that if you\'ve completed hard than there should be an (almost) impossible mode. Also minor details such as different textures and Easter eggs would be good. Last, I think that when you escape there should be an outside section where it\'s still got puzzles but it\'s more about the atmosphere. (Maybe that could just be for the "impossible mode") but it would make the game a lot more enjoyable. Also maybe a reward for escaping. (For incentive). Thank you and maybe you could take this into consideration :) also new app icon plz',
       'Who doesn\'t love this game? It\'s bone chilling and exciting for the whole family (Litterally my whole fam plays this game) it would be cool to have a mode where there was no granny just to explore the house and get a feel for how to escape. Also some weapons to attack granny. Lastly a map of where granny is would be super cool. Good luck!',
       'This is definitely the best game I\'ve downloaded! Can you please add some more weapon boxes all unlockable with one key? And put like guns and things in. Granny doesn\'t stay tranquilized long enough. BEST IDEA EVER!! Make it so there is a granny in the forest and go into another house with granny in.',
       'This is an early game with a bunch of potential. I love the game and I\'m always playing it but I feel like you can expand the game with these additions. Firstly, why not add in a collectible menu where you can hunt extremely hard-to-find collection of items within Granny\'s house. Also you could possibly add another, backdoor exit to the house. This would mean being able to escape a different way. Finally you could add another whole game mode where you escape the house in a different way. (You could even add in a whole new mechanic but don\'t make it too complex!)',
       'Hey nice update. I really love it. Please add more to the house and more to granny. Make a story of granny. Make new ideas to the game. Make the game more informational. Make the game better. Make her say random things about her life. Like she is singing a lullaby. Or make her talk to the wall or the mannequin. Thank you for updates. Please put more updates out there. Your too slow and we dont want to wait... sooo please work fast on updating.' ],

     [ 'I used to play this game a long time ago with my brother. I thought since after all these years so many new updates have come, the game must feel different. But it\'s the same. I love the tune that plays as you play it. It\'s so nostalgic. My brother isn\'t anymore with me but playing this game makes me really very happy. It\'s just like I am back in those old days. Specially for me, as it has so many memories, this game is the absolute best.',
       'I have a problem with my account. My punk zombird was maxed out. Level 3. Then when I opened the game, my punk zombird was gone... I obtained that by waiting patiently and gathering 90 diamonds. I had to watch 3 15-30 sec long video for 2 diamonds each. After watching the 3 vids, I had to wait another 8 hours for it to be available again. It took me a month to obtain that bird and then all of a sudden it dissapears?! I obtained it again but I had to start all over again. I uninstalled this app because of that issue.',
       'The game is really addictive. but repeated zombie birds are generated and diamonds are getting wasted. Please change that. One bird one time please. One bird should be at max 3 level not another set. It\'s wasting my internet to watch video to get diamonds for collecting birds',
       'I love this game cause it kills our time when were bored. Yep, we, my mom also is addicted to this game hahaha, shes always getting my phone and play this game whenever im sleeping. Love it, I recommend this game to everyoneüíñ you\'ll be definitely love this game. MobiGame you slaaaay hahaha',
       'I personally loved this game. First off,  u cant jump for high periods of time cause u to run into the bombs. Secondly, whats sup with these prices? Thats ridiculous. You cant level up with prices that high and u have to buy üíé gems and coins just to get a level up... But tum... Very great game overall.',
       'i think it\'s really good every single detail of it is the best only yu should add different zombies that give u power -ups and special effects The next thing is what I said yu should add it into the second one yu could make. The last thing is in the 2 one yu should make it so when an amount a zombies yu get yu get special powers,boost, and cool stuff. Plz make what I just said it would me so awesome if yu did. I\'m begging do it it is my first time ever making a short statement If I misspelled anything I\'m so sorry and for how long this is‚ò∫.I  love this game do itüíñ' ],

I hope my tears will help u guys. :)',
       'Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it\'s just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............',
       'Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!',
       'Its a very good game without any tension of wining any difficult task...I like it very much and its not much addicting I have played many games but its very different. controls are also good but this game needs some practice . I am enjoying this game because the tasks are not very difficult but at the same time not very easy its a perfect game and the main character of the game is very funny he always sleeps in the vehicle.....so finally.... I like this game very much',
       'At first I wasn\'t sure how good the game was but after playing it several times on Android and Windows 8.1 phone, I like it.  It doesn\'t weigh down on the phone\'s processing power. A very addictive game!! Give it go.',
       'I love it and I\'m addicted to playing it.   I like the fact that you can earn points if you don\'t want to buy them.  It would be great if tilting the phone had an impact.  don\'t change much though, its a great game:)' ],

    description: 'Chess in your AndroidChess is a board game for two players. It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat (\'check\') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.During the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player (\'White\') has pieces of a light color; the other player (\'Black\') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent\'s pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.Chess is popular and is often played in competitions called chess tournaments. It is enjoyed in many countries, and is a national hobby in Russia.Features:- five different themes- seven levels of difficulty- two players mode- game assistant (Helper)- realistic graphics- sound effects- small size',

It ends the game.<br><br>During the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player (&apos;White&apos;) has pieces of a light color; the other player (&apos;Black&apos;) has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent&apos;s pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.<br><br>Chess is popular and is often played in competitions called chess tournaments. It is enjoyed in many countries, and is a national hobby in Russia.<br><br>Features:<br><br>- five different themes<br>- seven levels of difficulty<br>- two players mode<br>- game assistant (Helper)<br>- realistic graphics<br>- sound effects<br>- small size',

     [ 'This is by far the best chess "trainer" for me.  It\'s got a nice flow and the game isn\'t "stupid" like most other chess apps/games I\'ve played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I\'m making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.',
       'I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!',
       'I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn\'t show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.',
       'So far it\'s o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It\'s not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game',
       'The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.',
       'Not 100% sure how that works but the other person has their king and it\'s a stale mate and I have practically most of my pieces but to unlock harder levels I have to win. Does stalemate not count? I think its pretty stupid' ],

     [ 'WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you',
       'Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It\'s pretty decent. I\'m enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I\'ve raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn\'t a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)',
       'Love that tekken is on the phone I was a master at it when I was younger no one could beat me with my combos and counters. The game play is good but having to heal at every opportunity is not. The fight should be about the fight not having to heal before going into the fight. If I could go into every fight with full health I would probably spend money on upgrades and fighters . It\'s good but not brilliant as tekken should be. It yous would like to hear what I have to say message me back because I love and loved tekken on the PS and Xbox one of my top 3. Games off all times. Keep up the good work but yous are not just there yet for me to spend money on it but overall it\'s good but not brilliant as it should be',
       'I just download this game today and every time i open it  in 10 to 15 sec game just close automatically. I haven\'t even do the tutorial yet this game just dont even open i love Tekken 7 i play every time in ps4 but i hate android Tekken cant even open. I will hope they fix this game.i have seen the gameplay on youtube i will give this game 5 star but only if i can play the game so untill then i will give one star because thia game graphics were cool on video Thnks for the update it works grat now',
       'iFirst of all I would say. It took me almost 30 minutes to just start the game. It was stuck in downloading screen. Later on it crashed on me  I fired up the game again and later It froze on me during the first fight. For 3rd time I started the game and it eternity to just pass through the loading screen. The data was downloading, then initializing and then loading. Took such a long time. Plz fix this issue. I really want to enjoy this game. But not like this. Even the game play is laggy.',
       'You "borrowed" a lot from MCOC, but as an avid Tekken player, I think you would have been better served sticking with the PS concept. Play the character you want, play their story for prizes at the end, and so on.  Using MCOC basic controls was cool, but if there is anything to borrow from them completely would have been the controls. Different offensive taps to create different moves, etc. Overall, it is petty solid, but could have been a hit if you stuck to your own game concept.' ],

     [ 'Only given a 1 star so the devs hurry up and get the game working again or else it would be a 5 star. This is the best game on play store currently and square Enix have done a brilliant job. No complaints... No p2w... and the graphics if you set them to full are just phenomenal!!! Keep it up guys!! But fix the loading issue so we can get back to akademia!!',
       'Great game so far. Not sure if there is a community forum or something somewhere which would be nice. I had a character on some other server and it seemed to be erased when the new server opened? Its fine though, previous character did not have too much progression. Music is not the greatest though, would be good if you could include more classic FF music in the game.   Dailys seem a bit overwhelming. There are so many quests to complete each day to get all the chests.   Other than that im quite enjoying it. If you can\'t load the game after update clear data and dl again',

It has been 5 days since I submitted a support issue with no useful responses made by them. Update: over 48 hours since last response still not any closer to having my issue resolved',
       'I was hooked up playing this game as you can still get stronger without spending. Unfortunately looks like something broke during the update and was stucked in the FF splash screen. Hoping that the devs are on top of this and release an official announcement to players.',

And now the game doesn\'t even start, i love the final fantasy franchise and you have a really great game, and i like that you have to interact with the game to stay alive and it\'s not just automatic bullcrap, please keep updating the game.',

When I found a match and the game is downloading the dog data,  whenever it\'s halfway from finishing it always says "you have been out of the room". I haven\'t played the online battle yet but I absolutely would love to. I can\'t give this app full rating unless they can fix it and I hope they would.  Thanks and good day sirs/madame.',
       'I think I should make this game my favourite game and I could make the best high score of 2000. And thank you so so so so much.But I saw one mistake you were making that was if a player just tap a white tile you would make it out . So don\'t make the player out. Give it at least 5 chances. So that he can make his or her best high score. Please try to make it more interesting . And also when we reach higher you make it faster and faster. Otherwise this game is the best of all games.',

Also, whenever I start the game I don\'t have any diamonds left, when I  get notifications saying "your lives are refilled". But they aren\'t. So I think you should make some changes in the game.

Although it took time for my account to be unblocked, it was still proven that I didn\'t use any bug on my account. So yeah, I am taking back the 1 star rating that I just gave yesterday. Hahahaha! So thank you Fishing Hall for my load credits of more than 3k , my Pineng 20kMAH powerbank, and my 1tb Seagate external drive. Thank you for fixing the issue right away!',

Some noobs don\'t get chance to play, if you do this update then, even they can play... Many pros like me fear to take noobs on our side, but in game we realize that they are good players, this update would help them a lot Consider my request Thank you for your patience',
       'Earlier I gave this game a 5 star, now the reason being unhappy is some of the add ons  I bought isn\'t working. Like the laser and the accuracy doesn\'t seem to work at all. One cannot deny the fact that m still addicted to this game and this still works as a stress buster. If the team can do something about this, would be appreciated. Thank you 5 star will come back!',

     [ 'Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I\'m 20 just..üòâüòâ I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I\'m in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...üòÇüòÇ Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. üòòüòòüòò‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è',
       'Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there\'s nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.',
       'A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!',
       'Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn\'t respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I\'m willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.',
       'It gives me something to do on my off time and. As I play I start to get very addicted to the point that I\'m fully in the game and I really love playing this game. I at least play up to 30 to 40 minutes a day just because how intense it is. Keep up the good work!!! üëç',
       'Fun little time killer. My only problem is that daily rewards fail to show up most days. It could be a problem on my end, but I don\'t know, and it\'s a pretty small issue so I don\'t really care.' ],

     [ 'Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!',
       'Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm\'s Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!',
       'Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I\'m just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it\'s going to be good.  We\'ll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!',
       'This game is awesome!! Just one thing... You might want to fix Power Trip, because if you miss the gravity pad in the robot part it\'s pretty much an insta-win. I don\'t know if it was meant to be there but if it wasn\'t, you should probably put some spikes there or something.',
       'This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10',
       'I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.' ],

       'Let me just say I don\'t mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high',
       'The game crashes unexpectedly even in the middle of a fight and when I return the energy I used for the fight when it crashed is already consumed when I didn\'t even finish it.  It evwn crashes in the middle of a raid =(    The game is good but I hope the crashing is fixed. I restart my phone and it works smoothly after that but I can\'t have my phone restartung every time I want to play. Please fix this',
       'This game is requires you to spend cash if you wanna get strong or atleast equivalent to the game difficulty scaling.

After 2 weeks playing, you\'ll start to see empty cities in several nations. The dev nees to stop opening new server and start to merge the old servers. If not, this game won\'t last long.',

After I reach LEVEL 35 my character was totally gone and advices me to create a new one. Please help me regarding with my problem. Any reply are very much appreciated. I will change my ratings after I recovered my character. Thank you.',

It\'s got worst after S17 open.. this game is the same as Loong Craft just different skin. But at least loong craft server is much more sturdy. Please DON\'T tell me to check connection or reinstall the game, because I already did it 3 times, connection it\'s perfectly fine, cuz all my other game I play run just fine.',

       'One of the best motorcycle game to date, weather conditions are great, bikes are great and handling is great, but the bad ai on higher difficulty level a few times are ridiculous and messes up everything.  Sometimes a truck speeds up to 150km/h just to close off that small gap, where you could slip through, but next time all cars in all lane slow down at once, so you can\'t pass anywhere, even though there\'s nothing in front of them. This is really annoying, when every second counts and there\'s no way to pass them for 4-7 seconds. Apart from this the game is great. The keep changing weather conditions is great too.',

Just kinda mad that I can\'t get back to where I was.  Edit: I keep getting communication errors and haven\'t been able to do a mission all day. All my stamina, gone. I let it refill still couldn\'t finish a story mode even. I had a good connection too',

A person is standing on the trap position but does not get stuck/hit by that. It took alot of time to set those traps and with this new update, all goes into waste. Please fix that.',

I\'ve paid over $500 dollars, y\'all got money, I know you do, you also have time! Just please deliver something great in the future, Special Attack Missions are a lot of fun :D',

Also my Ryo is maxed out at 9600000 and there soo much more to be collected. There\'s not too many things to buy with Ryo in this game. Add costumes or something.',

Sound is okay. I used both of these apps.',

       'You don\'t get it but no one wants to play a game which you can\'t play whenever you please because energy is limited and you have to wait for it to be refilled. Trust me I hate this and I am sure everyone else who plays this also. Get this removed so that I can play as many times I want and whenever I want! Otherwise your game is great. It\'s a nice app but I might uninstall it because I can\'t play it all the time!',

The game was fun to play until that the tasks had been getting ridiculous that even I was playing with the highest speed I still won\'t make it on time or I won\'t even get as many costumers as the tasks said so, and not only that I\'ve been playing extra job levels and guess what? I\'m not gaining any gems' ],

Overall great game when they game out with the sequel it addressed the main problem with this one mainly no other maps and you have to pay to get the female character',
       'I think this  game is so interesting  that I play it all day , and somtimes  it tell you that you  should  never ever  steal any thing  from a dangerous  place where nobody  is there, it is really  difficult.  Good luck  and be  safe',
       'It\'s a great game to spend time playing on but I would like the controls to change, their to annoying when I jump I die and am like WOAH... I JUMPED, THOUGH!!! otherwise. Great game.',
       'Temple run is one of the best game all time. Ally friends and relatives have this game in their mobile. It sounds more interesting. It is so good and time runs so fast if we start playing temple run. I like this game so much and I\'m thankful to the ones who created this game. It also makes us more addictive...',
       'I did it I mean I get my high score and then I died makes no sense right snow total stands but not mad at this game because like I can definitely not beat it it\'s like a fun and active game I would give it like a 5 of I didn\'t die like the heck',
       'The game is cool but there\'s a few things that have gone wrong because when my 10 and 5 year old grandchildren  play they say when we try to jump it won\'t let us so it would mean a lot if you changed it a bit' ],

     [ 'Has alot to keep you busy. For that i give 5 stars. Minus 1 star because certain features in the game cannot be unlocked unless you spend money. To me thats a recipe for a slow death. For i will soon be leaving guns of glory in a blaze of glory based on that alone.',
       'Need some updates like 2 simultaneously upgrade option. Less but more extensive research. Lengthy process is boring. I know by spending money u can get rid of it but money making shouldn\'t be always a concern.',
       'Could be a five star game, but needs improvement. Screen zoom is totally non-existant. No zoom out, constant "finger scrolling " required. ZOOM OUT,  ZOOM OUT,  ZOOM OUT!!!!!   ALSO 1.5 UPDATE?  GREAT JOB GUYS!  YOU FORGOT TO POST THE UPDATE!!!    WHAT A JOKE  They are currently giving APPLE users the 1.5 game upgrade. And gave Android user the middle finger. APPLE users now have a clear advantage over Android users.   So dont talk aboit you vare about customers‚Ä¶ they don\'t . Clearly an APPLE culture designer.  Still haven\'t posted Android tablet update to ver 1.5 (droid haters)',
       'I really like the game at first. I gave it 5 stars but after a few weeks, i change to 3 stars only. Every time after the update, i cannot play the game. It always "connection problem. please reconnect" and until now i cannot play the game anymore. This game only wants your money.',
       'This a pay to win game with lootboxes of different packs. They will keep making you spend with micro transaction of useless stuff to get the real thing you seek. Once, they took my money and the item was not delivered to me because i asked refund before, for a pack called "hope gemstones pack" but after 3 times of 20 bucks purchases, i did not get a single hope gemstone. A scam game in a very good way to steal your money. On the other hand, the game is very addictive and well made. If only the developer has a bit of decency..',

     [ 'Easily my favourite android game. Hits all the right spots. While Blitz followed the runner style coins model and see how much you can travel, I am glad that in this game they ditched that over-used android model. I appreciate there vision, it\'s a complete different game from Blitz. Various fictional cars and characters that seem original inspirations and charming in their own way. The tracks have a theme. Boss races under every championship. There is so much of soul in the game. And you can adjust resolution, add colour correction, adjust many other effects. Words don\'t do justice here nor does 5/5.',
       'Amazing! I play this game daily and I never got bored. Just one thing: other drivers don\'t use special abilities which does not makes it challenging. Now since I have completed this game once, I would expect devs to add new levels and characters. I have an idea for a new character. Please contact me',
       'Imagine Mario Kart but on mobile with a few tweaks. That\'s what this game is and what a great game it is. So much variety and features that makes this game unique. Vector Unit  did an excellent job and this game deserves some credit for how great it is. I\'m telling you, if you like Mario Kart, Crash Racing, Sonic All Stars or even Angry Birds Go, you\'re gonna love this game.',
       'exciting game for sure. but unfortunately i can\'t play it via bluetooth directly to other device without connecting to android tv. one more thing, i suggest to add on screen joystick for control option. im really looking forward for developer to update this. thank you',
       'The game just restarted as if I never played it. Just went through the tutorial as a new player. I have been playing for months. Not sure what happened! Can\'t sync it with google games. I do know I was playing and mid game my phone battery died. I recharged it and went to the game and went default on me.',
       'The controls take some getting used to. But for a Mario-Kart-like experience for mobile, this game gets my #1 rating. Feels more like Diddy Kong racing to be honest though. Can be played when you only have enough a few minutes, or grinded for awhile until you run out of tickets.' ],

     [ 'A good graphics for a good beginning franchise. A well tame game for an anime base. But my concerns on playing this game is sometimes ita forcing crash. (I thought this was a high end game so basically you need a good phone that can handle a game like this) im looking forward for better improvements such as more charcaters to come. And much more sfx. Big thumbs up for this game.',
       'Great game and graphics. Need to work on the optimization though as constant crashes occurs. Will also be thrilled to see rework on Yomo as he looks really plain in this game. Character collision and ability lock in also needs improvement, especially those with dashes which will be better to have single target lock in. Overall as a TG fan I love this game.',
       'It\'s a fun game and the controls are simply and graphics/animation is nice. Love the music and action scenes and the anime scenes that pop up every now and then.  It\'s pretty well done....except, the lagging is quite annoying and it has the tendency to crash from out of nowhere and it makes me rage! Especially when it\'s during a mission and it crashes and I have to start all over again! Please, please, PLEASE fix the lagging and random crashing!',
       'I absolutely love Tokyo Ghoul so when I saw this I got really excited. There are some problems though, like the graphics are a bit iffy and there\'s no masked kaneki but other than that pretty solid and could use more animations.',
       'Decent game. Same game play as Marvel Future Fight. Graphics are decent. Maps are way too bland and boring though. Also feels like its too big compared to the characters. Lacking auto sign in. when game starts, maybe only gor Goggle accounts, havent tried with facebook login. Otherwise a decent game for TG fans.',
       'Big fan of the Anime and Manga but I have a few things I wish the game improved.   Game will stutter on certain maps and will close for no reason, this however may be due to my phone.   Progress seems to be separate on every sever which is annoying if you wanted to change servers.  But I can\'t complain that the game is here finally! Hopefully the game is improved and we get some Tokyo ghoul re: characters once the Anime airs next month.' ],

Really developer?, ya cant wait a tad longer to stop the game and make us stare at a cat puzzle? The worst. I didnt even play it long enough to appteciate the poor controlls. Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.',
       'I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn\'t have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it\'s Definitely Not a game you\'d wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!',
       'Too many ads. I just downloaded n was very happy to check this out but first thing that came on my screen was advertisement. It\'s sad that even after so many feedbacks given for excessive advertisements still developers are running with it. I\'m uninstalling this game n not recommending anyone to try it unless you want to watch commercials',
       'Overall....Great Game, but with Controls of Shooting & Moving around....It\'s Not Exactly Easy to Around. And when it comes to Movement just in General....my Main Problem, But NOT the Only Problem was the Movement in Exactness of where I\'m Trying to Move my Guy (My/the Shooter) just Stinks!! - The Game itself....I Love It!!!',
       'Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)',
       'Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout' ],

     [ 'It would be nice if you level up and get full energy but your energy had some if not all left before you got it restored that you just increased by the full amount, the way it is now I lose energy when levelling up because it doesnt add any more to the 110 that is standard. I dont think it is fair to those of us who play daily. I never know when my pet will find that last batch of XP and cause the level up to happen. If I am over the 110 already, I don\'t even see the new energy. Some concessions need to be made for this. I love the game though, it is fun and challenging.',
       'Update.  Trying to play again and remember why I uninstalled it.  You have to wait 40 minutes for enough energy to play 20 seconds.  Or, pay outrageous prices for a few minutes of play.  I like the game enough, i would pay a reasonable and higher  one time fee to get rid of ads, and have unlimited play.  I may uninstall, again. Uninstalling.  Like the game but hate waiting hours to play.  Now it\'s crashing',
       'Your usual find hidden objects game, and wait ages or pay to reveal the story fast model. Nothing new here. Tapping on things can be inaccurate as well. Tutorial story was lame. Mini games were totally unchallenging as well, yet we need to earn the right to play them.',
       'It\'s a great game. The only issues are:  1. It takes too long to feed pets.  2. The energy refill should give a certain amount of new energy regardless of where you are at rather than refill up to 110.   3. Since I am on the most current available case, it takes too long waiting for new case to open. 4. Sticker packs are a horrible idea. Should give an option for energy or food.',
       'Its a real time killer I love murder mystrey They are so fun to do and exciting But it updated it and...... GOT RID OF ALL MY PROGRESS!!!!! i was on case 5 and i had to start again Plz make it so this doesnt happen',
       'Game is fun until it takes for her to do anything 12hrs to analyze something here spend 2.00 $ to speed it up. Out of energy pay 5$ for an item to fill 20 energy. No thank you. To much emphasis on energy and real money. The cases take way to long to solve and to many starts to analyze something g unimportant and to get stars you need probably 100 energy to get one when u need around 10 or more per case if ur lucky. On a case which coulda been done in one chapter not 2 maybe more' ],

       'What stands out the most from other games of this type for me is that you get heroes and that you don\'t lose fighters in battle unless they die whereas in other games like clash of clans you lose all you fight with regardless.

If money is all thats important i understand. Ill find another game to play. UNITE AGAINST SPENDING PPL!!!',
       'Game is getting better with being fair. Free to play people can actually roll decent heroes after a while with persistence. IGG is still unbelievably money hungry for their newest released things - but I guess it\'s better to wait for everything or pay for it upfront. I chose option 1. Thank you IGG for making rolling a little more fair.' ],

     [ 'Hot garbage. I absolutely love the game but forget playing in the evenings. The game freezes and kicks you saying internet connection lost. The problem is the servers not my ISP. Sometimes you can rejoin and continue where you left off, other times or says the room is full. 5 stars if they get this issue fixed and quit blaming the ISP when it\'s their equipment.',
       'I really love this game, not sure why. The only problem is that I keep on getting disconnected from servers or I\'m not able to load into battle royale or the qualifying games. I get disconnected from the wifi for a few seconds, I thought it was just the phone but when I uninstalled the game it stopped. It happens almost every other game, sometimes a few (5+) games in a row. For most games I would just uninstall after a while and find something else, but I really enjoy playing. Hopefully that gets fixed, I saw a lot of other reviews saying the same thing. ~Lagging',
       'The game is really good. I\'m really enjoying it but after playing for about 15 to 20 minutes it just quits, like it\'s crashing. This usually happens when I\'m first place and level 17 or so. Really frustrating as it means I\'ve gotta start again. Will happily increase to 5 stars once this has been resolved. Great game other than that!',
       'I personally love this game. The controls are fluent, and it is all around a good game. üòÄ But, for some reason, whenever I go into the battle Royal game, it just instantly kills me! Sometimes it works, but most of the time it just kills me straight away. Maybe it\'s me... Idk other than that, great game!',
       '4 or 5 games have got me to spend money in years of playing Android games. This is one of them. Probably because they didn\'t force me to, to enjoy the game. Great work. Different game modes keep it fresh. Very addictive. Please update and fix the English though.',
       'Gameplay is awesome. Game is awesome. Game is also buggy as hell. Bad translations, poor perk descriptions, and even perks that break functionality with certain game modes.  Worst thing is the inability to do almost anything while office or in low service areas absolutely maddening. Constant disconnect while playing online games.' ],

I bet this game would be a lot more fun if you could walk around instead of just sitting In one place which is my only complaint. But otherwise overall this game is rather a bit fun if you are looking for a time killer.',

       'Great shooting game. Love the song, gameplay,graphics and the story behind this game. This should be given the title \'The Child of Modern Combat 5\'.But I have some ideas. Why not making it like modern combat 5(making the character move in different directions, adding pistol as tertiary weapons, increasing the amount of teammates in the player\'s squad, etc)Anyway great game!

     [ 'Good game. Lots of characters to choose from and they are obtainable for FREE. Which is different from FFBE. The only problem im having is its hard to get specific character weapons for each character in story. Specifically the 25 gear draw. I\'ve been obtaining only 3-4 of the 25 story character weapons and I still don\'t have the weapon I\'m looking for. Also it\'ll be hard to obtain the same copy of the weapon to limit break it. And it Cost a lot of gems just to obtain one. The Color stones that are locked, can\'t be unlocked using gems anymore. Didn\'t see it in update, please fix.',
       'Great game to pass the time. Love the nastoligia. I hope more variety of monsters come soon. Bat,goblin,bomb,wolf repeat....haha. there are more but still pretty lacking given how many are in game. I like the progression system a lot and easy to farm gems.',

       'As of this patch the game is slow as heck!!! I\'m not downloading the whole game pack just to get past this. Now well I can see the text unlike other people the slow down from this patch alone almost makes me want to leave the game till it\'s fixed!   Btw for people complaining about multiple copies of an item that\'s a good thing you need 4x of 1  item to limit break it 3 times to the max lvl and then it gives bonus stats to that specific character the item\'s for. So then just equip the character and that alone will make it a bit stronger.',

I have a galaxy s8 plus and when I put the controls on large, it feels like there on medium. If your playing duel and your opponent has 5 power points ahead of you, just call it a lost. Do better. Battlefront 2 is about to be banned in Germany because of the card system. I hope you look into it.  Edited: it\'s still the same. It feels like a pay to win. I\'m going back to shadow fight 2. You know. The good one.',

If there was a shop to sell them or add runes to them or be able to combine them to make either new or more powerful ones of the sane type I would give this game 5 stars.hopefully the Devs will take this and add this feature in a update. Speaking of updates, I just installed the latest one it was like 403MB but nothing changed! What was the update for then?',

So it\'s kinda just a money grab. If that was fixed I\'d give it 10 stars',

     [ 'I rather enjoy the game a lot. It feels balanced for the most part,  leveling takes a while which wouldn\'t be a issue if it didn\'t take so long to go place to place. Gets sort of annoying to go back and forth trying to get resources and the game goes from fun to grindy quickly.   My main issue is the battery life of my phone. While charging my phone and playing this game but battery was being drained.  Graphics are good, I enjoy the crafting and base building, the combat is nice, and the auto harvest feature is a life saver.',
       '**UPDATE** Is an awesome game. Could use a few more perks (ie. Weapons and hard to get items) in drop boxes and yellow zones.Now the down side is if you die in a level your last position is no longer there to try and recoup some of your items. Players killing you as you open trunks in inventory. Oh ya and the free spin box...give random prizes instead of coins and rope. People will get really into it if perks are awesome. Great game could be the best with a couple tweaks. Awesome job.',
       'Alright, so I don\'t normally write reviews, but I feel like this one is deserved. The games concept is great, as with most post-apocalyptic zombie games, surviving and building a base is the main goal. Great. However, it is a micro-transaction based game, meaning you have to pay for packages if you actually want to enjoy it to the fullest. Am I saying you can t enjoy it otherwise? No, I do and I don\'t pay for the packages, however, my house constantly gets destroyed, I\'m killed by other players who do pay, and my game progression is massively slow. So, I don\'t really recommend this game, if you actually want to "play" the game.',
       'Just another game that either makes you wait to play it, or pay not to wait. Why? Don\'t make me pay not to wait. Entice me to pay with cool things, otherwise it\'s an instant uninstall. Poor business model. Imagine paying double to get them to make your food faster at a restaurant, or just wait a long time. Would you really keep going there, or somewhere else that makes something just as good but in a reasonable amount of time?',
       'Anyway i edit this review... The is nice and graphics are cool. But there is the problem on the game. Could you pls remove the energy bar so i can still play the without waiting to fill the energy bar... Cause otherwise i less play this game in days... that you know you must wait your energy bar to fill again in a couple of minutes if the energy is gone?. Pls Remove it so we can play all day along.. Thank you.',
       'I\'ve been playing this Game for Almost 3 months. Very Addictive tho. New update is Awesome. Im Level 90 now but i don\'t have a Gas Tank yet Because I have a Problem about Bunker Alfa Power Error. It says Device need more power. I hope i Can do Bunker even my Device is Weak. Thats why i rate it 4/5 if This issue fix Im gonna Love it üòä 5/5.' ],

     [ 'Well I like the game. It\'s fun and it is really tempting to open a really good chest because you can get a legendary. I have minor inferno dragon lava hound mega knight sparky and lumberjack. For example pretend your friend says don\'t open that ledendary chest wait until tomorrow . You just gotta open it. And Supercell it would be nice if I could get night witch.',
       'NejiOmeGa here!üôè I have got to say this game is a "quick paste first place!" type of game and I love it so far been training like a pro to be on top!!üôá I\'ve loved it ever since the updates, oh yes did I mention I\'m a returning player?? An exquisite job well done I have so many new opportunities to reveal, but so many opponents to show who\'s Royals! So all is said I just ask that you watch and battle me tuff clasherzüòÇüòÇ',
       'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'I m lucky enough!!!!!  I just started playing 8 months ago and now I earn 7 legendaries in total and 2 of them are lvl2 where as my friend is playing since more than a year he owes only 6 legendaries and 1 of them is lvl 2..... So plz do something about this we(gamers) expect better from u  Plz don\'t disappoint them who has low no.s of legendaries....... This is request from all guys who have not got luck in this game I guess...',
       'Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn\'t one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you\'re better at making farm and army games. Please make more of thoseüòñ' ],

       'Cute to see yall deleted my last review. Re writing and giving you 1 star.  Game crashes constantly. . Can no longer get into.  No more money will be spent till fixed. And if my review is removed again. I will just uninstall',
       'I unfortunately spent some money to buy gems for this game but realized that each levels requires insane amounts of gems to unlock new levels and upgrades. Would not be playing any longer. It\'s designed to suck out as much $$$ they can get from you. I\'d recommend you get other apps and just skip out on this one.',
       'I love this game. But when I go into the free gem section and complete an offer it doesn\'t give me my gems. It took me 2 days to get to level 8 on a game because that is what the offer said. I still have not received any gems. I\'ve also done quite a few others and no gems from those either.',
       'This is such a great game, it\'s just unfortunate that you need gems to play most of the game. I used 100,000 coins to try to get gems, and I received no gems. This is a serious issue. You will lose players if you don\'t make gems more accessible to players.',
       'It\'s a pretty entertaining game. BUT you have to buy EVERYTHING with gems (aka real money). Programmers focus excessively on making players pay even before they are hooked to the game!!! After getting to the second street zone, I find myself unable to continue unless I pay. I find it a little lame after all the effort you put on creating a pretty good game. Bye' ],

     [ 'So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn\'t find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren\'t extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don\'t know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I\'m not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.',
       'Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh',
       'I love the game but its frustrating when you have all 8 Spartans and the sword guys get in the way so maybe an extras set of controls to control where your men start or something. Also for me the screen keeps jumping I try to look at enemy and I catch a glimpse but then it jumps to my side then back again and again and again please fix this.',
       'I wish there were more commands. Like maybe you could command the miners to garrison while the rest of the troops guard. Also, redesign the swordwrath helmet. It looks like someone spray painted their hair gold and then glued jewels on it. I also wish there could be more types of zombies. The idea of endless is cool but please add the zombies to the campaign.',
       'I think that this game brings back memories of the times that we all played on the first one and seeing this new one with more actions and abilitys and many more things to do is just what I would expect from something from the old stick war 1 game and I just would love to see more stick war games like these overall I love this game and I think it was the best',
       'Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it\'s not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I\'ve survived 24 nights but I don\'t even have the achievements for"survive 5 nights". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don\'t because some of the zombie achievements I\'m not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I\'m currently at 59.

     [ 'I recently switched to mobile gaming only, and I have a g stylo phone and a Nvidia shield k1 tablet. On my phone I get network error (I\'m data only) and my tablet says the game isn\'t compatible. It\'s marshmallow OS on the shield tablet and the thing can run borderlands 2 natively so I know it\'s not a hardware issue. This game looks cool. Wish I could find out for sure. And no, I\'m not running a speed test.',
       'The features of the game are cool.. i like all the pvp dungeons.. but most of the dungeons with event goes in certain time and limited.. if i miss them..then i hardly get the purpose of installing this game meaning.. nothing else to do.. it\'s getting boring for player like me who wants to spend hours online but no more rewarding pvp dungeons available overnight.. maybe create some entertaining 24 hours pvp features? I can tell many players tend to be inactive for more than 1 day...so hope for more crowded and better LOD..',
       'I just realized this evening that this game uses the microphone feature to spy on the players and listen to their conversations without their consent. After joining one event I could clearly hear conversations of other players (not about game and I\'m sure without them even knowing that they were being listened to) while I was having my sound turned off, even after leaving that particular event and when having my game in the background the sounds didn\'t stop until I turned off the game. This game should be called Legacy of Spies, nice try üëçüèª',
       'Love the game, would give 5 stars, but lost 2 high-level characters and quite a bit of $ due to lack of anything resembling customer service. If you have to reinstall for any reason, and can\'t remember your password, be prepared to lose all progress because if you can\'t sign in right the first time, there\'s no way to sign out, or to contact someone to help recover your character.',
       'I love playing the game but there are so many updates all the time. And when they do their bimonthly update you have to download new package and then some gameplay features dont work. I have had a couple things not work from last update. I tried to contact support and they havent replied at all. Its been three days now. Im an everyday player who spends real money in game. Would rate higher if someone would help me out..',
       'Requires some patience but is a really fun game. Don\'t expect to fly through the tutorial but they make it fun learning the steps. What I enjoy the most, is its NOT lagging down my processor with ads. Only thing I wish is that the home base was a little more organized.' ],

       'Most intrusive ads ever. The game is great. Fun way to kill time. But the ads are horrible. It will sometimes open my browser to some sketchy foreign site, which then opens pop-ups saying that my phone has viruses and I need to download this so and so app. Really ruins the game.',

I got past the faxt it did that almost every game and couldnt make it past 1 lol. Due to the contonuous problem though, i dont feel i got the enjoyment i shpuld have and have since uninstalled the app. Great work so far, i hope to install it again when its able to run smoothly! Thanks!',

The art style is awesome, i am  reminded of early era nick toons IE Ren and Stimpy, or Rocko\'s modern life. All and all its pretty awesome. The only improvement i would make is a option to pay for removing ads. But hey awesome game. EDIT/UPDATE just noticed that there is the no ads option if you buy the starter pack.' ],

I hope to sell items / weapons in traders. features in lobby and main menu games are very boring. the more cool if every artata that has been in can. can in pairs skin + nick name. just enough for the addition of me. I can not say much because this is so crazy. btw thank you very much for fulfilling my previous request about "offline multiplayer". I hope it can be cool if it improves. I\'ll add a star if everything gets better. warm greetings from me',
       'Awesome. A great time-killing bullet hell dungeon crawl for mobile. I\'ve been playing since early-access and I\'m glad to see the game continuously get better. Only issue is with multiplayer, sometimes the game just crashes over and over again (w/4 players) for no reason really. 5 stars when this gets fixed. Keep up the great work devs!',
       'Love this game! How about pet machine which gives you a random pet when you use it? You could pay 500, 750 or 1000 gems to spin, and it will give you a new pet! There could be 51 pets, 20 common, 15 rare, 10 ultra rare, 5 legendary ones with super powerful attacks and one golden for fully upgrading the safe,pet food, plant and books! Some ideas for pets are zombie, noob, turret from  the portal series, a cloud and mini versions of the bosses! Thanks!!!!',
       'This game is literally the BEST GAME IS MY HISTORY!!! My cousin advertised me and I don\'t believe him but when I watch the ad I wan like that\'s it I\'m downloading this. Now I downloaded it me and my cousin manage to defeat the first boss because without teamwork, no a good idea at all... So download it right now it improves your teamwork ability with your friends.',
       'L.O.V.E.  I.T. So fun! Just one thing, MORE PETS AND CHARACTERS, oh, and try to make it so you can play multiplayer without same wi-fi please. But anyway, epic game, keep the updates comin\'!!! Also, I don\'t like the room on the 1-5 level where there\'s like 4 waves of only giant buffed monsters. I died twice in there.',
       'The greatest game, I ever played. It can multiplayer and its so fun playing it with friends. Although, problems can be seen during multiplayer, and multiplayer only. One: One of us may be stuck in the room forever unless someone enters the portal, or die. Two: It may restart the submission progress(the one before going into the dungeon), and Three: Can\'t multiplayer in different wifi? Are you serious? But to be fair, it so ok when started and no glitches, will occur. Its a fun game, and a good time killer. Worth the playing. (PS. If you can, can you make a new assassin skin with white hood, yellow scarf, and linings, and the spec. Changes color depending the skin, it will be great when it does)' ],

     [ 'It\'s ok...not something I am going to keep. Good for like 5 min then the adds getting a bit much after every other at bat. I understand making revenue but a bit much after 1 or 2 hits. Plus I don\'t know if it was my device but the only sound I got from this game was the adds. No hit sounds or music or even hearing the sound of the ball hitting anything. Good concept, could have been designed and presented better.',
       'Fun game, addactive, enjoyable. However forcing ads on the player after ever 2 hits is out of order. You already let us double our winnings by watching ads so why make us watch them when we don\'t want to? Take that out and add in an option to watch an ad for coins. Do that and I\'ll happily give you 5 stars.',
       'Awesome game. Bought it. Beat it real fast. Would like to see more bats to discover, different levels, places to hit the ball, maybe more challenging fun ways to hit the ball, but at the same time not complicate it too much. I\'ll keep it and wait for updates! Also yes the ads are excessive if you don\'t buy premium.',
       'This game seems like it could be a great time waster... If it weren\'t for the whole crashing after every round when it tries to load an ad or when you try to watch an ad to upgrade something for free. I see nothing wrong with having these ads here.... As long as they don\'t affect app stability',
       'To everyone complaining about the ads, quit being so cheap and give the $2.49 to buy the game and remove them. Once the ads are removed, it\'s addictive and fun to keep getting the ball further. Fun concept and well executed. I\'ve already gotten more than my $2.49 worth of fun out of this game, and continue to play it.',
       'One star for the fact that after every single at bat they throw an ad at you. And half you can not skip early. I understand the need for ad\'s but Jesus Christ not after every turn. I normally pay to turn ads off but since the developers wanted to go ad crazy I\'m not paying a cent and just delete.' ],

So far the best of the word connects !! Really happy with this game, will add to my phone  and get rid of the other word connect games that seem to have ad, after ad not to mention the high amount for hints! There is one reason I didn\'t  give it a 5, because some of the ads get stuck and you can\'t  exit,  overall  4.8!',
       'Not a bad time killer - quick paced and not too taxing on the brain. I wish it had a more comprehensive dictionary so you would still get bonus points for valid words like \'cad.\' No matter - still basically a four star, though almost three for the number of ads.',
       'The game isn\'t bad if you like word puzzles. My dislike comes from the fact that I have push notifications for this app turned off, but it somehow continues to manage to send them. It also keeps poor track of your coins. Good time killer.',
       'Child-friendly! And, as an adult? I love how am yet to see an advertisement. üòä  Unlike other word games like Word Connect, it also lets you find and play words that are not necessarily those found on the board, storing it in an "Extra" slot, which generates added points to your score, rather than telling you to choose the word that\'s only on the board.  ADDENDUM: After reading the comments, it appears there may be ads after all. Am yet to see any though. Perhaps because am still in a lower level.',
       'Game is fun. But giving me pop ups to bring me back to the game while it\'s not open is a nono. Especially when it takes up half the screen. I\'d give 5 stars cause i had fun playong this, but this one thing is annoying. Especially with the amount of ads, it shows you just wanna push people to keep playing for that ad revenue. Won\'t be downloading any of your games after i delete this now.',
       'This is one of the best word games I have ever, when running into a really tough spot not immediately uninstalled. This is a GREAT AND CHALLENGING GAME!!! It really makes you think and it keeps your brain thinking and actively. I love it and will keep it. I am 70 yrs old and just got this game a couple weeks ago and at almost level 300..

       'Plays flawlessly on my Note 8. It\'s a bit hard, but a fun and fair challenge! Of course, with any free game there will be ads, but if they bother you too much just go into airplane mode.',
       'It is.. a general improvement from Mmm fingers 1 - more traps ,challenge mode and trails. The graphics are completly different, But what really changed is that the game became ALOT harder than the original. Maybe it\'s just me not knowing the traps, but it still became harder.',
       'The game looks super fun when I see the pictures on the app. But when I actually go into the game, all it says is "Unfortunately Mmm Fingers 2 has stopped." Please fix this. I actually want to play this game because it looks really fun, and I absolutely loved Mmm Fingers so I really hope you fix this bug!',
       '1. The touch responsiveness seems a bit laggy. It\'s not as accurate as Mmmfingers1  2. The challenges menu should have a retry option so that when you fail a stage, you don\'t have to go back to stages menu and choose the stage which you were playing. Retry button will ease the problem.  Other than that graphics and challenges part is great.üëç',

Hope there is a version II coming out soon!  Cheers! ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ  I\'ve sent an email to the devs about no bonus brains in survival mode but after uninstall/reinstall there was the odd one popping up; however I feel there should be more to reward the player.  Cheers what up devs I didn\'t play for a few weeks and my progress and settings where wiped out...I started playing zombie smacker...are you the same devs???',

I hate the hiding construction workers. If I don\'t knock them out at the top of the screen, they get too low down and I miss them. Hate it when I accidentally hit the people when the game throws everything at you. I have a super fast finger, but, sometimes not fast enough. It takes concentration and fast reflexes to advance in this game. I gave it 5 stars.  Might go and read the help section for tips. All I want to say is try it.',

     [ 'Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.',
       'Fun at first, but you have to pay a lot of real money for it to stay fun. Otherwise you have to wait weeks and months to progress. Some events can only be fully completed by spending hundreds of dollars (yeah, that much). Not worth it. If you have that much money, use it on something better than this. Improve your life, use your time better, don\'t waste it here. Good luck!',
       'I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I\'ve already dumped into this game and the devs didn\'t give me my in game rewards. I\'ve submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.',
       'Wasn\'t sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to "farm gold,xp,mats". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it\'s an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don\'t be jealous, just play your game and have fun.',
       'Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an "annoying add". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It\'s simple, it\'s fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend.',
       'Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I\'ve progressed it\'s just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I\'m not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!' ],

     [ 'The game is Great! Awesome graphics, and the gameplay is great. It\'s available offline and that makes it almost perfect, just that it\'s only one mode when you play offline, which is Survival, it gets boring playing only that mode offline, there should be more stuff for offline. The controls is just Good, it can be Great though! Like add another control modes.. Maybe like a one where it\'s me who shoots with the cannon instead of automatically shooting! I admit it\'s gonna be harder but most important that it\'s gonna be Challenging and more realistic, I hope you guys consider my suggestions, especially the controls thing.  But yeah the game is Amazing overall, keep it up.',
       'Great game, great graphics! Needs some things  -like weapon/plane descriptions (just some text to show you what you are getting, maybe make it a bit educational) -definately a campaign -make offline mode at least a bit challenging... now you just farm forever until you get bored. Not ideal... make enemies shoot you at least!',
       'Great game overall but I\'d like to see some more game modes and a fix to the camera. It glitches out after a few minutes of in every watch and makes it impossible to play. I\'ll change my rating once I notice a fix.',
       'Inbuilt missile of F-35 can\'t even hot simple planes like F-16. It contain third class missiles in side even after being so costly in game... Please put some accurate missiles in f35 it missed 9 out of 10 times.... Waste of time',
       'I love this game! Best dogfight ever! Just a few request... Add a desert map, and it\'s like a sandstorm where there\'s dunes and little bases for offline mode, and add the dunes map for online but no buildings, or add them I don\'t know! And on offline mode, make it to where the enemies actually hurt you, I never get damaged unless I hit the water or objects, and last. Please make the landing an aircraft carrier ship, and they can shoot misses, (no lock on) and shoot the little turrets, because the planes, and game are perfectly modern, but the airship you land on, is too futuristic... If you love that idea of the futuristic ship, make a Futuristic Warplanes, and you can make your own planes too! And the new game, will get your own maps too! Anyways, thanks for reading, keep up the great work!!!!!',
       'The battles are extremely unfair, i was a level 5 with a harrier going up against a level 19 with a really  overpowered  jet, i could do nothing. Really unfair matchups that prevent people from progressing and enjoying the game.' ],

I don\'t get it cause I thought all my games save on Google or facebook all my other games are were there left off so please tell me I didnt waste all that money to start from the begining. I made this comment like 5 days ago I emailed provider of game waited 2 days then called Google only for them to tell me I need to get in touch with the game provider. Then I sent another email with purchases I did and my email and my phone number and nobody still has got back to me or commented on my review. So what do I do now my patience is running out. I even called the number that Google has provided for me for the provider and all I get is a voicemail which I cannot leave a voicemail.',

But when I\'m connected to Wi-Fi there\'s too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you\'ll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I\'m playing the game??!! It\'s too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.',
       'Well before I say my review, I would like to clear out a few of the negative reviews. There are not very many ads at all, in fact I barely ever even get any. Second, the controls don\'t suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.',
       'Nice game but became boring in just one day! 2 options of controls: Spin (Steering Wheel) and Tap. Tap option is easier than spin. You have to complete the damn missions but the coins are only available in Normal mode they aren\'t available in arena mode. For making easy highscore follow this!! 1. Switch your controls to tap mode. 2. Open Arena mode. 3. In the beginning take the U-turn. 4. Keep driving in the middle line i.e in between of lane 1 and lane 2. 5. Just keep driving on that small line dividing both lanes and you\'ll get your highscore until and unless you get tired, I\'ve made it to 3,887.  Normal mode is quite harder than the Arena but it provides coins and you\'ve to play it for getting your missions accomplished!  Thanks',
       'I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don\'t you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?',
       'It\'s stupid. It\'s really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn\'t turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked.',

Helpful tips to make it better, use the main gun outage glitch as part if the game, its brings more of a challenge!!!, don\'t give us a set of wing man\'s right off the bat, make us earn them or buy them....., little bit smaller ships in exchange for more ships, last but least scale down the size of the fire effects! PLEASE PLEASE, don\'t make easy for us!',

       'Can\'t upgrade ship any further. Can\'t  get a new ship. Level 40 boss doesn\'t fight back and stuck shooting at him. Main gun fires intermittently and there are no further levels. Great game for the first 30levels then that\'s it. Waste of time.',
       'It\'s still has some bugs on it. I got to last boss of the game and it doesn\'t  hit the boss or the won\'t even fire back or move. And it only the pets fire and the main weapon gets stuck of my ship. And because of that I can beat the game.',
       'This game is very simple, and easy to pick up and play! The only main issue I have is that the images are quite large. If it was zoomed out a bit, I\'d love it a lot more. I\'m on my way to clear all the levels soon!' ],

     [ 'I really do love the stories this game offers. I just wish the key and diamond system was better. I feel like I\'ve purposely passed up some great stories just to play through them quickly so I could get back to the current story I\'m really hooked on. Not to mention I\'ve put money into the game as well. But being on a budget, I\'m limited with what I can do. Sadly I think that is what will eventually make me stop playing such a great game. It\'s just too expensive in the end.',
       'I love this app! I just wish you could collect more than 2 keys at a time. Sometimes the chapters feel short and to only be able to accumulate 2 keys feels like its not enough. 3 to 5 would be way better! Its already a bummer to not have enough diamonds to unlock cool stuff. (unless you want to pay more.. Not everyone has money to spend on phone app games)',
       'I actually really like this game. It\'s fun, it\'s time killing, all that good stuff. But the diamonds are what really kill it.  You get one free diamond at the end of every chapter, which would be nice if it didn\'t cost 25+ diamonds to make a choice. So to get all the options required to have a truly full game play experiance you must buy the diamonds, which also wouldn\'t be a problem if they didn\'t cost so much. (For 5 dollars you get 60 diamonds which is ruffly 2 choices and really they should be lasting longer then that.) There isn\'t even the option to watch an add for more diamonds. Buying them is the only choice if you want to have those certain experiances. I understand that the company has to make money, I really do, but charging out the ass for something is not the way to do it. In short, I would love this game if it didn\'t cost an arm and a leg to play.',
       'I love it the most exciting story lines. I need you to write one more book about  Love Hacks it just ended suddenly. I have to know what happened to everyone if some of the other couples got married, had kids. Is some characters just single forever. YOU HAVE TO DO THIS SERIES JUSTICE. I FEEL SO HEARTBROKEN.',
       'Such a shame that the makers of this game are greedy. This is an awesome game with some great stories but unfortunately you need diamonds to make alot of decisions and you don\'t get given many as they want you to buy them.  So there\'s no way you can play the game properly. The diamonds are so over priced. If they were cheaper I might be inclined to buy them. So with regret I\'m going to have to delete this game. Greedy people thanks for ruining what could have been a fun game.',
       'There is a way to get me to give a five star review for this game.   Option 1: Convince Michael (2000 diamonds)  Option 2: Just leave it. üòÅ  The game and stories are great, the downside is to get more than half the story, especially the more interesting parts of the story, you have to spend diamonds.  You only receive one diamond for finishing a chapter but you can easily spend 40-50 in one chapter, which means to actually read these stories you have to spend money. I don\'t mind that the writers have done a good job, so I bought ¬£19 worth of diamonds but I only made it through 9 chapters of one 18 chapter book before I ran out.  Diamond cost for choices should be much lower, and there should definitely be another way to earn them - watching adverts or something.  Overall the stories are great but there is no way I can afford to spend a couple hundred pounds just to finish them.' ],

     [ 'Was an awesome game Very addictive game! Was well done.. until the update. Needs more pens and new themes as I have thousands of coins but nothing left to unlock. Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don\'t register as pineapple hits for the counters. There\'s a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it',
       'Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.',

Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.',

Which is good especially for me because I\'m not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game.',

     [ 'It is a normal car racing game with a very good graphics. There are four types of challenges. Elimination, one v/s one, test match and classic (6 people). The most hard task is to earn points so as to colour, repair and buy new cars. It takes so many gameplay for buying a higher model car with better class(C, B, A, S). It is a good game but it can\'t be completed without investing money. It\'s a good one for time pass and learning drift and nitro skills',
       'A very good for racers. The controls are butter smooth. Enjoyed while playing. But the main problem is that I was promised that I would get 20 gems after reviewing but promise wasn\'t kept. It\'s really difficult to earn gems/diamonds and also on the other hand most of the purchases are based on this. So...... Look into this.',
       'This game is killer considering the very small amount of data space is occupies,but you guys are really shooting yourselves in the foot with super lousy customer service.Half of my in app purchases have to be refunded to me by Google Play Store because i never receive them.Get it together guys. And actually answer an email once in a while.Also, you might want to consider CLOUD SAVE!!!!!!!',
       'Warning! DUMBEST GAME EVER it will say rate for 20 gems then when you have rated it nothing will appear. Graphics bad, controls bad, and worse you can\'t even upgrade your cars cause its hard to earn money. Nice try suckers',
       'I can\'t believe it. Too much ads on this game. It keep distracting me when I was still racing with others. Then, I was the latest racer to the end. But, the all the cars are seems looks like all are cartoon. But the gameplay seems it\'s ok for me.  Oh yes. How can I play multiplayer when the multiplayer botton cannot be pressed? Teach me how?!   Ok. I got my GTR and unlock multiplayer at 4/11/17. That\'s weird. But, I WANT TO PLAY MULTIPLAY WITH OTHERS AND THE LOCAL WIFI LIST IS ALL NOTHING. 3D games, can you multiply I to play with others, I always play with computer only.',
       'This was a fun game until I made a $30 in-app purchase and never received it! I tried contacting the developer by sending 4 different emails like instructed and never got a single response.They call that stealing where I\'m from! 2 months later still no response from the people who STOLE $30 from me in an in-app purchase. Google play no help either, why they let blatant thieves continue to do business with them is beyond me!' ],

Need more transport holes or vases and plants to hide behind. So many great comments, it\'s baffling to me.  Wish I  knew the tricks to get as far as a lot of the reviewers do.  Looks like it COULD BE A FUN GAME, but in present form, it\'s too challenging for me.  Bummer. Guess I\'ll have to uninstall it.',

       'Good fun and very addictive. I see people moaning about the adds üòß but what can you expect from a free game? You get an add pop up after about 5 puzzles and to be honest it is only for a few seconds....just close it if you don\'t want to see them.',
       'This game is outstanding. Love the graphics, simple to understand. Some appear quite easy and then you suddenly get a level that looks like it should be but has you scratching your head for AGES!!! Love it. I can live with the adverts, just wish i could put the phone down.',

     [ 'This is a wonderful, well made, fun game!  Also highly addictive.    Really enjoy it a lot.      With that said, the biggest downside, IMO, is that rewards are few, & far between, and there is no way to get gold bars without paying for them.  These become rather needed the further you get and for certain individual, and more difficult, "puzzles".  It can become too expensive to play (if one really want to get somewhere in this game).',
       'Why does this game keep freezing during play. I know this game has been on the play store for a long time now because I played it a year ago non-stop but now it is freezing. Come on dev\'s u have had plenty of time to work out the kinks. It shouldn\'t be freezing in the middle of play. Shame on u king dev\'s.',
       'I love the game, but i liked it more when the piggy bank had 100 gold bars. It was a fair price-amount report. Also, i would love to see more often the trick or treat and the win 14 challanges event. And yes, the new owl look is awful. Please change it back :-))',
       'Fun and addictive game.  I really like it.  The aim and control of the wand can be improved as it often misfires and the bubble is not where it was aimed for.  Great adventures and quests. I know longer get the daily award for some reason.  And you have to wait a long time for a new life (30 mins).',
       'Addictive but too rigged. The rules are inconsistent which spoils it a bit. Eg.  Sometimes the fairies burst one bubble of the same colour and sometimes all. There are other inconsistencies. The other irritation is noisy push notifications can\'t be turned off.',
       'Love this game. Would like some competition at some point. Also, I wish there were more challenges like the Halloween treats one. It was really fun. Not too sure about the latest updates though, the owls are almost camouflaged now. But great game!' ],

     [ 'Money pit. Only a few outcomes on any swing, most are just fly balls. You can literally throw 100% change ups down the middle and it\'s no different than actually trying to pitch. Swinging has no effect. If you level up your team at all the computer teams become massive all-stars that are unbeatable',
       'The game is super fun to play. I love that it is offline so you don\'t have to worry about data. There are some ads but they don\'t get in the way. My only complaint is that the batting mechanic seems a little off, you need to swing basically after the ball is already past you to get a hit. Took me a while to get the timing down. Overall great game though.',
       'Good game.  Great graphics.  Fun to play.  I dont have a  problem with saving my game progress.  With the last update yesterday, theres a glitch with 5he starting pitching. Its not going through the rotation. My number 1 starter has pitched 3 in a row. I change pitcher, exit game, save it, then load it up, and again my number 1 starter is in.... ???',
       'Good system for the league with all those stats and easy to get new player if you keep winning. One problem for free cp & card  is that it does not have any ads (installing 2 times, save cloud is ok and in app purchase is ok, just no ads at all). Idk if it is my network provider (3 mobile) blocked it since i don\'t use any vpn or ad blocking stuff. And i want cute speaker like the announcer in high school k≈çshien/mlb calling the batter name and position, but the most important is you don\'t make the pinch runner option!',
       'Love the game. Hard to read stats on gray background, especially on cell phones. White would be better, maybe. Also, where do you go to "equip" your team? Purchased a uniform change but can\'t find where to implement it.  But I am addicted to this fun game. Well done.',
       'For all the people saying too easy to get out. You must never have watched baseball in real life. This is how a game typically goes. People want it to be if,I swing and make contact, auto hit. Grow up. My small gripe with the game,is that the stats don\'t fully mean much. Its more realistic that a team woth lovwer skill can win but,sometimes,its,just,weird how often.' ],

     [ 'l was enjoying the game a lot and would have given it 5 stars. l spent a long time to get enough bricks to  build a level 7 home so dragons only needed 7 mins sleep.. NOW    only  the same 5 of my 30 dragons get out and this is making collecting bricks and healing power very slow. l have not seen all my green dragons and moon dragons( the hardest workers) for 2 days now. developers please help or l will stop playing. TY.',
       'I would love to give this game 5 stars but 99% of the ground I\'ve uncovered is covered by "treasure chests" and there\'s no way to get rid of them or contact the game makers for help. I\'ve completely run out of space and can\'t play anymore. The chests should disappear after 3 - 5 days if they\'re not opened.',
       'Love this game. Graphics are great and so much to do. Keeps me going for ages. Main concern and the reason I\'ve not rated 5 star is the time it takes to get each token. When some levels take 7 and it takes half a day to fill up it\'s a major pain. Then you do a level that needs 4 and the next also 4 it takes the p*ss. Would be great to have a higher limit without getting charged or for them to fill up quicker. If this was done I would rate 5 star all round.',
       'Playing this game makes me lose track of time. Wish we could buy the dragon egg chests with game coins.  That would be greatly helpful. Please consider this. Also would be great to transfer items from other levels back to the camp, like eggs, flowers, etc. Plz have this feature.Thanks. Plus would help if there was a set button to hit to exit the game. I am finding it takes between a few to about 5 times to hit the back button on my tablet. Plz fix, would make things alot quicker.',
       '2/5 stars because the only way to play the game is by paying! You can either pay to remove "pay to open" boxes or they don\'t go away taking up all your space! It takes 1 hr for your chalices (energy) to refill only 1 and you only get 7. Love the concept of the game and it is very unique but make it so that people can actually play. Get sponsors, play some ads, have the boxes disappear after a certain amount of time, ANYYHING! This is b*lls*it and not everyone has money to throw away on games. Fix it or I keep the rating low.',
       'I really want to love this game but the time mechanics in it are just too much. An hour for one game token and most of the maps after the tutorials cost more than one token to play. I have to wait 3 hours to play one round? I really like this game, the merging mechanics are addicting and fun! I find my self between kicking myself for popping something early and getting excited for getting close to going just one more level up, but I almost have to literally forget about the game in order to get any sort of meaningful play time out of this game.' ],

       'The best guitar hero style app I\'ve found for mobile. Any guitar hero players will find this familiar and challenging enough on hard, and the included songs are well fretted, so you get the feel of actually playing the song. Its also butter smooth on my s8. The ads are not annoying, just a 5 second one between songs. Great work by the devs. Obviously old GH fans.',
       'Game is fun and all. But I\'m having a big problem with the ads the pop up which is fine and understandable but I cannot exit the ads unless I close the game fully which is hell since there is an ad every song and sometimes even just as the game opens so basically I can not play the game, I don\'t know if this happens to anyone else but its really annoying and impossible to play like that, I wish I could enjoy this game.',
       'It\'s quite simple for me to explain why I have it a 1*. Why, you say? Because it ain\'t challenging at all. But if this answer alone isn\'t enough, I\'ll get into more details. Even at the hardest difficulty, it\'s too easy. Adjusting speed is a good thing to include and all, but it\'s nothing new for a rhythm game like this. Local mode is even worse than classic mode. Its even more easier than classic, and like other "include-your-own-music" mode in other rhythm games; it sucks. Its a lot more inconsistent than classic mode, and it poses even less challenge. Not only is this game hardly challenging at all, you only have less than TEN songs to choose from in classic mode. And none of them are challenging at all.',

Add new weapons pets make the lvl higher because it does get boring after a while just doing the same thing over and over and in PvP its vsing bots not real players its there ACC\'s but not them controlling them  add new roles. you can do so much to make this game so much better  like add a PvP that guilds vs guilds like 10v10 or 5v5 somethink like that would be so cool or a story mode to would be great. Anyways hope you would add something like this one day anyways great job on game',

How easy? well as a mage i just stand still in front of the face of monsters and hold the attacking button yet they can barely do anything about me. If u want general rouge like difficulty, skip this one. Im going to do that anyways.',

     [ 'I played this a while back and decided to come back and see if anything had changed and it sure did. There have been several updates that I love (the new maps, new sharks, equipment, etc.) and I\'m glad I\'m playing it now. In game currency price for items has been balanced out which I love and the missions system is much better now. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes progression-based time-killing games like Hungry Shark World.',
       'Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it\'s so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I\'ve had to start all over again... but the fun continues!',
       'Do not upgrade your Sharks.  The bigger the shark, the more difficult it is to play.  Big sharks have more drain on health and hunger, causing you to die more frequently. Impassable areas due to size of !! shark and less fishes to eat when health gets low.  Not to mention how slow these big sharks move!  The more you spend on bigger sharks, the less fun you\'ll have.',
       'This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don\'t play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don\'t make us wait foreverrrr!',
       'I\'ve had to start this game all over from the very beginning 3 times. After working hard to get all the way to the top sharks, the app will suddenly refuse to connect to your Facebook account and want you to start a whole new game. Waste of time. Very frustrating. Not enjoyable at all. Find a game that\'s enjoyable. This one is definitely not fun.',
       'It\'s a fun game and I\'m enjoying it. However, I\'ve come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.' ],

     [ 'With an easy guide, on \'How to play\'. Once you get going its great fun. Dare I say quite addictive. Fantastic animations. Amazing back ground music. Plus, no app freezes either.  Its an \'A‚òÜ\' from me at least.  Only, what would be a great idea. Is all the piggy bank jewels you build up, should be awarded for your hard efforts. Should not have to buy them back.  Only purchase jewels when desperate.',
       'Ok.....we need an aquarium just for the holiday\'s.  I cleaned out one aquarium and that\'s all I have in there is the holidays.  After this session I\'ll probably save one just for Christmas itself.  Love the unlimited times! Keep the surprises coming!! I don\'t like so many clocks in one game and the "timed" games are insane! It is definitely challenging.  I play several times a day if possible.',
       'Great game but would love it more if it kept track of when you bought something . Like a little quantity number in the corner after you purchase a fish or decorations. Hard to save up to buy things for guests, sucks when you buy something you already have when trying to complete a task. Other then that it\'s a great game lol I enjoy playing it.',
       'Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I\'m 32 and play this often so it\'s not just for kids . Give it a try it\'s very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen üòâ',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.',
       'Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can\'t do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!' ],

     [ 'One of the best wwe games.. even better than immortals.. the difficulty level is always fair when competing with online rivals... gaining loot boxes is also perfect and  not very difficult... I obviously made some In app purchases so I could compete well... just wish to open a loot box and get 1 four star wrestler... things would get awesome I don\'t mind paying for it as well..',
       'So honestly i love most of this game. However, you can notice that when gathering loot chests, there is a normal wheel of fortune scenario, with a decipherable pattern. However, if you look closely the game changes the options on the wheel if you come close to getting one of the better options. So instead of getting a 4 star superstar in big bundles you will get the crappiest 2 star superstar and in others you will get 150 cash insteadof a superstar. Ita ridiculous because that means that how much ever money you spend on the game, they rig it so you cannot win the bigger items.',
       'reliance I bought a real money loot bundle which was for 76 dhs (UAE currency)but I did not get the loot cases. Also checked my loot place but nothing was there and also restarted the game but nothing was there.. Simply wasted money.so after that I deleted the game forever.also the game is having a lot of bugs like game freeze,network issue,sometime showing black screen,etc.',
       'I like the new update.the graphics of the chamber is very nice. My suggestion is that you can improve its value by adding entrance to the players or at least play their theme song after the game. I\'m tired of listening to the same music again and again. Plz do these changes as fast as possible. Thank you.',

     [ 'So I\'ve won around 100 battles so far. Enjoying the game. Ready to see where this game is taken. I feel updates could make this unto the best mobile music game on the playstore. It\'s nice to always be able to recharge your stamina through ads. I hope updates come and also limited decals. One drawback and a fix needed is losing the stuff you paid for when you change the item.',
       'Would be better if you were placed in matched based not only on your discs but also on the levels of your band. I shouldn\'t get a perfect score and STILL lose because their passive is higher than mine but they made more mistakes. Also maybe up the sensitivity? it seems like the system doesn\'t quite pick up on my tapping  which causes me to miss notes. Graphics are nice and the spin offs are good.',
       'This game is pretty addicting the songs are short & sweet, the songs are not original songs but have a similar sound to the original ones, and are named differently too. The only thing that kinda sucks are the ads which you have to pay to remove & that the band runs on stamina. So if your band runs out of stamina you have to wait several minutes before you could play again but other than that I really like it and it has that guitar hero feeling to it ..',
       'What happens when you miss a note??? NOTHING. the song keeps playing perfectly so what then is the point of playing the game correctly if there is no penalty on the song quality? No point besides screen shaking smh. Make it like the console version where you hear a bad note.',
       'I can never watch a video for more stamina and everytime I try to collect the 2x reward money by watching the video the game just glitches out on me. I would have so much more without the flaw. I want to make in-app purchases but this deters me for sure. UPDATE!',
       'Game is really fun. The ads for other game aren\'t cool if you let your kids play the game. Especially it having an E rating. That is unacceptable. I understand ads is why it\'s free  but don\'t have 14+ rated game ads for an E game. Glad I didn\'t let my kids play this yet' ],

I do not recommend this app.  This is a fun game - one you can pick up for a few minutes, or for an hour. I played it before the challenge modes and was still entertained. The ease of use combined with incresing intensity keeps you very engaged. Heres the catch - TOO MANY ADS!   I paid the $3 for an "no ads" experience, only to encounter the same ads that appear in game and after every round, and on screen. The only thing paying for it does is shorten the ad run time, so you can close them after about 5-10 seconds. I am not pleased about this and would not have paid for it if I had known.   Buyers beware...',

     [ 'Great game. Loving it. I noticed when you go into the Alter, there is a note telling you your capacity limit at the bottom but in the Mana gem screen it doesn\'t tell you. Are you able to add this feature? I can never remember my mana creating limit.  If you make more mana than can fit in your mana storage line, you lose the excess.',
       'AWESOME!!! Originally, I was very reluctant to download this becuase I though it was going to be where you just sit and watch your character do everything for you. I HATE those types of games... This however is actually how I was really hoping it would turn out to be! You can move freely! The levels are linear and its not very open, but thats okay! You see each piece of equipment on your character when you wear it, which is absolutely essential to me! I will not play a game where my appearance does not change, so this has all in all met my expectations! Another RPG worthy of my collection! Thank you!!!',

       'Every time there\'s an update you get thrown backwards X 10! I was movin along at a steady pace but now since the update I havent been able to advance 1 area! Even the arena battles arent winnable. Not fun at all anymore. This coming from someone who played religiously every day for 6 months or longer üëé',
       'Think I\'m the same as most people who have been playing for a long time. With the new update its just to much of a un-enjoyable grind for nothing when for all we know the game will update again and we\'ll be set back and have to grind all over again.',

     [ 'What a good little game. Nothing special in the graphics department but it delivers on everything it says and shows. After playing for a little while I couldn\'t help but feel like I was waiting for a little bald guy to want to eat me if I got an answer wrong, "cans we eats it precious". Jokes and riddles. Very good game. Well done.',
       'Game is really good specially for kids . Makes them think. Only bad part of this game is the list in answers.. they are already displayed. This makes the game very easy. It would make an awesome game if user had to enter the answers.. hope the developers fix this!',
       'Way TOO MANY adds. It\'s more a front end for advertising & the questions are way to simple to the point of being inane. Mildly entertaining if you like to feel smart but only a diversion for a matter of minutes. Personally I much rather apps where for a payment you can remove the adds but this isn\'t one!',
       'The concept is cool and the riddles are fun but I dislike that it gives you four options to choose from and most of the time, it makes it very obvious what the right answer is. I would love this if it let you type in your answer or give you a section similar to hangman and you can fill in the letters for your guess. That way it actually makes you think and figure out the riddles instead of picking the word you think or know fits best. I also can\'t stand how many ads pop up during a game so simple like this. If they limited the ads and changed the layout and used a different font style I think it would highly imporove the game. But that\'s just my opinion so don\'t let this review stop you from trying it for yourself. I just think a little more time and effort could\'ve gone a long way for this app.',
       'I found "500 Riddles" to be somewhat misleading.  After the first few levels the riddles started to repeat. (Either the exact same riddle or the same riddle worded differently) Also grammar and punctuation errors in the riddles started to get annoying. But overall I did enjoy the program.',
       'The game could use a few fixes. Sometimes when you touch a level it is unresponsive. The stage count is weird. When you completed all stages of a level it says 9/10. Please fix this the overall game isn\'t bad but these are very easy no brainer fixes.' ],

Now, when i boot up the game, it just freezes when i click on anything. My shop tries to open but just goes to a black screen and freezes. I will try to play for a few more days, but if i cant play by the end of the weekend, i will be deleting the game.',
       'What is wrong with the newest update? I can\'t acquire my item from the switch shop. Every time I click on get item, the black screen goes to the top left of the screen. And I can see the normal background picture. When that happens I have to close the game and reset. I\'ve tried to get the item 20 times and it does that every time.',
       'Game is great but every time I go to the pawn shop now my screen goes black so I\'m stuck and can\'t really play.  Need some assistance, don\'t want to have to delete and start over.  My wife had the same problem on the other bid wars app and lost everything.',
       'Fun game to play but 2 issues.  1 - if someone bids a hair before you, you make a double bid when you might not want to.  2.  What is the point of Mutts market?  Everytime I get screwed.  Don\'t use it as 6 or 7 items in a row, my item returns lesser value.',
       'Great game, fun to play, just waiti g for an update now.  Great time killer. Only thing is after i bought mutts store i put an item up for exchange and now everytime i go to get the item the game freezes up in mutts exchange, please fix otherwise great game guys',

Be it on the town or at the battle field. But so that it wont be used as a means of scape, it should have a casting time to ride the mount. Over all it is the best game there is. Love it to the moon and back! =)',
       'This game is awesome actually but the developer keep opening new servers instead of merge the server. So many people choose to stop to play Seal because of this since less people play in most server. So please don\'t waste your money and time to play it. You cannot transfer your character to other servers. You need to start from begining. This make the overall experience becoming so bad.',

Or can i bind with other account? Pls help me. Coz i change use 2 phones.. And the other one always run off battery. Thanks',
       'I love this game, it\'s so addicting. But I only gave it 4 stars because we have too many servers. I highly suggest to not add many servers and just fix the older ones because the players in older servers are getting fewer. Like, I\'m in S105, and it\'s not been a week but there\'s already another server? And it\'s draining players. Please stop adding servers so some servers will have players too.',
       'I really loved this game. Its content its gameplay indeed it is really my taste. However, i hope that we can transfer into other servers without restarting ones account. As well as the timing system of each events sometimes its not exact. Hope you guys work on it to make this GAME BETTER. Pleaseeeeeeeeee!!!!!!',
       'Please help retrieve my money. I buy 4,500 diamonds but I haven\'t received the items but I\'ve already debited 2,845.   Here\'s my account details kindly check my old transaction.

     [ 'Awesome .game . I like this game . Best game ever of fight and this is game of superheroes fight. So this is the best game . We get champ 4*  and tier 4 cataystal easily . This is cool for upgrade champ. But this game has a one problem. It is very hard to get colourful tier 4 cataystal like red blue , pink etc. So please tell me how i get tier 4 colourful cataystal easily  . And please join a quest in event mode  of tier 4 colourful cataystal by day by day . Like monday =tier 4red cataystal , tuesday = tier 4 green cataystal etc. Please solve my problem of tier 4 colourful cataystal . Please please . This is the best game ever . Thank u . U can search my id in this game .spidy rajat . My team rating is low . I m playing this game about 10 month but still i dont have 2 colourful tier 4 cataystal . Please please . I hope u can solve our problem . Thank u . This is best game ever .and give me a review . Thank u',
       'I love the game and the vast amount of playable characters, however the sound effects overall aren\'t great but the gameplay is very good. One problem I do have however is that there are in models (such as thanos and Kang) but you can\'t play as them. Personally thanos is easily my favorite marvel character and the fact that I can\'t use him is a little upsetting. But overall its a great game with monthly updates and great new characters! Can\'t wait for more!',
       'I am using vivo v5 plus.. Game is running smoothly but after current Android update all apps are running good except mcoc.  After one or 2 fights or after 5 to 10min of login, it\'s shows connectivity problem.  Kindly give right patch...  I will give you 5/5',
       'Quality game only a few issues. Premium crystals need a higher rate of 3 and 4 stars, ive played 3 years and never had higher than a 2 star drop, only ever had 3/4* from 3/4*crystals. Also golden Crystal should drop more than 2400 minimum. Tier 4 class catalysts need to be easier to obtain  Awakening gems could be easier to get aswell. Also odin, beta rey bill, fantastic 4, more xmen',
       'Used to be my favorite game. Now there are so many bugs and glitches that they refuse to fix... Makes me think that the lag /delay and glitches are intentional. They have been continuous ongoing for years. So they are either intentional or everyone at Kabam is completely incompetent. They try hard to keep the game fresh with new characters and quests but would be so much better to fix the game before adding to it. The game is unplayable most times',
       'Aftwr the last update I can\'t open the application. It goes to a black screen and thats here it stays.  If this should go on and I lose my rewards because of this I will no longer invest or ppay this game, because wht is the se to play a game 6 months or more just to just lose the one thing you really wanted to get.' ],

     [ 'Graphics are awesome, but the game itself is very monotonous. You can fall asleep waiting for something to change and make it more exciting. When a change such as an added bonus does come (bomb or a rainbow bubble) you realize that it wasn\'t worth the 20 or 30 levels you just wasted your time on. Progressive enticing events need to happen more quickly.',
       'Game is good without any aproblem it do works. It\'s not a game a advertising app, isn\'t this too much hance i know you developers make money on the game but just because of this much ennoying adds when people uninstall this app you won\'t be able to make anything out of your effort can you???',
       'On level 19 I scored three stars bit it shows only two. Aside from that, no other complaints... YET. I will say thank you, though, for not aggressively pushing ads, pushing to pay to extend the aim line. So far, its amusingüòÅ',
       'This is a really fun game but my  my concerns are that when I have no balls left, for me it doesn\'t have the option to play a video to earn more but for my brother it does therefore it makes me start all over again. The other concern is that when I use a bomb for the chest it takes away a ball for example I have 12 balls when I use the bomb from the chest, I get 11 balls left which it doesn\'t do that for my brother. I hope you can fix this.',
       'I thought the levels would be more difficult by now I\'m on 143 at the moment. I enjoy the game but I\'m getting a bit bored with the easiest of challenges and without having to use the help button . I hope the game will  get more challenging soon.   Grandson aged 5 will like playing this game.',
       'I like that you don\'t have to pay for the Assistance or no stuff on the game to help you advance like the Hammers the ball that matches any color different stuff like that you just got to watch the ads which is fine with me at least it doesn\'t cost you a fortune to play I like the color on the graphics are very bright and colorful and good for children to play no violent content to it whatsoever great game for everyone across the board' ],

     [ 'I got to level 7 on big fish casino to get 60 gold. yet when I went back to reap my rewards I was startled! then my feeling of "startled-ness" changed to one of despair. For when I went back I realized I wasted all that time going to level 7 on big fish games and instead of having 60 gems I have 60 minutes of wasted time. Great game. Horrible reward system. I will rate the game 5 like it should be when I receive 60 gold. Unfortunately I like the game so I will continue to playing. I am level 27 after all.',
       'prices in the game are not well distributed. you can unlock new players only with gold but gold is obtained so hard. on the other hand, money is useless after some point. you can only use upgrading players but it also requires gold. you can obtain golds with watching ads and playing every tournament over and over again to level up and gain gold but after some point you cannot unlock new players (therefore cannot unlock new tournaments) because it requires so much gold. the game forces you to buy golds. fun game but only a short period of time',
       'First off Great Game! It\'s really fun to play and pass the time. The only issue I have is how quickly the guys run out of energy. The amount of "water" they need is a little high. Other then that it really is a Great Game!',
       'Addicting ha. But you should be able to edit stuff like amount of points needed. Or more team names, I face the same lame teams  all the time.',
       'Thanks      Ok I\'ll be right over to the house and I will get you the information you requested and I have to go to the store and I will be there at school today and tomorrow so I will kick your day going to be a little more than I do',

     [ 'Such a shame. The game is great, really enjoyed the concept however it is a prime example of how monetisation strategy can ruin a game. Gems too difficult to earn without buying them, and purposely easy to accidentally spend them. Too many ads too. I\'d rather have paid for the game. Deleted it after a  day or so.',
       'Not What It Used To Be  The second to last update I did for this app switched the aim of the ball to slightly off from where you point it. So now have to compensate (guess a bit) when you\'re aiming which makes play more challenging.  Likewise, levels beyond about 440 are becoming impossible to beat w/o saving like a weeks with of bonuses to use on each level. Beating one level a week is hardly fun anymore! I may be uninstalling this app soon.',
       'Game has so much potential and is a blast. I\'m giving it a bad rating because gems are insanely expensive and they have so many buttons to hit to "use 200 gems to remove 3 lines" as one example or another to lose 200 by placing the button right above the back button on a phone. Super lame move on devs to intentionally take insanely expensive gems from us by mistake. No confirmation or anything, just boom, gone. Lacks ethics to say the least rinow',
       'Games fine. I refuse to rate a game well when it\'s annoying ads start pushing political agenda against gun owners. Will go elsewhere',
       'Great game.   But one of the adverts is a virus.   The IG Academy advert wrecked my game and now my phone\'s being a pain in the ass',
       'I really this game, plenty of challenging levels, very addictive for sure. I just got a new phone and was bummed to have to start all over (had gotten to level 360) but my new phone came with an updated/better version so now I\'m stoked on it all over again. Sometimes I wanna quit this game but I never do.' ],

     [ 'Everything is about awesome in this case. Only thing is it does not connect to the internet without a wi-fi connection. While that is useful and preferable for a stable online gameplay, it is just almost useless in places like India. Here, apart from a few people, almost everyone uses mobile data for gaming. So I request you to please allow only connectivity with mobile data. I myself use mobile data and I installed the game solely for multiplayer purpose. Other than that, I would say the game is quite enjoyable.',
       'This will be the one and final rating and I am sticking to this rate I gave. I love it, the game challenges me and my skills. I love that its social and teaches people how to be friendly with one another, and teaches people how to be great on a team and work together as a team, and teaches people the value of helping others, and it teaches people to be great individuality, and it teaches people justice and independence. I give the  game 5 stars one more thing I  don\'t know how to  change my character for the campaign mode can someone  tell me how.',
       'This game is ok but it should take more aspects from N.O.V.A 3 Freedon edition since that was the best app in the series. Not to mention it would be awesome if N.O.V.A 3 freedom edition was in the play store since it offers more than what nova legacy is showing.Plus,the N.O.V.A series used to be awesome and enjoyable for me but now I\'m just wondering why? Also the new "update" technically plays the game for you which defeats the purpose of the shooting genre!',
       'Very good as a game. I would have rated 5 stars if not for just 1 problem . Whenever I watch a video ad for gifts, the game restarts from the Gameloft screen and stays like that unless I force close the game and start over again . And neither do I receive the gifts. I\'ve already watched around 5 ads but haven\'t received anything.',
       'Can\'t play Multi-player without WiFi. I mean like come on, Blitz Brigade can be played without WiFi, Then why not this. I can\'t even connect to Facebook without WiFi....... I request Gameloft to make this game\'s Multi-player without WiFi so that we can play it with 3G or 4G. I can\'t ask for Hotspot every time to just play Multi-player for a few hours!! Or else the game is awesome!!',
       'It is really cool, but the legendary weapon cards are too tough to get and I don\'t like the automatic shooting system. And add a bit of N.O.V.A 3 effects as it was really. Outstanding and this game also is cool but only text is visible while talking so add  some voices for people in the game.' ],

     [ 'Great game, no build waiting times, lots of strategy, a mix of tower defense and rts. Really is a game with a lot of effort put into it from non greedy devs. Well created hiker games. One small point that a future update could sort out is making a feature to create the same bandits again. Rather than manually going in and picking them again. And if you have spares, to automatically put them in place. Also duplicates seem to have no purpose as of yet....',
       'At first I got a clash of clan type vibe due to some mechanic like throphies and graphics. But the game is widely different and in a fresh new way. It\'s basically tower defense where you play both the defender and attacker roles which is done very well.',
       'Love mini games, also building tokens to obtain chests... please keep updates coming! And would love to zoom in more but I dig the overall quality of the game... when can I use my convoy to attack towns and castles?!?! Later on in the game?? Thanks!! And I would buy more gems if the price was reduced... fyi',
       'It was a really great game at first. It\'s a good strategy game like clash of clans where you try to beat 100% of an enemy\'s troops and vice versa where you gotta try to build up your troops (cavalry) so they don\'t take your trophies.  However, it is really difficult to get gold and the game really tempts you to buy game packs or in game currency. Most players in the game are really leveled up too, so it\'s really difficult to move up...  It\'s an addicting game, but I stopped playing because I know I was going to end up blowing my money on it eventually. You will too as soon as you get hooked on it, so just beware.',
       'Seriously... The recent update... Seriously, a major disaster! MAJOR BATTERY CONSUMPTION! My battery drained like craaaaaazy while playing on the new updated version! Please oh please fix it.. I\'ll be giving you a full 5 ‚ú® for fixing this issue. Playing on Huawei P10 Plus by the way..',
       'This game is  great and is very addictive. The gameplay is smooth and battles are amazing. The only problem that I face is that it never matches me with people with same power in ambush mode.Most of the convoys are always powerful than me. Please do something on this issue' ],

     [ 'Everything costs money. You\'ll be playing then run out of grenades. That\'ll be 30g. Don\'t have that? Well enjoy losing until you figure out a way to win. Love this game though. Made a purchase right off for a gun. Then I saw how much grinding is involved for the upgrades. The jump between a level 2 and 3 upgrade? Then the outfits, 2nd and 3rd weapons. Man. Sorry no thank you. This shooter however is very fun but the paywall is so well thought out I am not prepared to drop that kind of money. Learned my lesson losing 1k to Megopolis.',
       'I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn\'t have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn\'t get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren\'t vigilant of their customers and don\'t take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.',
       'Great game with a lot of potential.... There can be so many more additions to make this fps better. More grenade varieties? A spectator mode? Clan levels that allow more players to join when we reacher higher levels? Gun balancing changes? I feel like the Cerberus should be buffed. It is expensive, and the 3 shots at once doesn\'t allow for many attempts for kills. Adventure mode for more gunbucks? Death match option? Allowing us to pick the map? I understand the game is fairly new, so keep on adding changes and new improvements. Thanks for listening!',
       'I REALY LOVE this game but the only thing is that I\'m on level 10 and when ever I play in a battle and win I only get 200 gun bucks. PLZ can I have money transported to my account.My name is PRO_ADMIN.I would REALY HAPPY if you doüòï.By the way this is also for my FAMILY and they would love it if you do ):  . I am only 10 and I know I\'m asking for you to do a big thing but my family would really be happyüòä.My brother\'s acount is PROGAMER and he is only 6. PLZ if you don\'t reply or do something then it\'s ok ):  .',
       'Game is really tooo gud, graphics also nice n smooth controls but u guys released only one game mode(Team death match), but in lot of fps games they provided free for all, bomb mode, Flag capture n many more modes.. If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games üòÄ n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area.',
       'Lunar fest was a bummer.  You had to spend money if you weren\'t available often. I would appreciate not being spawned into a game on a team already losing by half the score needed. Perhaps set matches with people of similar win percentage so you don\'t constantly end up with people who can\'t see what the other team is doing (patterns are pretty easy to see if you aren\'t slow).' ],

     [ 'Great graphics with minimum config,controls are awesome  and it has dive button,can jump thru walls and climb windows,way better than the other survival games on phone,it has bullet physics! the only thing im concerned about is The lagging when shoorting from far distances,and id like to suggest a configuration for the graphics to adjust compatibilty . Thank you for this game 5stars! Your doing just great devs!',
       'there are some bugs, that i knew the player is in the building and in his/her phone, but in my phone the player just float in the air its good for me to kill that player, but its not good if the player was me.  fix the building.  add or fix some features like: 1. the distance of the safezone in the mini map. 2. after automaticaly open the door, please make it close automaticaly too. 3. make the control wheel just by move the camera not by the direction arrow. 4. foot step is just too small. 5. make a gun fire radar. 6. make the animation of the character more realistic.  its ok to me if the update makes the game become 500 mb bigger than previous version.  i love this game. its run nicely in my phone.',
       'Everything is cool about this game! I love the Smoothness, the gameplay, the addictiveness, and the graphic is better then FreeFire too üòÅ... But there are something that can improve this game more... The graphics is "Ok" but not "Great"... Fix more bugs too... And add more breaking physics... And improve the gameplay a little bit more. Overall the game is Fun, addictive, smooth and simple üëåüëåüëå',
       'need team voice chat and its super perfect.... anyone wants to try new battle royale? then try this... I think it might\'ve been better than Rules Of Survival... this game is worth it..... it also lets you to shoot while your friends is driving a vehicle..well, only for duo or squad mode obviously....but what\'s more, you can actually pilot a helicopter..... nice...',
       'Hey, umm please reply! I\'d really love to play this game. I really think this is better than Ros and freefire but I cant play it. Everytime I log in and it starts to load it will say "Poor internet connection, please reconnect." why is it like that? I got 4 bars of the wifi. My wifi is fast. please fix it or tell me what to do cuz I really really really wanted to play this game so bad.',
       'Sad. The game sucks. Why? Because it wont even let me in. It said something about my internet connection being poor and I have to reconnect it. It is working just fine, I suppose this might be an issue for the developers to fix. Please fix as soon as possible.' ],

     [ 'This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further.',

My big fingers cause me to select the incorrect letter occasionally and then I get the wrong answer and my streak is reset. Please correct this.',

It is wonderful for me because there is not a single problem. It doesn\'t seem to be bad for me i  meant the game was not at all bad and it was particularly different from some of the reviews means some people said this game this and that but it doesn\'t seem to me the same thing because each of us has a different choice but according, to me it was great, amazing, wonderful game.

So I hit "solve" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I\'ve recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you\'ve ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?',

     [ 'A great game many things to do. Very fun if you like dragon ball. Can be a little to hard if you don\'t want to buy dragon stones. I don\'t really know where else to write this but I have been having a problem with the evil emperor of the universe event. At the end of the event it says it gave me medals and in inventory it says I have more than enough medals, but when I go to awaken a character it says I don\'t have any. Please help',
       'I\'ve been playing this game since it first came out I even have a jp account this game is by far the greatest of all time that I myself have ever played. With this game I get to use some of my favorite characters of all time and one of my most recent acquired cards Goku Black rose which is also my favorite villain of all time. This game gives great experience and fun to whomever is the player. Spectacular Game Bandai! I can\'t wait to summon on the new super vegito banner wish me luck:).',
       'Somethings that would be nice LR reverse medals that revert LR\'s to thier base form so you can unlock thier potential easier. More ways to unlock medals like maybe some kind special treasurer where you can juts buy any medals. More LR\'s. There are far to many borly\'s so plz stop adding more. These are just a few nitpics but I like the game',
       'The Game is amazing . No glitches. ,story line fits perfectly,  there is nothing wrong with the in game and the gameplay of it. The only trouble I am having recently all day is that the downloading on the recent update is not workibg. Im standing right next to my internet box and it says my internet is Excellent. But every time i try to download this game it is just saying. "Download Fail" Please fix',
       'I\'ve been playing on and off since the 2nd year anniversary. All around this game is awesome.  I would love more ways to grind for dragon stones tho. I\'m happy to pay for them when i can but working for them is always better.  I have a couple requests. Since you\'re bringing back old events. Can we have the one for Epic Battle! Arise, Otherworld Challengers medals. I would love to finally dokkan awaken super saiyan goku (angel) (super kaioken)  Also, is there a way we could get notifications when certain items like medals are on sale/ in Baba\'s shop?',
       'Dear bandai namco i hope you read my review. Recently a new data was available for loading although my network was stable and the app was updated instead of using 800 mb of data it still requires much more data. I don\'t know how much data will it require please fix this as i am not able to play this game' ],

It doesn\'t resister some of the moves you make or it\'s lagging and when you smash the minions they should fly away and not stick to the screen for ten seconds so you can\'t see what\'s coming next. Just stop cheating! Don\'t take 20hours to give the necessary tools when doing a double task in the jelly lab.',

And why do you Have to watch an ad to get free revives, get some tokens, refill the Battery for the special Mission and to open the green and blue prize pod AND to Double bananas you collect? GREAT GAME I JUST HATE THE ADS.',

It\'s less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed.',

     [ 'It\'s a good game but I\'m still giving it 3 stars for two reasons:  1) Sometimes the shot you take doesn\'t get synced so even if you hit a 12 it will show a 0.  2) There are a lot of bots in the game. Often you will come across players with incredible records like 95% wins, yet they can\'t hit more than an 8 even once. If I enter Online Mode I want to play against real players, not AI.',
       'It\'s not bad, but you will have to play for about 3 years before you can use the female character.  Also, after the first 2 levels your bow will no longer work so you will have to buy a new bow. Problem is you are going to find yourself several thousand dollars short so you will have to keep replaying the same levels or spend actual cash.',

This game could be a good practice for people that just like to play these games, you know?',
       'I like this game, but when you do the offers to get the dozer dollars; I never got my dozer $ which help get bonuses. Very bad business. I\'m owed a lot off dozer money! I\'d give 5 stars if they had follow through. I download the games they say complete but there is no one to email a claim to. It\'s a dead end. Very unhappy',

I even sent feed back about this issue and never received a reply. What a rip off! Why have the option if they don\'t honor it?',
       'Got this app to get something for a different game but I\'m giving up because it will take too long. Constant ads in the middle of gameplay ruin this game. I understand having ads but there are way too many and they pop up in inconvenient times.',

What REALLY ticks me off is that Ive spent REAL MONEY in this game!!! I refuse to start over. I literally played 24-7.  So unfortunately I\'ve uninstalled it.  If this didnt happen I would of gave it 5 stars. Every 1 in my house has UNISTALLED!' ],

     [ 'Amazing game, great time-killer. I discovered a game breaker: if you go into the settings after you die, the number of coins you got in that level, [the number in the brackets] becomes equal to the total number of coins. Keep going back and forth into the settings, and the game will eventually ask if you want to triple the coins by watching a video. Instead of tripling the number of coins you got in that level, the number of total coins you have gets tripled.  Instantly triple your wallet every run.  I want the devs to see this and see if they can patch it because I really like this game and I want the coins I earn to be legit.  Thanks for your time, Mike C.',
       'It has a progression system, but it\'s completely worthless. The only reason to try to win belts is to get weapons that serve no purpose. You can win most of them by paying 200 coins and getting a random one, but you can, for some odd reason, get duplicates. Not to mention the fact that coin combos actually do nothing, not even useless cosmetic items, nothing. I think adding function to the weapons (e.g. Making long swords slightly longer range or making small weapons quicker) could add more depth and more of a reason to play the game. Overall: It\'s a good timekiller.',
       'Great game. Best for killing time. Great concept. Need to add a  counter for counting the number of people killed, otherwise awesome. Also there is not much incentive to play to win belts. Make playing with boss again free. Add new opponents (not bosses but the minions) . Make the game a little less challenging. Also remove the brief stun completely',
       'Really fun game. Nice graphics and simple controls. More depth to combat system would be nice. There is no point in achieving coin combos. It does not affect the amount of coins won. Add a multiplier for coin combos, as well as a score multiplier for chaining combos together without missing enemies or coins. Don\'t allow duplicate items to be won. Very annoying to grind and grind for coins, only to get a duplicate you can\'t do anything with. Lastly, an option to pay to disable ads would be nice.',
       'Good game. Though it could be better. Make range on weapons and protection when you have armor on. Then you should be able to unlock new settings besides the train. Multiplayer would be cool. Another (and the last) thing you could implement is a way for you to go back and beat the bosses you defeated already to earn money. Despite all the flaws I\'ve stated, it\'s a good game and time killer.',
       'The game gives you an unskippable mission to get kills with a certain type of weapon and then will never give you that weapon. I\'ve opened over 100 chests and never got a two handed sword, so my options are pay real money for the the weapon (what they want) or delete this cancer app. I get you have to make money but there are better ways than stopping all progression and ruining the fun. Overall good game 6.7/10' ],

       'This game got to a level where it predictes your every move and block you before you play. I mean the whole point of chekers is you capitalise on your opponents error which they are bound to make. Playing a computer however is very different because it already knows your possible move and then blocks you. So for that it\'s completely no fun once you get to a stage cos you basically can\'t win so only one thing left is to uninstall and look for another with a more fairer playground.',

     [ 'Goodday !I want to suggest something about sprint and walk ... ever played the game mini militia ? If not well the controls of joystick is good , if u control the joystick u move u walk ... u drag it further u fly... i suggest making it like that u walk when u move it but sprints when u extend dragging it more ... for more info try installing for a moment mini militia , i hope u make the controls like it ... its nice really promise',
       'Why is there an auto thing. Hate it pls make it more better and a little bit realistic like you move???and there\'s a sprint button???? u should just make it 1 button for walk and sprint.but special ways to unlock it like double tap on it. Bring Back Monster Squad!! Best Game',
       'halo , for me this FPS game is more interesting from the others. why ? because u can get a weapon with low price , can collect diamond easily ,still smooth on low spec mobile and this game really not buyforwin system . just the control , please improve it , make its more sensitive and specially the cheater ban them . I\'m sure there will be many gamers enjoying this game if the control more smoothly and importantly fairforwin no cheaters . thanks for listening !',

     [ 'Why I liked it? Because it\'s a simple game that doesn\'t make you addicted to phone but rather enjoy going forward focusing your attention entirely on your finger. What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven\'t listened to this game\'s. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I\'m entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.',
       'I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it\'s meant to be "skillfull" but thats harder than skillfull, you can\'t even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don\'t care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.',
       'This is game is ok if you are bored and don\'t know what to do.... however it becomes irritating after playing for a while.... overall its a nice game',

And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.',

     [ 'I LOVE this game My only complaint is in campaign mode it\'s said more worlds coming soon for YEARS!!! If they\'re not going to add a world eny time soon  they should at least change the coming soon part. But overall this is a good game and it seems like Cubic Games really care about what the consumers think.',
       'I think this game is brilliant. An absolute pleasure to play and I never get bored. This game should be voted one of the best games ever. Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can\'t join my sister and were only five levels apart.',
       'Absolutely great game ,but you made some far too powerful guns too accessible early in the game, so I went down two trophies after I ran into a bunch of wallet warriors. And for God\'s sakes put a more powerful gun at the end of the campaign, I worked my ass off and it wasn\'t worth it. Other than that large rant, I love it so much and play it every day. Make exp,gold and diamond easier to obtain though.',
       'This game is so good! I have played this game when it was in its early stages, and it was pretty good. Now it has gotten even better than before, with lots of multiplayer game options and lots of weapons and gadgets to choose from. There is one problem, which is when I got this game about a month or two ago, the prices to upgrade guns were pretty low for coins but ok for gems, but now they are ok for coins and WAY TO MUCH for gems, so I ask of you developers to please decrease the amount of gems it takes to upgrade gem bought guns.',
       'It\'s a great game.... until you reach level 27, then there is a REDICULOUS difficulty curve. I was steadily climbing the tornament leaderboard, I was good, then I kept getting destroyed after hitting 27 with OP items and no gems to get the new weapons, because I had spent them leveling up my weapons and was out. What are you thinking? Lag, not double jumping, not firing when I need to, occasionally. How rediculous.',
       'Pretty fun game at first. That is until you go up against super duper P2W players. Yes you can pretty much grind out everything you want and get more powerul. But to get fully upgraded everything it would take someone a good year or so playing everyday. It\'s absolutely not fun when you go up against another player that has the best equipment and just running around the map executing everyone while completely ignoring all damage coming at them.' ],

We are approaching one month with no resolution. I also have a new problem. In the Gold Event - Upgrade Stage, within 10 minutes after the stage started, I upgraded my stronghold to lvl23, added research of Spirit Attack lvl10, and upgraded a farm to lvl22. It gave only 120,000 points to me for the event. The sh upgrade alone provides just over 200,000 power points. The event rules say we get 5 points for each 1 point of increased power. That should have been over 1,000,000 points for the sh upgrade alone. I lost stage reward points because of this defect.  I\'m really struggling here. Is there a way to contact someone directly?',
       'Dont waste your money.. that\'s all I will say. Especially now. Spend the dollar they make you to use some features and that\'s it.. I promise you will regret if you do. It also sends a bad message. Pay to play is out of hand. Nothing wrong with spending up to a hundred if you play lots it\'s only fair. You would spend that on a PlayStation or other game (as long as there is no advertising) But this is out of control. Just greed.. and not too mention, Pricing is not fair world wide. So many things to factor other then dollar rates.  In a nut shell if we all stop feeding in to it it will change. We start craving the games that are fair and more about skill and talent and dedication other then checkbook or credit card.. and a smart Gaming company will see an opportunity.  Precisely why here... after a month or two.. next to no kids are playing... not one person in my kingdom is under 18 and I think it\'s a lot higher then that lol.. not one kid.. why... can\'t afford it. Just get harassed and beat down.. can\'t even afford to run the poor kids lol. I admit I had to spend to continue to play.. had to.. and reward is a near dead kingdom,... bad investment.',
