     [ 'Overall this game is sick as hell. The graphics are on point and each character is so much fun to unlock. But, like others, I just wish the 3% possibility of getting a 5 star would be raised just a smidgen. Otherwise, this is a really cool game that literally has me playing for hours. 10/10 recommend.',
       'Good game if u liked the bleach anime. I don\'t recommend buying orbs price is ridiculous.  And packs misleading. Says $80 for 585 orbs .( 490+ 95 bonus orbs) . That\'s means only 585 orbs. If u thought that was gonna b over 1k orbs. Ur wrong. They got me lol. And no compensation :(',
       'Great game for bleach lovers... But come on... Just spent around 5000 orbs trying to get a grimmjow and nothing... Just a bunch of repeated useless things... And every time there\'s a new upload I just spend hours trying to get it... Kinda losing patience here',
       'Drop rates for 5* could be better. I\'m not saying give them away, but 3% ? For veteran players who have to buy orbs, that makes for a lot of discouraging multis. Gameplay is awesome , and the guild addition has brought life back to the game',
       'Love the anime? Now love the game! Only issue is it\'s a bit hard on older phones as I get killed in raids being unable to control my character due to frame lag and complete freezes, which dont allow me to dodge or use strong attacks to avoid damage. Plz allow.for this in future updates. Moto G3 running latest android',

       'Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won\'t reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.',
       'The game starts off good in the first couple levels. But once you start getting to the faster cars, it becomes way harder to keep up with the cars PR points, to get to better races. Unless you spend real money to get the parts. One question I do have. Is about the blackridge rivals. Why put some one with a car at a way higher level against a person who\'s car isn\'t even close to the car at a high level, and one more thing... make the races longer. 20 seconds a race isn\'t fun at all. Thinking with the name "Need For Speed". You guys would of done a lot better. The only thing that I seem to like are the  graphics... But that\'s about it...',
       'Goog game, adddictive infact. But I don\'t understand the concept of PATANJALI adds. Whenever i choose to see adds to reduce the waiting time, you comeup with Patanjali adds of 10 and 20 seconds and the irritating part is the time doesn\'t gets reduced even after watching the whole add. Please fix this. When you say reduce wait time by watching add, you need to actually reduce the waiting time after the add instead of insisting to watch the add again and again.',

I am a family man, with a wife and 6 children, I just wanted a game that I could play when kids are in bed and wife is in bath, I don\'t have cash to spend on games, the worst thing is the 7 Day events, you cannot beat them without spending money.

The sensibility on the bet area is too high, I mean there\'s no exact control on how much you wanna bet and even less if the time is short. Should be an option to create a bigger tournament, more people like 2 or 3 tables. And other option to get coins.

I think you could inmprove further by making it easier to earn starcoins and another way to earn diamonds because many people do not want to/ cannot afford to BUY items in a fictional world.. Overall, i think this is a well rounded game, with a few improvement points, however i enjoy being able to have my own unique style in a virtual world :)',

     [ 'The game is great. Real old-school shmup. Graphics are ok, sometimes though so much is happening on screen that you can\'t see enemy bullets. Game needs control sensitivity options (like most of the other shmups). Overall - fun all the way!',
       'Great game.  Keeps me coming back.  A lot of depth for a top-down shooter.  I also love that it isn\'t pay to win, and there aren\'t any forced ads.  One of the very few phone games I actually enjoy playing, rather than just using them to kill time.',
       'I\'m VIP 2, currently on Stage 100, like this game but I have a suggestion. Please add Aircraft choosing option when prompted to join others online, 30 secs to prepare but got nothing to do except buying Powerups? That\'s too much time on hand and wasted. Some plane works well on normal stages while some works especially good against bosses, minus one star because the lack of this option. I\'ll consider giving you 5* if my plead is granted.',
       '(Tips for newcomers at the end) Classic style shmup, much less bullet-hll than most others out there. Been playing for over 6 months now. Not too many menus which I hate in a game, and the fun is quick to find and indulge in, solo or with a partner chosen from a friends list or a random volunteer in the world. It has microtransaction mechanics, but there\'s numerous ways to earn the special currency (gems) through normal playing. Earning base currency (gold) is hilariously generous, too. TIPS FOR NEWCOMERS; you\'ll be tempted to unlock every plane as soon as available, and get them all to the highest level right away. Don\'t. Stick with the same plane from early on (my fave was Laserbite), use gold to level it, and only use gems to upgrade for next rank milestones. You can test drive all the planes you unlocked to buy through story mode; the last one gets unlocked by stage 130 (sounds like a lot, but if you\'re the dedicated type, it\'ll take a month at most). And for Verdia\'s sake, don\'t use gems for respawn. Easy or medium, you can use a second plane to continue. For hard, just quit and try again with a different world partner, you\'ll usually make it within 3 or 4 tries. Gems are for the test-driven plane you liked most, and opening the next rank milestones for planes and BroBots. For BroBots, you can unlock most through BroPoints (generously given as well) and test drive those by equipping them and redoing old levels. The harder ones to unlock, you can observe world partners using most of them and decide if what you see seems useful to your style. Good luck and happy hunting!',
       'Great game. I\'d give it 5 stars, but after the update it erased my premium for 30 days midway. Very frustrating.',
       'Could\'ve been so much better. There\'s literally no way to gain the highest end aircrafts without either grinding for ages, or buying crystals with real money. What i particularly hated is that the "craft" method is completely missing for the aircrafts. You can craft bots using blueprints, but you can\'t craft aircrafts using blueprints. That\'s the last straw that drove me away from the game. Had that been an option, this was a total 5 star. But the greed really drove it away. And mind you i have actually spent some money on this game already, but am still dissatisfied.' ],

I contacted support and they said my version was not updated to the current version. When I went to play store there was no available updates. I contacted support again and they sent me a multitude of things to try. I don\'t feel like I have to do all this to play a game. They never offered to even give me anything for winning. When I won it again today...I get nothing again. I played this game for years and never had issues like this before. This game is not worth the hassle. Uninstalling it now, there are too many similar games out there that I won\'t have to stress or get mad about. Thought these games were supposed to be relaxing.',

     [ 'I love playing slot machine games, and Pop Slots feels like the only game that does not immediately shoot me down when I get a little crazy/ ambitious with my betting. It is the ONLY game I have ever played where I\'ve hit the jackpots on multiple occasions. Now maybe it\'s all completely luck on my part, but it feels like a game that doesn\'t immediately take all of your money faster than you can collect it. It\'s very easy to level up with a good win streak, and those hourly and daily bonus grow pretty quickly. Love this game!',
       'Used to be fun to play when there were decent rewards. For some reason the comp room rewards are gone besides small discount options. Ticket rewards are available for shows nobody would want to pay to see.  I have been playing for a few years now and have saved up quite few loyalty points. I guess we are playing for an occasional comp buffet. What a shame',
       'I like this game..but once i got to a certain level my daily bonus stopped going up.  It has reamined the same and it would be a little more exciting if it would increase the higher you go.  Win or lose is ok with me, it\'s something to pass free time.',
       'Game is really fun to play probably my favorite, and is the best slot machine app. I\'ve been playing at least 5 years But have recently stopped because it\'s not fun if you hardly win. And I totally get that it\'s supposed to be like Vegas, Win some could lose a lot. But it\'s just a game, it\'s for entertainment and I get that you can redeem the gold chips for real rewards in Vegas, but that\'s not why I play. I play because the games and different casinos are fun along with the bonuses. I spend 11 million just to play the pirate gem bonus and only win back 5 million. I could really care less how frequent the gold chips are, you only get 1 in 4ish balloons anyway. I just want to PLAYYY. Especially the bonuses, but it takes forever sometimes for them to be triggered in some casinos. Any chance it can change?',
       'Great game at first but when you progress you pretty much play for 10 minutes wait for bonus. Started purchasing chips and then they seem to go quicker! I like that is not all win win but damn, throw a dog a bone every once in a while. Basically you throw money away paying for chips and NEVER, and I repeat, NEVER win!',
       'I\'m sick of only being able to play for ten minutes at a time. Would love this game more if I can actually play it but you hardly can win coins, and if you do it\'s a quarter of what you spent on spinning it, and can hardly get coins. If you had more ways to get extra coins rather than paying like watching an ad, or something then that would be cool. Or if they made it so one could not lose 500k in ten minutes while only winning a total of like 5k that would be great cuz I would actually then enjoy it.' ],

     [ 'Should be more opportunities to pick up extra coins.  Buildings should not require high numbers of colours that have had little or no play or a player should be able to move from previous cities what every they want not limited to 1000.  All in all I enjoy the game but it could be s bit friendlier.  Thank you',
       'Love this little game! I wish we had five life\'s, Three just gets me started. But overall, it\'s a great game. Getting like Candy Crush the higher the level the more impossible it gets to finish. Please don\'t make it so hard to win. I keep having to use coins to buy lives. Can never build up enough to amount to anything. Also you can give cash on the scratch off card. PLEASE !!!',
       'I love this game. It is the only one I have on my phone anymore. There are a few new issues though. When the scratch tickets come through, I can\'t send to friends. It freezes and the only way for me to get out of it is to close the app. I think we should be able to cash in the travel vouchers, in not for coins then at least boosts. I think I\'m on day 93 of the treasure chests, and like the fact that I don\'t have to pay for the chests anymore. What I don\'t like are the rewards from the chest. If for reaching the milestone on days checked in, like day 90 I am given less resources than the level I just played, I might as well just play the level and not bother with the chest. I do love the interesting facts given about the destinations though. I do think it would be beneficial to have a button where we can contact you within the game instead of having to post on the review platform.',
       'FIRST OF ALL THIS GAME CAN KISS MY HAPPY ASS !!!  I had completed Sydney & was almost finished with Tokyo.  I went to play the game & all of a sudden my game cleared & it  took me back to the first play on Sydney.I have no Sydney no Tokyo.I am pissed about this. I really enjoyed this game but, if this is the way  you operate then I am over this game for sure.....',
       'I think the game is fixed. Its all down to how the game is programmed.  Sometimes no matter what you do you can\'t complete a level and then suddenly it goes into all singing and dancing mode and the level is completed with hardly any moves used. Its just a time filler for boring moments. Don\'t get me started on the marathon and Everest challenges!!!!',
       'Very hard and not as fun as the other games but very interesting.  This is not for just to pass time because you cannot even solved one level in a 3 lives. My friends do not want to play when I showed them how it is being played. I\'ve noticed that the first part of level 3 is more fun now than before. But still the 2nd and 3rd level is very hard. I admire those who completed the whole cities. They must be geniuses in algorithms in solving the 9 moves in one level.' ],

(before update) now upon opening the game, i get the same download error & cannot start the game at all.  the game is really fun & addictive. iam on level 20 I believe & really the only thing I would change would be the dialog boxes. it needs to have an "okay" button or some type of confirmation. they just disappear whenever you click on something.  they pop up in your face & as I\'m trying to out burgers in my pan, I didn\'t get to see what the instructions said because the boxes get so easily dismissed. I had to guess my way thru a few things as well ( i accidentally put mustard on all of my hotdogs because I didn\'t know how it worked)',

Some of my favorites are in the  classic section. I have been playing for several years. Today I am upset because of deleted chips, went from 1.2m won 690k but they did a minus instead of add. Grrrrrr  😊 Today my chips are multiplied, I\'m doing great.',
       'The thrill of the game I once loved is gone. Games just eats chips so you can purchase more and then eats them too! Games have low wins and keeps your play money low also. I only have it because of my BF Friends and I have money invested in it. BF don\'t seem to care that the luster is gone from a lot of their players or even care to bring it back!  😕😕😕😕 Still hoping for the best though!',
       'Hands down the best social casino app. I\'ve played pretty much all the different games there are. Big Fish Casino is fun if you win. Know when to walk away a winner. Plenty of freebies and bonuses are good. Meet and chat with people around the world. Download now and have a good time playing slots, blackjack, roulette, Texas holdem, burn 3 poker, or Big Fish Fields horse racing. Cheers!   Don\'t plan on winning.',
       'I\'m addicted to Big Fish and I keep  coming back for more!  No matter how many other casinos I\'ve tried, Big Fish is right up there at the top!!!  The graphics are good,  the bonuses are good and the tier rewards are the best!!  The social aspects are really good plus you get rewards for/and from friends.  The only thing I would change is the ability to give gold.',
       'I personally love the team aspect.  But sometimes the odds aren\'t so good. But  t I still love it and am addicted. And sometimes I have problems getting an answer from support. I have a request in now. So I\'ll see if there\'s a response. And there actually was. There still doing the watch ad thing and not paying out though',

Its pathetic that these gamw devs can\'t use freakin google play to store data BECUASE ITS OBTAINED THROUGH GOOGLE PLAY FFS!',
       'All day today every time I try and do something just get LOADING... on everything. Can\'t play the game at all at this point. This game is VERY hit or miss. Some days works like a champ others LOADING... all day long. Have tried on and off Wi-Fi and get the same behavior. Have power cycled my phone a few times and same behavior. This game could be so much fun if they could get some stability.',
       'Love the graphics. I like the fact that you can do a lot in this game. The only issue i have is the Arena. There is a great unbalance that i have to fight opponents that have 3x power than me. Hope you can categorize the players based on their level and power so we can fight on pvp with the same tier. Thanks!',

Like many of these type of games, the gameplay and graphics are great, but if you don\'t want to be destroyed by 1 hit wonder tanks then you need to spend money to upgrade and protect yourself, additionally many older and stronger clans are rebooting themselves so they appear as newly created, but because of the strength completely annihilate lesser clans as its based on points gained through wars, they seem like they haven\'t taken part in many.

     [ 'I used to love this game, very addictive but recent updates have made the game have too many elements (clubs - who cares???) Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels "fixed" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.',
       'This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.',
       'I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn\'t really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don\'t know how many more points you need.',
       'This game has many issues! It continually freezes and shuts me down. I can no longer play on my tablet, which I purchased just for games, and have to use my phone. I don\'t like using my phone because it drains my battery. I am so ready to quit this game and return to candy crush instead. Latest updates have rendered JP and other perks useless.',
       'Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the "boards" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it\'s addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It\'s becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.',
       'I really liked playing as mindless entertainment despite what I consider to be unreasonable costs of the games as you advance in levels  and even tolerated the forced ads when they began. Unfortunately 2 days ago   it refused to load and continues to ask to retry or restart.  My connections are optimal and no updates pending.   Have tried to contact support to no avail. Disappointing.' ],

The few rich players who reach the top levels are essentially gods that can\'t be touched. Top clans terrorize servers, causing many players to quit, but the clans dont get banned because they dump boatloads of money into this game. ALSO WARNING: THIS GAME NEVER ENDS. YOU HAVE TO BE ONLINE 24/7 OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE ATTACKED AND DRAINED OF ALL YOUR HARD EARNED RESOURCES. THERE IS NO SAFE ZONE (UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND $20 FOR A 7 DAY SHIELD...)  The servers arent separated by region so what you get is a group of people who can\'t communicate with one another because of the broken translation system that can\'t even translate Korean and it\'s a Korean game!  Trust me, I gave this game a try. I was in the #2 ranked alliance on our server and a top 100 ranked player on it as well. This game will take over your life and its just simply not worth it. Everytime I see someone dump another $1000 into this game JUST TO GET TO THE NEXT LEVEL I cringe.  AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE! There are free games out there that aren\'t pay to win. If you like pirates there are free pirate pvp games on the computer that are 1000x better and not manipulative as this game.',

     [ 'The events are so ridiculous. You have to make items for a chance to get one event item which would be fine if you didn\'t have to make 10 things to get one event item. There are usually 6 phases and 8 items per phase except on the last one which has 16.  It\'s  very frustrating to spend so much time for nothing.',
       'When and if ever the bugs get worked out it will be a great game.  The chat issues are ridiculous and getting into global and the market are impossible. The spinning sun of death gets old fast. Upgrades seem to make items disappear.',

It should be so easy that everyone can understand each and everything . Where are these clouds I don\'t know. You are teasing me by  showing this message again and again.',

       'Love playing this and have for years. However, I bought $39.99 worth of keys twice and was never given keys. Support does not respond, even with all screenshots the auto email asks for. I ended up getting a refund from google. Time to find a better game!',
       'The game is great entertainment how ever the tasks are extremely long half the time would have fantastic. Also the amount of tasks items to collect are much, should cut down the amount of items to collect and be generous with the keys and other treasures. Can be annoying when items needed in phase events are extremely difficult find and it is done purposefully.  Games should be based on fairness and not greed $$$$$' ],

       'The only improvements I would like to see is making it easier to view on my phone.  I actually got reading glasses just for this,  but it\'s still killing my eyes.  If I could even zoom in a little more,  maybe. Also, I\'m a cheapo, so missing out on Facebook & other perks by not paying or not connecting.  I want to play, not embroil myself in social media.  Still, LOVE this game!!',
       'This game is amazing! Most games of this style sacrifice story for the sake of puzzles, or vice versa, but this is a perfect balance and blend of both. I was hooked from the first moment, and the briliant and individual characters and challenging - but not impossible - puzzles have kept me eagerly impatient to play more. (My only complaint is that the energy refill feels SO SLOW when all I want to do is play more!)',

       'I was really enjoying the game, it\'s fun. Don\'t get me wrong. But I\'ve signed in every day, every single day and I make sure I do, and sometimes I do it from my iPad and sometimes I do it from my phone. And sometimes it lags and says I missed a day before it fixes. But today I signed in and it told me I missed a day. So I tried it on my phone and it still said I missed a day so I had to restart from the first day in the current collection item. I\'m very frustrated and upset by this. So this whole \'signing on from a different device\' thing is glitchy af and my game got messed up because of it. Very upsetting. Otherwise it would be a 5star.',

     [ 'I LOVE this game ... like I am so hooked.... I spend way too much money though because I love all the dragons so much just so adorable I always buy the dragon bundles.   It does suck whenever you get so high up with feeding your dragons then it costs a lot of food to feed them like if I didn\'t buy so many dragon bundles I would have a hard time feeding them to higher levels... Even now it\'s hard.  Anyways I am addicted to this game though other than that!  ♡♡',
       'This game is so bad I almost died of cuteness from the dragons. Firstly: you could try to make a breeding guide to help plays find what dragons to breed so they get their dragon the want. Secondly: the dragon and animations are just wonderful and adorable. Lastly: I would definitely recommend this to be installed by lovers of dragons and fantasy or anything like an interesting of this game. Even if the person hasn\'t got interest in would suggest them to try it because it\'s really fun',
       'This game is very addictive, fun, and a great game over all. Eventually if you play it long enough there isn\'t much you can do on the app until you wait but other then that it\'s a decent time killer. I haven\'t ran into any issues with the game and I recomended installing it',
       'Honestly a great game. It has ads but those are optional. You only view ads if you want some extra stuff. You click on a button to view the ads and after, depending on what you picked you wanted, you get. So please don\'t think that the ads just randomly pop-up out of nowhere. They only appear if you choose for them to be there. I\'d say download the game, you won\'t regret it 👍',

I love the game other than that but it\'s a pain to have to make these changes and then have to reset the settings in play store and for display to be able to use my device properly. When that issue is fixed... I\'ll for sure give it 5 stars.',

Your friends can\'t join you because thier potential spot is being taken by an abandoned accounts.  You get the same default uncaring reply to all of your suggestions/complaints. They say it\'s a war game and attacking is part of the game and for that I have no beef.  However, the commanders of every Arc broadcasts thier location to everybody across all servers. We even go as far as to tell our enemies when and where our troops are going and the final destination. This make it impossible for lower level players to hide or even try to avoid being camped by people twice thier level.  The balance (or should I say lack there of) in the game makes the history books. The Devs failed on quite a few of the basic elements required for good multiplayer game play.  I would put money on it that 90+% of all positive reviews that you have read were made before they got out of thier newbie bubble and made level 8 or so.  I could go on and on regarding the shortcomings of this game, but I think you get the point. This game is great to playing up to level eight or so and then you will find yourself debating on whether to leave or pay an exorbitant amount of money to compete or survive.  I chose to leave and educate anyone else wanting to give this game a try.',

That needs to be changed then maybe I will give it 5 stars  This games keepa force closing on me. Most of the time it\'s right in the middle or almost at the end of the game so therefore I have lost a turn or even the game when I\'m about to shoot my last ball...... I love this game and I don\'t want to delete it.... FIX THIS PLEASE',
       'App closes halfway through the game and I loose everything I had. They give you a lot of balls of the color you really dont need so you shoot balls in random directions because you need to get rid of them. Sometimes I feel they are setting you up to lose. The aim is off unless you use the aim perk so if Its a further distance Im shooting it blindly. Great talk.',

Update 2018: I keep getting kicked ou of the games halfway through!',

     [ 'Great solitaire game! If you want to play on and on, you need to buy extra credits, which I did because I could not wait+their CS is amazing!! Games are fun to play and challenging... You could still play without buying credits,,, it would just be slower. Highly recommended,! So grateful for fantastic customer service',
       'If you like solitaire you will hate this game. This isnt a game of skill or strategy. Its a sort of a matching game and it becomes clear quick that they are going to drain you of your seed currency quick so you can start spending real money. You will just pull card after card that you dont need.',
       'Its great game love that I don\'t need Wi-Fi to play it. But some of levels just get so impossible to beat you spend four day on one level. Make the crops pay out more and levels make them a bit easier make the challenges be the hard ones.',
       'Great game concept, great graphics, however it really sucks that the amount of coins required to play  increases too much and you don\'t get enough coins. I wish it didn\'t cost so much to play, it seems like they just want you to actually buy more coins. No thanks. Will be deleting.',
       'I really like the concept of this game. Unfortunately I am not prepared to even give it one star as it doesn\'t take you long to realize that the only aim from this game is to extract money from all who wish to play. Pitiful really as there are many similar games available which you don\'t have to feel pressure to buy',
       'This game looks great and is fun to play, but like other similar games it\'s engineered to get you hooked and then empty your wallet. The development team is clearly talented... If only they used their power for good instead of evil :) (sigh)' ],

     [ 'I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I\'d end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!',
       'Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It\'s reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series\' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis\'s and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I\'m offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,',
       'I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It\'s fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn\'t want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.',
       'Game it self is great and a ton of fun.   But, the system for showing ads is so annoying.  It\'s not just your normal video ad no, they make you watch 3 different ads and a min of 16 or 11 sec each.  After you have watched the minimum time, you have to hit next and repeat again',
       'Quite addicting. But does have partial microtransaction walls where it\'s extremely difficult to get past certain parts without forking over real money. Other than that it\'s nice. I only have two things that I think could make this game better: 1) boss battles and 2) ability to sort through parts by specific type, rather than just their standard class.',
       'I want to report a glitch. I betted 3 parts, titan, drill, and a repulse. I lost on thd bet, and guess what? The titan car still had that tick on on it, then i got those stickers on the car unlimited. It took me 5 minutes to get back to normal. Please dont use this peopole.' ],

Ok, so after about a month of not loading it started working...for a month now it\'s down again. I upgraded today, 2/19, and still won\'t open, grrrr! Help!!',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for quite sometime. It\'s addictive and fun. But it can cut out after a tough level and not give you a chance to find a key. Very frustrating. Also, I don\'t see a benefit in getting an outfit for the 20 gem chest. I\'m tempted to uninstall the game now that my gems were wasted.',
       'its your average match 3 game with the Angry Birds brand added to cash in on the match 3 craze. There are only 3 adult birds playable (Red, Chuck. and Bomb). There are events to unlock outfits for the happy hatchling...but thanlfully you dont have to do that if you dont wanna. As someone that HATES ads, I dont recall any so there mau not be any od they dont irritate me.  oh and batteru cpnsumption is not very high. hope this help',
       'I love this game and the hatchlings are sooo cute! ( unfortunately this game is catching my parents\'s attention and now they are playing it too much and i cannot get my hands on my cellphone, one day i\'m at level 10, the next, i\'m at level 70!)',
       'I\'m enjoying the game play but it really seems to lag between levels. I\'m waiting 15-30 seconds for it to load the next screen after the end of a level then another 15-30 seconds for the level to load. I spend a lot of time staring at a white screen. I\'ll keep playing but I\'d love to see faster loading.',
       'It\'s VERY addictive. I don\'t even know what to do with myself when I run out of loves. It can be a bit laggy during the start up screen or beginning of levels but it doesn\'t take too long or shut off so that\'s a win.' ],

     [ 'This is actually one of my favorite Final Fantasy titles. Graphics are gorgeous. The story is pretty deep and well written. The number of playable characters is astounding and most don\'t recycle moves. The devs update it regularly and are active in communicating with the community. A few things are kinda "broken", like the arena. And Microtransactions aren\'t overpowering, but they\'re there... 4/5',
       'Hi Gumi. I only started like last week of November. But I became an instant addict with this game. It has a lot of potential to be the best game on the mobile market. However, recent events and actions of the company stained the gameplay and soul of the players. It\'s like the events are not planned anymore, just putting something for us. And then this recent cash summon banner. This type of move is disrecpectful to us. I hope you can still turn it around. We will be waiting and I will still be playing to see what will happen. Thank you for this wonderful game.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game since shortly after launch, and I love the gameplay and nostalgia it has to offer. However, the company has lately been predatory with low value bundles, which at first glance, might look like a good deal to a newer player. I would warn new players not to buy anything in-game until they get their act together.  Also, the game has been more buggy than usual lately, but I\'ll let that slide and hope it gets better.  In short, this is a 5 star game run by a 1 star company.',
       'This recent GUMI bundle offer really put a bad taste on the game for me. It really was not a favorable cash bundle for loyal customers in my opinion. I wish the banner was only 20 dollars or less or provided the loyal customer the choice of which 5* character they wanted guaranteed.  GUMI, please change this business practice and take care of the great community instead of continuing down this path of bringing the game down in customer loyalty and fun!!. The quality of the events, rewards, etc have dropped.',
       'After all the previous issues of bugs, hacking, etc, the game has really picked up its slack. The game is so muchs smoother now and seems like more effort has gone in to it. Drop rates still seem low, since the 3x boost I still receive basics, but that\'s not a huge issue as theres always a free giveaway every week. Overall the game is finally enjoyable without constant issues',
       'I like the game but the summon rates are just messed up. My friends sat down with me and watched, on multiple occasions, where I would do like ten or 11 summons all at once and Id get 10 or 11 of the same unit. Ive summoned enough gokens to get 2 of his tmrs, same with yuri and conrad. While these tmrs are good, I would like to have more than a pool of ten units to summon from, Im just sayin 🙄' ],

     [ '*update - if you want any special characters be ready to spend 100$\'s. The summon you use is just a giant cash grab and never gives you the special characters. I wouldn\'t waste the money. * Update  pvp is a joke they predetermine who is likely to win by where they place the Chakra drains and who they allow to go first when attributes are tied. The game is going down hill.',
       'I like the game. All I ask is that you fix this glitch in the game where you complete an objective with the correct colored units and you still don\'t get awarded the pearls you\'re supposed to get for it. I got cheated twice by this glitch and it\'s really irritating to waste my stamina and not get my reward. Please fix this issue please!',
       'I\'m a die hard blazing fun, so it pains me to give this review. Developers have let trolls take over PvP. Emergency missions are just repeated. Summons are still summons though lol. But seriously the PvP is taking out all the fun out of the game.',
       'This game hates me. Everytime I use my pearls ya\'ll start a blazing fetstival. I waited 2 weeks to use my 75 pearls, and no good summons popped up so i used em and now there is a blazing festival with characters i needed.',
       'This game is not for you if don\'t want to pay to win if you day pay money in to the game you\'ll waste your time I wasted months just to get some good characters and only draw 3 and 4 stars from 5 draws not one good character and wasted all my stones just to get told to buy stones like whatever 1 out of 10',

     [ 'This game is once sided. Players who have had the game for a while dominate the game so that new/weaker players can not advance. Really the only way you can stand a chance is buying packs  which still doesn\'t help as higher levels can attack and steal it. Finally the moderators are non existing and are often apart of the large groups attacking you. A terrible waste of time and money.',
       'The same problem as previous person. Had 20 days left on Monthly card. Allowance has completely gone as they have introduced a new monthly card. Hopefully a mistake and not a scam. If scammed will be making chargeback of all payments !!',

       'It has a lot of room for improvement, I hope to see more as I play.  Edit: from 5 stars to 3 stars, many problems from the start get ignored by devs due to rich kids pumping money into the game, still an OK game though.',
       'Devs should add events or something where prizes has shields. Killing event is just too much a pain where bullying is tolerated. Universal shards are not universal as it covers only a few selected enabler shards...shady! Also sometimes or first log-in of the day it opens with phone media volume maxed and unchangable in-game, too loud. But overall not regreting installing this and will stay in phone for a long time.',
       'The game is great I enjoy playing it but I have two issues with it,   The chat censors are honestly a bit much, simple words that shouldn\'t be censored are and it\'s really annoying.  And the Grammer when taking the girls out on dates is so horrid I can barely understand what the actual heck is going on. I like reading the stories but I can\'t read if I can\'t understand' ],

     [ 'Definitely a game for car buffs. It requires using your "mind" to win. I\'m not to sure about my rating yet. But, will definitely change if needed. It\'s unlike any game I\'ve played & I like it! Someone wrote a review that this is a lazy person\'s game... LMAØ, I wish they would show me the games they play while they are running, swimming & mountain climbing "while" they play, smh HAHA!',
       'Incredible game. Awesome concept. Two complaints to developers. High speed loop-when you win, it starts detracting points. And also certain mph based drag races,I run out of road but the challenging car gets like 60 miles of road. Besides these, fantastic game.',
       'I think this game is amazing! And is perfectly good in every way!! I can\'t stop playing and look forward to getting new cars. There is just one tiny error that bugs me a bit but I can cope with it. The error is the color of the Ford fiesta xr2. When you race someone else and they have this vehicle on the card the car is black with a tiny red trim on the side but when it\'s on the track it is completely red. I do hope you can will fix this small mistake but apart from that this game is great!!! Thanks for reading :)',
       'I love the concept and it\'s been great to see how far this game has come, but I\'ve been playing since beta and nearly every update wipes my save data and forces me to restart. Luckily, I don\'t get too far into the game each time, but it is frustrating and enough of a buzz kill for me to drop two stars. If there was a cloud system implemented for saves this game would be a five star in my book',
       'Multiplayer is not fair. Have the same car with lower 0-60 time better traction, and higher mph but still lose. Match play is getting worse. I either have to spend a boatload of money or always come in last place.',
       'This is an amazing game and I think Hutch Games did an amazing job putting the collecting and racing features of the game together. Buying packs is very expensive, but in some ways it is a nice challenge to work hard to get the thrill of opening a pack. I love being able to collect and race so many real cars. For a suggestion however, I think it would add a lot to the game if Hutch Games made it so there was a section where you could put the cars that your keeping only for collecting. It would just be easier to get them away from the cards that your using to race.' ],

     [ 'My only issue with this game is that u almost have to end up purchasing tix to continue to play. The further u move on in the game, the more tix each card costs & ur only given a certain amount thru a daily reward. App should provide ways to earn more tix, either thru a daily spin or higher rewards. *(since app developer replied to this review, I changed my review to 4 stars)',
       'Just played my first 4-5 rounds and this ROCKS! Not too fast. I love it! Fair Payouts but 1st, 2nd, etc same as others. Graphics work!  All Around impression... Awesome-ness. Update: I\'ve been here atleast  5mos... long enough to know this still ROCKS!',
       'I really like this Bingo  game.  A few upgrades and it will  be better than all the other Bingo games.  I love the amount of tickets it gives you to play.  I love the extra stuff you can earn and not have to pay for.  A couple of things that would  make this game better would be all 4 cards on one screen in tablet mode, the power ups being applied automatically  and being able to daub that last number that\'s  called cause usually that\'s the one needed for Bingo.  Otherwise its great.  I hope  you find this useful.  I understand  if you can\'t  fix all three of these but the first 2 are more important  than the last and i understand  there can only be a certain amount of bingos i guess.  Thank you.  Real close to being a 5 but those 3 issues really hold me back as I\'m  sure it does others as well.',
       'I like this game VERY much. But my tickets keep disappearing! I just earned 200 tickets for feeding the dog. My tickets got added on. Then i clicked on Candy Crush. Then i clicked on 4 cards. And it said i didn\'t have enough tickets! It cost 240 in Candy Crush. I had almost 300 tick. When i looked at the top, i only had 131. What happened to all my tickets that quick?!?!? I\'m about to uninstall now. Its not the FIRST time this happened. But it will be the last! #GoodbyeBingo',
       'This used to be my favorite bingo game and then they updated it about a month ago (give or take a few days). Before the update, I was able to level up daily or every other but, now, it takes me a GOOD week or more to level up. That was my ONLY way to gain more tickets to continue playing without purchasing. I barely have enough to play 2 (4 cards each) rounds each day! REALLY stinks! Guess I will be uninstalling and going back to playing Bingo Blitz!',
       'It\'s been nice...I\'m happy to share: they heard us. We can earn power now, the games are fun, excellent pace. Thank you "Dataverse", I appreciate your changes 💯 ☠☠☠☠☠ UPDATE: n again 1/11. again: I ventured and came back. I can buy credit in January. Cuz we HAVE to have boosts to play long. Here I go !Update. I like a lot. Spent 20 but you simply can\'t spend enough.  must buy boosts too. Boosts get stuck' ],

     [ 'I didn\'t hold out much hope initially but it\'s a fabulous game. Graphics are good, there\'s a story and multiple maps etc. Its easy to progress and the special event maps were hilarious.  Definitely suitable for the majority of players and even young ones. There\'s no gore or unsuitable scenes and no constant push to buy ingame content. I wish more game developers thought like this. Properly enjoyable',
       'Great game, incredible customer service. You will never get bored with this game. Play daily as much or as little as you want. There are seasonal (timed) events to play and ongoing daily (no time limit)searches. We have all been there, missed an achievement because we logged on 10 minutes late. NO MONEY has to be spent to truely enjoy this game. Your progress or fun level isn\'t held hostage if you don\'t want to pay to play. Customer service is incredible. I was stuck and the response was quick and helpful. Even when I still didn\'t get it, think if it was a snake, it would have bitten me, they helped and never made me feel stupid. Install NOW and start having fun.',
       'Energy is spent too quickly, kind of their way of trying to make you to buy gems. I get it, and I would buy them if they weren\'t so expensive! I can barely make it through a single task, it does get quite annoying.   Maybe give us the option of watching ads for gems or extra energy, and an ad free option with minimal cost so those who would rather not have the ads get to benefit too?',
       'Love the challenge,  the mini puzzles.  The only draw back I would say.  As a new player having enough energy to complete some of the old challenges example (Valentine\'s 2017) is almost impossible.  Would love to figure out how to gain more energy. Fan page as far as I can see does not help on this.  Other then  that very enjoyable game.',
       'Hi, really like the game, but I\'ve just done the new jungle story and on completion of the story received a lot of gummy worms for energy, carried on playing, closed and came back to the app 30 mins later and they have all disappeared?? Could you please put these back in my rucksack so I can use them, was over 60, 000 energy that I have just lost, please sort this out as I love this game and I can then give it 5 stars, many thanks, Louise Anderson',

Oh and please don\'t suggest me to redownload the game because i would rather uninstal it (it took so looong just to download all of the data 1.9gb so i don\'t want to do it again by redownload the application)',
       'I have been playing this game for around 4mos(Global Server) already and it never made me think that choosing to play this game over the others was waste of my time. Even this game has pay with cash options, this doesn\'t hold the non-cash user to excel. It is indeed a good experience playing this FFT inspired game. I hope that you guys(Gumi) won\'t change and keep this a balanced game and the players, be it cash users or non-cash users they will be yours. I/we will be looking forward to the fast expansion and better gaming experience!!',
       'Awesome game this far into the experience of it. At Main level 22 and it\'s a very fun game with a great story. However... I am still the kind of person who would rather this be dub in English rather sub. But that\'s the only "slight" issue, which really isn\'t one except for me and others who would rather have dub as well.  Defiantly recommended!',
       'I love this game. One of my biggest ossues with mobile games is that theres so many where you dont really do anything. Its click and watch. "The Alchemist Code" however has a strategey gameplay mechanic that reminds me of FFTactics. You can put on an auto mode if you want to coast or play it yourself. The story and world are AMAZING. I wish they would make an anime adaptarion because i would binge the heck out of that.',
       'I Actually really love this game, gacha games are usually very RNG based and if you don\'t pay you can\'t progress. But in this game we are given good characters for free and the summon rates are really good. And I also really love how duplicate characters are actually very useful! But you guys really need to add an auto feature to the co-op, it becomes really tedious and boring. Keep up the good work!',
       'One of the best mobile game. Very well developed game, impressive graphic, good original story and character design. And one thing that make this one of the best game is, player doesn\'t have to spend money to make deep progress into this beautiful game and to enjoy the story line. But I will definitely invest on this game. Please Please Please continue with the good work on the next chapter!! You guys are so evil, I forgot to do my work!! Worth it! ;P' ],

     [ 'Overall... I\'d have to say it\'s a very basic game and I wish there was more to it. I have always loved the Simpson\'s and playing a game based on their life is surely interesting. However, I was hoping that it would be more realistic, fun and free. It turns out that it\'s a P2P game and that took my surprise because it really is unfortunate. I hope they improve the gameplay and graphics. More updates will definitely bring more players.',
       'I used to give this a 5 star rating but at level 150 I maxed out the amount of items I can have in my Springfield. Playing the game at this stage is pretty useless. I\'m not a hoarder, my Springfield is beautifully arranged so there is no way I will delete things in order to build new houses or place new items. Will come back when the cap is increased but for now I\'m sadly forced to take a break.',
       'I have been plying this game for years i love it and quite often play more than once a day. The graphics are great as are all the challenges i hopr you bring the gifts for visiting you friends towns back i hopr this game goes on for a long time most of my family play to x',
       'Since about 2 days ago the game keeps disconnecting from the server and I constantly need to \'retry\' to connect. Sometimes I am able to enter the game, but only for a short while before it crashes. Unable to stay connected.  No problem with wifi as this happens on multiple connections and it appears to be from the game\'s side.',
       'Crafted a straight trench & boom my crafty points disappeared The IRS radius shortened, clicking finished jobs doesnt redirect me to the Toon player. Train tracks cant be crafted anymore. The Claw machine gives Bowling shoes WTH. Maka Sprungfuld gret agan!',
       'Great game for Simpsons fans. But what kills the fun are constantly new side missions. Just as you finished one, two new shows up. You can never concentrate on what\'s most important and that\'s building the Springfield but rather playing with some ruffians at the time now.' ],

     [ 'It’s a battle for the ages! Wait, we mean a battle of the ages – kids and adults are at war in Springfield! But what could cause this generational divide – Unfair bedtimes? Too many vegetables? Territory rights to the town’s new playground? (That last one was so specific it has to be true). Can Bart lead the youths to victory over Homer’s aged army and claim Springfield’s new Mega Playscape?',
       'Gather your troops, fortify your structures, and see saw your seesaws. It’s time for war.' ],

     [ 'I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It\'s pricey but we\'ll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn\'t need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get',
       'Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn\'t need to have the internet on. Don\'t know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.',
       'This game is an amazing way to pass the time! I love all the upgrades and different levels, especially the events. The game gets more challenging as you go along, and the events I previoisly mentioned make it just that much better. My only complaint is how hard it is to get the special currency of the game, being diamonds. Other than that, it is a great game overall and I am looking forward to future updates.',
       'I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.',
       'It would be nice for updated casino with new slot machine games and also some new restaurants.  Last one was quite sometime ago?  Are you still actively developing the game or you called it quits like some other games I had to uninstall because there was nothing left to do in them.  Just curious.....',
       'This game is a bit boring at first since it is really hard to serve your burgers because they take ages to cook.  I, after 1 day,  got totally addicted to it as it gets really fun and especially when it lets you purchase the automatic cooker for just 10 gems it is easy and cool! You will see what I mean when you hopefully download the app as I would definitely recommend it! Thank you for making a fun, addictive app that I enjoy. 😄' ],

They feed everyone this bs line about trying to make the game challenging but it\'s just a money grab. Unless you like spending a ton of money on games stay away. It\'s a shame because they make it look nice and all. Guess they gotta recoup all that money somehow. Used to be good not worth the time anymore...I tried...',

     [ 'Even though the descriptions and dialogues in the game are bit off it doesn\'t completely take away from the experience of the game. It still does have some bugs, like the dialogues for instance, but the game is really addictive. It\'s one of very few games that I\'ve been playing religiously for the past few months, probably longer. That\'s the one of the main reasons why I\'m giving 5 *\'s. The game has an ENORMOUS amount of potential, I think if the devs got licensing rights then it would improve the game so much more. One thing I really do not like about the game is that it is kind of a pay-to-win game. You have to spend real money to advance quicker or become stronger in the game faster. Other than the cons, it really is a fun and addictive game. If you love anime, if you love fan service, if you love action games, if you just love Bleach in general then you will definitely love this game.',

       'Only installing because i spent hundreds in the last one. Devs only care about your money, don\'t fix or take forever to fix issues, and the game is basically pay to win. Yiu can still get decently for free, but don\'t expect to get to the top that way. Take the 1 star reviews seriously... A lot of ppl stopped playing because of this games BS...',
       'After figuring out how to reinstall the game. . . and still having my account. I\'m so relieved to still be abke to play this amazing game. . . keep up the good work guys. But you need to put the reinstall instructions in the original game sign in error. I went through a lot before I figured it out. Love the apology gifts tho. Thanks dev team.',
       'For those who lost their progress, you have to choose the right server in the home menu. It should be there. Anyways, weird way to make an update but this game is pretty okay. Flash sales and stam refill should be the only things you spend magatamas on. Roulette is a waste. Overall it\'s pretty good.',

     [ 'It was a great game until they introduced Deathstroke. Now you either need to have him(I do but it takes the fun away) or have people specifically to counter him. They made him way OP and arnt nerfing him anytime soon. So if your just starting you will want to spend money to counter death stroke.',
       'Ok, maybe this is a minor nitpick. But some of the legendary costumes look really bad. It is worse on characters that look good before the upgrade. The detective Batman and comic Harly Quinn are the biggest examples. I would rate higher if they gave us the ability to hold the apperance. Maybe add another level and costume and let players choose which they like best.',
       'Can you please remove this "Join dynamic PvP battles" from the game discription. There\'s nothing dynamic about every person having deathstroke as a team leader. Maybe having more character balance in the game would make the game better you guys should try it out.',
       'Fun at low levels, but they are clueless at scaling opponents around level 50 and have a few ridiculously overpowered characters.  I shouldn\'t be put in a fight with Bane that heals himself for 6000 after every attack (mine or his). At the end of each round he has more hp than he started with. Also, you get matched up against guys that can one shot each of your characters. My characters are all maxed for their level.',
       'The game is awesome when it works but im trying to play the shazaam to unlock new heroes and my team is on there but the enemys im suppose to battle aren\'t showing up so i have close down the game everytime i just wish they would fix it so i can try and complete the level',
       'Had to change my score after playing this game for almost a year. For more than a year this game hasn\'t done a single update. We still playing the same tired and boring game modes. No character rebalancing, no new gamemode all the do is introduced new broken character every month to get you to buy them and completely nerfs them the next month\'s just to introduce another broken character. Do not spend money on this game EVER.' ],

     [ '50,000 diamonds spent on 1 event and nothing to show for it???? Get real magic rush.  I have played this game for over 2 years and have found the game has constantly been getting greedier and greedier with the amount of spending required to get some of the  characters. After spending +400 RL dollars to get one character it did not even drop the character and show how cheap and money hungry this company is. The customer service team did not care about the concerns and said "its about luck" however this is game is less about luck and more about a  company trying to get themselves rich over enjoyong a game. Me and fellow gamers will refuse to play this game anymore.',
       '!!!WARNING POTENTIAL DOWNLOADERS!!!  Riot games are going to have a massive law suit on their hands with this company (again)  Not only have they stolen character concept and design, but they have also blatantly stolen found effects.  But what has this to do with you the player?? Because once the law suit goes through the game will be (by law) forced to stop.  YOU WILL LOSE ANYTHING you did in this game and ANY of the money you spend will NOT be refunded.  Do you think they would refund you if they lose the game? They STOLE from one of the biggest gaming Titans in the industry, they won\'t care to steal from you too!!  Take my advice DONT DOWNLOAD',

     [ 'This is hands down the most F2P friendly game I come across to. I mean you can pay some useful stuff but this game leans more on casuals/f2p. The graphics is nice,story is ok,gameplay so far have been really grindy as expected of an Korean rpg and yeah a casual friendly game. So far my only concern is the toxicity of the world chat. Where and how do I report those players?',
       'Even if this isn\'t your style of game I would recommend giving it a try. Truly a magnificent piece of work backed by an excellent company. Vespa strives to provide players with a fulfilling experience in all aspects of this products. There are some things which could use adjustments, like the state of PvP for example, yet I have no doubt that like everything else so far they are receiving and acting based on feedback of their customer base. All other mobile companies could stand to learn something from Vespa.',
       'Amazing first mobile game to hold my attention, great animations, epic fighting, and a strong story. Always something to do my only complaint would be cash shop is really pricey needs to go way down, $80-100  for a mobile game hero is outrageous i could just get a console/pc game but you can grind everything for free and there is decents sales and events',
       'This game is one of the most f2p friendly. All game content is available to get without spending cash. The community is good too since you can chat with other players when playing, and can join multiplayer raid. It may a bit hard to reach top ranks in arena with f2p, but pvp is not the main content in this game so most players dont bother too much with it.',
       'You guys reserved *5 just like my epis UW HAHAHA. Good work, thanks for your hardwork. I don\'t know you guys read this comment or not, but keep up your great work and thank you. For everything, and your daily motivation in game mail every hot time. Hope this comment also made your day.',
       'since the game first started (1 yr ago) they\'ve added 20 characters and 1 (!?) storyline chapter. if you\'re looking for actual content, this is not your game. if you only care about collecting characters and outfits and making strong for no reason (since there\'s nothing to do but pvp endlessly), then this is THE game. ugh!' ],

     [ 'I absolutely love this game. Turn based tactics are one of my favourite types of games. Since playing the game more I\'ve decided that there\'s not enough gas for me to be able to enjoy the game like I want to. I think the car should either hold more, or gas should be easier to get. This is just a game that already has inconsistencies with reality. Otherwise I love the game',

Build a camp, in order to multiply resources, because you will need them to improve other buildings. Also, to note, this game will not allow you to get stronger unless you improve your camp. I have survivors who cannot level up until I Improve the council. The training grounds will not be built any further unless you improve the council. Its like a city/fort building game with tactical rpg feel to it.  There is a leaderboard, that actually awards you for being at a certain tier. You can join guilds to help get better gear. I love this game!  ...The con that I have with this is that every time of logging on, deals are thrown in my face, and it is enticing too.',
       'I absolutely love this app! I enjoy playing it and haven\'t noticed any extreme problems. Though, I\'ve noticed that when I try to do certain things, like finish a mission or shoot a walker outside the fences the game would freeze for 5-20 seconds which would take away from the game play. Would definitely rate 5 stars if this problem were fixed.',

I don\'t know how to explain it but the main heroine doesn\'t have similar features like other 1492 studio\'s heroins have, a resemblence of face features. Maybe you should work on the face features to make it look like other heroins of "is it love" games because it looks completely different. Kind of unsettling to me.',

I don\'t think it\'s right to have to pay so much just to play the game. Like for real I don\'t get to play but 5 mins. With what they give u. But it does keep u in dispense. An keeps you hooked.

I don\'t like how most of these games now are making them design for you just to pay, if I have to pay for everything that I really need.  Then I should have to pay to download the game.  Other than that, it\'s a pretty decent game',

However, it is getting seriously marked down for the simple fact that if I watch video ads to earn gold, speed up construction or increase rewards it plays the video but doesn\'t allow me to collect the rewards. Clearly another company ripping off its customer base.',

And if the screen is not able to get any bigger, I\'m hoping you people can at least put a cool border around it instead of leaving it as a black bar. I know you people can make cool borders. Thanks for your attention!',
       'I love this game.  Strategy, adventure, and story (once you get far enough) are all great!  Although it is a little pay to win, and they keep coming out with new medals (attacks) that are infinitely better than your current ones.  This can get discurraging, because your hard work doesn\'t really mean much in the long run.    I played for 6 month when a friend got a single medal that made him more powerful than me on his 1st week playing.',

I love that you all added a lower quality version this way I can play this game.] I like it and all, but when that very large download starts after the tutorial, it stops at 4/6 and restarts, even though my phone has enough room for it, I think. Please fix this, I really want to play it!',
       'I played this game when it first came out. I quit a couple weeks later due to repetitiveness and not being able to continue due to weak medals and a year or two later I come back with tons of jewels. I had over 30000 waiting in the mail. Used them all and got some really good medals but when new medals are released its really hard go earn them due to the slow rate and cost. Buying them is overpriced. Pretty much one draw of 3000 jewels is 30$ for a chance at the new medal. This game is really a pay 2 win game and prices are just too much.',
       'It is so addicting but when I first got the game. I only had one problem with it and thats when it is downloading. It takes forever and just to get the app I had to delete almost everything. (BTW I have a 8gb phone and that didn\'t  work well for me. But I got it too work.)',
       'Don\'t get me wrong. I love this game entirely kingdom hearts is life. But it\'s funny that in the description it says it\'s the first mobile app for the kingdom hearts seires. Maybe I\'m wrong but I thought Coded was for the phone. Which would make this game the second mobile app x.x' ],

     [ 'This game is very fun and addictive but should have offline mode so we don\'t have to deal with a hacker every game.  Also after new update I\'m having issues getting into the game. It says "check comnection" and my connection is fine even tried uninstalling it and all. Other games work on my phone and so does my Wi-Fi. The game just worked last night for me now it doesn\'t! PLEASE FIX!!',
       'Just good. This game is great. The controls are completely customizable so you can make it work the way you want it to. Graphics are on point, better than 2nd Gen consoles, lesser than 3rd gen. If this game came out in the age of the PS2 I would have bought it. Also, buy a box because this game couldn\'t have been cheap to make. This game should cost like $25.',
       'Could you please add an offline mode...would be nice to practice on the go. Also please please please add more guns. I have been playing this game for a year and still no new guns but glad you are keeping up with the maps. I have this HUGE problem, it says check connection when I have good connection. I tried to restart my phone and reconnect but still doesn\'t work. PLEASE FIX.',
       'I loved the game before. It was one of the best fps game I have ever seen. But after the ban in pc you guys have lost a lot of players. And I too now hate the game. It was moreover greater than counter strike go, but after the ban you guys made all of us disappointed. If you would have continued with this game on pc I am surely telling that this would be known as people\'s choice game. So please consider to it and bring back this game on pc.  Thank you,  Your great full player',
       'The best game I have ever play Is critical ops it is perfect at gameplay control comfortable and of course there graphics.But there is a problem today I have try to open cops when I come at loading and came in the menu it shows authenticating but after a sec it again comes back again j try to happens the same so plz fix it am a pro at this game and I don\'t want restart the game so PLZ FIXXX!! MY NAME IS GTCTHD I know the name is trash but fixxxxc',
       'Pls critical ops i am playing this game for the last to years. I think you should not have changed the brewery. It is very bad and impossible to navigate and very dark. And in my phone there is a bug whenever i play ranked it asks accept i accept but it never shows abd the time runs out and i m never able to play the ranked games.' ],

     [ 'It\'s a great strategic game. PvP is more event driven rather than a free for all.Great value for the money you spend whether it\'s a little or a lot...and the purchases give a little free to your team. Lots of ways to win free stuff and points you can spend on items needed in alliance store and keep up with your wallet warrior team mate. One downside is the support..they can be a little sliw in response time to problems. But they don\'t just ignore you either.',
       'Why does this app request access to make calls/read sms/messages? Un-installed right away.  Edit: That\'s not how it works. Just because you say "your phone is safe" doesn\'t make it safe. You\'re still getting the permission from un-educated users that you can read their messages. That\'s very shady.',
       'Why need to be legendary first to send rallies? In previous games that I played you don\'t need it to send rallies. Rallies are what makes an alliance one and it should be done even if you\'re not in legendary... Still love the game tho..',
       'Less false advertising would be better the game is not like what the video shows I found this on YouTube. May I make a suggestion..dont advertise it like runescape. I don\'t like playing games that false advertise. I am going to be making up a YouTube page where it is going to identify every game on advertising and how the game really is.',
       'Add more features to it. Add some dragon thingy or make it less "PAY FOR PLAY" game don\'t turn it as one of those games who being hated for being stupid for money. This game has a good future already. :) Have a good day',
       'I love this game,  but its money spender game yet what game isnt?  Their support help you in pretty good time most of the time it takes 24 hours but sometime sooner or little later, they add new cool fetures, they do fail to fix some minor things but for the most part it works perfect. One time we had enemy kingdom on our leader boards after KvK they fixed it in less then 1 hour that some great work if you ask me.' ],

     [ 'BEST FREE GAME EVER!! I have been playing for almost a year now and I love this game. You don\'t need to put in money unless you want to play for a long time. Each ad you watch gives you cherries to play the game, so its like getting paid to watch them. I am playing now and I just had to stop and share how fun this game is. If you like BINGO, this is the game for you!',
       'I would give you 5 stars except for the last 3 to 4 days it keeps telling me I have new content over & over. It acts like it\'s updating only to tell me the same thing over & over. I have missed out on getting my daily credits because of this.',
       'I enjoy playing, love the game levels but expensive to play because no he\'s don\'t do much for daily play. Also I think the power up purchase should be that you can keep those bought but not used, waste too many coins with your set up as it is.',
       'This game is so addictive can\'t stop playing it... Everyone should play Pop Bingo it\'s so Fun... I love it... The only thing I have to complain about is the cherries don\'t last you long enough... It\'s kinda hard to build the cherries up.. I wish Thier was More ways to get Free Cherries.. But other then that I can\'t stop playing this game ... Thanks so much for making a fun Bingo Game...',
       'Love love love...Best bingo game. Been playing for years.. I play everyday.   Only problem I have is that I can\'t download on my tablet. I had it and it updated and won\'t let me download again ... Really sucks I much rather play on my tablet😫😥😏',

The whole game main screen becomes unresponsive and stays like that no matters the game is restarted or the damn phone is. Get this thing sorted out Miniclip. You have a reputation to maintain or not?',
       'At first I was skeptical about this game. I had downloaded it and went without playing for a couple of weeks. Then,one day I just happen to open the app and play. Best move I ever made for an app! This game is just flat out addicting, fun and challenging.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much fun it is and that there is, most of the time, something new.  Chalkenign friends and new people always makes for a challenging and fun time waster. Even if I don\'t have the time to play, I still make time!! Haha',

       'Great game, love it.. Encouraged my lad and few friend\'s to download it.  Would be awsome if you could do tournaments though like most other games.  Sort out a tournament mode guy\'s and this would get 5stars on everything all day long... 😉',
       'Uninstalled and reinstalled app because the update made it to where the game was unplayable. Went to login, using Facebook credentials. It says it failed because I would not allow them access to my friends list. Something doesn\'t seem right about that. Never had a game NOT allow me to login, after denying access to my friends list. Sorry, would prefer you not send messages to all my friends with my name tagged on it.',

     [ 'This game was fun about two years ago before MZ started trying to milk players each month for money.  If you buy a package from them,  which ranges from $14.99 to $399.99, make sure you get what you pay for. ..many times you don\'t get everything they promise; especially with the BOGO packages.   MZ will do little if anything to correct the matter.  Also, even after you spend tons of money, if you wait long enough they will give you the same stuff for free to all players.   My advice...find another game to play. ..something more fun and worthwhile. ..and not sponsored by MZ.',
       'First off to all those saying too many ads, there aren\'t any ads. What you\'re seeing is game packs that can be purchased to help you advance within the game. I love the game. Everythingis great. I just wish they would give everyone time to adjust to previous items before creating something new. And also the pricingis too high. $20-$50 is fine but $99 is way too much.',
       'This game has become a cash cow for the developers at MZ. New features are added making the game more complex and diverse weekly. Costing players money. While old features players are familiar with and depend on break down  After contacting MZ you get a nice form letter stating thank you for bringing it to there attention but they hope you understand these things take time to fix.',
       'This game should be awesome, but the updates just come too fast now. I bought 2 packs this week and still got zeroed as soon as i dropped shield. By the time you spend 2 days clicking upgrades, someone is stronger than you and just waiting for you to try to use your new stuff.',
       'It WAS a good game... And then they started pushing to buy packs CONSTANTLY and the game just gets slower and slower and slower. They don\'t care about the experience of the players AT ALL - absolutely terrible UX and UI with zero regard for giving people the actual ability to play the game.',
       'If you want to be at top of this game then be prepared to spend more than the price of a top end BMW in one year. I am not kidding. MZ releases major game changing upgrades every day for several $99.99 packs. Then you get tge worst customer support in the industry. Terrible software quality control and business practices that mirror drug cartels.' ],

     [ 'It\'s fun to play but it\'s like any other build game. But this one you level your building and otherthings to level 4. Then after that you need diamonds to level up. You need to buy them because they only give you one a day!! And you need 80 or more to level up things. So spend that money you dont have!! This game is a HUGE MONEY PIT!! You have been warned!!!',
       'I played this game for 18 months. Was very far in the game. Then they wanted me to do an upgrade. Afterwards I could not get back into the game at all. So I uninstalled and reinstalled it. I ended up having to start all over again. Most games will let you pick back up where you left off in case you get a new phone. This game does not. Other than that is a game of patience unless you have 1000.00 to put into it to advance quickly. It is relaxing to play for the most part. Kids might like it. It teaches how to be wise with money.',
       'Update: have played nearly a year and a half now. Game is fun, graphics good, addicting. You can play without spending one cent, and still have fun.  Good game for killing time or if you really want to invest... many levels and special events await. And the game actually doesn\'t have many glitches in it to be a bother. Liking on Facebook, one can actually hear from the game people about problems. That\'s a big plus.   Comment from 6/2016: Level too high for me to rate it any better. Can\'t rate what I can\'t see. You might wait to make rating it a mission until the level required to play it has been reached',
       'Seem to have issues and when I report them and send screenshots, your answer to all the issues is " clear your cashe and reboot".  Not impressed.  Upset is what I am.  I am not irrelevant.  And what I present to your tech support shouldn\'t be disregarded.',
       'I really love this game!!!! I cnt wait for you to make number 3 cause I love this game. Been playing it since it 1st came out. I would like to buy it as well. I would to know why it\'s so hard to log in on fb and sign in as well wen ur already logged in. Please fix please fix.',
       'Other than the "cannot connect to server" being a recurrent glitch when challenges are having bonus days or you are stupid enough to spend real money on timed competition  boosters...... Oh and the 10 hrs for ballyscape diving happens overnight here so I never get a chance beyond the first dive....  Good gameplay and lots to do instead of just collect and reset' ],

     [ 'I m so excited to unveil what happens next, the energy drains hell too quick. I would love if the energy is increased to a lot more because that is effecting the gameplay and annoys me a lot personally. Leaving this issue, the game is fantastic. I have always loved choice games and this current gameplay is the best of all experiences . I wish to read more through your stories..... ❤',
       'I think this game is really good. I just have one problem. Even though it says my energy is full, it feels like I have nothing. And also the mini game 100 energy seems to last longer than the initial 300 you receive. If you could fix this taht would be great. And if it\'s designed like this can you make energy spending more efficient?',
       'The story-writing is really well done and the art is gorgeous. My only problem is that if you don\'t plan on spending money to buy energy, the story moves really slow even if you get full points on the card mini game and watch the offered video ad. I guess that\'s the idea, though, since it tempts one to spend the money to keep reading. I also get really confused with the plot, itself. Sometimes the direction it goes doesn\'t make sense to me and also, the choices sometimes do something I wasn\'t expecting at all given the wording.',
       'This game really addictive!! The only problem is they don\'t give you enough energy.😒you either have to buy energy or play a mini game to get more energy. The highest energy points that you can get is 100. Plus the 30 points if you watch a video. Other than that the game is AMAZING. The graphics are realistic. It has a lot of romance too. You should definitely download this game if you\'re not bothered about the energy points.',
       'It is really annoying having to play a mini game to get energy in order to proceed in the story. Especially because that mini game is nothing that can be learned by playing more often, it\'s solely based on luck. And getting maximum energy in it, it still only lets you proceed for like 1 minute of the story. Quite annoying because the story itself would\'ve been interesting.',
       'Interesting story so far and great art but the energy runs out far to fast for you to really get very far, even at the beginning which is when the story needs to be able to draw the reader in so you want to come back and read more. Which is why I almost didn\'t continue and was thinking about just giving it up.  Not to mention the ads completely break up the flow of the story and you don\'t and can\'t even get energy from them.  So for these reason I give it a 3 even though I want to rate it as 5, but it\'s just to irradiating to ignore.' ],

     [ 'Yes this is addictive, yes it\'s fun, and it\'s great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don\'t have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it\'s not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it\'s clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.',
       'Way way WAYYY too laggy. It\'s an easy casual game though. I wouldn\'t say it\'s "fun" but it does pass the time and make you want to achieve the little goals. Only goal, make more money in game. That\'s it and you achieve that by not even playing the game so there\'s no challenge whatsoever. Uninstalled after first day reaching about 500 Trillion and force closing 100 times.',
       'This game is enjoyable, but like many have said, it drains battery life. Moreover, it hangs too long when switching planets. I suspect, like many areas of technology, performance testing new updates with older devices is not even a consideration. If it runs smooth on the latest and greatest then it is ready to ship.  Like many mobile games this is a casino. It\'s main existence is to make money. I do not have a problem with this so much, but the events give rewards based on leaderboards. Unfortunately, they are pay to win. You are bombarded with options to pay cash. Making the top charts without spending money is not likely to happen.  This game is a time and battery killer, so keep you charger close by.',
       'It\'s okay, but now that I think about it, it really takes up your free time and battery, to me it is eh no use but adddictive! If I had a choice to choose between a milla-seccond or a minute, I would choose a milla-seccond but technichly, you could just go offline while you are waiting. Cool game! 3 stars.',
       'Earth dollar = moon dollar.. the exchange rate is 1:1 when converting to the megabuck not like you grinded to jus redo earth play in the moon or anything. Events are unfairly calculated as well. If you do not pay $$$ you will not tier above 7-8 tiered rewards, if that even.  Youd think in a capitalist game you would be allowed to have choice over portrait lock. But the game overrides system settings I guess.  Game lags hard when it cant figure out portrait or not.',
       'You should be connected to facebook. So when people change from iPhone to android, we can keep our levels. I just had to restart again and I had 6800 lemons and not much longer to complete the game. What an accomplishment I\'m going to try to receive this time' ],

     [ 'I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn\'t have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn\'t get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren\'t vigilant of their customers and don\'t take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.',
       'I love this game so much. I have been looking for a good shooting game for years and I never found one until I came across this. This is perfect. Me and my friend would spend hours on this game. I have been playing this for about 6 months now. It\'s perfect. I think the best thing about this game is how organized everything is. It is very self explanatory. I found everything and it was easy to do so. I also love how they update this game very often. Great game. I haven\'t had any problems with it. I can\'t wait for updates later on to come.',
       'Game is really tooo gud, graphics also nice n smooth controls but u guys released only one game mode(Team death match), but in lot of fps games they provided free for all, bomb mode, Flag capture n many more modes.. If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games 😀 n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area.',
       'The best shooting game ever. Lobed each and every single thing about this game but there a little suggestion that we can see the player if they are online or not but how is this if we can see there live going on matches? That concept will be great and games lag sometimes so if you can fix this and add my suggestion in guns of boom that will be hell great!! #the best game',
       'I was loving it and have spent alot of money but this update made it to where i can\'t even open it back up. Please fix because i loved this game and have invested time and money and if i don\'t get to play it anymore sometime soon I\'m not coming today back. Please fix very soon i was trying earn a special gun but I\'m not sure if that\'ll be an option if an when it gets fixed',

     [ 'Excellent for including LGBTQ stories, thank you. Also the storyline are interesting and sweet. However, the missing of 1 star to full score is due to long waiting and expensive ticket. I don\'t mind to pay for tickets to support the game but it is quite costly for me. Nevertheless, great game! Keep up the good work and more LGBTQ stories please.',
       'Great app, however if you\'ve completed a story from start to finish, you should be able to play it again for free without the need for tickets. Fix that and I will rate more stars. Also the time for tickets to regenerate should be 1 hour per ticket, or if you\'re insistent on it being 2 hours, increas the maximum amount of accumulated tickets to 4.',
       'I like the idea of the app, but it doesn\'t tell me hiw to get tickets or hearts which means that I can\'t choose romance options which is why I\'m playing on this app as is pretty obvious by the title. My second issue is that I cannot access my last play point on the stkry I\'m in, I keep getting sent back to the prolouge and then after i finish the prolouge again it sends me back to the main menu. Overall, I had a pretty good time playing (except I didn\'t have any hearts), but the navigation of this app is horrendous and I refuse to pay for hearts (which seems to be the only way to get them)',
       'I love the the stories and the graphics, but I wish you didn\'t have to spend hearts to pick some of the choices. Hearts are hard to get (unless you pay for them) and then it always costs so many hearts to use these choices. A lot of times I want to delete the app just because of this, because I can\'t afford to keep buying hearts so I can pick better choices.',
       'Absolutely love this game! My favorites are Astoria and Gangsters in Love! It\'s a great app, but lately I haven\'t been able to play it due to it loading but I\'m not able to push anything or choose a character. Is anybody else having this problem?',
       'The game is really fun. Lots of great stories and I love the new stories. The only thing I dislike is how long we have to wait to get 1 ticket. For example I waited 2 hours and 15 minutes for 1 ticket. Then after a 2-4 minutes episode I have to wait 2 hours again.  The only thing I wished is for the waiting limit not be so long. Besides that, the game is extremely additive and is great! My favorite One is Antares. Can\'t wait for season 4! Amazing game!!' ],

     [ 'Some of the troops are simply overwhelming, e.g. Dragon, while some spells make the troops overwhelming, e.g. Protection on Black Night, Giant Growth on Black Night / Dragon, which generally make no chance of countering (countering is an element for good strategy game). A few suggestions to balance the cards’ power and have good strategy game:   1. Giant Growth: reduce the power-up to 30%, or add time limit to the spell, or disallow the spell to cards with mana 7 and above (unfortunately Unchained Demon with only 3 mana will be spared from this).  2. Dragon: reduce the speed to 2, or reduce the power / health / attack range.   3. Protection: disallow the spell to cards with mana 7 and above, or add time limit to the spell.   4. Vempire: reduce the attack / health / speed, increase health loss %.',
       'I like it ALOT, but unless you can get lucky with good cards as a new player it wont be fun for a while. There is alot of umbalance between newer cards and stock cards, you can get screwed unless you\'re absolitely professional with default cards',

     [ 'This game is good with a very high chance to be one of the great fishing games.  Fishing lures have short info on that specific fish and some are pretty interesting.  Always have a tournament going on and the only bad part is if your just starting out you may not have a lure u can use for that tournament. Don\'t worry you don\'t have to wait to be a certain level to participate so chances are you will eventually be able to be involved. Only complaint I have no option in settings to change kg to lbs.  Other than that you have a fishing game with easy controls that is fun to play.',
       'I purchased lure packs and built an amazing profile, then they game wouldn\'t load for 2 days so I had to uninstall it and reinstall. Once I did all my info was gone and so we\'re weeks of my time and money building up my player profile. Rip Off!!!',
       'I wasn\'t sure how I was gonna like this game, but I am glad I gave it a shot. It is very easy to get addicted to it. People who talk about leveling up fast are just impatient. Enjoy the graphics and smooth gameplay.',
       'I will re rate game when my issue is resolved. I have finished events and not received my packs for what I achieved. I didn\'t even get the gold coins. It has happened on 3 separate events now.',
       'This now is the 3rd time I\'ve download the game, the last as well, the 2nd time it wouldnt let me upgrade the fish, when I went to the game stopped responding and shut down, if it does it this time I will delete it permanently',
       'Absolutely love the detail put into this game. The fun facts about the fish are really cool too. And it\'s always fun to challenge another person. I just wish there was more room for the card packs' ],

Have uninstalled & reinstalled several times & game still doesn\'t load.  **update** Seems the issues with trying to play this game continue. Again have unistalled & re-installed, attempted to load existing game & it sits at "downloading content". Appears there are several players experiencing the same issue.  Please fix.',

     [ 'I really love this game. Of course it WANTS you to spend real money on it, but you don\'t really have to to make progress. Just set stuff up then go back to it later. As per other reviews it does take a while to load, but due to the excellent graphics, music and overall feeling of happiness I get playing this - they are forgiven.',
       'Okay, this is probably the most honest review I will ever take the time to write. The game is beautiful and entertaining...just like everything Disney does. The other thing Disney does EXTREMELY well is suck money from you (I live in Orlando - I KNOW this, Man). I\'m not proud of what I\'m about to say but I just spent $30 on essentially a "Russian Roulette" for Alice in Wonderland characters. It\'s like this...the game is entertaining and enjoyable to an extent...but if you\'re money concisious don\'t download this game. I\'ve played a lot of app games and this one FAR surpasses the need for real money. The game is entertaining and fun if you semi/kinda love Disney stuff because of nostalgia or whatever...but if you\'re a die-hard Disney fanatic...this game will bankrupt you. So, fear it.',
       'OK I love this game, however have a problem, I recently broke my phone had to send it of to get fixed. Have uploaded this game to my iPad have clicked it over to the correct game to keep my level however gets right to the loading section then kicks me out. My iPad is up to date, can you please fix this bug. I haven\'t played for a few games, the tempary phone I have won\'t let me play either. Please fix..',
       'I\'ve given it 5 stars but really it would be 4.5 stars. The prices of things in this game are stupidly high and they don\'t make it easy for you to get money and gems. It will take you months just to save up to expand one square in the kingdom.',
       'Amazing game, even for those who prefer to not spend money like myself. The only thing that I am curious about is that some of the characters need to be bought with gems, but then the reward for completing a set is significantly less gems, so I feel as though the gem based rewards should be for collecting all the characters in a set aside from those that have to be bought.',
       'At first I LOVED this game! I play it everyday. The graphics are amazing. I wish, however, that it wouldn\'t take so long to finish missions. I was super excited to get Wendy for the first 2 weeks. But now I am honestly just bored. I can\'t seem to get enough of the items that Wendy needs. 4 days in a row I have been giving my characters tasks and NOTHING! Not even a stupid ball of wool! And what\'s with the chests?! I spend 60  hard earned gems that took me a month to collect, for a 100 stupid potions and a BENCH??!!! If I am spending 60 gems on a legendary chest, there better be an epic character or a ride in there! If this doesn\'t change, I am afraid I will have to stop playing this game, as it\'s really getting on my nerves. I have been playing it for almost two years. PLEASE, make it more  easily accessible and not determined on real money for awesome characters and things!' ],

     [ 'Your duplication rate is ridiculous. If I\'m spending money on it, I should have a better chance of getting bots I need than someone on free to play. Also your events are meh. Way to club us over the head with a carrot dangled from a stick of things we will never see like 5* bots or the new Prime cores.',
       'The game is addictive it has nice communication between players and is over all fun. The only downside is how long it takes to get a combiner, and if I\'m going to spend money of coins on a crystal then it should be a guaranteed bot that you dont own',
       'It\'s a perfect game for people who love Transformers and all of it\'s different universes. It combines continuities like Beast Wars and the IDW comics into one game. Even with the game\'s amazing features, the game doesn\'t crash or lag when you play it. I am so happy that it\'s works for older generations of certain phones. One thing I am ready for, is to see the Shattered Glass universe to make an appearance.',
       'Decent game.  Robot abilities grant surprisingly deep combat tactics.  Loot box system is skewed to make you spend money on a crystal 3 or 4 times to get the bot you\'re paying for.  Otherwise would be 5 star.  Don\'t spend cybercoins till you but a 3rd builder.',
       'Unfortunately for you, due to randomness of crystals and the fact it duplicates bots so much, I wouldn\'t risk spending money in this game, as there is a high risk of it duplicating a bot I already have. As for a combiner I will never have one as getting the 3* bots required would cost £100s in duplicated bots. If I could purchase specific bots I would.

     [ 'There was a time when you can still feel the dev team\'s gratitude for you choosing their game. But now, its just one paywall after another. Whatever they used to give for free in the past years, they\'ve found a way to turn into cashcrop. I\'ve never been closer to deleting this game than when the latest update came out. If you\'re not a VIP, uninstall it now. They\'ve made a fool out of us.',
       'Well I have played this game from the beginning. And it has been a solid game. The evolution of the game has been astounding for the most part. I have had my ups and downs with it over the years. Yet overall it has been the one game I could never fully quit. I have taken my time from the game a few times. But, every time I come back. It feels as fresh and new as the first time I logged in. And in the world of micro-transactions, Netmarble has been one the most generous companies out there. Thanks for making a solid, fun game featuring characters I grew up reading and loving.',
       'Do not even download this game. It is an absolute scam. At one point it was a good game but you will quickly find all the good characters are locked behind thousands of dollars of paywall. Much of the game is based on RNG and so a lot of the resources you can actually grind for go up in smoke. If you don\'t already have this, stay away.',
       'I love this game. I truly do. That\'s why this hurts. With the Adam Warlock update, I knew I had to be ready to save up crystals, though I did intend to spend a few for new uniforms, but hiding the one for the update\'s protagonist behind 5.5k crystals is a new low, and you haven\'t even soothed the slap on our faces from the Ultimates\' update. I was prepared to buy a new subscription for crystals or bios, but not anymore.  Netmarble, I thought you better than this. You had a good, committed following, yet you abuse us like this.',
       'An amazingly, beautiful made Game, which is a true gem for Marvel fans. Hats off to you guys. I didn\'t thought that android platform will be that big in gaming areas. I am a Hardcore gamer and i know what gaming should look like...and that\'s what it looks like - Future Fight. I hope you guys will improve the game from time-to-time so that we can\'t get bored of it.',
       'Updates? Updating means improving something, you\'re just digging a bigger hole NM.. I used to spend £10 a month on this, now it\'s not even enough to unlock the new characters... Many of my free to play friends stopped playing, and I\'m 1 update of following them.. Just can\'t be bothered with the grind, and the other option is pumping money into it. That\'s not gonna happen anymore.' ],

     [ 'The game is called "Battlewallets" even the biggest spenders in the recent update cant believe the new prices. Their rating is bought by bribes and they give special privileges to some players using codes. Devs are pretty much destroying their own game. Pay to win game not for free to play game like it says in their game. The smaller players suffer(everyone now suffers in recent update) the most in this game. so i highly recommend taking your business elsewhere folks not worth the frustration. Use the money to get a new car instead of a buying into a red class carrier. After this update most will quit. Again Pay to win not a free to play.',

     [ 'If you\'ve liked the first game you\'re probably gonna enjoy this one. It\'s more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it\'s built around microtransactions so if you\'re feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don\'t understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it\'s likely you\'re going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren\'t aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don\'t expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!',
       'I love this game! One thing though, I believe that there are too many plants that cost real money to get. Could you please make some more plants that you can get them by being able to unlock them by playing the game, instead of ones where you have to use real money. Besides that, this is a really great game!',
       'Free to play games are always the same formula: Starts off addictive, gets more challenging, starts encouraging you to buy gem equivalent, forces you to buy gem equivalent. At least most other games are fair with it though, giving you a chance. PVZ 2 does not. Levels go quickly from fun to I\'m done, and become impossible. I\'d love to see developers or game testers try to complete later levels without gems, especially Big Wave Beach. It\'s a shame, as the first game remains a classic. Buy the first game and Garden Warfare if you like it. Leaf this game alone, it\'s a sprout at best. Oh and remember, if zombies try to break into your house, throw your money at them.',
       'Love this game so much! I am a huge PVZ fan anyway and I love playing this. You do need some boosters to get past levels, which feels a bit like cheating sometimes, but you can earn plenty of coins. There is always a new quest to play so even when I\'m stuck on the other levels I can still play. This is a great game, well done devs!',
       'BEST EVER GAME I HAD PLAYED IN MY LIFE!!!!!  Great game! Too addictive and it is the best favourite game ever and the hardest edition you will ever find in it. Even challenging.

     [ 'Game has so much potential and is a blast. I\'m giving it a bad rating because gems are insanely expensive and they have so many buttons to hit to "use 200 gems to remove 3 lines" as one example or another to lose 200 by placing the button right above the back button on a phone. Super lame move on devs to intentionally take insanely expensive gems from us by mistake. No confirmation or anything, just boom, gone. Lacks ethics to say the least rinow',
       'Such a shame. The game is great, really enjoyed the concept however it is a prime example of how monetisation strategy can ruin a game. Gems too difficult to earn without buying them, and purposely easy to accidentally spend them. Too many ads too. I\'d rather have paid for the game. Deleted it after a  day or so.',
       'Not What It Used To Be  The second to last update I did for this app switched the aim of the ball to slightly off from where you point it. So now have to compensate (guess a bit) when you\'re aiming which makes play more challenging.  Likewise, levels beyond about 440 are becoming impossible to beat w/o saving like a weeks with of bonuses to use on each level. Beating one level a week is hardly fun anymore! I may be uninstalling this app soon.',
       'Games fine. I refuse to rate a game well when it\'s annoying ads start pushing political agenda against gun owners. Will go elsewhere',
       'Great game.   But one of the adverts is a virus.   The IG Academy advert wrecked my game and now my phone\'s being a pain in the ass',
       'I really this game, plenty of challenging levels, very addictive for sure. I just got a new phone and was bummed to have to start all over (had gotten to level 360) but my new phone came with an updated/better version so now I\'m stoked on it all over again. Sometimes I wanna quit this game but I never do.' ],

     [ 'Would of gaven 5 stars. But there some bugs that need to be worked out. Like connection and handling. But other then that this game is really close to PUGB for the phone. Massive open world. COULD do little better on the mechanic of the game but nothing to major. Would like to have a better money earn system like small amout per kill or something. This game is well dont. Ive played almsot all games on gogole play and when i say this game is fun I MEAN IT!!..',
       'I like the game, but I have a few things I would like added. One thing is instead of joystick controls maybe there could be an option that allows you to have buttons to move like in vehicle mode where you can switch from the gas pedal to the four buttons. Also I would love a first person mode, I think that would make the game so much cooler and better, just a new way of playing. And Maybe a mode like a TDM would be cool. Just some suggestions, thanks for reading love the game!',
       'It was a good game till there is alot of cheater. Please ban all those hacker@cheater. I have been killed by so many cheater. They can shoot through wall n walk through it. How the fuck am i suppose to win a game like this. Sadly it was a good game till you guys stop doing the job n enjoy all the money from people who buy diamond n do not ban all those cheater.',
       'Thank you for constantly improving the game. Id say at this point not to add more but to fix and adjust what you already have. Fine tuning before more additions would be great. Optimizing sounds, movements, vehicles, rendering, scoping, responses, all that good stuff would be great. Its a little laggy but thats just what you get for a giant game and 100 million+ players. Love it either way.',
       'Fun game, especially since it\'s free. But I saw that this game supports controllers so I tried to use my pro switch controller with it and so far only 2 buttons seem to work, as well as a huge delay from input to actual action. And I can\'t seem to customize the controller layout, so I\'m just stuck with the Ability to walk and crouch/lay down with said controller. Can\'t aim or shoot.',
       'The game has so much potential they just need to make it easier to see other players and easier to shoot people close to you. Also the game doesn\'t need to look realistic they should make it more like fortnite graphics and gameplay wise.  My main point is that it is too hard to see others in the game. still a good game though' ],

     [ 'So I\'m changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it\'s a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I\'d rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!',
       'GAME CODE reveals ROLLS ARE NOT RANDOM - they\'re pulled from a table of predertirmined outcomes, designed to MILK YOU FOR MONEY at a set rate, based on PvP, reg. Game, Event, Boss, etc.  Just like slot machines & video poker (which i programme).  You must \'assemble\' high scoring games, like a puzzle, with majority of yahtzees sitting after 4 or 8 rolls (1 or 7 bonus \'dice\'(money) spent)... Like a choose your own adventure book that can cost Hundreds of Dollars.',
       'Scopely is the most greedy, disgusting company I have ever seen. The ads they have littered into the game play literally crash the game at least 4 times during a match. You will see about 10 ads on top of the crashing per game; you could be in mid roll and the ad will ruin it. So desperate for money.. Don\'t support scopelys terrible practices.',
       'This game cheats! Don\'t get me wrong, I love it and am going to keep playing. But WAY more often than it should, it tallies up your opponents score wrong to make you lose. I count and take screen shots. If you get upset at things like that, it isn\'t for you. But if you don\'t care that much, like me, it\'s absolute fun! Adorable names given! Awesome dice to win! Very entertaining! Battle real people or the game! Just don\'t be a sore loser even when mathematically your a winner!',
       'I\'ll give this game more than one star once the showdowns are less about the computer clearing and more about real challenge.  Once you start a showdown the computer conveniently never gets a bad roll.  Which wouldn\'t be a big deal except you have to wait to challenge them again unless you want to pay for extra dice which is used to unlock everything else.  Kinda cheap.',
       'Horrible game, stupid graphics looks like a preschooler did it, games are definitely rigged you hardly ever beat the house. To much stuff going on on this board you have no clue where to go to get to anything. The old game was easier to navigate. You should give people the option to keep the old game.' ],

     [ 'But says you can use coins to buy chips and havnt seen where I can do that yet. Ive traded Gems for a chip and coins and I dont get the chips everytime. When I have 2 cards and I Bingo on one and Im still playing card 2 why am I not allowed to Bingo on that one as well when that happens ? I have done that a couple of times. But wouldn\'t accept it. Love it now thank you for fixing it !!!!',
       'I started with Bingo Bash and am now a bingo junkie! I really like the different ways they have made it more fun and challenging. You don\'t have to spend a lot to play and to win. I love it!! I haven\'t had any bad incidences,it has all been good to go...Bingo!!! Been playing BB for a year straight,now. I am definately hooked. The rooms are getting more interesting each  year! This isn\'t your Gramma\'s Bingo anymore. Enjoy, I sure do.',
       'Good game. Difficult to get Bingo\'s. Bingo reward to low, you really only get the value of the card back. daily bingo chip allowance to low.  Would be better if more free chips were available for those who cannot afford to purchase them such as pensioners. Daub alert should be on all cards for those with vision difficulties. A lot more fun to play when unlimited power ups are active.',
       'I would really like this game more if u took the rocket out, or have it as an option. I dislike that part immensely b 1/6 update. Getting bored with it. Obviously with bingo u have no control over numbers called. But so far and few do u get a bingo',
       'This game is cool, need to fix the near last calls of numbers to be able to press it for a bingo, doesn\'t give you a chance, game over. It\'s ridiculously hard to get buy cards and most duds. aside from that I like it, double up is cool. Need more game to continue to level up. Been playing awhile and I still enjoy bingo bash',
       'This game is addictive and with each new game the pay out gets a little better. Wish they didn\'t cost so many tokens to play. But hey got to try to get us to spend money somehow. I guess I\'ll just have to keep winning. I\'m hooked not ashamed to say it. I had 4 bingo games dl on my phone now only have this one. I\'m picky about my games so it must be good' ],

     [ 'not gonna mention too much ads, doesn\'t bother me so much. what bother me are words that dont belong in certain language ( specifically  Croatian here). PAZL isn\'t Croatian word for god sake. Lose too much time seeking that word to finish level ,I\'ve lost my nerves. and thats one of many. stupids',
       'I don\'t know how good is game on other languages but in Croatian it sucks. I\'m deleting this game because of constant repetition of non-existent words in Croatian language... Even all dialects included. I even purchased few times coins just to see which word is it and it wasn\'t Croatian.',
       'An ad after EVERY SINGLE TASK? Really? Too much for me, thanks. Otherwise, the game is fun, graphic is good, I like the variety of languages to choose from. Battery goes to hell while playing, even with sounds off - that\'s also an issue.',
       'Why so much ads??? Continuously during game and after each level two more fullscreen ads. And I can\'t pay without providing personal data. Very bad',
       'Okay app, would have given more points but waaaay too many adds. After each level  an add pops up which is very annoying.',
       'Excelent game, but I think that I found something which is not necessarily a bug, but it might be a design flaw. I am playing in eng. lang. and if I need to enter 2 similar words, in my case these were "oar" and "boar", application recognized later, longer word first, even if i entered "oar" first, but system rejected it as incorrect one...' ],

     [ 'Hate the new update. What\'s with you and all these chibi things? You\'ve done it before and based on the review, your players love the Mature and Realistic style much better. So why you changed back again? You have totally Lost your Identity and Uniqueness as LoA game.  If you planned on doing this, why don\'t you do it in the first place? so we don\'t have to waste our time and money!',
       'What\'s with the chibi hero icons? 😭 The artwork was so good and everything works smoothly before the update. Also, during battle, it\'s lagging. In my  opinion, the previous one is way better than current. I\'ve been a fan of different LoA versions, please don\'t ruin this one. 😟',
       'I *HATE* the new style. The reason why I liked this game in the first place was because there were no chibi characters. Dominion has no instructions and seems rather useless - but could be developed into something cool. The team formation doesn\'t have a way to sort your characters (I wish it was ordered by BR). I can get used to the new layout but for right now adjusting is hard. Thanks for developing the game more but please go back to the original character designs.',
       'Update on 2/23 made the game worse. Originally i gave this game a 5 star but with this update it feels more like a 3 star if not 2 star game. I get that you have to update games to keep it fun but sometimes you shouldn\'t change something just for the sake of change. Why not add content instead of trying to fix something that isn\'t broken.',
       'I started playing this game few days ago and I liked it so much. The graphics, controls, story all we\'re very interesting and addictive. Until the developers decided to update this game and completely ruin it and making it just like other mainstream RPG genere with ordinary graphics.   They just completely removed the story of the game and now every stage looks like I\'m playing some Angry Bird infact even that game has some story to every level.   In conclusion, this game was more fun before the update but now it\'s like ordinary RPG.',
       'Originally sold on the realism of artwork, then slapped in the face with ugly-by-comparison cartoon representations after last update. If they want a game with this style, go make one. Don\'t suddenly apply it into a game people are already invested in and were sold on realism in character visuals. Every preview image for the download page is now practically a lie. Might come back, despite the complete lack of foresight and consideration to the players, should they properly change the artwork back. Otherwise I\'ll be uninstalling and thinking twice before ever touching another GTarcade related game.' ],

     [ 'Played many times and game play is ok and its quick to connect to opponents. But the dice suck!! Not sour grapes but all to often when you are in an unbeatable position the opponent will throw 4 doubles or exactly the right sequence of dice to win. This im sure is to encourage payment of coins. Not the best because of this bit could be.  Its a shame it ruins the fun totally!! Edited as the dice really are pants! Ive played many backgammon games online and they do not re-act like these do. There is definatly an issue that needs to be resolved as they don\'t drop as they should. I am sure the other reviews are accurate regarding the dice',
       'Really?? Its absolutly riggged!!, cant believe people rate it 5 stars... first you win, they ask u to rate it and them you lose with impossible dice combinations... dont waste your time and money with this app.',
       'I\'ve been playing this on my computer & 2 other cell phone for months. Since Xmas update I have installed & uninstalled from my cell 35x & the screen locks every time at 94% & won\'t play. PLEASE FIX!  Game was the best I\'ve found & I really enjoyed playing it.  Almost Impossible to use skills against unbelievable - impossible rolls & Dbls. Some players know how to hack game.  I Played in clubs professionally 38 yrs.  When I\'m winning other players roll 6-7 dbls in a row & win with impossible odds at the end of the game. 14 dbls in 1 game - NOT in real life. Never in life rolled 10 dbls in 1 game.',
       'This game is full of shit. The logic behind the dice is rigged to roll the exact numbers for you to lose. This in return causes you to lose free money and spend real money to purchase more. You can predict what it will roll. Uninstalled this!',
       'The game is rigged and they steal 25% of all your winnings... They\'re after your credit card like starved vampires after fresh blood! AVOID IT',

So maybe admin you could take a look at it for us please as I would totally love to keep playing this game as its a great game to play especially when your winning down after such along day.. Thanks',
       'Got too allgegro madness. And got stuck with the no face cards. 14 cards is alot to get. In fairway blast the card suits stick until a new none face card comes up, or reshuffles them. I find with this game they dont stick when the next card is turned over. So your run ends. And the run cards you ave accumulated as returned back to one agan.',
       'It\'s a fun game!! can keep you very entertained only thing that sucks is if you have it on PC or iOS there are way more features and it\'s way better than the Android version!!😢 So the side note is for the developers at Big Fish Games....... So I think we\'ve all waited way too long it\'s time to step it up and come out with a greater Android version at least make it as good as the iOS version!!!!!?????',
       'People will tell you that it\'s good for your brain or that it\'s fun, but that really isn\'t true, especially since it won\'t even allow you to turn off hints. Immediately after you make a move, you can\'t even think for yourself and try it alone. It\'s annoying. Don\'t get it. Go to a different solitary game.',
       'I love solitaire games, but this game is impossible. The first rounds will be easy, and then you\'re hit with ridiculous difficulty and straight up unwinnable games, that is, unless you spend money to get power ups that shouldn\'t even be necessary. 100% pay to win game. Which I find very sketchy. I\'ll never download anything from these developers ever again.',
       'PLEASE change where the 5 extra card for 2000 bucks is! I love this game but when you\'re short on money and you accidentally press it.... aaaaarggh. I\'m pretty sure others don\'t like where it is either. Could be a perfect game. And I spend hours a day on it as I\'m bedbound. Please...' ],

       'Your dictionary needs updated!!! Does it only have 50 words in it? Because when I find extra words the game has no clue. Most important, the puzzles won\'t let you spell the word. I spelled candle 50 times, used all the hints and it spells cand,..it won\'t allow me to put in l, e. !! Because there is another pre-used letter between.  Game sucks due to these reasons.',

The idea was to see if it was fun and interactive as well as giving her brain a bit of a work out/ stimulate recovery and memory. I found myself addicted to it so i downloaded it on my own phone too - even my step father is addicted ha! Its fabulous. I also recommend paying for the lowest package of \'hints\' because all packages remove the adds (which are the only down side to this game. I paid 69p for 10 hints and it removed all the add - yay!)',

       'Pay to win. Some players will shell out hundreds (edit: THOUSANDS) of dollars to crush you. Mostly non-interactive combat. Laggy severs... This pulls it down for me. Otherwise it\'s a great rehash of the builder browser games of old.',
       'Too many new updates have ruined the game.... also a lot of glitches you\'ll wake up one morning after units will be dead yet no one has attacked you and there is nothing in your mailbox support will never get back to you about it. All in all could be a great game, but they focus on re wrapping events then fixing / improving game mechanics',
       'Nice game. Somewhat unbalanced and you will have to spend some money to make progress in finite time. The players are really great to have fun with. Unfortunately the last magic update fom 12/17 will frustrate new players and will kill the game in the long run, if the company does not change it. The background is, that players can not protect themselves anymore against raids by higher level players anymore and thus will not be able to accumulate enough resources to level up.',

This game is completely free although buying things with real money can make it easier on you and the cost to buy things for this game is pretty cheap and reasonable. I have yet to find any bugs or anything I hate. It\'s a great time killer!',
       'played this game for less than a week. it was fine until i saw the major prob. yes most of negative reviews were right, pay to win. i accepted that a bit coz most of games are now like that, but having enemies 6 levels higher than you., crushing your castle unli times. looting your sources and leaving you with hundred of thousands soldiers on hospital. that needs hundred of thousands of resources and more than 4 hours to heal... thats pathetic. giving this game a bad rating..' ],

     [ 'Well, I still liked Duel Generations better, and wish that that game would work again, but I have to admit that visually and game play wise Deul Links is pretty amazing. Especially for a free game. I haven\'t gotten very far into it yet, but so far it\'s intuitive and just really slick looking. However, there is one reason I still would prefer Generations, and that is because I loved the inclusion of ALL versions of Yu-Gi-Oh, not just the first series. I grew up with 5DS  and Zexal more than anything, and I wish that those series could be incorporated into the game somehow. I\'d love to be able to play as Kite or Astral or something.',
       'this truly an amazing game, there\'s really only a couple of things, why reduce the monster and spell/trap zones to only 3 cards? I wouldn\'t say it\'s bad, I just don\'t see why you\'d need to do it.. plus the average deck size of yugioh is between 40 and 50 cards, why limit us to only a max of 30 cards? (not including the 5 for extra  decks) but all in all its a great game! Finally got my six samurai deck!😄 also, I think it\'d be an awesome idea to put in a way for duelists to redeem the codes on the cards they\'ve purchased IRL. I bet that\'d get even more duelists to play! Just a thought though😊',
       'Never played Yugioh this is the first time in this game and it is easily accessible with this game to get into this card game. I liked Yugioh better than the other TCG game like Pokémon,Hearthstone,Magic etc and I thought they are kind of more complicated for me because of their sourcing system like mana and energy while its all about monster cards, traps and spells etc. Very good card game and newbie friendly in general both those wanting to get into Yugioh and card gaming in general :D',
       'Found Yu-Gi-Oh on Netflix last week and decided to rewatch it. A few episodes in, and my love for the show rekindled, I got eager to play the game myself. I used to play with Yu-Go-Oh cards when I was a kid but it\'s been about 12 years since then and so all my old cards are in the loft, not that I know anyone IRL anymore who would fancy a game anyway, and not accessible right now... plus I had forgotten most of the rules too. But this app is just what I was looking for: a way to relearn the rules and have a bit of fun. Perfect for whatever skill level you\'re at with the game!',
       'Just sad if only they could fix the  zone to 5 monsters spell and trap cards. Plus the starting with 5 cards and the original deck size and life points to 8000 it would be soo good. Hope you do that and fix it im sure more ppl would  play this if you do',
       'Trash, true fans would never say this game is great. Only 3 monster and spell/trap zones and the person that goes first only starts with 4 cards? Really? Not to mention the terrible camera angles and rigged matches. If you\'re a competitive player that doesn\'t like to get bs, don\'t play this.' ],

Dh already decided who must win and who must lose, it got nothing to do with cards and your luck. once Dh chooses some to lose,  that person will lose whole day. BIGGEST NO to this game downloaders',

       '*Update Very greedy company-&gt; bad rating from me! They sell packages for 200-300 dollars! What\'s worse is that there are people who are stupid enough to pay for it. Aside from that a very cool game. To be at the very top it is pay to win. Besides that really cool. Lots of heroes and therefore possibilities.',
       'My first review disappeared so I will leave another.  This game was great at first, then it started inserting the buyable characters such as Batman, Assassin\'s Creed and they are so over powered, one of them can take down your whole team without taking any damage.  Game is now so unbalanced that it isn\'t worth playing.  Until they fix the game, it worth playing.  Unless you like wasting money to feel like a god with over powered characters.  Game is dead, play something else.',
       'Stale content for over a year with no improvements or heroes unless you drop a paycheck on the game. Pet system ruined the arena. Don\'t waste your time here.',
       'Had the potential to be good but they care more about money than a good game, once you progress so far you will constantly lose to ppl who have bought characters that are vastly over powered. They will auto reply and say plenty of ppl still have fun without out paying, I made it to level 65 and it\'s just not true.' ],

To the point that you coukd build a massive defence really early. 5x maxed out super monkey gods with 5 money making farms maxed at level 20 into the match...... i thought it was hacking. Nope, for $10 you can get 2x cash.... pretty much the only way to do the higher levels, or spend forever grung enough $$ with special towers.   Fun game, i got to deep, trying to get out.',

Would enjoy more. challenging maps, balloons and restrictions to maps. as well as new agents and towers.  Be looking forwards to see what you have in store for the future. (P.S. Sas needs that too)',

Sort it out guys, and you\'ll get your five stars back! Oh, and one more thing... I\'ve got nigh on 4m credits in game, what am I supposed to spend them on? Maybe in the shop options we could buy dilithium with our credits, say 500,000 credits for 5000 dilithium?',

The wait times are not insane and nor does it feel like a pay to win game - take note, thats exactly the kind of game im willing to spend money on! The support for the game is good too. Suggestions for improvement : Make ship upgrades easier to obtain, more crew spots in space battles, increase crew limit above 25 thats a bit low. Other than that i love it thanks DB games!',
       'This is my second review and as I said in the first one this is a great game, but once again , along comes an update and ruins it. Updated the game and now I can\'t get into it at all !! The support is a complete Joke,  I message them three times after the last update  and never got one rely.  Great game ruin by terrible support  !!!',
       '3 stars mostly because the latest update broke the app for me. Didn\'t load, just a black screen. Left it for 10 minutes and nothing. Tried multiple times. Fixed it by uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Also a little pricey for what you get. So lower the price or make it so you get more bang for your buck.',

       'It is a great game, very complex, very unique and the graphic is great. I have joined a crew but was not able to join a fight or support a crew with my own space shuttle during a fight....But perhaps Iam too new, I do not know where everything is.

       'There is lots of good things about this game but I think we need more elements and characters and higher star ratings or new ratings more cooler looks to characters like evolving them more with more evolving them to more stages plus more things to do in the game like boss arena or like some more types of reward things with hard battle boss mode and such still love it tho keep it up',
       'Very nice game but crashes ALOT unfortunately on Nvidia Shield K1 and long loading time after each crash some battles impossible due to crashing almost guaranteed for longer fights',

       'I\'ve always liked the design of the different factions and creatures in the HOMM series of games, so it\'s nice to find a game which focuses more on them.  Graphics are great and the menus are easy to navigate. My only grievance is that the RNG aspects of the game can let you down more often than not, but it\'s not a deal-breaker for me. Awesome game, I definitely recommend giving it a try!' ],

     [ 'This is a pretty good app,  but when building it needs an option to replace a room with another type. You shouldn\'t have to spend all your caps to rework a floor plan, especially when you built everything not knowing you could combine rooms since the help pop ups didn\'t mention that until after you had been building a while.  Other than that it is thoroughly acceptable.',
       'I love this game so much! It\'s very addicting and challenging. I love the animation I am all for it. I think though that one thing that would help is a pregnancy bar of some sort to tell you how long your person is pregnant for. That\'s something that I would add and maybe some times you get a huge wave of people and then you lose resources and such faster I think that may make it more challenging, but overall I love this game!',
       'I love this game, it\'s really fun. The only thing I wished was that when the characters level up, it actually does something more than raise their health. Like, increase stats in the place their working, or increase production. Maybe not every level, but there should be more benefits to leveling up. When bringing wastelanders back, let\'s say they are gone for an hour and you start to bring them back, when you get to ten minutes before they get home and put them back to exploration, they shouldn\'t jump back to where they started, from an hour. Idk. But I love the game.',
       'This game is so very exciting to play. As an avid fan of nearly all Bethesda games, this is a great mobile representation of their Fallout Universe. The gameplay is enticing and there is always something new around every quest; however it should be noted every quest storyline has variance, the quest gameplay is similiar between all. Comparing your dwellers from the beginning to a week into the game and there is a sense of accomplishment. The customisation of the dwellers and vault rooms is satisfying. The only thing I would add that isn\'t already presented, would be multiplayer. A way to send dwellers or explore eachothers vaults. If this option exists, and I just don\'t see it, I apologize.  Great game. Love to play.',
       'I really enjoyed this game but upgraded phone from s5 to note 8 and can\'t get my old game save back. Tried to follow steps and load from cloud but nothing loads. Wouldn\'t really care about starting over so much if I hadn\'t spent money on the game. Hopefully developer helps me out. I can screen shot order history to verify in game purchases if need be.',
       'Fallout shelter is a fun, beautiful quick game you can keep coming back to. For me fallout shelter is one of my most favorite games on mobile and keep coming back to even after over a year of playing it. They keep updating it to. There are plenty of things to collect as well as people u might know from the other fallout games. Really really fun and love the cartoony graphics as well as the easy controls. Great to kill time' ],

Or can you just give him A prize likely the strode, you could make him 8000 and can you add other Jason\'s like slasher and unstoppable?and at last,can you make more of the campaign? Other than this, the game is perfect. You are doing a good job',
       'Earlier I rate this Game 5 star. But now I am giving lower rating because Probability of getting Diamond characters are very less and also there are no challenges for Diamond characters except Shao khan.. But on other hand there are players or hackers who have all Diamond characters max Fused... So it means this game is only for hackers... Please improve this....  .',
       'I love the game but I need help 3 of my players are stuck in a quest that\'s been already finished and it keeps showing that they are on a quest while I have3 other quests running at same time. So I can\'t use them for anything until the quest mode releases them and the quest they were on has been completed days ago. But all in all a effin amazing game. I figured its just a lol glitch any advice on what to do?',
       'Good game but it needs to have a better choice of fighters and should not cost so many souls for them. Also the challenge mode when you have to choose a specific character it should be easy to buy them. Relic mode is by far the most ridiculous part of the whole experience. You can pay up to a 100 souls just for a little bit of health',
       'I really love this game, this game is so addictive I played every single time until I reach level 51. BUT just a few minutes ago I did game update, and when I opened it to start to play ALL MY PROGRESS IS GONE! IT START ALL OVER AGAIN SINCE LEVEL 0!! PLEASE HELP ME TO GET BACK ALL MY PROGRESS!! If I really should start all over again, I choose to delete this game perhaps',
       'I really liked the quest mode. Its a bit of reward for players who play this for a long time. Please please please remove shield powerups as hackers exploit it effortlessly. Some tines they do that more than 3 times in a single fight session without swiching character\'s . Imposible to win faction wars even with my maximum fused level 50 gold characters.' ],

The pricing is pretty outrageous for a mobile game. $35 for a t5? I paid less than that for my Matilda IV on WOT. Please address this issue. So we can actually show you our patronage. You occupy our spare 15 minutes. Not hours daily. Think of where this is played and charge accordinly. That\'s all I have to say.',
       'Haifuri brought me here I am sure this will be a pretty interesting game. I heard hsf harekaze and hsf spee is going to be here cant wait for it....  I encountered a game bug.. I was using a destroyer class ship and the steering wheel won\'t turned after I  pressed the left steer the ship just went on spinning left...please resolve this issue\'s',
       'I do like this game. The support team is good and are helpful when they can be. But the silver and points awarded are much too low in my opinion, when in comparison to the costs of modules and supplies consumed during battles. Also the supply crates could stand to be better. The ships are pretty awesome and are very well rendered. Very good graphics. Everything runs smoothly with no lag or server issues.',
       'Connection issues. Don\'t bother with playing on hotel Wi-Fi. The mcDs or the coffee shop. Forget about it on 3G. Because you need to have a full wired connection just to not hop around the map with the superb lag spikes. Spending tons of time shooting and hitting the enemy getting zero registry. In short good looking game spent hundreds of hours on the desktop version. But this doesn\'t seem keenly executed. Not connected to my desktop account? Why bother?',
       'This is a great game!!.  Yes, computers have issues, yes its short then the PC version.  This is not a PC.  This is a great 5 minute break.  I play the PC game too.  Its flipping fantastic.  The programmers at WOW are brilliant  and they care about the product.  If you love histroy, Warships, strategic games pitting you against other human players.  GET THIS YOUR GAME.  There are other warship games.  None get it more right then WOW.',
       'The games mechanics and controls need an overhaul. The secondary weapons should be automated as fast firing ships operating in touch screen controls requires immense micro management. Second, the post battle screen graphs extremely limited battle details and the UI is equally as lacking in features and navigation. Finally, the battle time is far to short and the majority of battles are ended with ships still in action on both teams. Potential to be a 5 star rating when the mechanics become as user friendly as they they are on PC.' ],

     [ 'Love this game...best WWE Game on mobile, and I\'ve played them all. So addicting I spend money on it. I do wish it was easier to get TP, and tokens to level up superstars. I\'ve been playing for almost a year, and have EASILY spent 6 or 700 on this game, and only have 1 three star superstar....only because i bought TP  and Arn Anderson crate over Christmas!! For some reason, I\'m still addicted.',
       'Real talk. The game is a blast but if you are going into it thinking its free to play you will be in the pit of misery for a long time. It takes money to get up to par really quick and its always fun to watch the cpu combo you to death when you have 0 control over it. But take the bs with the good and its a fun game but dont think for free is for me on this one. Gotta pay to play.',
       'Much better update. Battery life is actually decent. No freezes yet. I like the new system to make more coin. Still a grind, but I don\'t mind. I spend some money here and there. Suggestions: bring women\'s division. Unlock finishers, seriously, Bray Wyatt doesn\'t use a Stone Cold Stunner. Please add new music. Thanks!',
       'I believe I started playing this game of April of last year. I upgraded my phone and the company can not retrieve my old account. I paid money to play this game. I attempted to retrieve my old account in which they requested a transaction ID which I sent them in a text and picture format. They are unable to find my account so the money I spent is gone. Please do not spend money if you want to play this game. There are dozens of gem games out there that will fill that void. I know it is a Wwe licensed product but please be aware that you may lose money because of their terrible account migration system.',
       'Love the game except now it\'s not going past the loading screen and can\'t get on to play has been like it since last update... have waited giving the benefit of the doubt that a new update may come and fix whatever bug has caused the issue but still no joy... please fix galaxy s8 new update still not working',
       'The concept is great, game is great but i think  devlopers sucks a big time. Its all about greed, thay are after your money only. Odd are very poor, after a point of time you realised that you hv left no interest . So many glitches and its all about spending real money for decent progress. I wish they realised that long term strategy is good instead of making some dollars by pushing for purchase.   I wish somebody else will takeover this game.' ],

     [ 'Hi! I\'m having some issues here as the game wasnt loading well the whole day thus I have re-installed it. My level is back to my previous gae; however to my shock, all my hard-earn power-ups are 0 now. Is there anything you can do to retrive them back??TT Thank you~~ I really enjoyed this game.',
       'This game is great! The characters make the game play more fun than just matching items. And when I get close to not beating a level their lips quiver and worry and make me laugh. So if you are a lighthearted fun person you will love this cute game.',
       'Best match game! This matching game is the best from all of the different matching games I\'ve tried. It\'s so colorful and refreshing! The characters are adorable and I love the art style. It\'s also really fun when you\'re about to fail a level and the characters get teary-eyed. 😅',
       'A lot like candy crush with some interesting twists. Every switch from puzzle screen to menu screen brings up a loading page that takes a really long time. Over all though a good app for kids.',
       'Just keeps getting worse!  Great update! I have to close it after 3 games because the screen flashes!  You get x3 and they give you 1. All the "review highlights " are from an older version!  May have been ok back then, but jam city has added scam to it. Unable to remove last cracker with balloon, yet they take one of them from me. Watch a stupid ad and the screen goes black or flashes.  Restart and that life has been lost.  Or, watch an ad and you don\'t get the booster.  Some levels are faded and cant be played.  Shut it down and that life has been lost.  81 did it 3 times.  These people have no integrity.',
       'I\'m on android playing. Lots of friends. Lots of lives. Only problem that I keep reporting is when I click on free booster I get an ad \'slots era\' that freezes my game. JuiceJam won\'t have ad fixed so I am hardly playing.' ],

     [ 'Love this game. Its not pay to win like so many others however if you choose to pay its priced fairly. Lots to do on a daily basis and seems to be pretty fair when summoning/ pulling/picking as well. I got a great pull my 2nd try. Doesn\'t seem rigged like other games where you never have a chance of getting anything good. This game seems fair which I can appreciate. I\'ve played and tried many games. I\'d definitely recommend this game whether your looking for a fun game to play or just something to pass the time. Keep up the good work 7 Palidans.',

     [ 'I\'ve played CE for almost a week now. I like the art and concept of the game. Interesting idea of heroes. I highly recommend it if you enjoy playing idle rpg games like dungeon rush and idle heroes. The only problem that I noticed so far is there\'s limited things to do. More content is required for extended gameplay, otherwise 15-20 minutes everyday is more than enough to do everything there is to do. A 5 star, nevertheless. I don\'t see any reason to be a VIP yet.',
       'Dev\'s other game, Epic Summoners, and this one, are essentially clones of other games. But, as games like Grim Dawn are essentially clones of Diablo, yet do the genre justice, so do these games. You will find so many familiar mechanics to other popular games. Done well, my only issue being the "need" to spend cash to truly advance. Other than that, art is awesome, enjoyable, and worth at least a download and playtime.',
       'I wouldn\'t even call this a game, you\'ll "play" 20-30 mins worth a day and all your doing is collecting things and put them into slots. The graphics and art are actually really good that\'s why I download this in the 1st place.',
       'Pay to progress, simple as that. Servers are dead as no one wants to fork out cash for every event that on the whole offer no real game play. Remaining players have spent hundreds and lord it over people like children. Emphasis on paying is madness, it costs £20 for 10 scrolls. You need 600 for top tier reward... Played a shameful amount and without paying you get nowhere. But drop rates and RNG is so poor you don\'t want to pay.',
       '15 minutes after starting game and I\'m still not able to do anything just follow tutorial squares... Maybe this game is just a tutorial. I got level 12 by just pressing yellow tutorial squares. It\'s like when teacher tell you to write on board 2+2=4 without letting you to solve it on your own. And after that you just follow instructions, will teacher give you certificate of nuclear physics. I don\'t know when tutorial ends, but I have enough, and I am uninstalling this "click here" game.',
       'Really great graphics, and they spent a lot of time and effort on the look of this game. For an idle game, it\'s gorgeous! That drew me in to a type of game I don\'t usually play. So far, I haven\'t paid, but I think I will put some into it, since I\'m enjoying it so much. Its not necessary though, at this level, anyway.' ],

     [ 'Really like this game. It\'s like the love child of Civilization and Clash of Clans. Love the fact there\'s a different designs for units and buildings when using different nations. Lots of strategy and depth when it comes to battle. Also, includes events based on history. The only thing on my wishlist for this game is that they add a nation unaffiliated with any country and does not have special units so players can play through the default units and buildings through the ages like Yuri in C&C.',
       'The Best Strategy Game I\'ve ever played. Its because It has Unique way to play than other games.Every Level u go U will find out fun & adventures. I got addicted to this game. Speacilly I like the gameplay of this game because Its seems so real.Like,Survived soilder will return to your base,troops vs troops fight, no magic spell,Human made Weapon used in this game which is possible & I love unlocking new ages here. Supper Cool Game',
       'Best empire game I\'ve had. And I\'ve downloaded probably all of them. Great aesthetic changes when upgrading buildings. The fact you can actually strategically place troops and attack is awesome. Love that resources respawn and that there\'s animations when farming them. The different nations with their advantages is a lovely touch.  The one draw back I would say is that it\'s expensive in a new players city to fulfil the task to join an alliance. Not a huge issue. Just would be nice to join friends sooner.  All in all amazing game. Great work Dev team',
       'Fun game, although there is pretty strong pressure to purchase upgrades to complete missions after an hour or so of gameplay. Two stars because the "crown" reward. System does not work. As it should. Several tasks were completed for rewards and the reward never showed up. In fact, the reward mysteriously disappeared from my queue. Feels fishy to me...',
       'Really great game like clash of clans, but mixed with the old age of empires or empire earth. Only problem I\'ve encountered is when I go to upgrade a building, no matter what level I upgrade it to, the preview picture looks like a level 1 version of the building. Other than this, the game is fun and constantly updated. I miss how easy it was to get trade goods.',
       'Used to like this game a lot. The missile silo ruined it. Now my troops are regularly wiped out and I wait two hours to play again. Not fun. And the waiting times for anything to finish are absurd. Developers take note: you screwed up. You should keep the faster training times of the Carnival event permanently. I\'m pretty close to giving up on this game, and I\'ve been playing for three years' ],

     [ 'This game is perfect for anyone who loves magic, fantasy, collecting, and a whole new level of adorable! Dragonvale takes everything to the next level! I highly recommend it, as it is a amazing game, my most played, and I hope everyone else enjoys it just as much as I do. Five stars! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Edit 2: I was re-organizing my islands by Element the other day, and I had just finished the Plant Island. I put down a Oversized Oak Tree, and immediately, a image flashed through my mind: a young girl, sitting on a branch of the oak tree, a book in one hand, a baby Plant dragon sitting next to her. Stretched out in front of them was my Plant Island, the dragons freely soaring, the other islands in the distance. And that sparked a inspiration in my head. I just wanted to ask; can I write a Dragonvale book, which takes place at my park? Please let me know !  :)',

But now I am restarting and I go to buy the beginners pack for 9.99 and it says there was an error and i wont be charged...come to find out it did charge me and i didnt receive anything! Please help',
       'I have been playing for a while. After events you get a day to turn in your event specific currency for the prizes, even though the event has ended. Well for Gardenia\'s event, it turned in all my roses before I could exchange them. I had over 25,000 and was so pumped to get the new dragons. Now I don\'t have any roses and 25,000,000 extra coins i don\'t need. Please help. This is a very frustrating bug.',
       'I really love collecting all of the dragons and the fact that you can theme/decorate your park too. But the amount of types of decorations are unbalanced, the majority that you can currently buy in the market are just plant and earth type while there are very few decorations of the other types (such as air, cold, etc).',
       'When I first had it it was super fun. Then I saw a game I wanted so I deleted it I did that before and got it back I could log into facebook and go to my old island. But this time I could not. I was so far and looking forward to seeimg my dragons but it did not let me go to my old island. It left me im tears that I had to do what I did all over again. So I deleted this stupid game and gave this. If I could rate 0 I would',
       'its ok, and you might think you cant li e without it, but trust me.... after a while year of playing, which is what i have waited to wrote this review, the game play becomes very repetitive. sure try it out, its fun, but not something for the rest of your life. dont put money into it, you will regret ir later.' ],

       'Very slow, lags, when you tap on anything, attack, raid, change base, deploy units, buy units.  Just takes forever. That\'s on Android phone, and on iPad 2, takes 5 mins to start, then will just crash, used to work sometimes.  I have been playing for a few years, and it just gets worse.  Otherwise would be good, but if you spend money on gold, it should work.',
       'The game itself is good fun, but it\'s ruined by anything but normal missions can\'t be completed without buying gold from the Gree store, the most frustrating thing is the constant crashes. I am running a completely up to date, vanilla Pixel2 and a 25mbps network and it will crash almost every time, no amount of updates to the game over the past 3 or more years, or my multiple platforms, has changed this. There is massive lag everytime you conduct an action, or change screens. Please, please make it more quick & stable!',
       'Game was good when was under the hands of Funzio.unfortunately ever since Gree takeover, there had been nothing but glitches, dishonest scrupulous non-ethical in-game strategies to trick players of their progress and money. I wouldn\'t advise players to continue spending or start playing this game',
       'Gree either just doesn\'t care about the customers that play this game,  or they have  hired a bunch of bumbling idiots. Always have the same mistakes and problems every time anything is changed, new campaigns, etc. Hard to advance if you don\'t spend real money, but why spend money on a game with such a crappy team running it??

I love this game and it has great graphics and it\'s a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I\'ll rate 5 star$',
       'Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn\'t really feel like you\'re getting anywhere.',
       'For a shoot \'em up racing android game it\'s really addictive. I\'m always playing it. It\'s fun. My only complaint is the time it takes for the fuel to charge, 30 mins? Come on! Otherwise very challenging. Challenge accepted!',
       'For as repetitive as it is I can\'t seem to put it down, it\'s seriously addictive. Maybe it\'s the great graphics or the fact it reminds me of one of my old favs arcade game  Spyhunter. A few small things I would fix are; needs a running diamond total during race to see how many you\'ve picked up. A better garage showing a side angle of your car so you can see the paint jobs and rims better and the most needed item is when you click on your profile pick there NEEDS to be a experience total! Just having the circle showing your experience isn\'t enough, I\'d like an actual number total. Also another mode to think about is maybe a side scrolling mode or overhead track mode like Grand Prix 2. All in all great graphics, music and replayability!',
       'Money trap. They don\'t even offer the option to watch videos to recharge the fuel to be able to play. So unless you spend money on this game you\'ll be stuck and having to wait hours to be able to play again. Such a shame given the game is so much fun. I was really enjoying it until i ran out of fuel and had to either wait or spend diamonds, which are hard to come by if you don\'t buy them. Very disappointing.' ],

     [ 'So I am a major mobile gamer.  And I must say this game is awesome in a number of ways. My cons however is: arena battles are way too long.     : more clarification should be emphasize on "finish daily or unfurnished daily", I can\'t seem to understand when my daily is completed by looking at the daily chart.  : too much pay to play going on. Mix it up a little plz.   Pros. Great story line.            Epic fighting styles.             Awesome mounts.             Super clean graphics.              Will keep u entertained.',
       'Its a good game. One of the nicest mmorpg on the market right now. However, my only nitpick is the lack of customization of the characters. You get new armor but your actual appearance doesn\'t change except with outfits, but everyone has those so at the end of the day your character does not feel unique at all. The combat and navigation are on point though. Overall a good game but just lack of personal input.',
       'RECHARGE ISSUE: PLEASE FIX THE ISSUE REGARDING RECHARGE. PLAYERS ARE NOT RECEIVING WHAT THEY HAVE PAID FOR, THIS STARTED SINCE THE MAINTENANCE LAST 22ND OF FEB. MANY PAYED WITH REAL MONEY. SO MANY PLAYERS SUBMITTED THIS ISSUE TO YOUR SUPPORT. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE NO SUPPORT ON THE WEEKENDS, BUT THE ISSUE STARTED ON THE 22ND WHICH IS A WEEKDAY. PLEASE FIX ASAP OR WE\'LL REPORT TO ITUNES AND GP. THANK YOU!!',
       'Man I gotta write this again &gt;~&lt;... The only thing u need to fix is the bug that doesn\'t allows you to see the characters... It really anoys me b/c I\'m a girl and only the boy characters are visible so please fix tgis in the next game update! That\'s the only bug that I have experienced! Anyways everyother thing is *AWESOME* btw my character is the puppeteer if that helps in something',
       'This is actually a very good mmorpg game, i\'d like to say it\'s the best mmorpg, but, the bug isn\'t fixed yet, i can\'t see my character when playin, also the puppeter and bountu hunter. Fix this bug quickly, i want to play this game so bad. I can\'t enjoy the gameplay if the characters are invisible.',
       'Apparently, my first review is gone. It was just a few minutes ago. So basically, I wanted to create a puppeteer but it does not show the avatar in the character creation screen. Same thing goes with the bounty hunter. I\'ve restarted the app, my phone, and re-installed the game. It\'s the same thing. I only see the scythe and shadow for the puppeteer and shadow for the bounty hunter. I\'m not gonna play this game until this issue is fixed.' ],

       'This game is AMAZING! With that said, heres the problem. Stop with the obnoxious freaking monkey!!!! Im sick of him popping up every 30 secs with no skip button. Ill be getting up a good tapping speed and it will jist ruin it by popping up with no option to click off. If i want to explore the game further, i will, at my own pace. I dont need you to hold my hand. Its really spammy and ruining the game play. Tutorial based gaming is a waste and a headache. Also its laggy. Please fix this. I LOVE this game and i want to play but the spammy monkey is a deal breaker.  Rant over',
       'One of the most obnoxiously money grabbing games i played. Commercials popping out constantly, and the rewards for watching them are more often than not just worthless. It\'s a shame because the game is quite fun to play otherwise',
       'I like the game very much. I bought the starter pack for a dollar 99 and removed ads. After the update came out, the one that and the ability to watch a video to double your rewards, your offline rewards, I click to watch the video and then the game sends me to the store to buy a gem pack. I click off of that and then it says the video is not available. I assume it wants me to buy another gem pack in order to enable that feature. I will not be doing that as that is ridiculous. I already bought the starter pack. Please fix this as the game is very fun and addictive.',
       'It was fun, but im slowly starting to hate it. One moment youre just looking at youre businesses and the next they are shoving ads down your throat. I shouldnt have to look at ads unless i get something in return.',
       'The tutorial will not let me play the game, it continues to interrupt me and forces me to do what it wants. Graphics are also cheap and ugly looking. It also feels janky, and buggy to control. I wish I could enjoy this otherwise decent idle game.' ],

       'It might not seem so, but has highly strategic gameplay and very good management, good sound overall and beautiful artwork. You don\'t need to spend tons money on it, but, progress can be quite slow - especially evolving heroes. A lot of it is based on chance, which is not the best, but not the worst kind of chance. A bit confused why it is impossible to praise clan members same or lower level - surely low-level players could use the little gold unlike the high-levels, and high-level players would use the food. Once you get to lvl 100, you actually end up with having almost no way to get food and might as well stop playing.',
       'I\'d love to play for more than 10 minutes a day. 125 energy and a map takes 9 energy and lasts ~1.5 minutes.  The amount of grinding required is way too much for so little energy. The first 4 days or so, you level up fast enough to build a surplus of energy, then you struggle to do anything after the honeymoon is over.',
       'I like your game nice way to kill time, but it becomes clear the first time a player tries to upgrade char abilities that devs are only in it for your hard earned money, players must be VIP 5 to purchase extra points to upgrade character abilities.  VIP requirement makes it impossible to level 5 character crew and evenly.',
       'I am stuck at startup and can\'t do anything to go further because I closed the game while it was teaching me how to play. Not cool',

I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.',

I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning',

Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress. Literally one downfall... upgrade costs when you get higher spec cars. Apart from that... GOOD JOB!!!',

I\'m just going to name some things that I\'m sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I\'m just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!',

     [ 'GirlsxBattle Global is a great game for those who want to spend their free time on something that has cute characters and fun people to play with. Sure this is not an FPS or Indie game, but a game\'s place isn\'t given by genre, take a look at Doki Doki for example. Anyways I\'m getting off topic here, its an awesome game to play and u get to DO some stuff with our girls, if u know what I\'m saying~',
       'I spent money on an event expecting to recieve an some items that were clearly promised. I did not receive them and when i tried to resolve it with GM, i was told the rule had been incorrect. They still havent corrected it though. Seems they want to fool people into spending money.',
       'Game is pretty fun so far. I have run into a lot of  UI issues so far but nothing world ending and they are fixable by restarting the game. I\'ll probably write a better review later once I\'ve played for more than 2 hours.',
       'It didn\'t didn\'t even load. It made me sit on the loading screen forever but when it started extracting it stopped (what is it even extracting anyway). I tried again and it stoped there too.  Its a shame it looks like a really good game.please fix this I saw other people say the same thing. Some ppl are saying it\'s even play to win!!!! Like why you all ready took a lot of my info when downloading.!!!!',
       'Bad ratio between amount of gems required for summoning and how much you can get. I feel the game is a bit pay to play. Which is bad as it is hard to relax. I also asked questions via Facebook hope I can get answers before the end of the day. As for gameplay I feel that sometimes the game just has stupid hard levels, or maybe the game doesn\'t provide enough ways to level the academy level which means although it shouldn\'t be character s become hard to level, and the player can\'t choose a fast play style of the game.',
       'i can\'t go to the game... it always cant connect to the game... my net is fast.. my phone have a lot of storage.. and only this game cant connect to the server... pls fix this asap... its a good game but how can i play it if i cant log in to the game' ],

     [ 'Let\'s be honest. This game is very similar to every other choice game. You have to wait 3 hrs for another ticket and I don\'t mind that BUT the storylines are CHEESY! Like damn, I don\'t even feel  the chemistry between the characters, you all should work on that. Also, the why you all draw the Black characters is simply awful. Work on the way you color the lips and draw the face. I hate to say it, but overall, this game is basic. It\'s a work in progress, READ your reviews and actually listen to what they are saying.',
       'It\'s pretty good. I am going to save this application for now. Right now I am reading the Campus hacker story. I really do like the humor in it but I kind of find the characters rude LOL. I\'m only on the first book so I don\'t want to give up yet. I have four other reading applications and this one honestly is my least favorite as of right now but I would definitely recommend it and give it a shot.',
       'I think this and most of the game since choices came out are all rip offs of episode choose your story. Now I\'m not saying they are bad apps or stories I just wish some of these people knew about episode. Though I have to admit this game is pretty fun.',
       'In the past I loved my shelf, now I kinda like it. Untold Darkness was amazing... Then I read Untold Darkness 2, I was very unhappy about it. I had hoped it was a continuation of the first, but it restarted just like the first. One of the things that got me upset was that it changed things, like not knowing Eugene, and Eddie, also I disliked how I had to meet everyone else again.  I really think there shoud be a continuation of the first Untold Darkness though, it\'s my favorite.',
       'I kinda liked it. I finished untold darkness book 1 before giving up. I also started reading a couple others to be fair. I didn\'t really like untold darkness until later on in the book, and was eager to start the second but very disappointed in the second one. I felt like my choices didn\'t really effect the outcome.',

     [ 'The game is good and i like it..  But after every fight you must connect to internet,, honestly this sucks.. Fighting game needs much comfort ability but every being online its really boring and it eventually slows which makes the game awful Please fix this up  Shadow Fight 2 is more portable and nice thought this will be better than two but for this update Shadow Fight 2 Is the best...',
       'This game made me rage. Insane difficulty is literally impossible.The loot is trash, upgrading armor and weapons is better. In the fighting system, when you get cornered, your basically screwed. I miss the mechanics in Shadow Fight 2 where you cant hit him when he fell on the ground. It a really good mechanic to give your opponent a chance. But thus game, there is no mercy at all. You still get hit when on the ground which sucks. C\'mon developers, you gotta fix this!',
       'This game is annoyingly unfair to the point if you keep playing you will Introduce your phone to the nearest wall. You simply cannot win unless you pay and the rewards for winning in duel and other play modes are less than minimum wage in s$&t hole countries can\'t buy anything useful.',
       'Classical pay per win game. Once you advance (e.g. lv 4-5), winning against the computer in the main quest is only possible after several days of waiting for free cards and random levelling of the weapons via chests (gained via duels). Glitches in skills usage are also observed.',
       'Great game in terms of graphic and gameplay. The only thing that sucks are the paywall in this game. Almost impossible to pass the story mode with weak weapon that we are given. The box drop rate also terrible. The only way to level up is by completing the main story. I will uninstall this game till they fixed this system. Really bad system.',
       '5 out of 10. Only graphics are good on this game, but lacks in other areas. Event weapon sucks. Controls are half broken when getting the right attack move. Worst of all is opponent\'s rare weapon, where player have only dual short sword Vs a Guan Yu blade staff or the flying dagger. Additionally the campaign mission are getter ridiculously tougher than the last, the sense of strong armed into micro-transaction.' ],

     [ 'The game is really fun. You collect comic covers, which are heroes/powers, to battle in a match 3 style game. It\'s great for a Marvel fan like me. The only down side is the high price to expand your roster. You can earn hero points in game to expand the roster but the price climbs higher, making it impossible to collect new covers without spending real money. This issue is strange because it prevents you from collecting more, even though the idea is to collect more. The price to expand should be a lot lower',
       'Been playing this for nearly 18 months and I\'ve still yet to become bored with it. Yes, it\'s basically a match 3 game but you have to think about what you match in order to maximise damage and win your match. Lots of chances to win or improve characters which then makes the game more intriguing and fun',
       'Update: 12/27/17. Joining an alliance helps. Playing for a year now, repeating story lines. It takes a while to advance unless you pay cash. Backed off on the constantly wanting me to rate everyday, was very annoying. it\'s like they wanted me to uninstall the game. Now I have to go through google play every time the game opens. Not worth the hassle anymore. Time for puzzle quest to go. AI makes for one sided play, they give a good explanation on how the AI dosen\'t cheat, but after a few months of play you will see.',
       'I know its about making money but you guys make it way to expensive to progress in this game. Why are the slots so expensive. The cost hurts the gameplay experience for me.',
       'Microtransactions are everywhere. I wouldn\'t mind so much but it exponentially costs more for you to increase your roster slots. Not for a character but to be able to have another character. I would rate 4 or 5 star other wise.',
       'Very clever game.  Hard to stop playing it.  Would be even  better  if  they added  more  new story  events. But you must play at least 4 hours a day if you want to advance significantly in the game.' ],

     [ 'I absolutely love the story line and I\'ve spent more on the game than I\'d like to admit. But spending money doesn\'t really get you much farther because the energy goes so quickly. I think you would get far better reviews and more happy customers if you got rid of the energy system and upped the ads for more revenue from that standpoint. Then you could keep the micro transactions for the secret scenes. This way you\'d still be making money,  but your customer retention would go up. I have so many ideas that would help this app out and I\'d love to share them as I love this story. If you are interested in what I have to say please reply',
       'It\'s really a good game. It\'s awesome! But that energies are my main problem! Don\'t you think that...... only 300 energies that means only 30 lines are not enough and too little for a day..!?..!???!.. and 10 energies per line isn\'t too much!!??! Please make it down to 5 energies for each lines...and only for dialogues.. And if you give 500 or 100 energies (if 1 line cost 5 energies then there will be only 100 or 200 lines. Not much for a whole day!!!!!) and take 10 hours to get free energies again then the game will be perfect!! Everyone can\'t buy energies (including me)! You know! Please consider this case sympathetically.!.!..  I beg you.....!....',
       'It\'s exactly what I was hoping for. The 300 energy per day is just enough for me, since I don\'t like getting sucked into the story for too long. The controls are simple, and I like the game exactly as it is. My only issue is that the dialogue takes a long time to load sometimes. I wish the game would just pre-download one chapter at a time.',
       'Lovely story line... love story that keeps you coming back everyday.... at times we are urged to buy energies.. however the energy provided gives sufficient dosage of the story each day... sad that it\'s going to get to the end...  And i wish I could go back and re read certain moments which is not possible.... apart from it.. this is amazing...',
       'I love the game. Wish we didnt have to pay for every secret scene and had a little bit more energies before having to wait for more or buy some. Would be great if we had more options for free energy. Love the story and characters. Hurry with season two already!!!  Im anxious to see further stories on ryan and the character Lol ❤.',
       'I think there are lots of chapters and the energy for really slow. So I am practically making a tortoise speed progress through the story, when normally I can finish many pages in a book (reading). Someone should do something about pacing up the story. And not to mention secret scenes later on can only be played by purchasing the paid version of the game!' ],

And tickets? What good are They? I think it\'s time for an uninstall since the level I\'m on now I\'ve been trying for days to beat! Impossible and no longer fun. Should be fun not stressful.',
       'I have re rated this as I had to reset my tablet. I then logged back into the game only to have to start all over again as I don\'t do Facebook. This game needs its own log in. Also every time I complete a level I get adds. What ever has happened it is spoiling the fun of the game.',
       'Lost my gifts from completing the task for tier 6 level.  And they disappeared. Please fix or I\'m uninstalling. I worked to hard to complete and not be rewarded. It was for collecting butterflies.  Tooooooo many glitches. Please fix if ya want better ratings. Sick of the bullcrap time to uninstall and save some data',
       'Love this game! Stupid toto barking on the menu drives me nuts though! Lots of challenges for bonus items and the game keeps evolving. Sometimes little glitches when using lollipops, but mostly free of problems like freezing etc. Hopefully I can keep enjoying the game as long as I have enjoyed the film.',
       'Ok, I\'ve been playing this game for awhile not as much anymore.  Not getting moves like I used too get for my daily prize, Judy non sense like tickets. What do I need the tickets for?  Can I buy stuff with them?  What? I have no idea what the tickets are for.  Pleaser put the moves back, at least I can use them.',
       'I have been trying for a while to pass the level I\'m on.  I send help to friends they had unlimited lives and still didn\'t pass it.  Come on I like a challenge  but this is ridiculous.   I like playing but if I have to spend all my lives and not level up I will just play candy crush....because your getting just like that game...' ],

My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I\'m not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr',
       'Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I\'m paying £9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn\'t make it worth the price being asked.',
       'I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',
       'This would have got 5 stars had I been able to share it with my 2 kids via family share. I refuse to pay £30 for all 3 of us to have access to all the levels.  Great game though. Fun, quick and easy to play. Many hours spent between us. So many levels too.',
       'Super Mario run is a great smartphone game it has the very addicting toad rally and remix ten and the simple, but very rewarding controls. The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars',
       'I beat world 1, and I have to pay for the rest of the game? Really? This is stupid.. If you\'re going to have a game you need to pay for, market it as such, not the ol bait and switch. Very deceitful.. At least make a trial game or demo game not lure someone in and then tell them they need to pay to finish the game' ],

       'Rewards for quest are terrible. The quest was to catch 150 beast, the reward was 8 hours reduced from arena ...no recipes given for any quest completed since NOV 2017. Smh',
       'Great premise. Started out awesome. But all aspects of the game have been nerfed into oblivion. Most notably, rune obtainability, which is what allows for spell casting.',
       'This game is now officially garbage. Dont waste your time or money.   UPDATE: A few things have been fixed. The eggs however are a giant mess. There is little rhyme or reason to what comes out of which egg. I keep getting the same things out of golden eggs as well. Its frustrating to see someone get out of a 5k that i get out of my golden egg. The spawns are terrible. Its always the same creatures everywhere you go. The speed cap is yet to be fixed. So many players are quitting due to the champions and eggs. There is less and less people chatting on the Facebook pages. It\'s a fun game, but is so frustrating at the same time. I hope the devs fix the issues.    The game has been niantic\'d with this last update. People are upset about the changes on the fan pages. I won\'t be spending anymore cash and it seems that\'s the consensus. I\'m very disappointed that a game that was supposed to listen to the fans and be a different AR game has gone the way of pokemon go.  It was a very fun game up until today.  Update: it\'s worse than I even realized. Lures and essence and pointless now. The glitches are out of control. The speed cap came back after the "bug fix". PvP is one sided. I don\'t even bother with it now. With gen 3 coming out soon, I find it hard to believe they will retain daily players. And automated responses don\'t make people feel any better about the situation. It was a fun game for a minute.',
       'This is a terrible rip-off of pokemon go. I get that pokemon go can\'t be the only AR game out there, but at least be original about it. Aside from a couple different features, it\'s just the same, but ... worse.  In fact, I\'ll make a list of things in draconius, and their pokemon go counterpart: Essence=Stardust Evolving=Evolve Power-Up=Power Up Bestairy=Pokedex (The bestiary is a little understandable i guess) CP=CP (Real original with that one, huh?) Stones=Candy Copied fast/charge move system. Apprentice\'s Sphere=Pokeball Master\'s Sphere=Great Ball Ruler\'s Sphere=Ultra Ball Arcana Caramel=Razzberry Magical Doughnut=Pinap Berry (except it increases "essence") Unicorn\'s Marshmalow=Nanab Berry Crystal of Wisdom=Lucky Egg Pheromones=Incense (though there is the daily change concept) Lure=Lure (and works the exact same way as well) Perpetual Dragon\'s Cocoon=Incubator Dragon\'s Cocoon=Incubator (×3) Small Healing Potion=Potion Medium Healing Potion=Great Potion Great Healing Potion=Hyper Potion Potion of Complete Recovery=Max Potion Ressurecting Potion=Revive Pillar of Abundance=Pokestop Pet=Buddy And as far as I can tell, there are 2, 5, and 10K eggs just like in pokemon go.' ],

     [ 'Have enjoyed this game for years. Don\'t like the update that changed the prizes to these random keys. I liked knowing I\'d get good prizes at the treasure hunt. It\'s what kept me coming back. Keys aren\'t doing that. This game is a nice distraction from life with pleasing music and awesome art. Don\'t like the current update with the connection to social media slowing down the start up, but it\'s pretty easy to avoid. Play on!',
       'Was amazing, not anymore. The game seems to be increasingly more rigged as you progress. I\'ve played a lot but now it seems nearly impossible to complete the level without purchases, especially in treasure hunts. 2-3 levels are ridiculously easy and then it takes one day to get through one. Used to be my favourite commute game, sadly I am uninstalling it now.',
       'After watching an ad, you have to hit the close icon pixel-perfect, otherwise you\'re taken to the play store. Returning from play store to the game will crash the game. Super annoying. Other than that, I agree with the other reviews: keys are the worst idea for this game. Useless and annoying. It used to be my favourite game, not anymore because of those bad ideas of the devs and the horrendous bugs.',
       'Way to easy to accident purchase something. I\'m half awake playing thisand meant to hit the x button to go back and loose a life but hit the button next to if and there wasn\'t even a confirmation just bam there you go. Was a complete accident. But it is fun to play',
       'Very low Rewards :/   First time playing 2 dots. The game is fun and challenging. But comparing it with other games of this kind you get almost no rewards and items are super expensive $$$$$. The key system would be nice if let\'s say you got a key (or two)for each star that you gain after passing a level. So 2 star level gives you 2 keys (or 4). So yeah... If developes wonder why people quit, voila!  Update: another example of the  Sad rewards is the events. I just finished it. There were around 7levels and some pretty hard ( I used no boosts at all). Is spent around 50 lives too. After all that you get a medal hahahhaha. Seriously haha not even 1 free boost or 1 hour of unlimited lives .. Lol.',
       'Used to love this game. The new keys thing is ridiculous. You can\'t get things like color burst, or shuffle or any of those things that are helpful like you USED to get with the daily prize, instead you get keys that you can get nothing helpful. And the expeditions are too short, the treasure hunts get more time and they\'re way less fun. But either way now the expeditions are really hard. And oh, but shock there instead of getting the shuffle you get some keys. The keys have actually made me quit playing the game almost completely. I went from playing several times a day to playing maybe once or twice a week. It\'s a horrible addition to this game.' ],

You can purchase increments of time and it\'s often more luck than skill that determines your win.

The details like graphics and sounds are great, but this is a true exercise in frustration.',

     [ 'It\'s like Episode\'s ugly cousin. Story line is okay, character look is very limited, in order to play the rest of the game you HAVE to pay a subscription fee like the game is worth it. For one month it\'s 7.99 and may I remind you that Netflix (10000% better) is the exact same price as that for a standard pack. Episode (story app like this) is much more cost-efficient and over all better because at the very least you can make your character resemble you, don\'t have to spend so much out of your pocket, and Episode also isn\'t prone to crashing like this one.',
       'Subscribed for a month..cost me $9.99.  Not bad I thought...until the game stopped working in the middle of a story. Had to restart game and it went to loading page....stayed at 10% and will Not load any further. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling ...no luck! Asking for my money back . Funny how it stopped working a couple hours after I paid!!!',
       'I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME!!  This game is amazing and a great time killer! I\'ve used the game in the past when they gave 2 tickets but I\'ve recently downloaded it, they only give 1 ticket for 1 HOUR! The stories it self is good, the characters lacks some things, the stories are too short. The \'free\' diamonds doesn\'t work, when ever I click on it, it goes black and closes the app which is frustrating. The choices in the stories are 10 to 25 GEMS which takes forever for someone like me who doesn\'t pay for gems. BUT other then that there isn\'t anything I could think of from the top of my head.  So, please fix these....',
       'One ticket is too little.. plus the stories for each ticket are soooo short... other apps have it longer and you get 2 tickets minimum before the next ticket arrives.. and owh... can the characters have more options in terms of looks? Especially the guys... boring.. Plus why cant we keep the clothes that we already purchased? Stories are ok.. similar most of them..',
       'Not a bad game I like the stories. The only thing is you only get 1 ticket to read with. On the plus side you can speed up time til the next ticket',
       'The stories are great but unless you invest a ton of money into the game you don\'t really have a choice how the story will turn out. Whenever it pops up to give you a choice, the more favorable one is 20 diamonds which you will only possibly get if you buy them. It ruins the whole concept of the game.' ],

     [ 'This game has a chip sale and it never pays out. It constantlyI takes it all back. I have been playing DoubleDown Casino for over a year now. I have enjoyed the game tremendously. However I noticed that I purchased chips all the time. The game takes all the chips each time and you have to repurchase. I have a Samsung Galaxy 6 Edge Plus. I have tried to install DoubleDown Casino many times and it always crashes. So for now I will not install it on my phone. I am still playing,its addicting..but i am still looking for other games to fill my time.',
       'Graphics are totally messed up at start up.  I cannot see games. The games that appear are games I do not play. I have deleted and readded casino but games are still not showing. Wheel spins give low points. Hard to get high points. When you manage to get a good score, it takes away until you get low. I like the games but often lose down to nothing. I will not buy credit for any games I play so if losing  credit is an attempt to get me to buy, forget it. I have kept this casino open longer than any others because I actually like the games.',
       'Why is it a problem loading this game? Used to be easy but now its a pain in the ass. I think im going to take this app off my phone. Used to be easy. Now very frustrating',
       'This use to  be one of the best games ever. Now you rarely seem to win anything. The more you play the less you get. Promo codes are marked invalid and it goes into maintenance  often but never improves.',
       'I knew there was a reason why I quit playing double down once before     they cheat   don\'t play fair. And they are cheap',
       'Have gone threw free coins and didn\'t hit not one time.. I will buy coins if this changes at any time when i do get free chips and win. Then i will consider buying coins' ],

     [ 'Love love this game! Just started playing it a little, but definitely super cute! Love the background sounds too. They\'re not annoying like some games that repeat the same darn words throughout the game. Uuuuuugh! So annoying.  Thank you developers for not destroying the fun in this game by putting repeating vocals. The music is calming, the graphics are awesome! I don\'t have the funds to purchase power-ups, etc., but it\'s still fun! This 51yr. old lady thanks you bunches! 🙆‍♀️👍',
       'About to uninstall as I have also just lost about a years worth of play. I had completed all the winter levels and was up to the new year levels and it\'s been wiped back to 167 of winter levels only. Also was about to hit 1000 stars, now back to only 411 but all my arendale achievement are there. Lost interest now. Don\'t want to have to do it all over again.',

     [ 'I have seen this as an ad. I thought I should give it a try. It worked out. Before long, I reached level 15. Now I\'m on level 32 and I have 1.092 aa gold! I automated 100% of my farm!  I\'m already making lots of gold with automating potatoes. Potatoes give away so much gold! Good update.  Keep up the good work. Thanks, Idle Farming Empire. What a good replacement for Farm Away.  Idle Farming Empire is like the best simulation for farming. I gave the game 4 stars for a reason. I liked the game! Look under the review! There\'re many people rating the game 5 stars. It should really be rated 4 stars.  Over 97,800 people rated 4 and 5 stars. I like this game. Thanks for everything.',
       'This "game" is like empty calories. I ingested it ate it up and left hungry.  There is no goal whatsoever to this game. It is a glorified add campaign intended to keep you going on and on with a false feeling of accomplishment in order push ads on you or make you buy perks. Want to double your earnings for 20 seconds? Watch a 30 second ad. Want to improve earnings for four hours. Watch an ad. You get the point. Of course you can buy these perks but why do any of this? The "game" never really does anything whatsoever. No milestones, no real goals, no anything. Well after about 3 hours of game time and the equivalent of add watching time I am off to ingest something with more substance.',
       'AMAZING! I love this game. It is so addicting and a great way to pass time and boredom. I think though for one small improvement you could add a thing where there are like \'mini games\' and you earn coins for that. Using those coins earend in the mini games you spend it on things like watering cans, fences for live stock and more! This was only some suggestions for a bigger game if you can have or make a new game called like farm life or something like that....LOVE IT...',
       'I LOVE THIS GAMEE!! It\'s so addicting and once u get used to it, u can\'t stop playing it! It\'s a great time killer and it auto saves (not of u connected to Facebook.) Again, I love this game and I would recommend this game to EVERYONE because it\'s for all ages (unless u are a very serious person) JK LOL! :D',
       'Like so far But, 2 issues. 1- I don\'t Facebook or do any social media so needs to be a way other than ads for those bonuses. 2- daily rewards Don\'t happen. Shows that they were collected but will not activate unless I have enough diamonds. Please fix. Play offline on tablet and hotspot to get daily reward.',
       'Great and addicting game, but with one major bug. I went to collect my idle money and I watched a video too double it (46 billion total). But when I hit the button to collect it, I never got it. All the money dissapeared and I got nothing. What\'s the point of an idle game, if you don\'t get anything for being idle?' ],

The next day I look in my bank account and I have been charged for what Google play said I couldn\'t do and I was charged another $4 when I didn\'t even click on anything. I want my money back. That is real shady that you would charge someone for a service that didn\'t even go through. And where did a $4 charge come from. And there is no way to ask through support to get that back so I\'m taking this here where others can see. Don\'t spend money here or there will be random charged in your bank account.',
       'Definitely not worth it. Was fun at first, but after the updated quests, the game took a serious nosedive in quality. Now you HAVE to beat the opponent in order to get anything, otherwise you\'re out 1000 gold. Before, you would get something just for playing. The new PvP just sucks.',
       'The forced ads are so frequent and annoying. Pvp either freezes and steals your coins or you win and lose coins. Probably over 100,000 coins lost this way. Game has potential and is fun, but company took this fun game and made it not worth playing',

     [ 'I like it, but I just hate when players keep on attacking weaker players or attack my base when I\'m not with energy dome, I feel like this game is more of a competitive game than any other multiplayer games. I know its natural for players to attack other players. Its just that I don\'t want to constantly buy more domes than I needed because of my fear of loosing all the resources and troops Im building up. Its like I can\'t have one day without a player raiding my base and I have to get resources again. Overhaul good game, just needs some sort of protection, cooldown or limit to how many times you can attack a base.',
       'I m playing this game for long time and i liked this game but now this game asking too much .So many back to back events .I think the game maker must know that all playing this game have a real life to deal with.Reduce back to back events.I m sure if u guys dont do it most players will quit and this game will be longer played.',

       'Turning into a farming game.A few glitches,such as players attacking and immediately being able to raise shields.A player should be vunerable to counterattack while attacking as in other games.Recovery time between dimension events needs to be 48 hrs instead of 24.Players also need to be more or less perma-shielded,garanteeing income to the developers;you will normally have your base resources and troop levels zeroed in a couple of hits by higher level players.Also...some upgrades take far too long unless you pay...54 weeks for core upgrades above lvl20??!  Give it a rest...Score reduced from 5 to 3 overall;also ui is a little sticky.',

I would have liked if they had subtitles to the songs so we know what they are singing. Also give us a chance to earn more gems and scouting tickets.The scouting I think is also not fair. I would scout single ten times and not get anything but a rare. While my friends do single scouts and get ur and SSR. YOU won\'t get goods cards unless you pay or do the 11 scout. The pricings also could be improved',

One thing I\'m really picky on is that you press the circle on the beat and this is the only game so far that has stayed true to all the notes being on the EXACT beat.

       'Loving this game for a few reasons; its feature set just really makes everything so very detailed and interesting, and I love the way you can upgrade properties. This game allows you to find out some things about your area, and I truly think it is great. I don\'t mind buying coins, as they are possible to get through gameplay and support the developers. Great game, really recommend!  My one concern is it is sometimes quite slow at loading.',
       'This app isn\'t just a game, it is also financial teaching tool. While I am having fun buying and selling properties, I am also learning the basics of investing in real estate. You also learn some of the realities of owning and renting property. The more property you own the more money you make. There is even a marketplace feature in which landlords from around the globe bid on properties. Who knew being a real estate tycoon was so fun and addicting?',
       'At first im quite confused on how to play this game. But after i watched some tutorial then i like this game more and it addicting. I always feel like wanted to buy more properties but unfortuntely i dont have enough coin to refill the cash. Btw, this game is really fun and addicting. Well done Reality Games LTD.',
       'It\'s a great game and I love overtaking people on the leaderboard and growing. It has taken over my life. I sold my wife\'s kidney just to buy coins and more coins. Almost out of coins. And low on kidneys. Wondering how much my house might sell for. That would provide alot of coins. Yes! That\'s it! My house! I can use the McDonald\'s I bought on this game and use it\'s free WiFi. Good plan. Peace',
       'It WAS a fun game, great concept.  I spent 84 million on a property (saving up for months) and then they revised it\'s value down to 300,000 and refused to make it right.  Who knows when that\'s going to happen again, if they won\'t make it right then don\'t waste your time! 😞' ],

     [ 'Great game. Loving it. I noticed when you go into the Alter, there is a note telling you your capacity limit at the bottom but in the Mana gem screen it doesn\'t tell you. Are you able to add this feature? I can never remember my mana creating limit.  If you make more mana than can fit in your mana storage line, you lose the excess.',
       'AWESOME!!! Originally, I was very reluctant to download this becuase I though it was going to be where you just sit and watch your character do everything for you. I HATE those types of games... This however is actually how I was really hoping it would turn out to be! You can move freely! The levels are linear and its not very open, but thats okay! You see each piece of equipment on your character when you wear it, which is absolutely essential to me! I will not play a game where my appearance does not change, so this has all in all met my expectations! Another RPG worthy of my collection! Thank you!!!',
       'What started out a 5 star wonderful game has dropped to a prime example of how Not to treat loyal players and followers. With the latest update to "rebalance" which stripped long time players of attack powers, levels and hit points the developers should take notice of how many people no longer spend valuable time on their offerings. This is sadly another one for the uninstall button because after months of grinding to improve my character to now basically start over isnt worth it',
       'It was bad enough what the update did to players characters.......but after your patch to supposedly take into account players objections about how their characters statistics were lowered,  my character lost another power level and 2 million in power after the patch. Absolutely pathetic how you have treated the players who have played this game. Perhaps I should contact some of my friends that are Bratva to represent me and voice my complaints. Have a nice day!',
       'Result of your update, invisible walls,  player getting stuck running like a idiot, you created a algorithm for a headless chicken, good thing I advised my friends NOT to download it, if it ain\'t broke don\'t fix it, g___dy b___s__t artist. I bet all the good reviews you got were done in your offices, shed or bedrooms, back to ye olde ps4.',

     [ 'This game is perfect for those who played any moba style game. 2 buddies of mine play this the same we used to back in the first 2 years of league of legends. Short games, almost no existence of any real "pay to win". No heavy dedication required to get started. Great for the casual and hardcore gamer. Not for those who haven\'t even seen a moba style game before. Just needs more items to buy in game, but can\'t expect perfection from the start. Overall 4.7 from me',
       'Cool game very fun few negative though. Snowballing is way to easy one death and you basically lose lane. The controls need to be better they need a target lock mode. Its hard to keep on your target even with hero icons on. Being able to only use the jungle talent if you have a jungling item on sucks. its so hard to comeback if any bit behind as i said snowballing is to large.',
       'The connection and reconnecting sucks, I always end up idle or AFK because apparently my connection sucks but it\'s perfectly fine. Reconnecting takes forever and by the time it\'s done the game is already over and I\'m reported for AFK when it\'s not even my fault the game\'s connection sucks.   Other than that the game is fun to play and a good time consumer but they need to work on better connection. I kept on getting warnings for my AFK when the game kept on glitching and it affected my phone so I had to restart the whole thing.',
       'Way better than Mobile Legends. I use to be  Mobile Legends Die-Hard All the way but this is the best MOBA out there. I have no idea why this does not have 50+million downloads. ? Do Not Judge By Front cover. PLAY THIS AND SEE WHEN YOU REACH RANKED MATCHES MY FELLOW MOBA PLAYERS.',
       'Game is an absolute blast.... when it works. I am constantly getting diced in lobbies right before a game starts meaning the game punishes me for something that is server side. I know my Internet connection is fine because I hopped on LoL and discord just to check my ping and it is at a stable 40 whilst this game says I\'ll have over 500. Because of this it makes it hard to enjoy because of the credibility system. If this issue gets fixed I will change my review to a 5 star because the gameplay is superb for a mobile game and a moba',
       'Played both the international version (arena of valor) and the Chinese version (honor of kings). It is the better mobile moba in the market with great control and smooth gameplay. Having DC heros in the roster is a big plus.   Downside is the lack of content compared to the Chinese version. Sure it\'s a fairly new game, but if this game wants to be as successful as honor of kings it need a lot more content to keep players engaged. More meaningful events (not the crappy one that give you 5 gold for winning matches), way better skins (seriously check out the skins in honor of kings, so much better) thats actually appealing to people. And please let people unlock arcana pages with gems instead of paying real money.' ],

     [ 'This game is essentially a pay-to-play game with one major difference-build times. Part of the reason that I don\'t usually play games like this is because upgrading your HQ to level 10 takes a couple of days. With that aspect, the game is more fun and the developers make less money because purchases dramatically decrease. I find that to be important for them to sacrifice something to make us happy.   Unfortunately, though, my phone overheats when I  play it, so I can\'t binge on it. I would like to, though.',
       'Great action graphics and animation. Love the team aspect. Only negatives for now are several recurring glitches and constant tweaks to the battle aspects of the game due to upgrades and adding additional gameplay features. Takes awhile to get accustomed and tough to get comfortable with constant changes, but still interesting.',
       'This game was very addictive until latest update. Latest update reduce attacking power significantly and making this game is not fun anymore. We can\'t even defeat base with 6 level below ours. Now, this game is suck. Not gonna play again, just let the miners fulfill the storages by their own as attacking just a kind of wasting my time and my resources.',
       'It\'s fun, good time killer. However slow loading, glichtes are becoming too frequent. Biggest issue, almost have to buy packs on a regular basis to level up. You don\'t get enough resources in the game to build, it takes too many resources.',
       'Newest changes not implemented fairly or consistently. They changed how upgrades work dramatically mid game without any prior notice or phase in. The result is any weapon upgrades you didn\'t have the level to use yet have been removed and replaced with new system that requires far more grinding now. Old players now have a much larger advantage over new ones because of this change since they were able to easily upgrade stats while now you are hindered with rare upgrade drops that mean only one thing to play the game...$$$$$ sad.',
       'The game was pretty good before they brought in changes to the maps and units. The game now is mostly for people who want to spend in purchasing units. It\'s no more for people who want to enjoy a good game. Too many changes brought too early. This game will economically drain you.' ],

     [ 'Used to be a decent game. The game developers have basically abandoned it and only use it to get cash on the side. No game updates for months. Small problems have been popping up now and then. Not worth the time, the game\'s just going downhill from here',
       'Not bad at all! Awesome strategy game , it\'s all on how you decide to use your  resources (diamonds) . Don\'t even have to Recharge much and still move up in ranks & power. Got hooked on it more than Coc.😃😀🖒🖒',
       'You guys might want to consider making occasional, if not regular update for the game, especially on the events. At least keep up with the regular, basic ones. It was enjoyable. Missed the old days even tho so many changed drastically for good or for worst. The difficulty in everything is not really bothersome but if the minor rewards are slightly helpful, they could bring a fortune to you guys and us, players. Conclusion, please give us what we deserves 😊',
       'Great game but when i tried to use gems for instant research it didnt work and spent my gems and i tried to do it about 3 or 4 times and it spent all my gems without doing anything. I tried reopening the app and i tried resetting my phone too, to see if it was just a glitch. Please do something about this. I would like my gems back',
       'Too brutal and hardcore for new players. 100 times more powerfull players attack your base when you level up to lvl 6. You loose all you troops and you don\'t have food to develope new troops and it takes forever to get enough food and train new forces. And you are attacked again and so on. Unistalled game right after that. Alliance is no help.  They have copied whole game from the Zgirls game. Just a little different graphics',
       'Its a ok game but i got a problem. (i already reported it)  My problem is that i bought 5 gifts for the texas gall and when i looked i only had 3 of them. So please fix tgis and give me mh gems or the 2 missing gifts back' ],

The tap-to-move control is more natural and relaxing than thumbsticks, and it’s also truer to the vintage point-and-click Action RPG experience.The game can be really played for free, as more than 90% of our players do. Purchases are completely optional. Gems, the game’s main currency, can be collected from enemies and quests. There is no limiting stamina or energy. The best things in the game are obtained by playing, not paying.Eternium has been launched in 2014, and is actively being improved by the original development team. Through years of polishing, and feedback from millions of players, the quality of the game has steadily increased, making it now one of the highest rated games on all app stores.As of fall 2017, major new features are in advanced stages of development, including real-time multiplayer, town portal, and a fourth world.Enjoy the visceral satisfaction of responsive, fast-paced combat, with spectacular special effects, pleasing sounds, rewarding damage numbers, all set against immersive backdrops and atmospheric, inspiring music scores.Play as a Mage, Warrior or Bounty Hunter, wielding a sword, axe, staff or gun. Level up to learn new abilities and increase your attributes.Battle skeletons, zombies, automatons, aliens, demons, dragons and many other creatures, across three beautifully hand-crafted worlds, or in endless generated levels.Venture into dark caves and dungeons, explore forests, villages and graveyards, lay siege to demon controlled castles, brave snowy mountain peaks, travel to the moon to slay strange creatures among craters and canyons, and beyond, to the deserts, pyramids and jungles of the red planet.Open treasure chests to loot gold, gemstones and battle gear. Equip shiny breastplates, menacing helmets and hoods, spiked shoulder pads, mysterious cloaks or capes. Protect yourself with a shield, or choose to wield two weapons as a warrior.Rescue your tank, healer and ranger companions who will join you in battle. Use their abilities together with yours to create rewarding and powerful tactical combos.Experience a refreshing storyline, filled with interplanetary intrigue and seasoned with funny characters. Hunt your arch-enemy, Ragadam, across the worlds, while trying to uncover and undo his twisted plans.Progress from common to rare, epic and legendary gear. Find gemstones that fit in your armor’s sockets. Craft socketed rings and amulets, and fuse three of them into a higher quality one.Unleash awesome offensive abilities, such as Whirlwind, Shockwave, Arc Lightning or Blizzard, control the enemy crowd with Frost Nova, Vortex, Silence, or sneak and assassinate with Smokescreen, Traps and Snipe.Each hero class has access to about 20 abilities (skills or spells), and each of your three companions has four more. The game starts simple, but culminates in a flurry of tactical possibilities at high levels.Once your hero reaches level 70, your experience points go into Champion Levels, which are unlimited and yield steady stat upgrades. Champion Levels are also inherited by your new heroes, so they will have an easier time growing up.Aside from the three story acts, an endless progression of beautiful, randomly generated levels awaits in the Trials of Valor game mode.Eternium is crafted with passion by a small band of old-school RPG fans, who love making the game they always wanted to play.',

     [ 'What a great game this really is, there isn\'t many RPG\'s you\'ll find like this on the Play Store. I recall playing this 3 years ago and a lot has changed, but still a vital element is missing; multiplayer. I see within the game description that it was promised for 2017 but after downloading and playing I can\'t see any multiplayer feature. Apart from that, it\'s a really well polished game and seems to offer a lot of content and replayability and I really do hope they bring us multiplayer. I also purchased a limited time offer for £0.89 and it offered a lot that\'s for sure!   Runs well on max settings on my Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra on Android 7.0',
       'The gameplay is the best ive seen for an android RPG Diablo type game. Slick graphics, awesome sound track and effects, no slowdown and you can play offline!! Absolutely love the game. Only down side is the worry of repetitivness of the game but i guess only time will tell',
       'Incredible game. Very intuitive and unique with the swipe to cast system. The graphics are quite nice and the amount of memory the game uses is very acceptable for the quality you get. Music is very relaxing and well done. Level and NPC design are great, really feel like I\'m playing an old school medieval RPG. Absolutely 0 need to buy gems, the game gives them to you for just killing normal monsters. My only gripe would be to maybe add a fourth class? If not more in future updates. Otherwise, fantastic game, well put together, well written story, great opening scene and whoever did that voice over should be looking to do more! Thank you for making a true RPG for true RPG fans, keep it up!',
       'The game is addictive. I was hoping to play it offline all the time but you need and internet connection to upgrade skills and craft its annoying because I don\'t have wifi and I use mobile data. Still it gives me the feels of Diablo all over again.',
       'Absolutely love this game. I downloaded it 2 hours ago and havent stopped playing. I play on an S7 Edge and this game plays flawlessly.  I haven\'t been forced to watch any ads.  You can choose to watch them for bonus gems but don\'t have to. The game play is very responsive. When you touch a destination or an enemy it responds without any hitches.  I like that their are different levels of difficulty you can choose. The amount of weapons and armor you can collect or craft is endless, with rune upgrades possible. Great game guys... keep up the good work. 5* for me!',
       'I love this game. It could use some improvement, but there is nothing in the current  version that would warrant less than 5 stars... particularly for an android game. If you loved Diablo; then you will definitely want to play this. And, BTW, you really don\'t need to spend money to play or win this game. But it will help you ALOT if you spend $20. Just wait for one of the special offers that come up. Otherwise, just conserve your gems and DO click the ?-Cubes. It is worth a 30 second add to get 5 gems. And I easily collect around 100 gems per day of play clicking those. Also, DO NOT, waste gems on the large golden treasure chests. You have to pay gems, a lot of gems, to get the treasure and none of them are worth the grossly exorbitant gem fee.' ],

     [ 'Good fun until you figure out that you only need to build area 52 up. At level 500 it jumps by 5000000% or something stupid. Meaning can clear a planet in just hours. Needs a different hook to it. After a few planets it\'s a bit stale.  The choices to buy in multiples of needs moving. With fat fingers I\'ve caught the research aswel as hitting Max a few times',
       'It\'s a good time killer. The thing that makes me think about deleting this app is how it keeps overriding my phone. I keep turning notifications off for this app, but the game will turn them back on again. It\'s so annoying to have my phone buzz just to find out its just this stupid game telling me my scientists are done or waiting for a task.',
       'Usual game where numbers get ridiculous and good at killing time. Very good features and well balanced - so far. Like with many of these games nearer the later stages the completion time can be calculated and nobody wants to tap for 211 years to complete the next round. Hopefully this game sidesteps that.',
       'Update to previous review: Devs seem on it. After the last update there seemed to be a bug or two. A couple of us let them know and they fixed it within a week. Good game, come and go on your own time, well maintained. Thanks guys!  --------- I\'d have to agree about the slow down for the red bacteria after the update. It used to come between 1.5 and 3 mins. Now I can go 10 minutes looking at the screen before one comes. It makes the game more of a waste of time than fun. Other than that, I was really liking it. Played it more than most games.',
       'After the last update it became unplayable. Crashed all the time. If they fix it it will be a great game but until then avoid it. Tried again after the last update. Still unstable. Not worth the wasted time.',
       'If you just want an idle clicker, it\'s not bad at all.  However, if you\'re more interested in the research/mutation aspects of the game, you\'re probably gonna be disappointed.  Research/mutation provide permanent (but unnecessary) buffs to your bacteria (or new types of bacteria).  Problem is that the success rate of research is ridiculously low unless you opt for the 24 hour version, so you won\'t get much out of research.  Since mutation requires two unused types of bacteria (which come from research), you won\'t be using that, either.  It\'s really a shame considering those were very unique aspects to this game that set it apart from most clickers.' ],

     [ 'This now a prize example of a freemium game that needs a premium option. I would gladly pay £10 as a one off purchase to do away with the need to say for lives. In the past games worthy of a one-off fee would offer it and this issue such game that should consider it. I will never pay for any in app purchases on any game and I am sure I am not alone. This has 5* written all over it but the long wait times and exorbitant cost of energy replenishing means this doesn\'t get anything higher than average.',
       'Loved the game but if the life was free this waiting for minutes to play again is not cool. Also noticed if you have to score more than 1 goal and you make a mistake you have to start from the same goal you already scored. If we can get the requirements before each challenge that would make it much more fun otherwise I love this game a lot keep updating for more seasons. Thank you. I am on Level 560 with 1257 stars I am awaiting Season 29. If you can also create a full football game with same concept. This is a Great game!!! Thank you developers keep developing Great games like these!!!',
       'Wonderful! Game by first touch   But I can\'t wait till the hearts 💚 are filled!  So Reduce the time. Improve this game more and more and create a new exciting games.  I have finished 390 levels. And I have a doubt what is the last level and what happens after it? All the best for ur future and I\'m a biiiiiiig fans of u guys!!  Hands off',
       'SCORE  HERO RULES This game is so sick dudes. It so cool that this gives us idea that how to play soccer or football. Gameplay is so smooth . They players show us some epic skills . It has an commentary. The worst part was the heart. I can\'t wait till it get refilled ❤❤❤❤❤ this. Graphics are great . Just reduce the time of refilling the energy . Overall this game cool. Thanks for the game FTG.',
       'Great game! I enjoyed it alot. Finished the whole game (540 matches, over 1400🌟) in 1 month without spending any $.   3 more months: got ALL 1680🌟 not spending any $.  Gameplay improvement required: after missing a shot off the woodwork or a penalty kick the player should go for the rebound , not stop!',
       'Great game. It is just like Fifa the journey!😃😃😃😁 please fix the lives because when I am on lives it goes down from 5 to 0 in 1 turn. I only lost it once and it took all my lives. Please reduce the time to get lives back as well. Its ridiculous' ],

     [ 'Really liked this when I first started playing. Honestly,there is no point me keeping it now. Can\'t perform my operations,as don\'t have bought staff and ward not on the appropriate level. I can\'t get any new staff,as I don\'t have enough hearts,and once you are at a standstill like this it take FOREVER to earn hearts back. Have loads of cash but nothing to do with it!! Game seems to be designed around getting people hooked initially (as performing operations etc is really fun), but then can\'t continue or progress without purchasing hearts!! Not wasting my time with it any longer.',
       'Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I\'ll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx',
       'Your new update will not let me, or several people it looks like,  get into the game. I am currently doing the 12 day event and am on level 17 please fix it ASAP! I refuse to lose all my progress. This is the best game I\'ve had on my phone in a very long time.',
       'I\'ve played this game a few days now, all of a sudden it freezes and crashes. This file has corrupted my new SD card, has uninstalled it\'s self along with any memory on my sd card.... I even downloaded it again as I expected everything is gone... Gone! Great game just not worth the bugs!',
       'Awesome game but fix recruitment. I keep doing gold recruitment and i have almost all the characters but I only have 5 doctors. I keep getting duplucates. It is like it will not give me a new doctor. You should be able to choose whether you are purchasing a doctor, nurse, surgeon, etc. It is not fair always getting nurses. Thanks. Oh, p.s. I have spent a bunch of money. This game is addictive and hearts should be more readily available.',
       'I will give 4 stars to the game out of 5. It\'s a pretty good game among the others. But the main problem is that I can\'t unlock more departments even if I have money or hearts. I am on 29th level and have a good amount of cash but the departments are locked. So a bit disappointed. Please fix this...' ],

       'It\'s a pretty fun game, better than I thought it would be. There is one problem, you don\'t really need to buy "Flooz", but if you do. The prices are a little outrageous. Like 5$ for 100 Flooz, seems a little money hungry. And 100 Flooz for 15 days is 29$ is outrageous as well. I\'ve played other games with better things to do besides upgrading and usually 100 "diamonds" of anything would last 30 and would cost 10-15$. Seems like you\'re trying to rip people off. Besides the money hungry creators, good game to kill time.',

Even uninstalling and reinstalling did not fix the problem. I hope you eventually get it fixed it would be worth downloading again.',
       'Would give this a better review, but there are so many glitches. You can only upgrade a booster once, then you have to close the app and open it again so you can keep upgrading. Loved the game before this started happening. And the tap boost should be longer than 60 seconds, how about 30 minutes like the speed boost.',

It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. uno points equals cs instead of like some of the others where it takes uno points to reach cs etc....Also, TOYOCASH App very reliable in paying you when you redeem to Giftz. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to waIIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for adding some fun to my day.',
       'Fun, addictive, progressively challenging....this game has it all. I especially appreciate the flawless performance with no lag time. I also paid for the ads to be removed... totally worth it!  There are some inconsistencies with words being accepted in some levels but not others....not an issue for me though. It adds to the challenge.  I love the beautiful background pictures!  Best word game ever! I just need more levels now :)',
       'Great game, fair balance of ads. Only thing it needs to mix all the songs thru all levels, as the single song while does hold up to repeat play, eventually gets repetitive. Also need better dictionary because I often play real words and it doesn\'t count them which stinks.',
       'Okay, enjoying playing the game but seems that there are no rules! Sometimes proper nouns are okay sometimes not, words used in previous rounds suddenly aren\'t allowed, etc., plurals are a lottery and perfectly good words are just not accepted and few non-words are allowed. Seems a bit arbitrary at times.',
       'I only downloaded this game because on the advertisement when I saw it on another game I was playing it showed the crosswords where like word search and you cross through it and then it drops off the page until all the words are gone. That is not the game at all and now that I\'ve downloaded I can see that it\'s a completely different game than what was shown on the ad. Disappointing',
       'Its fun but when you get to like level 85 it gets really really difficult. The only way you can pass if is if you know your words very very well. Some times i have ask my mom to help me because it so hard.' ],

Make it more like the casino game before it was changed, single window main with four bonus screens, player claims all wins, OR, keep four main windows with higher minimum bet and have four window bonus screens but player MUST claim all wins.  I am level 48 and bought my way to platinum status. Higher level players ( larger bets) wouldn\'t mind buying coins regularly if it were more fun.',

Played this game for over a year and its become more and more majorly biased to the mega rich.  Customer support is a joke with copy and paste replies and also don\'t take on boars the requests of the community, just favour their money making methods. I understand that this is a company to make a profit, but when you\'re developing a game which is aimed at pleasing the very small pocket of people who sink tens of thousands of pound, it becomes rediculous.  Dont waste your time or money on this. Buy a sudoku book instead',

    description: 'Is it Love? Colin is an  interactive story  in English.Like in a TV series, new episodes (chapters) are regularly released.You can download this love game for free. Will you find Love? Will you make it in the musical world? Story: "You come from a small town, you have a well-ordered life: Basic studies, a very respectful boyfriend and parents who decided on your future. You\'ve always dreamed of becoming a pianist, But your father didn\'t look on it with a favourable eye, so you did what was expected of you. And then, one day, you felt trapped in your monotonous life. So you decided to leave it all behind and move to New York. But, after so many years, having put your dreams aside, your piano gathered dust and your mojo disappeared. At the Carter Corporation, you found a stable office job and good friends.

     [ 'Well the energy situation is beyond annoying. You only get very little for free and the prices for the energy and just WAY too expensive. I do like the story a lot though and will probably take 8 years to complete the story so I don\'t have to pay 50 bucks',
       'Really don\'t like how the guy treats the girl, what a scumbag! Plus I\'ve been playing for over a week and the plot is unbelievably slow, the energy doesn\'t last long enough. There are much better otome style games out there.',
       'My absolute favorite of all of the Is it Love games. Colin is an amazing character with an equally amazing backstory, and the way he connects with the MC is just incredible. The twists and turns in each chapter leave me craving more of the story. The energy they give you is somewhat lacking, but I\'m used to it by now. Highly reccomend!',
       'OK, so I absolutely agree with everyone that the energy you get for free is nowhere near enough & packages are too expensive for what you get. I know, I\'ve bought many. This story particular started bad, but now that I\'m at the end, I\'m hooked. Please continue to update. I have lots of bought energy going to waste!!',
       'I don\'t really like the concept of earning energy every 24 hours. But I\'ve got to say every time i see that message when my energy runs out. It leaves me on a cliffhanger and it keeps me in the story. Even if the energy wasn\'t there i would still play the game to my hearts content! Overall AMAZING story and characters!!',
       'Decent game but I refuse to pay the amount of money they want once the energy for the day is gone. The wording is often wrong for the story and the plot could be better. Big issue for me was how overpriced and poorly written this game was.' ],

Maybe every 40 levels add a mill purchase option. When selling on the market, we need an option for a blind add or a neighborhood only sell or trade.. make these upgrades and so far game would be perfect!',
       'It\'s great to be able to buy from other farms in theory. But there are WAY too many times that you click on something and it\'s either sold or not even in the roadside stand at all. The for sale paper needs to update quicker.  Also, it\'s very hard to accumulate any \'west bucks\' in this game and you need them to do almost anything, so the game is a big money suck too. I\'m deleting it.',
       'Update......I have learned there is a chat feature AND a neighborhood group you can create.....so excited to get to level 19!!!! Would give it a solid 5 stars if we could have an actual chat option with friends. Looking for a new game to get away from FV2, but can\'t find one with the same chat availability.  Add this and I am hooked!',
       'I love these type of games just like hayday. I have noticed it freezes and takes ages to load the newspaper. Also would be helpful if it could tell you who needs help in the newspaper would help filling orders quicker. Also I have noticed alot of people selling the same parts and harder to get others and it\'s extremely rare to get the land parts without paying',
       'The game doesnt give enough case vs things to buy or fix.  Also have issues with getting product into the alloted spaces.  I thought it was my screen but had it cleaned thoroughly and it still happens.  It takes several attempts!!!  The story is cute.  The graphics are cute as well.  Ive noticed it has a couple of choices from other games Ive played on older phones. I would suggest the game to others but get the issues fixed and itll be a 5star game.',
       'I love playing these games. I\'m not sure why we are rating gameplay they offer apps not a game. It\'s crazy how they ask us to rate game at the beginning of game. We haven\'t learned the bad points. This game makes us pay for treasure chest instead of giving us to them free like most games. Which means we have to pay for everything. Totally not fair. Takes the fun out of game.' ],

Only for my account to be gone tried the facebook method plus redownloading the app and nothing happened. 2 years plus  down the drain how especially if it was linked to my email and play games account, I don\'t understand. Sent the dragon soul support team a email with all requested information and got an automated "we\'ll be reviewing your the matter and thank you for your patience". Umm hope so I spent to much way to much time with too much to lose. Dragon soul please fix this 🙏 I LOVE THIS GAME IT\'S LIFE!!! *If issue is resolved I will put up a great and positive review*.',
       'Infuriating exploit. One of which is when you encounter a 2 roster team in expedition mode that is maxed level and tiered. The overall power of such team is lowered, due to only have 2 heroes, thus allowing you to encounter them. However their maxed level and tier make them unbeatable vs your team of 5 non-maxed heroes.  Please fix this by implementing a mandatory requirement of having 5 heroes in every expedition team.',

Yet again no help except for except for the standard cut and paste responses you can find in the help forums. I guess they just don\'t care or are too over extended to to reply to customer problems personally. Either way the app still isn\'t working, and the years of work I\'ve put into building my teams are lost.' ],

     [ 'I know the update on The Book of Dragons came out a long time ago, but I still can\'t make sense of it. The old book of Dragons was a lot easier to understand. If you filtered it to show only searchable dragons, then it would show in order what you unlock. I\'m not sure, but from what I understand is that the dragons are now arranged in time to search. That\'s neat and all, but could you please come out with a filter for dragon unlocsks by Lvl?  Dragons unlocked at a later Lvl is usually better. With the current filter, you can find a dragon which collect 14 mill wood/hour with dragons collecting 1.05 mill wood because it is arranged by time to search. Again, please release a filter option by Lvl unlocked? Thanks for your help!',
       'I really prefer  the old version of  this game like how you\'d have a dragon and you\'d guard a wagon and collect gold and fish and some time a new egg. And if a dragon attacked you\'d battle it and have to tilt your tablet to fly aim you fire blasts.could you add a dragon racing minigame',
       'Game is a good time killer, but getting anywhere in the Jerk at Work is almost impossible. 3 waves of enemies above my level and the only way I can even the odds is if I pay for sage fruit. That is far too stupid and dumb. Thanks for being impossible to beat. UGH',
       'The new update is really great!  But there\'s one glitch when unlocking the legendary dragons. The part in collecting resources for 15 days. It stopped counting the hours since I updated. (It was already 9 days and counting...)   Please fix this.',
       'Slow loading and sometimes does not even load the villege. I already tried clearing cache and it started to re download(tried freeing up space - didn\'t work). Very frustrating and suck. But this is a good game. Please fix and update the game.',
       'The new update is nice, except for the iron storage downgrade. Why the hell would you downgrade from 45k to 10k??? Rest of iron in mail, all 30000 of it!!! Why, thank you , it\'s good to know that I will be able to keep 5000 iron AND LOSE 25K WHEN I CLAIM THE PACK IN MY MAIL. Now I have to keep the mail iron and collect more over days on end to make the next iron storage upgrade.... seriously??? At least divide the iron into packs of say 3k each so that it\'s usable. The fact that the iron storage was downgraded is bad enough, but 30k iron in email when storage is reduced to 10k sucks!!!!  Update: claimed the extra iron. It ended up split into packs of 5000 iron in mail. Little happier now' ],

Other then that the game is quite amazing wish it had more fighter\'s though hopefully in the next updates new fighters will be added in the game.',
       'They app wont even stay up and running the ammount of times the app crashes is insane. Controls wise its a pretty typical fighting game. Idk much past that sonce the app refuses to stay open. In its current state the game is unplayable. If theres any change then ill change my review but for now dont bother',
       'You guys need to improve alot in graphics, smoth animation and quick response of controls.. Because of tekken game\'s cult following arround the world. This game can become no1 if the said aspects are improved. Thanks and good job devs.',
       'I didn\'t expect it will be this bad 😫. Is this cards game or Tekken?. I thought it will have 8 way overlap pad so we can do most of the actions. Because this kind of control what makes the game exciting. But you guys made it with cards. I\'m really so disappointed 😥.',
       'I\'d lost my progress in before the bug fix, even purchased the gems. But now started over. Game is smoother than before. The loading time, the packs opening time, also the time for matches could be trimmed. Also there should be the replay of finishing attack. On Snapdragon 835 adreno 540, it\'s really fluid fast. Sometimes the splash screen in the start freezes, and the screen smudges for a while till loading. Also if you are opening the dojo vault, and you get daily login gift. Both get stuck and not able to retrieve any. There should be tab for daily bonus and time remaining for next gift.',
       'Jst upset that cant give it a zero. The game is pretty good, and is interesting to play but after the latest update , that is v1.0.2 it keeps crashing and I\'ve to reopen it. Seriously dont provide updates if you guys are unable to make it worthwhile.' ],

     [ 'This last update (1.94.2) is f***ed. I constantly get logged out randomly in the middle of a hand and am forced to fold. Also, the filters for games have been generalized so I can no longer narrow down to the game type I want. That one is not even a bug just an awful bewildering design change.',
       'It\'s an ok app. Noticed to many patterns to believe it\'s random. Don\'t play real money unless you feel comfortable throwing it away. Most player\'s who seem to win are from some third world country.',
       'I have been playing on this site for at least 14 years now I loved it I played with real money but in last 4 or 5 years I haven\'t been able to play with real money I do spend reel money to buy fake chips I\'m not happy with the new settings that I can\'t find the tables that I like to play and can\'t play with real money let me tell you that until you fix this and change your settings back the way it was few days ago I wound play and I Will ask all my friends that I referred to this site to stop playing and deposit.  So please fix the problem.  Thanks',
       'Start page doesn\'t open on fave game.  Can\'t reload chips ahead of time.  Also, seating distribution needs attention on Omaha tables.',
       'It\'s fun to watch people play bingo in free money games. They just made it harder to find games that are not NLH. Disappointing',
       'Real unhappy with what this game has become. I have played Pokerstars for years! Started on the computer, then pretty much migrated to the mobile version when the app came out. The computer version has always been better supported, but now I feel like my android phone and I have been left out in the cold. The newest version constantly disconnects. The server reliably kicks me out, and it even seems like only when I have good cards. Also I o my play Fixed-Limit Holden (more skill involved than guts). Superstars was THE app that offered this game, and made it easy to find a seat. No more! If Pokerstars is willing to bend a bit, and meet the needs of more long-time players like myself I may stick around. At this point, I\'ll be looking for a new home (after decades). I was playing Pokerstars long before they were forced out of real money gaming!' ],

In deathmatch, i get kindof irretated when players use vehicles EVERY TIME in malta fort. If you can please change it so players can only use vehicles one game in each server, that would be great. Thanks for this awesome game!',
       'Zombies is fun, can\'t get too far as they seem too strong. Aliens would be cool of I could actually stay connected. Need some better  algorithms for matches. It\'s tough to come into a match with some super over powered weapons...or are they modding? Would like to see some actual action taking place against hackers. You can report them but still see them every day.',
       'Honestly 1 star is not low enough.  I downloaded the game just a moment ago, still has yet to load up. I\'m on a Samsung s8+ and have yet to experience any issues with any game so far to this extent.  Once the game finally decides to load if it even does I\'ll give a better review.',
       'Connection issues solved just wish my Bluetooth controller worked. Just tried it on an android box why can I not download the game with Ethernet only wifi and also why is there three sperate downloads why no just all one from the play store. Controller support would be nice',
       'Full of bugs. eg I\'ve played alien for a long time, suddenly it wouldn\'t work. Restarted the app, noticed all of my progress lost. (This isn\'t the first time.) By the way, the anomaly left after a player is killed causes a lot of lag to the game. Other than that, this game is still fun to play with. Just that there are irritating bugs that I hope will be fixed in the future.',

     [ 'I really love the concept of completing puzzles, different quests and special side games. The graphics are great as well. I don\'t, however, like that you\'re almost forced to pay for tickets or you can play MAYBE one game a day. Needless to say, I\'m not spending money to boost up my tickets.',
       'I have 89 power ups and cannot use them. This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen in a bingo game, it\'s cheating. Ok so they put up power ups that I don\'t have and want me to buy them.Here\'s the kicker, if I don\'t buy them it stays up the whole game and doesn\'t let me use the ones I have!!!!! Ahhh greed! What a joke. Absolutely unfair. I\'ve never seen anything like it. So so sad. And now since the new update it takes way too long to level up!! They just more greedy with each update. Again, so, so sad.',
       'Game freezes and I always lose my tokens. Not fun. I dont play for days to save just to play 2 stupid games',
       'The game started out fun an interesting. After the update you don\'t win ever an also it takes forever now to level up. Wouldn\'t recommend now..',
       'So far I can\'t figure out what the xp points are for. This game unfortunately, like most of these games starts to get impossible to play because you have to keep paying for tokens in order to continue. I really like the concept, but I\'m probably going to uninstall it as it\'s far too expensive for what little bit of playing time you do get.',
       'It\'s more exciting in the beginning. The higher the level the harder it becomes to even have tickets or power ups to play. If u are able to get tickets your not likely to win without buying power ups. So no matter how u look at it the higher the level the more cash out of your pocket it will take to play.' ],

If not lower prices then at least add more tickets like 10 or 15 for 20$? Pretty please! Well either you change it or not I just want to say. I LOVE THEM STORIES ARE DAMN ROMANTIC AND INTERESTING! Love it! Make more event prizes that involves a lot more diamonds and tickets please! THANK YOU LOVE~ | Update: more season 2 of characters please!!!',
       'Addictive, very entertaining stories with good music, colorful graphics, and great characters! My issues with this game is a money dumper! It\'ll make you spend money to fully complete the stories. In between chapters, you are giving a certain amount of time to complete the mini games or whatever the task may be, which is impossible, in order to receive those special pages.  So it\'s fun, but there is no way to fully complete stories for free...',
       'Fun stories and lovable characters. The only issue is that the amount of jade needed overall for one characters main story is a bit high. I would also like the opportunity to win or use gold/jade to get the side stories. Finally there\'s almost no point to having gold. The 4 rating is because despite the cost in time and money I still wanted to finish the story. It would be great if we could buy entire main stories.',
       'I really enjoy the storyline - it doesn\'t involve too much comedy or anything like that - but it isn\'t extremely serious either. I love the characters, and I wanna unlock everything possible that involves Ukyo. I do feel that the art for some characters Can be a bit better..(eduard\'s arm Always being up is a bit awkward). My biggest complaint is that there are many hard to reach checkpoints. But other than that, it\'s very fun and interesting!',
       'The game is quite good till the part i played but the only problem which i have with this game is after the prologue. After finishing chapter 1 part 1 i can\'t seem to be able to play the story. It goes completely blank. HURTS !! I couldn\'t even get a chance to pick my choice ;(',
       'The story is great. My only complaint is how much jade I need for the premium routes, also when I try to complete tasks for free jade it doesn\'t let me click it and go to said app to download it or take me to the website to complete the task. Everything else is done well though so no complaints there' ],

     [ 'Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.',
       'Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don\'t get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a "Create a Player" option under \'My Club\' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It\'d be so nice if you add that.',
       'I will love it if i can send players on loan and be paid some coins instead of directly selling them off. Also switching players for a few or no coins will be great. Since players like pogba likes changing his hairstyles, it will also be great to effect some changes in some players hairstyle. More leagues are needed, if possible, German,  Chinese, Nigerian and south African league. Lastly, commentators find it difficult to call the name of a created player, work on these and this game will be perfect.  Thanks',
       'Where\'s my coin? Last week my buy the coins and until now she didn\'t receive any coins. Earlier day, i buy the coins, because of offer that you have given, its was fine. Except for just now, i buy it because of i want to buy Alexis Sanchez, because of this matter, i have lost my chances to buy it. Connection was stable, and if it do so, you have to fix it. Otherwise refund back the money or in future, what would happen to your company?',
       'Very good game. There are lots of players but Manuel Neuer is missing. Some extra things need to be done for this game to become the top football game. German Clubs and many clubs of other countries like those of Poland, Denmark, etc. are missing. If these clubs are added, then the game becomes complete. Hope this changes are done by the "First Touch" as fast as possible.',
       'Great game. Controls could seize to work at times (not very often though) but as a whole, it is a fantastic game. Quality graphics and game play. It would be nice if the game could auto-update(with internet connection) so teams could be updated and players could be at their current clubs e.g Coutinho (Barca), Alexis (Man utd ), Mkhritaryan(Arsenal)etc. Love this game' ],

If you bought it you should be allowed to switch back and forth as you wish.    It\'s a really zen pass time  game :) also cute and interactive.',
       'This would totally be worth 5 stars if it weren\'t for the ADS. I get it\'s a free game, but its one thing to put an ad on the top or side of the screen. It\'s one thing to optionally watch ads for coins and prizes. But its another thing when full screen videos pop-up, pausing your game and wasting your time. I was honestly thinking about giving this 3 stars just b/c of how annoying that is alone.',
       'I think you need to stop rigging the wheel and actually let me get more then a few diamonds because it\'s pissing me off. Other then that the game is good',

     [ 'I hate this game cause one, you can\'t even change the decorations or visitors. Two, you can\'t even get coins for completing a level and the daily wheel is rigged cause you can\'t get anything good. Three, if you watch a video for a reward or life, it never gives you anything. And four, they don\'t give you enough moves for each level, there are too many ads and everything\'s so overpriced. Hate this bullcrap game😡',
       'A great game, but WAAAAY  too many ads. Its the same thing after each level: AN AD. The game is fun, but its hard to enjoy when you\'re watching ads every second. And Im getting the same ads over and over! I want to rate five stars, I really do, but I cant if there\'s going to be this many ads in a game I think everyone would enjoy. 💛💛💛💛♡ (( pretend the hearts are stars )) I\'ll download the game again once I see less ads in your games, like My Talking Angela, which also has way too many ads. Please take this into consideration! Thank you!',
       'I am so disappointed in this game due to the fact my 3 year old somehow bypassed my password and spent 79.99 on coins!!! I sent a message immediately to Google play and the developer and I was told it doesn\'t meet the refund requirements. WTH?!! So frustrating! 😡',
       'This game would be a whole lot of fun IF there weren\'t so many ads! My niece is not patient enough to wait for stupid ads to finish, and u can\'t play the game until the ad is finished! Very disappointed!',
       'Love this game. Super fun but how do you get rid of ads? I paid for coins yet i still have ads. This is highly annoying especially if i can\'t skip them. Still love the game just not the ads :(',
       'Ahh I think it\'s a pretty good game. This is the 1 st time I\'m giving my review. I loved the game.I\'m.now in lvl 179 this game is fantastic but the lvl r so hard as we increase our lvl. This game have a good graphics, game, control n plz make more this kind of games' ],

     [ 'I\'m so addicted to this game! Out of all the simulation games I\'ve played this is by far my favourite. The characters are great and the story line changes on each route so it keeps you interested. And you don\'t have to spend money to enjoy everything in this game. An hourglass takes a while to get but it\'s worth it to use them to get the extra stories. I enjoyed the Christmas add on.',
       'Nice description, nice plot. Likable characters with spot on music. What more could I ask for? (Edit on 9/7: I downed the rating not because it\'s a bad game, but because although I had an account for this game, I lost all my data when I logged in. I had saved 270+ hourglasses so I could do the secret endings but well. That went down the toilet. I won\'t be trying again until I get interested (and over this) in this game again. Other than that I fully recommend this game.)',
       'I\'ve been a long term fan now since 2016 when it came out and I still play it to this day! The chatrooms are very interesting to read and the visual novels are always something to look forward to! I have been in love with Saeran since the Common Route so him getting his own route was like a dream come true! Although, his route is an emotional roller coaster..',
       'Update: I said that I only rated 4 stars because sometimes I missed the chat room because I didn\'t get any notification, right? But now, after I updated the game I get notifications about the chat, and not just once but twice! I got double notifications lol I\'m so happy, thank you! And thanks for the 20 hourglasses after the update. Now I give you full 5 stars! I LOVE this game! 😘  I\'d love to give 5 stars, I mean this game is amazing and almost perfect! Just sad that sometimes I missed the chat because I didn\'t get the notification. So, I have to check the game often. But I really enjoy playing this game, which doesn\'t feel like game at all. I feel like I\'m chatting and talking with real people! And it says something, cause I just installed this yesterday. Highly recommended! Try it and you\'ll love it!',
       'There\'s a glitch. I can\'t even log in anymore. I used to love this game. I hope they fix this so I can play it again. But now every time I try to log onto my account it says \'Network error try again\' even when my wifi connection is perfectly fine. I\'d give this five stars if it gets fixed. Till then, since I can\'t play it, it\'s only 1 star.',
       'Hey! I fixed my rate. Sorry for the bad English. I really loved it!!! I have a suggestion...if it\'s fine? Uhm, I would be very happy if you made another game that is somehow connected in this app but please, can you not put girls in that app?? I would like if the one playing is the only girl or boy or any gender..just don\'t put a girl in the game...because of personal reasons.' ],

Otherwise i love this game its the best reading app I\'ve ever gotten thanks you deserve 5 stars',
       'Scream was interesting, didn\'t like the ending though. You can only save people if you pay. If I had known I wouldn\'t have wasted diamonds on pointless choices earlier. Also tired of games shaming the characters for not buying clothes',
       'Great game. Lots of choices so every play through is a bit different. But it does rely too much on gems for a choice you\'ve already made before ended up spending nearly 200 euro on two play throughs of scream.',
       'Chapters are a little short and the best choices are way too expensive.  8 dollars just to make 1 choice?? Also I would like to buy the monthly plan, but I will not do so until you fix the clothing glitch some of the items when you select them just put a block of colour onto my character. Fix that and I\'ll pay for monthly',
       'I enjoy my time on this game and I love the customisations and stories. Only when it doesn\'t freeze when I get on to the game, I love it! Only it does that all the time and its hard to actually find it pleasurable. As soon as I open the app, it stops working and I have to restart it and it either works but becomes very laggy or freezes again. Or it freezes in the middle of playing. Please fix, thanks.',
       'While the \'gems for good choices\' thing is annoying, I\'m used to it on games like this. The stories are very good. The thing I DON\'T like is that you earn clothes but can\'t use them unless you, surprise, use gems. I don\'t mind losing choices because of gems but please reconsider not being able to use the clothes you earn. That would definitely earn my 5th star.' ],

       'I like the game. I was in love with it when I first got it, but coming back to it I remember why I Uninstalled it. It\'s because it coats so much to expand. It\'s honestly ridiculous. This also means it\'s difficult to keep the butterfly you have and get the event ones. It\'s just a upsetting. If it wasn\'t for that literally making progress in the game stupid I would give it a 5 star.',

     [ 'I really enjoy this game alot. Its better then the other hospital type apps that i have played. Great time killer and fun.  There is only one problem that i have with this app so far. You can not rotate the map around to see the diffrent angles and it causes me to have a difficult time placeing things sometimes. I would love to see a rotation button added to the game.',
       'Love it. But I do have a suggestion. I think the game should have wereifur in need of something u should be able to ask nother player if they have a item u need and if they would sell it to u.bc searching tho the ads and waiting for what I need to come up takes to long... I always need shovels but can never get any so it would be great if I was able to ask a player if they had any they would be willing to get rid of for a price....and it dose take to long to get to the next level... Like way to long I been on level 33 for 4 months now n I play alot..ever day a good many hours and I do alot on here and it seems I never can get up to another level Other then that is great. I love ethe game...',
       'Why is getting the shovel getting harder and harder? This way it would be difficult to play the game at all. I tried finding it in stores and cant find any. I tried going and helping in the gardens of others yet i dont get shovels. Please change it back to the way it was instead where we could easily get the shovel making the game slightly easier.',
       'Constantly disconnects and needs to reload. Happened while collecting my 540 coins for 2 hammers and I lost my coins and the 2 hammers. Not enough coins from patients and too many coins to buy necessary machines. Way toooo much waiting around unless you buy diamonds. Number of diamonds needed is way too high. Nothing but a money grab.',
       'This game is great . All the features are excellent. Laboratory, patio , VIP ward every things is superb. But here is one problem that whenever I but something , it becomes more expensive than the last one . I want to expand my hospital , but it is too expensive. The cost should not be more than 1000 rupees. Please it is a request. And if it is not possible , than its OK . I will manage. And a big thank youuuuuuu for creating this game. THIS IS REALLY THE HEALTHIEST GAME IN THE WORLD. THANK YOUUUUUUU CHERRY PICK GAMES. THANK YOUUUUUUU.',

Looking back I would give seasons one and two 5* however I am annoyed at the devs for cutting short season three as another one to two months would have been better. Now I have no chance of getting Gigantes, a free Gairo in season three.  I also do not appreciate reducing alliance members from 290.  I worry that season four maps will be too small.  I am concerned that the devs may ruin a decent game.',

     [ 'This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!',
       'This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you\'re willing to go broke',
       'Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.',
       'Its the best game I have ever played. The things you can build are amazing and it\'s great that you can build your own to. The controls and graphics are unbelievably amazing. Great animal sounds to, they actually sound exactly the same as a real animal. Its also great that you can have villager\'s and your own pets. Only problem is the packs you have to use diamonds and if I don\'t have enough then I have pay for the diamonds and I\'m just a kid and my mom says no so please make the packs and the things in them cheaper. But other than that, this game is so AWESOME. 😃',
       'Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses.',
       'I have a significant concern with how easy it is to accidentally spend the gems. It has happened at least once, though I\'m assuming it happened a second time while I was quickly clicking building a building, since fifteen gems are now unaccounted for. I cannot feel comfortable with this game if at any given moment, all my gems might get spent because of one misclick.' ],

Looks plz and thx fix that and yes I\'m on my phone when I play it AND ONE LAST THING. MY DRAGON DONT SLEEP LIKE DID I GET THE GAME AT THE WRONG TIME',
       'Just the idea of creating your own HTTYD character and walking around on Berk and interacting with other players is so, so awesome!!! Really fun to play, BUT there are some bugs that can be pretty frustrating. I sometimes find that my control panel disappears, or I can\'t press the Play button when I want to log in, or the rooms just don\'t load, which is a problem when I need to go somewhere for a quest. But I keep the app anyways, because it\'s JUST. SO. FUN.  Just please fix the bugs so other people won\'t get as frustrated as I do.  I highly recommend this app; so much fun.',
       'It\'s a great game, I really like playing it, but they need to fix a little bit, and add a little bit. for instance: make more expansions, like making a Valka\'s Sanctuary!....Also it would be cool if you could become a dragon rider with Hiccup and the others, and have fun guest on dragons edge. And make Berk better and more realistic...Also I LOVE Razorwhip\'s!!, I have one, but there is nothing for them; no saddles, no cloths...nothing!! And the chat is really overdone! I said \'where\' and they turned my chat off for 3 days, so I couldn\'t talk with my friends!!...But it\'s still a great game I would recommend it to anyone who loves dragons...they just need to fix a little bit!...but all and all its a great game.',
       'Awesome game very exciting!!! I love dragons my favourite type of dragon is the zippleback dragon! This game is amazing and so addictive! I love the game and recommend it! But plz plz plz I don\'t know if this game is a scam but I tried to buy some gems entered  my card details right when I was about to buy the gems the game shut down.... I tried it again to see if that just happened to happen but unfortunately the same thing happened.... I\'m not blaming the people who made the game at all cuz I love the game!! But I just think it was a bit odd how it crashed as I entered my details.... I was quite upset because now I can\'t afford a deadly nadder egg... Thank you for reading this.xx',
       'First of all, I love this game. It is interesting but there are 2 problems. 1. Fishlegs has 2 quests for me but every time I click on 1 of the quests it freezes and I then have to close the app and then go back in. 2. Fishlegs is the only 1 who has quests. Please fix this. Good update too. P.S. I was just flying around and then the game and then the game said "Sorry you cannot say that here. This is your first warning." Can you fix that too, please?',
       'This game has all the potential to be grate, right now its wayyyyy to glitchy. Controls are terrible, its slow, and half the time my control doesnt work and im just stuck in one place.  Once tge glitches are fixed and everything can move fluently then itll be a really grate game. Untill then work out the bugs' ],

     [ 'Amazing and a unique type of game. The currency is all obtainable even as a free to play. Cool looking dragons and the movement in the game more lively than just pictures. I\'ve played many app before this and I would say that this is top 1 so far. The only problem is the game will stop and crash. I don\'t know the reason but I\'ve tried in another device and also stops working. Overall the game is magnificent and I definitely recommend it to everyone!',
       'Awesome! I really like the game. Top 5 game? Worth it! I\'ve played some similar game but this one is the best. The graphic is great and the dragons are cute. The resources are not too hard to get. The best part is the drag-skill! It\'s really different. Each dragon have their skill effect with different area form. You have to drag it right. A long way to be a master tamer. So enjoy the process!',
       'Pretty well made game afterall, all currency ingame can be obtained in fairly free and quick way. The game also offers really big help/supply for newbies. Spend a few (for me 3)days and you can already get 3 times of 11 advanced draw. Can get a little bit of grindy but not pay to win either. The flaws being some English translation error and extreme flashy visual effects, and the lack of (limited even) variety of the dragons and campaign plot.',
       'Great game.. I\'ve played all the others, but one huge problem. I keep randomly having an issue that my app acts as if there is a pop up (that never actually pops up) in the middle of battles, lagging out my game. Every 10 or so minutes the app crashes as well. It would be a great game to keep on my phone.. if it would actually stay open.',
       'Very clean, polished game. Took awhile to get used to it but I really enjoy it now.its easily free to play as well once you reach level 20. You can get somewhere around 1.2k gems a day just by playing. You can also get gems by just questing.',
       'Good games guys but the summon rate for a 5 star is too low. Im one of the top players on the server. When i do get a 5 star its one that i already have. Also the log in event is not working for the American server. Even if you pay. Its a waste cuz rates are too low. So don\'t' ],

     [ 'To all retards: This game is not pay to win. You have a chance to unlock the famous generals. Unlike wc3 where it is pay to win. This game was made simpler and has better gameplay. You have stackable units that you can\'t do in wc3. You have the chance to unlock the famous generals now and no oil. With stackable units you can tank damage and have to not worry about defeating generals like Manstein. This is good. I hope to see EasyTech woth WC5. You just need to stop being lazier than you are for just paying for early access.',
       'Fantastic game. Easy Tech games are not pay to win games. They are challenging strategy games. This is definitely  their most challenging one so far. Ive played most of their games and have beat them all without paying, it just takes time and effort. If you are a wimp who wants to win easy and cant handle a good challenge, then these games aren\'t for you. My all time favorite strategy series for mobile.',
       'Honestly it is a very good game. I love it, and I like some of the changes made, like how you have to take a city to steal land from others. I found that my allies would claim all the land around my city in WC3 and it was annoying. I also like the animations added. However I find that in order to really get anything good you have to pay real money. Now that wouldn\'t be a problem but some of the prices are crazy. So please, if you lowered he prices to things or offered discounts once in awhile I feel like you could make more money as things would be more affordable for TR players and the players would be able to get better things easier. But other than that this game is fun and I really liked it.',
       'Really enjoy the game, have played all conquers by easy tech but I have to agree with most folks saying medals are required to win. In 3 you at least got 1 free general, and I made do with a couple shoddy early generals in WC3. Bronze generals cost as much as GOOD generals in WC3. Ya\'ll need to lower medal price for a good deal of generals. Middle tier bronze is 1200 medals. 7$ for 2800 medals... give us a break please. *edit* you simply cannot grind medals without paying. A good 80%-90% of generals simply cannot be grinded out.',
       'Very good game. Compared to the wc 3 it is easier to get generals. The only problem is that it gets too repetitive but i guess that u should wait until u finally want to play again and with pleasure. On the other hand it is just slightly better than wc 3 but y is there a price for this one? But overall it s ok it s just the price that disturbs me. Good job keep up the good work Ps can u guys do one game like that for the 7 years war?',
       'I want a refund I spent £5 and 2 days later not only did my medals go away with no spending so did all of my progress please respond and help. BTW nice game controls simple and nice and thank god you fixed the border issues except the money problem it all great. Edit - nvm fixed it by reinstalling it then pressing restore however I lost all progress I hope this doesn\'t happen again...' ],

     [ 'It\'s a very fast paced game. It\'s like clash royale but faster. Good fun only played a few games at the moment.  Also I spent money on a pack and didn\'t get the items it said I should but they soon corrected it.',
       'Since last update I cannot see the whole game on my screen. Exit markers on top right and cards are just off of the screen. Please recalibrate. I have a galaxy 8 plus so I know the screen is big enough! Otherwise a great game!',
       'I\'ve been in the 800 plus trophy range for a while and I can\'t seem to unlock bombard, everyone I play has it. I\'ve opened all kinds of chest and even spent USD. I\'m very frustrated.',
       'Good game, but some new characters are cheap, meaning they make the game imbalanced.  The mana troll is too powerful.  The snipers are too hard to get at.  The tentacle cannot be countered.  This goes on and on.  Not every new idea is a good one.  Leave well enough alone.  I may be quitting this soon if it keeps up.',
       'A great game...but its either pay to win which is lame, or worse half these jerks hack into the game and enable the hacks if they start losing....summoning 5 titans in less than 15 seconds, 3 of which are the same titan summoned in that short time isnt legit...its cheating. Game is fun but they def need a hack shield and stop making it a pay to win game. If it were a game that wasnt pay to win like the new monster hunter world is, and it was based on your skill alpne, it would be a top game, and man how many ppl i would wreck....but sadly its all about money',
       'It\'s fun and all but it\'s so stat based it ruins your round if the enemy has stronger units. You won\'t have a chance to win if that is the case. If you want a game that is all about strategy then this won\'t scratch your itch sadly.' ],

     [ 'Worst performing app on ANY of my devices. Playing as a newly created acct lags more than than my lvl530 no idea why. Thousands of pop up messages ruin gameplay. Performance is the worst is all i can say. Not strictly pay to win but almost still fun while free and has been for years. I just hope it works decently on your device as performance has just gotten worse over the years on my dozens of devices. They stopped caring about the game and set their sights on money instead kinda sad',
       'Need to improve,for offline play for ppl who don\'t have much time or limited internet.',
       'I didn\'t receive anything for purchase, only confirmation email from play store thanking me for purchase',
       'Your game has a ton of bugs you need to fix.',
       'Not up to todays standard in gaming (not even mobile gaming!) 100 % pay to win! Story mode, team-fights and some PvP (incl. empire wars), offer less than competitors do. Ocassional appearing events will bore you, latest when played for the third time! Graphics are average. Summing up: The game modes & stages are not attractive, fair or interesting! Tier 2 classes didnt bring more flexebility, instead further inbalanced wars. Since high ranked PvPs are rewarded per season, top boss-fighters should receive similar. One could see over all those gaming issues and still have fun with this game, BUT the aggressively hostile community & chat atmosphere gives this product the rest! A childish product that attracts childish minds! Be sure to protect minors from that inacceptable environment!!! All ranking calculations seem quite strange, as late entries always have unfair advantages. I dont get in what reality people live that introduce earnings and progression upon PvP-losses?!? - everybody knows that the high ranks are earned through purchases anyway, trying to be everybodies darling now? Maybe you should remove pre-selected PvP-lists, and stop rigging the competition instead! No game anywhere in the world rewards for loosing, nobody can take such actions serious, and therefore I still can only evaluate mobile gaming much childisher than real competetive console- & PC-gaming! My advice: You are better off with a competitors game! PS: spare me those ignorant standard review replies, this game is of such low quality, you dont need to outline this further by giving awkward suggestion replying to reviews! All regarding this negative ranking is all detailed, outlined and explained in this review, maybe read it before annoying me with an additional review reply!!',

When i do so it shows the doubled value with the option to double again, and again the process can be repeated. This has amazing potential, But im really curious about how much Wiz is involved with this project, hmu i have plenty of ideas to make this game amazing--- love the new strains and goals btw! Keep up the amazing progress',
       'Its not to bad if you can handle watching all the full length commercials to earn your gems.   The Facebook option sucks,,,,,  and its a waist of a good bong and couch .........Not everbody wants to be on facebook to achieve higher levels in a game.  Maybe create a lounge area where you can kick back smoke a doobie and socialize with other game players.',
       'I\'m killing this games in two days I got to level 40. The strains are accurate with the reviews as well. Great game love the challenges. Played first tournament and won by over 1000. Hard work pays off just like real growing',
       'DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU ENJOY WATCHING ADS !!!Another potentially  great game ruined by ads. not even a minute in the game and it tells me I need to watch ads. watching ads should be optional in all games and not forced upon your clients by making the game too hard to play without watching the ads. I don\'t get why game developers can\'t just make a great game you want to make purchases in. ads generate revenue for the game developers. let\'s not get them rich off of terrible IN game ads. Hempire is a great weed growing game. check it out n u will not be dissatisfied as you will be playing this garbage.',
       'Great game. The only thing I don\'t like is when you get jars there are too many  duplicate pieces but other than that awesome game',
       'I love this game but its on its way off my phone. The video ads are not giving the bonus they are supposed to. Please fix this! If the game requires 30 second videos to put out the bonus, then why are you showing 15 second ones? Its bad enough that we have to watch them at all please fix this.' ],

       'Love the game, excellent game play, and really makes you feel in charge! However, for game play 4 stars, because it is really annoying that every ship coming into a port, or finishing repairs, you have to click on visit the port! Why can\'t there be a OK option there as well? But, overall excellent game!',

     [ 'The first three turns of the game has an incredibly small amount of finite moves.  You wouldn\'t know this because the typical player will take more than 30 seconds on their first, second, and third turns.  You start to realize that on "draft" games, you will benefit more if you concede the game when your opponent is taking an agonisingly long time on the first few turns because they\'re putting so much thought into the only play in their hand.',
       'Hands down one of the best card games I have ever played. The gameplay is simplistic yet emersive. The different combinations of cards and deck types you can build is vast allowing you to adapt to any challenge you may encounter. While the gameplay is phenomenal, it\'s very easy to gain an understanding of how to play and the cards themselves. Bethesda has yet again made a game that has captivated me. Well done 👍',
       'An absolutely wonderful game. Even better then Hearthstone if you ask me. It\'s so good that even I, Solaire of Astora who hails from Dark Souls, absolutely praises this game. 100% recommend. This only issue that one could run into is lag, but this is only due to the fact that I have an older phone. I\'m sure that if you have a better phone, this game would be EVEN better. Praise the Sun \\[T]/',
       'I\'m a huge card player of all kinds and really didn\'t expect much of this game, but have loved all of the console ELDER SCROLLS so I gave it a try. Immediately hooked, and the best part is how well balanced the game is in terms of card power. I have made 4 decks of separate play styles with equal win rates. 5 stars for sure',
       'I really hate having to admit this, but I\'m huge Magic the Gathering fan... And I really feel like this game is not only one of the best card games I\'ve ever played but a thousand times better than Magic. Everything about this game is amazing. It\'s obvious that Bethesda meticulously  thought out and skillfully created a solid card game with the intention of destroy all the competition. Thank you for creating another amazing game. I only have one problem that needs absolved... Somebody stole my sweetroll!',
       'The game itself is okay. But like others said this is not a free game and should not pretend to be. The introduction campaign, is useful to see what the game is about, but it is very short. I wouldn\'t even mind paying a small amount to unlock different storylines, if the price was reasonable. Surely the company would make more from having a 100 people spend £2. Than 10 people spending £15? (Yeah it really is that simple) you would also have 100 more happy customers. Also, the cost of the card packs follows the same business plan. Charge less, sell more. Otherwise you just look like all the other greedy companies out there.' ],

     [ 'I also liked the game more at lower levels. Maybe you could make it like a loss drops your rating by so many points. I hit lvl 130 and barely win a fight with either of the three of my ships. If we could drop points, maybe we could get 3 straight wins or 5 a day. The higher the rank, obviously means harder opponents. But my ships are only so strong while saving up money to by better upgrades or a better ship. Please fix this',
       'The match making system could be improved. Match making is based on your level but does not take into account the level of the ship. To test this I took a Heavy Fighter At level 11 and was being matched up with Frigates. No chance in heck to win for me. Even at higher levels it\'s hard to win if your opponent has a ship 3-4 steps above you. A limit of 2 levels above and below for ships would be a good fix.',
       'This game if fun....but after trying a couple of the free offers to gain in game currency and never receiving the funds I will be uninstalling. I contacted fyber(the ad company that gives out the currency) and they say they gave the compensation. I cannot support a game that blatantly states that funds may not be awarded and still uses the fraud company. It is a great disservice to the player base and I will not stand for it',
       'I really liked this game.  Its fun and addicting if you like constantly building tweaking and testeing your ship against other peoples.  Unfortunately when you log on one day and randomly all of your progress and all of the ships youve worked on have disappeared and you have to start from scratch again i could not recommend playing this.  I could see no way to ask for help so there is no recourse if this happens.  Funny that all my achievements and battle stats stayed just no ships, levels, or in game credits and paid for crystals.  Stayed logged in to google play so that should have saved my progress.',
       'I really like this game. The variety of ships and focus on building is fun and imaginative. A warning to new gamers, Unfortunately I (level 30) have been struggling to progress since coming across the Destroyer Vega (limit time in game purchase) the majority of match ups, as it\'s overpowered at the level you can get it, means constantly loosing.',
       'This game is awesome! I want more ships and stuff I would  love to play this game alot!  The only thing I don\'t like is that there is no name change and sometimes that game will just crash and you have to restart. If you can fix this I will rate five. Thanks.' ],

Its OK to waste 20mins on but I won\'t be keeping it that long.',

I can no longer add friends or send/receive points ever since after the very first day I played this game. I tried reinstalling, didn\'t work. PLEASE fix this issue an I will gladly rate 5*. I am in Server a5, ID is MaJoRbIg81',
       '9/1/17 Update- they haven\'t responded to my multiple emails. When they do, it\'s a canned response like how I am seeing when I read through the reviews. I like the game and have resorted to another server. I wish they would fix the original server i was one since i have better toons on there. 8/21/17- I liked this game a lot. I haven\'t tried idle heroes since I thought this looked cool. But for some reason I have been getting errors with just getting into the guild and receiving messages from the guild. I have had this issue for a couple of days now. I had someone contact me back, telling me that they will fix the issue soon.. I sure hope so. I will def. Rate this higher if they manage to fix it within a day or two.',
       'For almost a month now we\'ve been screwed by dhgames. They don\'t care about this game. They abandoned it. This game is fun, but doesn\'t work properly. I\'ve sent multiple emails and many reports, just to not hear anything back. Don\'t download',
       'Problem with hanging on load screen corrected the following day. Getting used to the big changes since update. Still a great game! Hoping for a "Skip Battle" button soon...',
       'I like it and I enjoy playing it. But I still think Idle Heroes are the better of the two. I enjoy not having to deal with this 1/2 and 1/3 waves as most games have. So the static 6vs6 that Idle Heroes have is more to my liking rather then having wave-stages.  BUT.... as of now, since last updates Avenger Heroes is broken. Everytime you login you always get this arrow pointing to either dungeons or you get the "you unlocked guild" message directly on login. And the screen is frozen. Can\'t swipe left or right. So all islands on your right or left side you have no way of accessing and alot of progress is lost. Uninstalling and reinstalling doesn\'t fix it either. And this is still not fixed. Been three days and three days I have been sending ingame feedback on this error/bug.',
       'This game is fun and interesting.. however ,this game lack of event and surprise ..i\'ve sent multiple email but none have been answer yet.. Please improve this game sir give us Halloween event.. We spend money in this game also.. The more event the more money we\'ll spend..' ],

     [ 'The game in itself is in no way a Final Fantasy Game, apart from containing many of the series favorite characters. It is however a very enjoyable and addictive game, keeping you returning for just one more battle.  I haven\'t found any bugs so far, works perfect but does require a constant internet connection.',
       'Good game. Lots of characters to choose from and they are obtainable for FREE. Which is different from FFBE. The only problem im having is its hard to get specific character weapons for each character in story. Specifically the 25 gear draw. I\'ve been obtaining only 3-4 of the 25 story character weapons and I still don\'t have the weapon I\'m looking for. Also it\'ll be hard to obtain the same copy of the weapon to limit break it. And it Cost a lot of gems just to obtain one. Hopefully the game will add higher chance and still have the opportunity to get those weapons since its expiring tomorrow.',
       'It\'s very nostalgic to see all the famous characters in a game together and in a game that works. This game is awesome and addicting. I haven\'t spent any money on the game and I can still get stuff done and not get blocked by something stupid to pay for like most games. Grinding is kindve a nightmare for when you unlock later characters you want to use but the writing and gameplay is solid. Love this game and I highly recommend it to any FF fan.',
       'Loved the game from when I downloaded it and played the hell out of it none stop for days pretty much. However, after doing the latest update today, the game has lost all functionality and is unable to even begin. I\'ve attempted to load it several times, and have even uninstalled it and then reinstalled it multiple times but it still won\'t work. Love the game, its one of the best games on the app store but I\'m pretty much furious now that the game just won\'t work for me any more and I\'m not the only one this has happened to.',
       'For a phone game this has been the first one to actually grab me in a really long time. It\'s a great time killer it\'s super addictive and I even find myself stopping to focus on it during some of the harder fights. Everything\'s very rewarding and while I wish that the microtransactions were a lot cheaper all in all it\'s a really good game.',
       ':( I was excited but after downloading was met with a black glitchy screen. Uninstalled and reinstalled twice no luck. Gonna wait a few days and try again. Not hating on the game at all, just gonna wait a bit.  EDIT: Now that it has been patched it works perfectly, I love this game. Thanks you so much.' ],

     [ 'Great time killer! Simple to play, though a few information/help would be nice for a few items, the auto sell option and the bailer so you know exactly what they do.  The developer does listen to the players and fixes things! Only true issues that I have are 1)the materials needed to build the buildings in incredibly high, not really obtainable for game play, even for someone who would play constantly',
       'You had my attention, and now you have my money. Yes, this is a good game. However, it costs too much real money to advance this game. There are many missing pieces and too much to acquire to be able to progress. Maybe instead of making it so in depth, take it down a notch. Let people use junked cars to fix cars and sell them, if this is already an option make it easier to do so. I think this is a good game just too in depth and not enough give to make it entertaining and fun at this time.',
       'Great time killer... Love it so far and only been playing since yesterday... Already level 11 and got quite a few things however I gave 4 stars because I spent 10 diamonds on the bank which showed the stock market but didn\'t tell me it was coming soon until I paid for it... I like that this game doesn\'t make you pay real cash and gives you tokens just to win more cash, diamonds, energy etc so please don\'t ruin the game in the future and make us pay 2 play =)',
       'The game is over good. It\'s definitely fun for your car enthusiasts but I am now level 11 and I can\'t obtain "glass" to build any buildings... The game is getting boring because I can\'t move up, it\'s pretty much scrap cars and sell parts... I don\'t want to rate this game too high because I believe it still is a work in progress, but yes it\'s a good game and I would recommend it',
       'It\'s a decent concept. Good time killer for a little while. I don\'t know why all these games take energy. Just let me play the damn game. And the constantly fluctuating prices to sell the parts got old REAL QUICK! Apparently the creators of this game have never been to a salvage yard in their life.',
       'Game is simple and easy to play but the materials are hard to get and even when have enough to repair a building it\'s not working. Also the rewards to leveling up are very low for the amount of work needed to get there. After about level 11 or 12 is just more experience but the same $100 and 10 energy cap increase. No diamonds and no material for leveling up. Fix these few issues and I\'m sure this game will keep it\'s fun factor a little longer' ],

So instead of hitting 90° and then the counter says "combo broken" it could be something like 100°! Cause I mean... Reverse entries are awesome! And you should make the hoonicorn Mustang 4wd instead of rwd in the drift setup!!',

You don\'t really have any objective in the game, you just send away the planes and look at them fly, until the routes and planes eventually freezes and you\'ll have to restart the whole app for it to work again.',
       'The game is good in general but there is no option as far as I can see to disable notifications. Even disabling notifications through the settings doesn\'t stop the airplane beep from sounding. Poor menu layout and lack of options in the settings',
       'Really good game, I love the fact that it puts my managerial skills at work and helps improve them in one way or another, the fact that you have so many different planes to choose from is amazing, graphics really good, perhaps a bit of work on the slots, maybe put as a prize to get am coins as well. Overall, wonderful game and captivating! Ps: when are we going to see new planes in the game such as the A350-1000 or 787-10 or the A380 neo? A lot of planes have been launched in the past months but none of them are in the game!',

     [ 'this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It\'s a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that\'s it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame',
       'Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn\'t came in two years it probably isn\'t. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don\'t pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges.',
       'Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.',
       'I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.',
       'Great game, addictive, in a good way. This is one of the few games that is addictive, but does not take up a large amount of your day, unlike some game (Clash Royale), I feel it\'s not Pay to Win. Great job guys, thanks for making an entertaining, relaxing, non time consuming, free to play and win game. Graphics can be bested.',
       'Funny characters, endearing cartoon aesthetic and enjoyable game play, but after a couple hunts forces you to wait over 8 minutes before you can actually play again (in order to entice you to pay to make the wait times go away). What kind of game compels you to QUIT out of BOREDOM after playing it for 5 minutes?' ],

Gameplay is terrible and the story line is basically non existent. On the bright side, you do not have to spend money on this game to level quickly.  I will keep this game until the next update and if the bugs are not fixed I will uninstall.',

I\'ve only been playing this game for 2-3 months and in that period, without any farm castles or attacking other players I made it to castle 26 and still going (Not 100% though)! Play this game. Collecting rss is by far the fastest than any game I\'ve played, collecting troop training buffs is by far the best, I\'ve never seen so many probably $500 or more dollars have been collected in training buffs. This game deserves to be the number one game ever! Keep up the awesome work blood tyrant!',

I had to pay each time i danced wich sucks.  Till that update this game was the best game/app ever. It was so fun and so great that I just wanted to play nonstop.

Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren\'t enough. And one of them didn\'t work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.',
       'I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.',
       'It\'s fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I\'m bored. I love the songs and dance moves it\'s awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it\'s awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don\'t know how to dance then you should download this game it\'s perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.',
       'Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn\'t have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!',
       'I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn\'t make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun.' ],

I DONT WANT MY RANKING TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF LUCK.  +Ima a REAL RISK FAN. I have purchased everymap package available. Its fair priced and affordable.The new maps are too easy in my opinion. MAKE MORE MAPS I\'LL PAY idc jus MAKE them MORE Challenging',
       'This game is great but it could be so much better.   1. The expert AI is too easy to beat. Risk players normally gang up on an opponent, if they are dominating. There should be a legendary option.  2. It would be nice to have a match summary and timeline at the end of a game.    3. There should be an auto-save game feature when playing against the AI, in case the game drops out.  Edit: They seem to have addressed my third point.',
       'This is a very frustrating game. Every single time I play my turn (in a multi-player game that is) I get disconnected! .. and I\'ve to replay it again .. only to get disconnected again! and so on and so on till my time runs out. Sometimes in the middle of all this \'replaying\' I even lose my troops to other players .. VERY FRUSTRATING! And No .. I\'ve both a very good data and wifi connections.',

       'Its just a very slow moving game.  I could only play won game and I had enough. Got bored of it.  They don\'t really teach you how to play either. I know how to play the real version.

       'It\'s just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that\'s a good question.',
       'Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don\'t terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.',
       'Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don\'t ever plan to, but here you also don\'t really need to. I\'ve won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you\'re not forced to watch them. It\'s not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.',
       'Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don\'t even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.',
       'Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn\'t be putting people in the "club" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this "club" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they\'re INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game' ],

     [ 'Best version ever this season!!! Very addictive been playing for the last 3 years or so, great game and soo many great changes!! One thing that I see as a issue is that they make u spend actual money to get your team to the next level. It would be impossible to play in any league and be good if you don\'t put some actual money in the game and upgrade your team to elite.',
       'Amazing! Only minor detail. Has to be easier at least by a little to get more elites. I know during the Superbowl you give out players but then you guys do an update and we have to start over. Was furious at this. It is great though like gameplay and set up. Season mode is really good. Just make odds easier to get ELITES',
       'I love the app and all. But if you put out a special halftime show event for the superbowl make sure that it isn\'t crashing every 5 seconds. I\'m pretty sure you guys make more than enough money for servers that can have a lot of people on it. I\'m just mad because I had 12 seconds left in the event and it kicked me off.',
       'A very awesome game, however, it\'s EA, so the things you need to advance in the game or a promo are out of reach if you don\'t have any money or Madden Cash, which you have to buy WITH REAL MONEY. Gameplay is good, challenges are creative, and the League Survival update is awesome. One complaint I have is the lack of penalties in season mode. It would also be cool to DO A PLAYER CAREER, or DRAFT CHAMPIONS, like in Madden 18 Console. Just wish the game was more for the GRINDERS and not for the RICH.',
       'Great game lots of fun !! I have a suggestion.. we should be allowed to have interleague Player trading. Have options for trade like coins, Madden Cash or trade ( x ) amount of gold players to someone for 1 elite or several lower rating elites for one higher rating elites. Set a timer on the trade, counter trade options & accept, decline or withdraw trade..',
       'This game is great. Really. The only problem that I have with it is that in the new update maybe last year, I lost my 90 some overall team. I had Brady, Gronkowski, Beckham, and a great defense. All of this was gone after that update, when the training came into play. If this was intentional, please notify me, I\'d not, I\'d like my old account back. It was Slyclone89 and it remains so now, under a 65 overall.' ],

If you choose to its not expensive.  $1.00 here and there helps but, not needed. The older game you got more for your buck. Now, they have gotten a little greedy but, still not as bad as some games.',

       'Hard to get stars after about level 11  and no real way to farm them. Replaying levels doesn\'t provide them and tournaments are so lopsided that its not even funny. Log in daily for stars or prepare to drop money.',

     [ 'Very good! The graphics are reminiscent of scribblenauts, which is a great look, controls are simple yet very good. But, I do have two problems: One, the pricing of the sets are too much for what they are. 6.99? More like 4.99. The currency i can understand, maybe bump up the quantity of the 50.00 dollar currency pack, otherwise, the currency pricing is fair. The other one is that there are many framerate bugs! Please attempt to fix them! Besides my problems, the game gets a score, in my book, of a 4.0, great game!',
       'It was a fantastic time eating, addictive, fun game;  The developer became greedy with too many ads.  Also, at the same time, it started using too many resources, frequently pausing for up to two seconds during gameplay, rendering it unplayable.  I really enjoyed this game. Nice, challenging physics and strategy through design and problem solving.',
       'Only reason I\'ve won\'t give 5 stars is that they use to give holidays special mission this year they\'ve skipped it. Seen a few improvements other last year an half but nothing major. But all in all fun game build crafts and hope u make it.',
       'Recent update filled the game with adds. Used to play and only see adds when finishing a mission and selecting the option for extra coins or gems. Now they auto play adds between runs forcing you to have to watch two for the benefit. Good game but they got greedy.',
       'Game used to be good. Started playing again recently and the amount of ads is just abysmal. They also seriously lowered gold rewards for completing levels. The game play is fun, but if I were starting now and didn\'t have decent parts and upgrades from before, I would have dropped it immediately. Shame it ended up like it\'s current state. No longer recommend.',

The main issue I have with the game is not having issues resolved. I\'ve had an issue going on for months (over 6 months) with no resolution. Every time I would submit for help I would get a generic answer. Once I threatened to quit the game for good the answer changed. The problem hasn\'t been resolved but they are "working" on it. If it isn\'t resolved soon my time and money will find a new game!  New update as of 2/15/18. I invest money in this game but I am not able to utilize the upgraded hero\'s...they have disappeared. I complete tasks with no rewards. I submit help tickets that get ignored.

     [ 'Great game for some good old fashion nostalgia. Normally I don\'t keep playing the same game over and over because phone based games usually get boring very quickly. But I\'ve finished all the normal levels and I still find all the changing quests to be a plesent mix of level grinding and competition. Only complaint would be how hard it is to get a +3 or +4 level digimon as well as trying to get anything other then a C chip.',
       'I love this game, I\'ve been on almost everyday. It looks great, there are many Digivolution paths to take, and battling is a ton of fun. My only real complaint is the chat.. my friend and I use a private chat to talk all the time while waiting for stamina to recharge, but it\'s pretty buggy, censoring a lot of really common, non offensive words like anything with an "ho" or "is", and for some reason the word "ready" is censored too.. if this could be fixed, it would be great.',
       'Great works. As a big fan im really looking forward if Bandai can also bring back the classic old school dot digivice game into modern one. Not mmorpg.. But just that classic nostalgic dot nostalgic game. I really like digimon unlimited that a fan made before where we raise one digimon in many ways. Too bad its not bandai work. I definitely play if u make one',
       'The games is really fun and i love how the systems work. There are some issues however, for example WAY WAY WAY too grindy. Thats the biggest because during events you have to commit your life to the game to progress your gamestate. Additionally if you use stones in someone else\'s hosted co-op game they\'re gone despite it not being your fault and with the tiny amount of stones you get after 3 10 captures it adds up. Needs reworks but is good over all.',
       'Most people will say that it is kinda hard to get to mega. And I think they got a point but well in my own oppinion, this game comes with its own strength and weakness. I manage to get my rosemon and wargreymon and now I\'m working on my taomon. My point is. This game is good overall but it can be better if there are feature that we can do to enhance our interaction with other player. A clan or guild or something like that. Keep ap the good work and I\'m looking forward to the next update.',
       'Doing this review after having completed the first area of the normal quests, so I\'m not very long into the game. That said, I\'m ok with what I see. It\'s a very nestolga driven game, relying on it\'s player base being made of kid and adult fans of the show. Good graphics is another plus otherwise this might have only got 3 stars.' ],

All hands to battle station\'s.',

All the time game crashes and stalls, Samsung galaxy S7 was locked several times. Game is developed for crazy profit  and normally you should pay to have fun  otherwise some one will but not you.',
       'The game seems to go through faze\'s some times good some times just ok. If you only speak english it can be very taxing, not to friendly at times. Has a very clicky higher archery . If you fall out with them you can have wasted all the money you put into the game.',

Also, not a deal breaker, could we shut off the verbal commentary during battle and keep the sound effects? That\'d be awesome. Great game all around though.',

       'Very addictive game. Love flying around and shooting planes and bombing boats. There are so many planes to fly! Even if you suck this game is fun lol You would get shot down quick and your team would hate you but it\'s still fun. The controls and graphics make the game play so lifelike.',
       'A few issues... Many of these issues you will ignore to begin with because it IS a fun game.  But.... 1.  Poor network reliability.  Planes jumping around in the game because the game can\'t keep up. 2. No mute in chat.  Filthy mouth weirdos abusing others. 3. Matching of opponents is poor.  For example: jets V piston; tier 8 planes V tier 6.  Fix these issues and I will play again.' ],

Give you enough lives to rate it good then the lives end and you have to watch a min advert or 30 mins for one life Regen. OR PAY. They just want your money at that point. So sad.',

It\'s a nice app but I might uninstall it because I can\'t play it all the time!',

The game was fun to play until that the tasks had been getting ridiculous that even I was playing with the highest speed I still won\'t make it on time or I won\'t even get as many costumers as the tasks said so, and not only that I\'ve been playing extra job levels and guess what? I\'m not gaining any gems',

You can\'t do anything without huge amounts of gems. I bought some and bought one thing and they were basically gone. I had to use 2 powerups to pass the level (and that was only 1 level). What a waste.',

I can\'t level up because there are no portals near me so the open portal recon is just useless. The closest portal is 14kms away. What to do ? I feel to delete the game or go gps spoofing .That\'s the last option left for players like us.',

The enlightened want to use exotic matter(xm) to control humanity. The resistance are trying to protect humanity. Which side will you join? Okay so all that aside, great game, takes forever to level up, but stick with it. Once you level up a bit, this game gets fun. Join your Google plus community and or Facebook page.',

I guess it\'s a blessing in disguise not to waste time on it.',

     [ 'Lost another These constant updates caused me to uninstall this. Fun game - very good game!But if it ain\'t broke don\'t fix it. I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.',
       'It\'s a fun game. If you\'re a COD player you\'ll love it. In general It does good on it\'s own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It\'s good that there\'s a grind to get them but I think it\'s a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.',
       'I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to "rent" which is an option in the game.',
       'Great game play, Great graphic, but after 1 month, I think this is another pay to win game ; the great Gun need to buy,  the Armor need to buy, almost every wining key things need to buy. But some people really like it because they have money to buy all those and "WIN" other pool guy. it is not about skill, it is about money.',
       'Awesome graphics, and for what you get on a phone, it really is an amazing game. The only complaint (if you can even call it that) I have is the controls can be a little tricky as sometimes when you\'re trying to swing left or right you can accidentally change your weapon instead of swing to either side. Aside from that, tremendous gameplay, multiple modes to play, amazing graphics, really just an awesome game. Make sure you have a really good internet connection.',
       'Be prepared the stupidity. 230 armor 120 health isnt enough to protect against the remington. So if u want to survive be prepared to pay more and more always. This game aint fun after a while. More annoying really. Otherwise would recommend it. So look elsewhere if u dont want to pay a hell of a lots of money' ],

     [ 'Best battleship game on Android hands down ! Better than wargaming ship game great controls great graphics !Fun to play good selection of warships and large maps and they keep on doing updates to keep it interesting! And the most important thing is the price of ships are fair keep up the great work . I love the last update with graphics and maps and ships. the only thing the Bismarck is under powered can you make her stronger because she was the pride of Germany and everybody complains she is not a good ship.She is a powerhouse thank you!',
       'Fact need a good connection to keep control of your ships Now, I have plenty of $$$ nothing to spend on it. Waiting to get the last max destroyer ship i can get on the random container spin.  Also noted... I open up the app the next day and the container count down says 2+ hours. It should read 0 zero I would think.',
       'This is a fantastic game one of the best by miles. I am not sure however, that the latest update was such a success. Prior to update the smaller torpedo boats had a good chance now that dynamic has been removed by the dominance of the larger ships firepower and slow reload times on torpedoes.  This means that the strategic component has been somewhat diminished',
       'look since the update the game constantly resarts when trying to enter battle.....  now I just had my tablet lock up for a half hour....  the chat in this game has killed it.... constantly getting the game  restarted..... booting back to desktop. I have been playing for over a year with iowa and new Jersey completely maxed...  its sad to see the quality go down',
       'It\'s a good game. While I don\'t like the sinking animation, this game has the best controls of any game like this but I have a list of ships you should add to the game. HMS Caroline, HMS  Carlisle, HMS Dreadnought, HMS Hood and USS Arizona in order of what I want added first. My only problem is that it lags out to the home screen a lot. Also, make it so that there aren\'t any of the same ships in one match.',
       'Been playing since release but the latest update is a joke. Used to enjoy now since 2018 update game has lost its gloss. After making purchases I am no longer wanting to play ..well done for destroying a great game now it\'s no better than other. Battleship games ..game lags out and now you need to waste gold on repairs while in the game I have 50 mil in cash with nothing to spend it on ..' ],

     [ 'Awesome but... Feature suggestion.. I really enjoy this game. it\'s addicting and fun to play. I never cared about Pokemon other then the original wizards of the coast 150 but this has opened me up to newer generations of Pokemon. But one thing I really would like to suggest.. if you can make changes to the game where as you can invite friends or family or even have friends list to battle friends that are also playing. If you guys could add that feature that would be amazing. Other then that this game rocks! Awesome job team.',
       'Used to love this game, but after the recent update I couldn\'t open the app anymore and when I uninstalled and reinstalled it, all my data was gone. It has so many bugs and glitches, it\'s not even worth playing. Been a pokemon fan for such a long time, but this one has been a major disappointment.',
       'This game is the best way to get my mind thinking with its amazing graphics awesome story and amazing gameplay 5 stars for me!! And combining this with pokemon is just YESHHH!! But there are some downsides considering after getting farther into the game you have to pay and the game is straight up rigged as well.',
       'The game is really fun but its held back quite a lot by how badly unbalanced it has become in recent months and its laggy and unresponsive UI, which seems to get worse as time goes on. This is a real shame because there is a really good game here and I wish they would focus on making it fun instead of making it more of a chore and a headache to play.',
       'I really didn\'t like this one. Its extremely slow and laggy. Buttons take multiple taps to respond. All rewards won in the league take hours to open so whats the point of playing if it takes me 24 hours to claim my prize? The only way to get good pokemon is with money.   Worst game made by pokemon.',
       'One of the worst rng coded games i have ever played and i played Summoners War for 3 years...... You lose just about every spin in battle vs the ai. Roughly about 70 percent in my case. Also I won first turn about 10 percent of the time. It is by far the most rage inducing game I have ever played. Devs, games are supposed to be FUN! If i wanted to be bummed out I would go to work in my free time. Don\'t bother downloading this game. Google Pokeland Legends instead and have a way better pokemon experience.' ],

       'Too many trolls.  There are many nice and helpful people, but there are too many malicious people in the game, which ruins it.   There is an encyclopedia in the game that lets users create a page for items obtained while playing.  Users are very competitive with obtaining these pages.   But the problem with the encyclopedia is it has minimal policing of its encyclopedia.  Any user can go in and change tags to anything they want.  Many-a-time I ran into a situation where an entire color group for hairstyles had been wiped of its tags (ranging upwards to 50 items) with a snide remark aimed at myself.  The users would avoid disclosing their account name by writing messages in the tagging section staying completely annonymous.  Several attempts have been made to devs without a response. I wanted to help the encyclopedia become more organized and user friendly but there are far too many people who aim to disorganized the content.',
       'This game is awful, it didn\'t turn me on at all. The girls are to nice. The game could use a few more kinky anal sex scenes.',
       'Decent game. At its core it\'s a dress up game, really, with the addition of chatting and visiting other users. Currently level 82 and waiting for the fourth girl is tiresome and becoming very boring. There\'s little to do other than press a few buttons, read the same chat messages over and over and save up gatcha tickets to probably get something you\'ve already got. Most recent event was very odd to me (the healing event). Events are impossible to win without paying, obviously, but you don\'t have to pay real money to succeed in the game and get nice clothes. My biggest problem is that male pronouns are forced on the player. You have many, many female players. We all spend ages chatting to unlock scenarios, and when we do, there\'s phrases like \'becoming a real man\', etc. It\'s not that hard to make them neutral.' ],

     [ 'This game is good and the story was interesting. The reason why i give three stars is because the magic challenges sometimes need to consume lots coins or lunes. And everytime there is new event which need to collect bonbon... It is teally hard to collect it and instead we need to buy... i know this game is free for both pay to play and free to play... but all i see is pay to play since the bonbons need to buy and sometimes events that come back by popular demand also consume lots of money.... I actually liked this game but since you made this game really.... i had to give only 3 stars since the game had to use mk ey A LOT....',
       'I loved it , it is so addicting and the characters are gorgeous, but it is way too short. I find myself paying fake money from the game to buy tickets just to know what happens next! You might actually fall in love with the characters! That\'s how amazing it is!',
       'This used to be my favorite Solmare game, but the pop-up ads have ruined it. They can pop open at anytime, playing loud music and ruining the experience. When they pop up, I usually just end up closing the app, no matter what I was in the middle of because they are so annoying. I will probably end up uninstalling this app because of them.  If this was not an issue, it would be a 5 STAR game.',
       'It\'s one of the best \'Shall We Date?\' series. There\'s a lot of stuff that even free players can get and the missions are pretty easy to pass if you take part in lessons regularly. Also Zeus ♥. Super great game!',
       'The stories in this game are well written and well edited. There are no confusing grammatical errors to try to work past to understand the story, which is lovely. The artwork is very pretty as well, even the backgrounds. All the guy characters I have read so far are interesting and different from each other. Most of the stories differ from each other enough to keep a player interested. My only complaint about the stories is that the MC is whiney and childish. Annoyingly so.  One thing: I had to stop playing Blood in Roses because of the massively annoying popup ad where this guy just bashes a pigs brains in with a club. Every. Single. Ad. And now, this game has that same pop up ad. Why? My rating will go down quite a bit more if this continues.  Update: okay, now the popup ads are not the guy braining the pig but they do now have sound AND the game cranks up the volume on my phone to full when the ad pops up so I get a blast of whatever dramatic music is playing in the ad. Thanks to that, instead of relaxing with a story before bed, I now nearly have a heart attack. Why? Why would you do this?',
       'This was my first dating game but now I play lots of them but this one is just fabulous. I m in love with the characters ❤ .. But the only problem is the ticket restoring time, it\'s too long.. I mean 4 hrs just to restore 1 ticket is just too long ..Please can you guys decrease the ticket restoring time ..?' ],

     [ 'The game is ok.. i love the idea.. but in all RPG and similar games you can accuire your items from when you died from your body in that zone.. also its good when you enter the inventory to pause the game.. when entering a zone the game should give some time before reseting the material and monsters if the player re-enters the same zone.. These are the most critical points so far i have encountered.. please take these in consideration.. thank you',
       '16 energy to move to the nearest forest!! Don\'t expect to build your house or collect resources in a day. This game has potential, but the energy spent to move to a forest is just too much that after an hour you would have to spend money to get energy just to collect resources. It\'s a shame that the gameplay is really smooth but the game is focused on making you pay to win/build in the first hour.',
       'This game\'s great, I loved it until I saw the ammount of energy it costs to travel to the nearest forest. Could you try and fix this and anything else that the reviewer asked? The game\'s even better than Last Day on Earth, it\'s like a zombie survival in the middle ages, just make some improvements and this\'ll be the best survival game in Play Store',
       'As others have said it\'s basically LToE...and just as big a cash grab.  I have the same problems with this game as I did with LToE, I\'d rather pay for a game than have the mechanics manipulated to result in a poorly disguised attempt to get me to spend money.  At the end, too much repetitive gameplay, oh look, I\'ve chopped digital trees down for hours of my life.  No thanks.',
       'Game is alright durability seems like it could be adjusted so items last longer more then one outting at least. Where are the keys for dungeons and materials to finish stables? Lag spikes have costed me two full inventories of materials and with no chance of reclaiming body makes the game less fun.',
       'This game is really great, i mean absolutely great... it has alot of potential and its really enjoyable😉😉😉 i haven\'t even bought any purchases in this game but i still didn\'t die so far and i already made a lot of progress... keep up the good work guys, im excited about the future of this game, looking forward to it...' ],

     [ 'I absolutely LOVE this game!! The stories of each character are amazing! I just wish they had more suitors. And I wish they made more games exactly like this but with a completely new story line and characters. Like, I love the voice animations and how long the chapters are and how long the story line of each person is. I also love how your character talks like a modern day girl when she\'s at the sengoku era. You don\'t have to pay to see more about each person either. It\'s amazing. I Love this app. Please make more!!!! ❤️❤️❤️',
       'So, this is my third update. That\'s how much I love this game 😂. Thank you for giving us castle and closet space via game events. Very helpful. I don\'t have anymore lag issues. And I appreciate the diversity in storylines. No route is the same, unlike other Otome games. Also, the relationship development is fantastic - not too slow or fast. The main character actually talks like a real person and less like a "character". Art is beautiful, too. I just feel bad that I can\'t say much about the music or voice acting, as I usually have my phone on vibrate.',
       'Idk what to say, but one thing for sure I really loveee this game!!!! Is so awesome, the chara omg so magnificent. I don\'t mind spending much money on this game hahaha it\'s so freaking beautiful!!! And I really love the MC she\'s so strong and cute, it\'s just like I want to have a route for MC too. But rn I\'m waiting for KENSHIN UESUGI route, I hope it will come out soon. Damn, Cybird always make such a beautiful otome game. Thank you for making this game, it just made my life💗💗💗💗',
       'I couldn\'t resist to do a newer version of the review, so here it is. I\'ve been playing this game for nearly three months now, and that\'s saying something. First of all, the story is really engaging. The characters are really sweet, and I love how we don\'t need to spend money to enjoy it, unlike other otome games. Shout-out to the people who made Ieyasu\'s route a dream come true.',
       'There are only a few routes out currently but they are wonderful all the same. The main character is funny and reacts realistically to situations! Not to mention the voice acting is impeccable like wow I don\'t speak a word of Japanese but everytime Nobunaga speaks I\'m just nodding along. Also this game has an adorable animated series and it is the best',
       'The most romantic and sweetest experience of falling in love game..  I feel like I\'m truly falling in love with Masamune date.. Love his playful side, his sweetness,  fierce yet gentle  sometimes.. The only reason I CANNOT RATE 5 STAR is I cant read back the route chosen even though I have spent actual money..  Its like I\'m purchasing the story,  but the fact is,  I\'m not.. This is frustrating..  Atleast after having spending so much money,  we can keep the story to be read again afterwards..  Please reconsider this..  Thank you' ],

     [ 'A very fun and addictive game. I make bows all day, but it\'s nice to be able to shoot from my couch at night.  The influence of wind on the arrow is accurate when it comes to drift. A little costly on the upgrades for those that don\'t buy their way to the top, but all games are that way.',
       'Love the game, BUT there\'s a glitch in chest bow where it locks up for 1 shot, multiple times a day. After you shoot without being able to aim, the bow works normal until the next jam. Looked for a place to submit info for possible fix, BUT game doesn\'t provide a place for feedback. This is only place to air complaints :(',
       'Ok game, but bingo mode is a huge pain.  My shots filled out the opponent\'s card better than mine.  Stupid way to lose a lot of progress/coins.',
       'I really like this game but it is quite frustrating that I played many times to get a new gear and spent 200 000 on one which has a red cross in it and makes it nearly impossible to shoot promptly. What a stupid idea to have a cross with the same colour as the board itself. They shouldn\'t be red, blue or yellow.',
       'Game was fine. Lately, keeps freezing and somehow opponents are getting 10\'s when I CLEARLY see them hitting nowhere near the middle. Matches are freezing while i\'m ahead, then match ends and says I lost. Somehow i\'ve lost 20 million coins, and not from legit losing either. I also just played a match for 1 million coins, i had over 1 million in the bank. I know sonehow have 0 after I clearly won the match but it said I lost. Either people are using cheats or the game is not functioning properly',

       'Want to love this game, but it just constantly cheats!! It would be more enjoyable if you could have so many free plays per log in to just enjoy some play, like other games do. Instead you run out of gems right away after being cheated out of one or two games, which really stinks!!  I\'m not paying through the nose just to enjoy playing a game. You are too greedy and a big fat CHEAT King and it has really disappointed me, because the game would be great fun if I could actually play it!!!',
       'Uninstalling...too many hiccups! Costs too much too play a simple game of cards. This game is all about making a lot of money for \'King\' corporation. Can\'t really say anything nice about this game. Pretty much agree with the reviews. (didn\'t even have installed for 24 hrs.)',
       'So... if this isn\'t a scam... how can I quit a game before it\'s over and immediately be paired with the same opponent. Every time I\'ve had an opponent drop out, it takes a few seconds to notify me they left the game. Every day a new reason to NOT pay a cent for this fraud. I play out of sheer boredom.',
       'Was loving it until I noticed the cheating. Funny how I would play around 6 games and only win 1. And when I had the right cards, my opponent would create a four card meld which made me loose. If that isn\'t cheating then I don\'t know what it is cause it\'s annoying how many games I play and loose because I never get the cards I need. Not to mention when I give up a card and then receive a sequence based on that card. Seriously? And how about a way to get free golden bars? No? Okay... then it\'s a no for me from now on.',
       'What is going on with this game? First the bonus gems for playing so many games is gone. Now the weekly bonus is gone. Turning another game into a money grab. Too bad. I really enjoyed this game. I will have to think seriously about uninstalling. Shame on the developer.' ],

Gonna put a hindrance on the event that\'s over on Friday. Do hope it\'s resolved soon. Still like the game tho, but would like it better if I can play.',
       'Well guess they deleted my last post cause I complained that the game took up 1.8 gig till I uninstalled it and reinstalled it then lost my saves because of bad programming.   Don\'t waste your time or money on this company.',
       'Right.  First off, If you are not a fan of Idle games, then don\'t play. This is the epitome of an Idle game.   The Early game is pretty simple. Click, Collect, Make your way to Level 80. You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn\'t bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn\'t been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event\'s are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events\'  All in, pretty good.',
       'One of the best "tap" games. Love the satirical theme. Who would have thought that politics and money were SO interconnected😁. Just to be clear to some, I AM being sarcastic!!!! Great time waster. And that\'s NOT fake news.',
       'They put so many buttons to purchase things ion the main screen. When tapping as is the nature of the game, it brings up confirmation for your purchases. If you\'re trying to play fast, you could easily spend $20 in mere seconds without noticing. Put all the purchases in one place instead of cheating players.',
       'Good game but you need to fix your ads, half the time they either crash the game or they won\'t load and freeze the game so you have to restart. Also the game will randomly just close sometimes for no reason. Enjoy the game but there are definitely some bugs that need to be worked out.' ],

     [ 'I\'m really enjoying this game - it\'s surprisingly advanced for an app. Plays very smoothly and looks pretty. One annoying thing is I get network connection bugs from time to time flashing up. They don\'t stop me from playing tho, so meh. Also, the way they match players together is sometimes pretty suss, ships that wipe you out in two seconds flat...or less... just shouldn\'t be matched with you. But, overall pretty great.',
       'It\'s a good game.  Three things I may add.  Every so often when you improve a ship , the app goes "improvement failed" yet but takes your coins. Bit frustrating. Secondly, the matchmaking can be at times frustrating too, you\'re getting wrecked in seconds by other very powerful ones.. And last thing , hey , the music of the game becomes straight boring and dull after a while. Add something , anything , Frank Sinatra  ffs , you got about 15 seconds of soundtrack in all this game..',
       'I really love this game, i made a donation to help the devs... i was expecting no more ads (unless i chose to watch videos for double rewards) I STLL GET ADS. i will leave rating at 2 stars until this stupid issue is fixed. Why force a paying member to watch ads. STUPID DO NOT SPEND MONEY',
       'Plays great, but I can\'t put my super heavy weapons in the super heavy slot. And all the players who two days ago were fighting two tier under me have ships now a tier above. I don\'t think this is real live gameplay.',
       'After a while playing I feel a new ship is needed. A ship that is used to support and repair team. I also think an actual alliance base would be nice to use. Assault another\'s base to gain upgrades for alliance base could be rewards. I just feel there needs to be something else to do besides a match vs other\'s. Maybe even have tactical station\'s where player\'s occupy turrets so dual pilots can occupy a ship, each with roles to fulfill.',
       'I love this game, i have been looking for a capital ship vs capital ship game for a while and this is s a great game. Its diffiuclt to level up but it is always fun. Although i am experiencing a glitch where my super heavy cruise cannon has been placed in one of my gun slots, and i cant place it back in my super heavy slot. Otherwise great game' ],

     [ 'Whenever I try to open the app the screen starts flashing black and it\'ll stay like that or keeping turning back to the screen I was on and off, which ends up somewhat strobe-like. The actual game itself is amazing despite having a hard time trying to beat the bacteria level but, what\'s the point of a good game concept, if the game won\'t work properly',
       'I thought the new scenario was a free-trial only like the simian flu. (At least you can unlock it after being a brutal pro at the game) I\'m gonna enjoy playing this a good few times and unlock even MORE scenarios. Keep up the good work! I wanted to make a suggestion, but I just can\'t remember now. Oh well...',
       'Fun game. I wish the rate of death was more consistent. 37,000,000 a day at one point, but waiting 6 months for 100,000 to die towards the end. The disease didn\'t change, the rate of death shouldn\'t decrease just because there are fewer people. Good game otherwise',
       'The game is addictive but when you get to a certain point the cure kicks in and it stops giving away DNA points and it makes it hard to advance in the game. I have read the hints in the news it gives, but I still can\'t manage to beat the game. I want to delete the game. Butim going to continue to try. I just wanted to mention it idk if its the game or just me. I won\'t tell others about the game only because its frustrating to play. These games are not good for people to play that has any type of mental issue unless they want to buy a new phone.',
       'I didn\'t buy the new plague, i might need to. The first 2 difficulty settings are easy, the 3rd not so much. Good game to me! Just have to read what it is that you spend your DNA points on and you should do just fine',
       'Really annoying ads keep repeating and covering controls.  So annoying. Pity as game is unplayable like this. It never used to happen before. Why can\'t developer just charge for extra content rather than make game unplayable. Will have to remove.' ],

It was in FS 16 but missing in this one. Please also add Case IH magnum CVX and quadratrac & Challenger MT900 & Big Bud 747 & 450 and MF 4790. I desperately want big bud tractors and quadratrac. I would love big bud equipment in the game.',
       'Great game. I\'d like to be able to put attachments on the front on my tractors. It would also be great to be able to make my fields bigger. There is a lot of wasted ground in the game. Over all love this app. Or if there is a way to expand my fields please someone let me know. Thanks',
       'I think that u should be able to sell the bales that u collect. Their is a lot of bales that are just being erased from the game because their is no limit to stop and no where to put them when the animals are full other then that the game is fun and time consuming. Plus it is a easy to kill some time',
       'Great game but I have a couple issues. 1:sower and fertilizer are to wide for the small plots, #2 Need bigger plots, #3 I am getting commercials that pop up and close themselves like there is a glitch, it keeps asking me to download a 3rd party program, to block the commercials that the phone won\'t allow. all this is directly through the game. Then the program closes or freezes. Please provide fix and I will adjust stars.   Update: I purchased this game directly through Google Play, the update or re load resolved my problems and the advice on cloud storage was a bonus, thank you. I have change the rating to reflect improvements thus far.',
       'I have purchased all the fields. And have reached a limit to purchase more vehicles. I have more than 20 lac in my accout. What do I do now? Please add some more challenges. This game has become boring for me.',
       'Great game, more realistic tractors, harvesters and equipment than on other farming simulators. The only nuisence I find is that the ground glitches a small amount in the distance. Its easy to get used to though.' ],

     [ 'Used to be one of the best time management games available but they no longer fix the glitches.  There hasn\'t been any updates or new venues for a long time so think the game is being phased out. The game is free but you do need to buy gold with hard cash to progress. No longer worth downloading, my advice is to find something else to play.',
       'It is an awesome game. It is very addictive and I feel very invested in it. If you don\'t want to spend any of your real money to buy gold, you sure don\'t need to. It takes a hell lot more to get everything you want but it\'s still playable. It has some bugs, sure, specially regarding your wireless connecting but it\'s nothing major. The levels are really hard sometimes but makes up for the good challenge. Thanks, devs, for the awesome game',
       'Re-installed the game because I can\'t create a group goal nor join any. Then Back up on facebook didn\'t work.  I lost all progress except my duel scores. Everything just went down the drain. The game worked perfectly fine for me before all these happened.',
       'I love the game. But there\'s some bug issues like   1) login to claim 10golds - didn\'t happen. Where\'d the gold? 2) now I can\'t even login to social. It keep loading, then kinda leave it at that.   I would rate it 5 stars once this is resolved. It\'s really getting on my nerves.',
       'Game could be cool but has way too much stuff crammed into the tiny screen of most phones. Graphics need to be simplified so that you can see things easier. Overall, the game freezes and crashes every time I try to play. Spend more time making this game stable and easy to see and it might be more fun.',
       'Up until five days ago I wasn\'t having any problems with this game and I played it nearly everyday. Now I can open the app but nothing happens when I click on any part of the game. This has kept me from being able to do anything with the game for nearly a week. I\'ve missed out on events and opportunities to move up on leaderboards. Please fix the app. I enjoy the game and I don\'t want to lose progress because of a technical error.' ],

     [ 'The new interface is very confusing.  There are a lot of pay walls in this game, but the added feature of videos for currency made it much better.   However, they modified the result of the videos to randomly give other rewards which have little value. I will consider giving stars back if they change this functionality back or make the game less expensive.',
       'They\'ve taken what was a good game and ruined it, in a cash grab which is as unfair as it is blatant. Hugely diminished progression through tedious, grinding battles. Event battles which are so heavily stacked against the player  that even if you win, you\'re not guaranteed the resources to obtain new characters. An ever changing rnd system which is designed to frustrate you into spending cash. The ultimate kicker being, even when you spend the cash, you\'re still not guaranteed a win. All in all, a greedy, self-serving exploitation of the Marvel brand and an unplayable game.',
       'Can\'t play it anymore. Game will stay on main loading screen and just load or it will load the game then just quit to my phone home screen after a few seconds on being on the game. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but that didn\'t work at all. Loved being able to play before when there wasn\'t an issue with it.',
       'I don\'t like the new update. For the characters to appear as their upgraded selves, you have to change them every time you load the game. Also it is very laggy, although I\'m not sure if that\'s just my internet. Either way, it\'s very annoying. Also the game is super laggy.',
       'I upgraded my rating to a two star, because it will finally load.  It is still slow and lagging.  Wish you guys would have left it alone.  You took a nice relaxing game and made it confusing and difficult.  There wasn\'t anything wrong with it they way you had it.',

     [ 'Don\'t let the haters win! This a great game with solid fun graphics. There\'s so much to do that you could play just this one game. There\'s new quest every hour. There\'s guilds (clans). There\'s personal development. There\'s city building. There\'s troop management. There\'s Titans to slay. Loads of fun activities and things to keep your fingers moving and your brain tapping. I play this on a Note 5. The load times need improvement (noticeble delays), but the game play, fun dialog and entertaining graphics make up for it. If you\'re P2W you\'ll enjoy the pricing structure for Gems. If you\'re F2P then you\'ll enjoy the Gem gathering rate. Overall, this it a great game, which if you like the genre you\'ll want to play.',

     [ 'Infinite flight is one of the best aircraft simluation games out there on the market. Although, it costs around $5 USD it provides free aircrafts and, maps with the game. What im slightly disappointed in is, the amount of in-app purchases needed to aquire the various maps and aircrafts. There just a inconsistents over free aircrafts and maps, and the in-app purchased items. If you developers could add more free aircrafts and, maps it could add more value to the consumer buying this game, and thus getting more than they expected. Despite from my concern this is a great simulation game and, please continue on with your work.',
       'Awesome game. Especially now, that they have added global. I can finally travel the world on my phone with stunning realistic graphics. Although it doesn\'t have complete terminals and the complete airports you can still communicate with ATC and other aircraft around. Love the controls and also the autopilot. I hope they keep adding more upgrades like terminals or gates and at least have background noises to hear the passengers boarding. Finally I would like, for whenever I switch to wing view to not be loud.',
       'Hello, I\'m really impressed of this app. Flying the world is amazing from a country to another. My personal favourite is the London to Hong Kong route. One thing to mention about aircrafts. The A380 needs a full rework on its Cockpit, external cameras on everything and wing flex and actions. It also needs the liveries that the a380 currently dosen\'t have in the fleet. It would be great if you guys are working on this programme. Secondly, I hope that Infinite flight will release the A350. Its one of my favourite aircraft.',
       'This flight simulator is so amazing you can be airtraffic controller or pilot there\'s multiplayer too. In the new update the online is really expensive now... i loved the older version becouse it was way cheaper like around 3.84 pounds now its around 10pounds a month? Also you have to membership to fly outside of region in single player i already payed for other regions... if you expect us to pay around 9 or 10 pounds make servers better',
       'Deffinately the best flight simulator....this game surely lives up to its name. Really hope i see this game coming to windows and mac. Theres only one issue. I use the samsung galaxy j5 prime and when i play the sensitivity is very fast to look around. I dont why this happens and i even redownloaded the app.a few times, can u all please at infinite flight help me??',

     [ 'Invite Code: zYATah  This is the very first Otome Game (w/ VA\'s) that I have in Android (Amnesia: Memories requires payment so yeah) The graphics was quite nah for me maybe because it didn\'t fill the screen of my phone. Maybe because my device is a huge one so that\'s why. The story is quite interesting. The characters have each and different unique personalities that I loved. I hope many Otome lovers will get to see this game. A very rare catch in deed!!',
       'I absolutely loved this game. I put in a good month of work on it. I needed to purchase platinum to move on in the story, but I chose to do the free offers. After signing for one of them, and putting money into it, I never received my Platinum. I sent an e-mail to customer support asking about it, they asked for proof and I sent them a screenshot of the proof and they never replied. After 4 days still nothing. I cannot move forward or do anything, and it\'s bull. As much as I loved the game I just uninstalled.',
       'The story for each character is amazing, but the amount if money you put into this game is just ridiculous. Just to complete one story you spend about $100. Full video games or even novels don\'t cost that much. And seeing as there are multiple character storylines you cam put well over  $500 just into this game. And it\'s REQUIRED. There are certain items that are needed just to progress in the story. I really wish you could just buy a full storyline and let it be it. Rather then spending $50 then, $30 more, then another $30- $50...jusy for one storyline.',
       'I LOVE THE GAME! Though I just started the game....I was speechless! The graphics are just amazing. Not to mention the VA as well! ^-^ I cant wait till the other 3 guys to come out. Amazing game. This is newly released, is it not? For the people who are reading the reviews, try it!  P - Please try it! L - Lovely game! X - Xtra hotness added! K - Kiss your famgirl side ^-^ 4 - 4 the new guys! B - Be the absolute best!',
       'It\'s pretty awesome and amazing for a cute story about these cute guys, I like it so much that it\'s a shame that the costs of reward points is 300 and the gold 3000. It\'d be better if at least it could also give more presents during the day. But I have to wait to 4:00 am to get the tickets and presents. Whenever it\'s possible to update it I think at least the hours of getting the tickets back should be changed and DIFFERENT presents everyday at least. But the rest is awesome, and I\'d be spending all day playing with this app, please upgrade it somehow ;-;❤❤',
       'I love it!!! So amazing. I\'m addicted. Their voices are so hot, and they\'re so pretty. Also I love the storyline. I can\'t wait for other characters to come. My fav char is Toma. Right now I\'m on Chiaki he so amazing! Also if anyone wants to recieve variety of gifts input my code: jFrXHS.  P.S to input the code go to my page and scroll all the way down and you\'ll find it.' ],

     [ 'So far so good. I\'m about halfway through, and it\'s an enjoyable ride.Yes, feels inspired by The Room series, but that\'s not a bad thing. Great to play so far. However, the controls can be fiddly, where sometimes the attempt to make a found piece or tool work doesn\'t take or a tapped on clue won\'t function at certain angles. But I chalk this up to teething pains and I\'m sure the next Blue Brain game will be even more beautifully made and imaginative.',
       'Wow! At first I thought this was just a knockoff of The Room trilogy, and while it was clearly inspired by those games, it is every bit their equal. (Do I blaspheme?) Which is quite honestly a shocking achievement. Those games are classics, but this game belongs right there with them. The puzzles are challenging but logical enough that you can work through them. The graphics are top notch. Every detail has been meticulously thought out. Is it the most original concept? No. But who cares! If you love The Room, you\'ll love this too. If you don\'t love The Room, well clearly you\'ve never played it. Either way, you\'ll love this game.',
       'I finally finished the game.  Loved it.  Its the best game, best graphics, best everything I\'ve played yet. And so worth the $5. I could not put it down often.  Only a couple of small hints for the sequel...nothing big... The game is a bit dark...at times I could not see objects or places to put objects.  And when I try to roll or turn or pull a lever, or ball, whatever, the entire screen moves.  The boiler on both sides was a good example of that...try to flip those levers to fire the boiler and the whole room flips up.   But even with those issues I couldn\'t give it any less than a five.  Surely we don\'t have to wait A YEAR for the sequel!  What WILL I do in the meantime??',
       'I had this game in my wish list for the longest time because I don\'t normally buy games for my phone. But I finally bought it because it look so interesting, and I love puzzle escape games.  I loved it!! The way the controls and the feel of the game were done well and immersive. The puzzles were challenging, with out feeling like one would never get them solved.  I was so impressed with all the secret compartments and the complexity of finding the hidden objects. But the story behind it all helped drive the game along, I didn\'t get bored with it like I normally do with those kind of games.   Wish it was longer, I couldn\'t stop playing and blasted right through it!',
       'This is an excellent game after the Room sequels. I love it and find it a perfect mixture of renaissance instruments and Leonardo da Vinci\'s genious with a very delicate attention to details, aesthetism, and a feeling of bygone days. It is just like a story told by Umberto Eco and I thank the creators. I cant wait to buy anothger game offered by these genious and creative persons. Thank you very much. And the graphics are superb. However, the conquering part is a very difficult section. Wish you had made it easier. Especially for women, who are not prone to thinking about conquests + Mathematics... Thank you all in all.',
       'Insane! If you liked the room you are going to love this one! Excellent mechanics, stunning graphics,  the puzzles are not so straight forward as in the room and require imagination.  Gameplay is also much longer. Music, atmosphere, scenario, an immersive experience best played on tablet. A few glitches on the controls here and there, some puzzles not making much sense, some p.o.i. hidden in the shadows and a sudden non climaxing end is all the criticism  have to offer. True masterpiece. Well done Blue Brains. You guys lead! Hope you get enough funds to develop an even better sequel.' ],
