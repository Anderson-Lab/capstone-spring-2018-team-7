        "Wow! Great job on this mobile port. In addition it's also free. Download it! This might be the best mobile game I have ever played, with the best looking graphics. It's absolutely insane that this will run on my phone, but I'm not sure if I can run it on my computer. This is impressive and super fun. The controls are fine, but take some getting used to. If you added Bluetooth controller support, I would buy a controller just to play this. Good job guys  :)",
        "The gameplay is so great so far! There are stil a lot of bugs though, like mic doesn't work sometimes, aim and reloaded ui is gone, and I don't know if it's my phone but when I use 8x scope, the frame rate drops; like a lot. Hopefully the game will get fixed, and get optimized for low spec phones on a further update, oh and also a suggestion make the hud mini map a little bit big and also make the map itself hd. Anyway you guys still did a great job and thank you for this! :)",
        "I think this game is really good compared to the Xbox and PC versions of the game. It also adds a few other options for the game that aren't on the PC/Xbox version such as distance from your marker, dotted line to your marker, and it tells you how many poeple are in the plane. The aim assist really helps balance out the phone controls to keep gun fights running smooth and everything works really well. There is the occasional lag spike and stuff but the game works really well for my 2 year old Samsung  tablet.  10 out of 10 would recommend.",
        "Umm i loved this game on my pc but on mobile I belive there are some serious optimisation needed I am using a Samsung j7 prime and it can't run this game on low too. Means are you guys serious? You wrote that it works on Redmi 4a having a much less specs as compered to j7 I know its a samsung phone but we can expect a smooth experience at low setting I will change my rating once I get a smooth experience. Hope you fix it soon",
        "Nvrmind I'm starting to understand this game. It's not bad but could be a lot better. Still say u should get to keep wat u find. Unlocking is kool but should be only for better than basic gear. Just my opinion. Guns and melee weapons it's understandable to have to find them over again each game but the clothing I just don't understand y I gotta be naked unless I unlock crates to get clothes. Weird really.",
        "It is a super good game. Probably the best from all other battleground games, even fortnite. You guys should put a game mode where teams of 4 can conqure land on the map. And once a person dies they cant respond. Put checkpoints all across the map to be able to claim a section of the map. The only way to win is by eliminating every enemy or taking all the land. This mode will change the game play of pubg and will be another unique thing compared to fortnite. It is also something new and very interesting. Please take this into consideration."

        "Could be better. I dont like the fact that anyone can just waltz up to you and come in your house. There should be a setting that allows you to keep your house and sims private from other people. Also its a bit weird that if you tap on any sim without talking to them, they come into your house and do whatever they like without permission, even if you have a bad relationship with them. And it would also be nice if doors could be locked.",
        "It's fun so far! Can't wait to play more and see what else is in store! P.S. the sims, I wish they would not go off on their own and make doubles. Like if you want to make it a real life interaction type style, you should probably fix it to where the actions are more real and not computerized. I would like the option to do more with my kid sims, like more clothes options.  I also dont like the fact that when your sim retires, yoy no longer have control over them. Yhat jind of sucks. Alot...but Keep up the good work. Thanks!",
        "After playing for three days, this doesn't feel like a Sims game, some actions and interactions with objects are meanless, why do I need to use the toilet? One of the key factors of the Sims is to fill their needs, what are the needs of these Sims? It doesn't care at all if I decide to not pursuing one of the stories with friends, hobbies or career. And where are their feelings? Their aspirations? If I follow two romantic stories,  those Sims don't seem to be jealous even if I'm dating them in the same room! This is a game for the money,  not to play a simulation.",
        "PLEASE  HELP!!!!! So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning. And didn't really recovered my previous game. Love everything except for this.  P.S. i did the troubleshooting in the forum but nothing really helps.",
        "Edit: I just had my latest infant boy \"evolve\". My question is, why did you all give me a caucasian kid when my family is black? My other 2 kids are black too! I don't mind (since he's here lol) but this is odd.     I love this game! Already have 2 kiddos and a big house!",
        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much"

        "I think that this game is amazing and soo fun and adicting but the only problem that I would have rated it 4 stars is that this game only works with internet connection which saddens me because this game is my absolute fav. game I have played and I always want to play it. Keep up the amazing(A+) effort!",
        "The game is really addictive and fun. One of the best idles i've played. Good graphics and simple to play. The only problem is the poor performance. I don't know if the problem is my cellphone, but i think the game could use a little bit of an optimization.",
        "Sent email to devs over a week ago asking a question. No reply. Disappointing. Also the fact that there are no videos so unable to use the spinning wheel. Otherwise a mostly good game.",
        "Google keeps crashing. Even if you press stop it still pops ups every 10 seconds and the game takes ages to load and prestidge using an S7. Will increase stars if fixed as a good game otherwise.",
        "Lo      What the hell are you doing today and then I have to play a lot to do with the son I will call u in the garage for parkour now I'm a little Italy for you and I will call u after shcool you have a good night sleep oh I thought it would be fun with the kids and I will end you will be able to get a email from the other day but I didn't know if it would help me to get",
        "Fun game can you make things less expencive though i know it is ment to cost allot but it takes a while to get money i love the graphics and the controles my rating is a big fat five well done and keep updating us on new things!#LOVEGAME"

Not sure why that happen. Also don't like how you have a truck and the grass and or sand will slow you down. Also wish there were more color options for your vehicles. Other than that its a fun and addicting game.",

Not cool at all. Once or twice is whatever, but its happened at least a dozen times. Please fix this!!  Just dropped my rating again because its getting worse! Idk if its people cheating or what but this is ruining the game! The race rankings are a complete lottery, doesn't matter what place you come in because its gonna change... For the worse. Had it with this.",
        "Well it's ok but you are always underpowered I literally but the next 2!! Cars and I couldn't even get in 2nd place it's ridiculous I mean come on and I wasn't even up against real people it was bots. And the ramps using nitro on them is a deathtrap and the driving is Soo weird.",

Overall, good job.(Edit**) Great job on the addition of new content with the last update, however with this latest update the game will glitch. The glitch makes the ball not land and resets the game to the pitching of the ball.",
        "I liked the game before. I did pay to remove ads. The game was simple and fun. However the current update has the game broken. The ability to get new characters is a nice addition but the game at higher levels is unplayable. The game keeps resetting because the ball is hit so hard and high it goes out of the playable area even if you hit it \"perfect\" once this issue is fixed I will adjust my review",
        "Fun off the bat... But then it slows down to a brutal snails pace. It's a great concept, it just needs a lot more updates!  *Slow claps* great work on the \"updates\". I shouldn't have updates in parenthesis.. The characters are cool, leveling is also a cool touch, and a whopping 7 new bats? Killing it!..? But come on, way to go extreme overboard on the speed! All the other bad reviews cover it better. I just wanted to also sarcastically congratulate your update.",
        "pretty good game, glad they're updating it and adding in more bats. I play it when I'm waiting at the airport. the new update sped things up, made it really buggy. resets your hits at 44000 M and isn't really playable at this point, hopefully it's fixed soon",
        "Latest update totally destroyed the game. Even using the basic bat hitting it perfectly straight it takes the ball 2 seconds to fly 100,000 meters and then the game resets back to swing again. Without even getting to actually make any currency for upgrades",
        "UPDATE: Every time I hit, the game resets it's self. I hit the ball the meters get up above 80k and then the screen goes black and then I'm back at the plate.   Any upgrades coming soon? I have all the bats and am over 30,000 meters. Need some more upgrades."

        "I love the game and then when i saw that there was 3D projects i was so excited but they did not meet my expectations the controls were a little hard and the graphics were a little shady. Also there is a lot of adds i don't mind some adds but there's just so much so it would be nice if you cut down on the adds. Over all i really like the game i love that i don't need Wi-Fi to play this.",

        "Simply love it, if i may make a suggestion... how about providing an option to hide the finished works from the first tab? That way one would not have a lot of scrolling to do find a new piece to start. :) keep up the good work! 👍",
        "This game is AWESOME!!! and Everytime the game updates their app it adds more exciting options to playing the game such as creating your own pictures from your picture gallery folders or other of your downloaded photos from your picture galleries or saved photos. It's so much fun. I also find it to be a Great stress reliever for me. ThaNkS, pixel art app. I love this game, I find time each day to play... Very Relaxing 🤗🤗😀😀😉😉.",
        "Absolutely love this. The only issue I have is when I am working on a puzzle on my galaxy tab A 10.1 it blinks off if it's tilted a little the wrong way. It especially doesn't like it when it's laid down on a flat surface. I love that it's mostly free for Android users and the 3D puzzles are fun too.",
        "Great way to relax or calm down. Lots of choices without having to earn game coin to buy more that only disappoint. Mix of both easy and challenging. One thing would improve over all play and that would be an easy way to locate any missed cells at the end of a puzzle. Having to scroll through some of those detailed ones to find one or two blanks can be a real headache! Other than than i think this is the best color game I have tried! Keep up the great work!!"

        "I absolutely love this game. I make it a point to not spend money on mobile games cus they typically turn out to be a cash trap, but this was just like buying a regular video game. No adds, and even before buying the full game it doesn't shove \"buy our product\" notifications down your throat. Nintendo has always had good games and I have no doubts that I will keep playing this every day.",
        "Awesome update! Make the game worth again, when it seems Nintendo had abandoned Super Mario Run, they back and release more content for the half of the price. This is the kind of update I was waiting for, once I didn't paid the game yet, I think this could be a great time to purchase. Probably in the future they will release more content, but the price will back to 9.99, so the best time to purchase is now! Great job Nintendo, I love your games since my childhood.",
        "Was pretty short to begin with but Nintendo has supported this game well, adding additional content, even a new mode. The simplified game mechanics to fit Mario gaming on a phone work great and feel natural. The story with it's additional challenges to open new courses are fun, toad run is addictive, the remix 10 is somewhat redundant content wise but also good. I'd rather pay $10 up front than have in-game purchases, the reception to this game indicates that I'm very much in the minority on that. Great game, very fun for a quick session of Mario.",
        "Awesome and all, but you only get 4 levels for free. To go to world 2, WHY IN THE UNIVERSAL WORLD RIGHT HERE IN A CITY (lol😀) DO YOU HAVE TO BUY WORLD 2, 3, 4, 5, AND 6? TALK ABOUT A RIPOFF! 😞 (Warning to Nintendo: If you dont fix this soon, I'm deleting. Sorry!)",
        "Favorite game. It has a one time cost for full version and not a monthly fee or several different things you have to buy to enjoy it. I like the updates with the remix, and the star courses. I didnt like that there was so little to do before I bought it. I got bored quick. But was surprised by the cost, and love it after buying it. I do wish we could see our friends land and share things we don't need and give rally tickets to others.",
        "This is just proof Nintendo can make amazing games no matter the platform. All the bad reviews are people's mad you gotta pay for the game. Lol wut? It's a great time killer made  by the best gaming company in the world and you're mad it's not free? Funny. There's no IAP.  It's not pay to win. But it is the most fun 5$ will ever buy you."

Game play is fun, there aren't ads every 30 seconds, the app runs smooth, and the artistry that went into designing this game and the characters in it is absolutely flawless. Can't complain at all. Great game, I do recommend to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games.  10/10!",
        "Awesome game. Sadly motivated by profit grabbing providers. The cost to buy extra lives is astronomical. The only way to buy on a more viable basis was via the piggybank and guess what. They removed it. When I questioned this I got standard fob off bull. I questioned that and guess what no reply. A shame, it is a great addictive game. Just don't get tempted to get you wallet out..........",
        "Zainy!  I can understand the addictivity of it, however, just as I was getting into each level, surprise!, is was completed! This spoilt a bit of the fun for me.  The catchy music, oddly I never got tired of hearing... Great game!!!  This review is after my first experience of the game which I played upto level 20 before stopping.",
        "Sounds boring but I'm loving it! Sucks you right in. Starting to get a little complex (actually using some real brain power) but still very much doable and no charges as of yet and I'm up to level 10 atm. I am no gamer by any means but I'm really enjoying this.",
        "After my anti-matter laboratory had a slight malfunction and destroyed half the houses in my town I discovered that I had a lot of time on my hands. So I discovered Toon Blast. Been busy ever since! Thanks guys",
        "Awesome game! Thanks to the developers for not only making this fun, but doing it in a dignified way (i.e., no annoying ads). I love this game! It's fun, addictive, and challenging enough that it's still entertaining 500 levels in! Love it, can't say enough good things about it."

I therefore uninstall, only to find myself in no time at all missing the game...the challenge & reinstalling the app.  👍👍👍  Good job to the developers.",

Sudden barrage of loud commercials has ruined the experience. It has actually resulted in me playing less and therefore has had me watch less commercials. Go figure.",

I hope you make the main menu button apear immediately or allow you to click your back button to go to the menu of the game but other than that AMAZING game!",

Also, the speed of the ball is ridiculously inconsistent.  Sometimes you get games that are at a reasonable speed and other times it seems like the ball speed has increased an unreasonable amount to play.  Why even bother trying to load the game each time anymore?",

        "Poor quality game that wasn't tested before release! After your first death you can't land on the platform upon restarting and immediately die, the only way to have another go is to completely close the app first."

GET OUT NOW!",

And on all your other Playgendary games you release on android...  Many thx.. Me 😀😀😁😀😀😀",

It's a game...it's supposed to be fun not rocket science!! It should relax you but when you're played a level 6 or 7 times and you get down to needing1move to win... yet again... you get stressed!! And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun! I like a challenge but this is ridiculous!!!",

        "Getting green pieces gets extremely redundant. After 30 levels it's still the goal. Levels are near impossible unless you get lucky and things line up perfectly.",
        "Its a mind blowing game i cant help but to play this game my day seems not complete if i cant play the game specially when i cant pass the next level and the hardest part is the hard level the time are very fast when i am playing.i really love it and the freebies i can get everyday to boost my game.thank you creators and the makers the graphics and the animation is very realistic.",

When you win you get anywhere from 50 to 100 play money.  So you have to spend your real money to get your play money.  If you have money to spend then enjoy the game."

        "Just downloaded this app.  So far a very well executed app with excellent layout and controls/easy and fluid to use.  Much better than other Sodoku b/c no ads during actual game play!  The only \"con\" is that I cant put graphics behind gameboard. Only suggestion: Would like to see options for backgrounds like in Solitaire. This would truely make it a 5 star game!   Ps. I was not paid/reimbursed or otherwise incentivised for this review in any way.",
        "I'm addicted to this game especially the daily challenge boards. Pros: pencil feature, all instances of the number Are highlighted when you fill in a cell. Con: the timer starts when board opens, would like it to start after filling in 1st cell. As others have said the ads are right below the numbers, too easy to tap when your on a roll.",
        "I like this app, but it feels like it could be more educational. I get stuck on the expert puzzles and often have to use the hints, the way the hints just tell you the number in a selected square doesn't help me work out what I'm missing. If the hint could show me how I could reveal another number would be more helpful to me. Otherwise top notch app",
        "It's a pretty decent sudoku implementation, far better than a lot of the other ones out there I should say. The only issues I have are firstly I do find the \"penciled\" numbers to be a little on the small side (on a 5.5\" screen). I'd also say that for those of us that don't find the \"expert\" setting particularly difficult (without meaning to sound arrogant), it would be good to have a step above that. And finally a Google Play leaderboard would be a nice addition. None of these are massive problems, it's a good app as I said.",
        "Great app. I can do Sudoku on the app with the 'write' facility for numerical notes and I like how it removes them automatically as you fill in other areas. But I still find it very difficult to do paper Sudokus because I can't fill in the right answers without loads of workings out on the more challenging puzzles. The app makes this aspect easy.",
        "I would greatly prefer to start by touching a number rather than touching a cell.  I have to hunt for a cell with the number I am working with, touch that to show where all instances of that number are, then touch each cell and the number to place either the number or a note that this might be the number.  If I could select the number first, I would only have to touch each cell to place that number, then turn on \"note mode\" and touch each cell for a note.  Only half the taps per game, saving both time and the muscles in my arthritic hands!"

Can't that be possible at least for a week if one on it to her their records it shud be like that for the rest of the week. Most importantly  subway surfers consume too much data. But wen updating every month and for that reason I humbly demand that this game company provide physical cash reward for those who are consistent for us to tell others who are asking us who subway surfers help. If we tell them benefits we derive I bet u more people who are lover of games will wanna be part of subway. Trust  me....  Tnx in anticipation",

        "Great fun game. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because you go through your money pretty quick buying boosts to win levels to then upgrade your garden. I like the game a lot. Also I think that at the end of your board if you have undetonated items they should detonate at the end of that level. I've lost too many levels because of not getting one item that was next to something that was undetonated.",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "Much has improved since my original review (see below). There are special events going on quite often to help with earning coins and powerups, and the levels don't seem to be as tedious. Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

Anyway the game's good everything is cool but.. if u think u have seen an app with more adds then you know nothing download any voodoo game.. Literally after every single game over u get ads so it doesnt really matter if u tap the revive button (yeah u should u get ads regardless)",
        "Honestly, it's a really good game that mangages to pass as challenging, entertaining, addictive, and time-consuming (in my opintion) all at the same time. But, there are WAY to many ads. The game itself is great but all the ads and interuptions completely takes away from the main purpose of the game; having fun. That's pretty much the only aspect of the game that I highly suggest improving at the moment.",
        "I think the ads are fine. It acts as a breather whenever i lost a run. The gameplay is addictive and all. but.... BUGS! i hate it when i pass through 3 or more layers. And still died by stepping on dangerous tile instead of breaking it. Just had a 11k run today and died because of a stupid bug",
        "Honestly i love this game its a great way to kill time. And there's a lot of reviews on here saying how theres too many ads. Heres the simple solution to that. Don't like ads? Turn off your wifi. Ads can't play without internet.",
        "Reformat your ads. If you're gonna have one play after you lose do it exactly when you lose, not after yu've had a chance to start the next wave. Otherwise watching an ad to revive seems really dumb",
        "It's a good game that is challenging to start,  but adds nothing to keep it challenging. It just changes colors. It would be nice to have a timer,  or a high score, or something to aim to beat. Or maybe even that once you hit a section of a tear it falls away and you have to keep moving (challenge mode). I still play it,  I like it. Just wish there was something to keep it challenging."

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Love this game. My mom and I play it 24/7. It's addicting. Annnd it's a great time killer. Just like everyone else there are things that I would suggest to improve the game. Like for example the time frame for waiting on items. Crazyyyy long. Like the fish nets are like 14hrs! Could drop all the high times to half. That would be cool. But of course if you guys did that then it would be super easy to level up. And you guys would loose out on money cause there are some impatience people out there that just go ahead and buy diamonds and such. Anywho. Love the game. Please consider some of these people's suggestions. Thank you. #HayDayFan",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "Good game. I initially wrote a one star review because this game was very dependant on microtransactions but it's actually pretty fun if you have the patience. Right off the bat you have to wait upwards to 30 minutes or an hour for basic production and warming but as you grow your farm it gets easier to deal with. This definitely isn't a game you can play for, like, an hour, consecutively, which kinda sucks but it's great for the 10-20 minites you pop in now and then."

        "Something has happened.. I am currently playing the attack master event. I have attacked 20 times at least. But the metre only indicates 6 attacks. Everytime I attack I see hammers going to the metre but the number there remains the same. I would have gotten 12 million and evemln more but due to this issue I haven't. It's definitely the fault of game. Please fix it as soon as possible.",
        "Very frustrating to have to work for weeks to earn enough to build in the higher levels and have it constantly being destroyed because in three days worth of spins you only receive 2 shields... not to mention the rarity of free spins (maybe once a week) Game is an exercise in frustration and not worth the download.",
        "I am playing this game in a long time. but i have found some issue.. many time i am not get shield & someone attacked my village. How to upgrade my village. Pls tell me Moon active team & also upgrade spin 50 to 60 & also redused village manufacturar cost... Thank You.",
        "Game was running successfully but now game has stopped working in my phone all of a sudden, I have uninstalled the game and again installed but not working. My mobile handset is Motorola g5 plus and android version 7. Please help me out to resolve the issue asap.",
        "I actually liked this game but recently very glitchy/buggy. I get attacked by the same person twice within less than a min of each, same with raids. I earn for attack/raid master and the counter doesn't update. Freezes in the middle of spins. Don't earn coins for watching videos sometimes. This is even after the most recent update"

        "The game is simply awesome in a word. The mesmerizing music combined with excellent commentary makes me nostalgic to the time when FT first released Score World Goals. Playing the game is a very smooth experience, in addition to the pleasure from the quality of the graphics. There are some minor problems in gameplay, but these don't matter that much as the game excels with the idea, execution and result. And of course, it is a game where losing creates no frustration. Thanks to FT for providing us this masterpiece.",
        "Love the reduced tackling. It feels more like a high pressing Premier league match now and actually gives you a chance to stop the better teams. With the slower tackling, one missed time tackle deep in your opponents half can result in  them getting the ball all the way to your penalty box and scoring. All the while your players just hover around doing nothing. Keep the reduced tackle time!",
        "I do not like the new update where tackling recharge has been reduced. I think what it was on before was a lot better and made the game a lot more strategic as you had to time your tackles perfectly. I think reduced recharge should be something you can win in the boxes or buy with the money or gems. Another good idea could be to give the team that's just scored 20 seconds of quicker tackling on the back of the goal they have just scored. Please put it back to the normal tackling rate! I am addicted 😂😁",
        "Honestly so angry, you go on a small losing streak and end up not being able to play a game due to not having enough nomey, so I spend £10 of in app purchases thinking it will sort me out, lose once and again I can't afford to play. Don't download money snatching pile of tosh",
        "Pathetic gameplay, it has so many issues that haven't been solved with the updates. First the game lags so much, then you cant even string 2 passes together when the opponent team tackles you off the ball. Ths happens in all difficulties. Can't attack, can't defend. Player updates cost too much. Fix all of this in the next update.",
        "The fast rechargeable tackles should be removed.  The game is no fun now. Earlier I had to time my tackle perfectly so that I don't give away second balls. And same with the attack. I tried to get tackled in an area where I can win second ball. But now this fast tackle recharge has just ruined the game."

Big advantage.. And you dont HAVE to go platinum to enjoy this game, but I am considering it ! GREAT JOB !!",
        "It has a good game play as well as millions of adds which eventually ruines the game. You have to watch an add after every single mission and before starting a new mission to gain energy. So basically the energy bar is just a little trick played on us for watching advertisement. I will not recommend this game only because of the adds, otherwise it's really a good game.",
        "Do not buy Premium. You see all the locked features saying exclusive to Premium. You drop $70 for Premium only to find out the best features are still locked because now there is Premium Plus for ANOTHER $150. You are not told other than here by me that what you get when you buy Premium is a Premium-lite. You hear about Premium Plus for the first time after you have bought Premium (lite)",
        "I do liken the game. Here are my pros and cons. Great graphics, wide variety of levels, and ease of controls.  Weapons are too expensive, the game stays one step ahead of you as far as when it offers you deals on weapons. You will either not have the points or coins to purchase and then when you do it offers one level too high at your point in the game to purchase.",
        "Nice game. So far I've noticed only critical hits count. Taking out a knee or a shot to the gonads usually fails. Upgrades are like any other game, spend money to get the good stuff. Hopefully it doesn't get to the point I can't unlock the items to keep playing.",
        "Sinse last update when playing when get killed it will show score screen but spawning back to game locks up and won't play just have to watch myself lose or stop and start over losing my life??????? Please fix...... Would like to know when you are going to fix can't win for losing life and diamonds and not even getting to play!!!!!!!!!! Don't know what you have done to the game getting where it is no fun getting killed before you even get respawned"

Boosters must be given more often.",

        "The game is fun and addictive, and it also has a lot of content but unfortunately there's a bug that hasn't been fixed which is the time. Sometimes on many occasions, the level starts with the time passed like 1-3 minutes. Say I want to get 3 stars in a level by finishing it under 2 minutes and 30 seconds. When I start it, immediately one minute and a half are past without me doing anything and I have to restart the level to get it to zero. Sometimes I forget and end up finishing the level with 2 stars because of that bug and having to restart the level once again. I appreciate your support and offering the game for free but don't forget to get a fix for this bug, please. Thanks 🌹",
        "I enjoyed that it is challenging but still easy enough to feel like it's not impossible. However, there is at least one ad before every level, and sometimes 2-3 ads will come up for each level and this will probably be the reason I end up deleting it.",
        "Fun addictive love it the music the side effects all of it even my six year old daughter likes this game it's fun it's challenging for her it's not your typical solitaire and she's only 6 years old and already she loves it the higher the level the more she said Love's to figure it out great game wonderful brain game for small children teaching strategies great job guys two thumbs way up",
        "Impossible to enjoy game play due to excessively intrusive advertising.  One can't even shuffle without being forced to watch another ad. Banner ads, long boring ads between each level, jammed into players brains (so the developers wish).  I am immune to advertising and simply tune it all out. My only reaction being to UNINSTALL this otherwise enjoyable game and warn others about it's predatory intent.",

If you can please add the feature of talking to enemies when they get near. Or maybe let us chose our squad members (as many of them don't use voice chat)",
        "i was very addictated to this game until the last update. i can't even log in to the game, it said \"network error\", but my network is fine tho. i tried deleting data and reinstalling the game but nothing happened. once i can log in to the game, i can't even play normal matches. and my friendlist is gone wheter it's in game friends or platform friends. hope these problems will be fixed, i really love this game tho, i wanna play it soon :(",

It's designed very well, the map is great, everything about it is great. However, i was talking in discord with some people and they said that they couldn't play ranked. I launched the app, and i saw that i could not play it either. I hope this gets fixed soon, good luck! Edit: I can now play ranked mode, 5 stars",
        "I like the game graphic after update BUT please fix the ranked mode  . It says\"invalid season\"  and cant open it. I will give 5 stars after its fixed.   Also it would be  great if you add chat and in-game commands with next updates.  I still like this gamee so much",
        "I rated this game five stars and then  I got region locked in an European server.

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",
        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money.",
        "The game is great but customer service is non- existent. I bought the 30 day gem special that was supposed to come with an egg and fountain. Got the gems (so far)but not the extra items. Tried contacting customer support several times but following their M.O., they never respond."

Make an option to use those gems for shots instead of real cash would be nice but still earned 5 stars. Samsung galaxy note 8",
        "I think everything is fantastic about the game, but after this last update. The loading time is 20x slower if it loads at all. Galaxy phone. I can't leave message with development so this is the best I can do about that. But I love the game and this wouldn't change my activity amount at all. Keep up the great work development and look forward to new games in the future.",
        "Best game i played ever. But new update have some bugs like if we going to play with friends it take too much time for loading nd mostly notification pop up that there is an error your coins refunded in your account. Kindly resolve this issue. Except this best game 👍",
        "So I have no idea why I am always at a club disadvantage. My driver is level 5 and always vs a person with level 7 or 8. Why do I never go against level 3 drivers. Always vs higher clubs! ALL THE TIME! you might as well give them the win. Losing me as a customer because there is something very lopsided.",
        "Game sucks donkey *****. You play maybe 10 beginner holes and get chests that open in 12 seconds. THEN you play a normal hole and get a chest that doesn't open for 4hrs. You only get four chest slots so that means you can only win four holes then you have to wait 4hrs (or 8 or 12hrs depending on the chest you choose to open) before you can get anything for winning a hole. In two days, I haven't even played 18 holes. Guess you gotta have money if you wanna play. Thought I trusted the \"Editors Choice\" games, guess not.",
        "Love the game, but its not perfect. You could make the textures better and add more detail in each level bc right now they look empty. Also matchmaking is garbadge, and I get matched against people with much higher trophy counts and far better clubs... Fix this bs please."

        "I actually like the game, but I got all the guys in 3 days.... Now what? There are no upgrades or any other options to use the money on. Also the same thing is happening as others said, where the browser keeps popping up saying there is a virus. Pretty annoying",
        "Fun game, very entertaining. Ads pop up too often, it opens my browser saying i have a virus. I cant avoid it and it happens very often. Im only keeping the app bc i hope the next update fixes this issue. Other than the stupid pop up its a great game and i enjoy it. Please fix it so i dont have to uninstall.",
        "I wanted to enjoy this game. The advertisements randomly open chrome browser windows with a fake virus scan saying \"your device is infected.\" Its ironic in that the software that you're prompted to download is terrible adware that an actual scanner might flag.  It's quite persistent too, happening only after I installed this. 30 second video ads midgsme and adbars that just so happen to pop up and hover where you have to click in-game.",
        "I love the game as a whole, and I just barely redownloaded it and it saved my progress, but I can't even get through one whole throw without it opening up chrome with a fake survey or whatever. I'm not joking, it's really bad. That's why I can't give this a good rating. I understand the need for ads in a free game, but for whatever reason, mine is nothing but ads.",
        "I did not play this game for a long time. I download it and I only played it for maybe 2 hours. I tried to play, but when I  was in the middle of the game and it froze and sent me back to my home screen. The controls I like. This is not the greatest game I have seen, but It's ok😐😐😞😞"

The game uses a lot of memory, and I had to uninstall it from my tablet because it kept making it crash.  Works on my phone, but it's still a lot of memory.",
        "Love this game!! I love the challenge with completing levels. There's days I can't get enough of this game. I play every day. I love decorating my tanks. I love when I get infinite time, but It would be nice if we had control over when to use it or the time would stop and be saved for when we return. Sometimes 6 hours is impossible to sit there and just play. One thing that would be nice is if we didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life to renew and could have more friends to  receive more lives and got to use the diamonds we earned amd not be stored in a bank to buy. Other than that I cant complain😉 best game out there and I highly recommend it to all ages.",
        "It's a great game. I play it with my daughter on our freetime it's quite addictive. Its great that you get rewards if you have to watch the movies. The only thing i would change is the reloding of the lives. Half an hour for one life is too long. Every so often you get a few free hours, but you need to have free time to play.I love the fact that we can play using my phone sideways (landscape ) as I have a problem with my wrist. I highly recommend it!",
        "Fishdom is a fun game.  The puzzles are challenging. I would love to see a change to the gifts we can give our neighbors . Such as, the lightening, or fireworks, or an ornament for their aquarium. I would also like to see the diamonds we earn to be available, not stuck in a bank, to be paid for.  Limits could be put on it, of course, but the free one here and there only help once in any puzzle sequence.   Overall, though, its a nice game.",
        "I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one's tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don't earn anything for more decorations and it doesn't get dirty and the fish don't get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.",
        "Got a new tablet for Xmas.   Had game on sd card. Wouldn't transfer to new tablet.  Was on level 105.  Have to start all over again! TORTURE lol. Other games I would just stop but not this one.  I love It!  EDIT...STILL LOVE THIS GAME.  Highly reccommend it!  Some levels are SO difficult but still loving this game Oct 9/17.  DEC 2017.  Still adore this game.  Now my husband plays too.  Best game EVER!"

What is a difference if I buy better worker or he evolve? Maybe to include waiting for raw material after order? Include different sizes of workshops? I have some other ideas as well",
        "This game is really well done. The tutorial teaches you everything you need to know. Its an amazing game and its very fun for killing time. As a machinist my self I like the aspects it puts into play. So good job to the developers its a great game.",
        "What you see is it. Very simple game. Very simple practice. Just s classic build up your base, buy more expensive stuff to make you more money. I don't recommend to download it because of gameplay but because of it's amazing sound track. I LOVE LOVE the techno one that has a very short guitar rift in there. It's music is probably the best for a mobile game and definitely worthy of being a big mainstream soundtrack.  I read some of the reviews. A lot of these people probably aren't smart enough to pour piss out of a boot let alone operate their phone. There is a simple tutorial and even then it's easy to operate. It's not hard to make money like some people it is. Don't spend all your money at once, dumbass.",
        "Irony, factory efficiency game with no automation, zero, none. If you want automation pay $$$. If you want more in game coins pay $$$ so if you cant afford automation and you cant afford currency games done for you. Cant make your own premium currency without paying either. Just a free demo app at this point.",
        "I like the game just wish it was not over priced  There is a machine that will cost me 4000 gold and if i was to buy it cost me 80 bucks real cash to get it with only 1000 left over thats crazy high it be nice to have flash sales that would make more money for the game but also would be nice to have a cash or gold option when buying  The new machines and it be nice if some  Machines you buy will produce gold without spending cash  On the machines that will. lowering the price would be a big plus and a lot more people would be willing to buy cuz my saying is a fast dime is better then a slow Dollar so if they was to lower price they would make a lot more money faster just my opinion and it would be cool if you could do customization to work uniform and do a little bit of customization in the game just my thought on it",

The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn't make it better at controlling. I don't know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌",
        "this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It's so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It's just so addicting and I can't get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the 'play online' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊",
        "This is better than the browser version for multiple reasons. 1) It doesn't lag as much. I played a few rounds a noticed a little bit of lag, but it's better than the browser version.  2) You can play against AI if you don't want to play against people. I like this because I actually had a chance to win and was able to kill some. 3) You can create your own custom skin, which is awesome. All of this is free as well. I love this version of Slither.io.",
        "So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I'll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It's in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I've ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍",
        "Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃",
        "The controlls are pretty bad considering how simple they are.  The lag is unbearable. Fix those and you've got a 5star game all day. Simple fun pick up and put down time killer. In fact the lag is such an issue however, the game is getting uninstalled. You can't play a reaction based game when the lag has you 6 seconds behind whats going on."

First adds would take forever to play then they wouldn't play at all and it would freeze up till you closed it out then my whole phone froze up has NEVER happend before. I UNINSTALLED this game and my phone is back to normal. Not worth screwing up your phone. It's a bit fun but there are other games out there.",
        "Game is fun, but it crashed (Samsung Galaxy S7) and lost all progress. Now had to start again (which is not such a big problem), but then the game glitches and I don't get anything for leveling. Meaning I can't get past car level 4 anymore, because there are simply not enough parking spaces. Will give 5 stars if this gets fixed.",
        "Just a typical merger. I agree the ads are a bit excessive and when you watch ads that actually help you the doubler only lasts 2 1/2 minutes. I like these kind of games though. And now it's take me to spam pop ups. Ugh. Gave it  another try anf This one still has potential...but for now it's getting deleted again.",
        "Too many adds. You keep getting random adds in addition of the adds you are clicking yourself in order to progress. There are many games that following the same policy but getting random adds without a reward while I'm opening just a menu is really annoying",

        "Love the concept of the game but the moment you start reaching higher castle lvl  that's when you realize that if you don't pay you will be on a long journey, ie.. PvP are out of the question everyone has minimum of 5 epic items, arena you will have to settle for 5th or less place due to power lvl difference. I am about 141000 fighting 190000 or 90000, which is not fair for those of low power or advantage to those of high.",
        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",
        "I loved this game very much, I had a lot of really nice things and invested nearly $60 dollars into making my guys 5 stars and diamonds and other level up promos... I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine.."

        "Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It's nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don't want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn't get a key.",
        "Good little time waster, simple classic gameplay but puts its own unique twist on it.   Side note: I clearly played this game more than they thought anyone would as I have started getting repeated designs when I upgrade my spells xD",
        "It stopped working on my One plus! Help! I was excited about the side games! *********************************** Excellent, addictive fun. I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn't level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can't progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.",
        "All in all it is a really great game there are very few ads, its fun, the graphics are crisp. Its amazing except for one thing. On one of the levels all of the monsters have exactly 666 health and im not religious or anything but I'm pretty sure that if some one who is religious see's that, well lets just say that it might not be good for the company, so I suggest you fix this.  Thanks.",
        "Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion.",
        "Fun game but takes forever to get gold to upgrade. The cost to pay for the gems to buy so you can buy gold is really expensive. Not much dynamic to the game. Same stuff on each level just takes longer to bet enemies cause of higher HP."

        "Awesome Game!! Really I like this game. I dont even have words to describe it. Totally Fantastic... Whatever you say, this is totally cool. But I have a request...please add a column of legendary bikes. Like there is Common, Rares, Epics, and Specials , there should be a column of legendary. Waiting eagerly for the next update. Thanks a lot of making this fabulous game. And I would also like to appreciate the colours and graphics of this game. Thanks to the team for making this game. I advice this game to those who are looking for cool new games. Please install it and have FUN!!!! Dont just look at the pics, install and you'll be amazed.",
        "Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death",
        "Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won't register your flips. These aren't huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.",
        "Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I'll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.",
        "Way much room to improve                                 So first you could get more bikes in there and add more levels and make the resolution better like 1080 or something add more achievements and more of those levels that you get when you are just playing that game outside of the levels. But other wise great stuff great stuff keep it up. Also some missions are impossible, unless as someone else's comment said you play 16 hours a day",
        "This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can't seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn't be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it's not something you have to add, it's just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven't seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it's an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘"

        "A great app to download. Great format and graphics. Lots of fun and challenging. Rated everything 5 star other than gameplay. It's good but not great due to the water hazard or out of bounds shots.  Players can hit into the water yet still finish on par. Water hazard should automatically be 2 shots. If this gets changed it would be 5 star no doubt and best golf app.  Single mode would be fantastic to practise",
        "OK I really love this game but all if a sudden I can't play it anymore. I try to set up a match and it just hangs in the loading screen then boots me to the main menu. I have sent 2 emails to support within almost a week and more than 48 hours apart. I have not received any responses. Other than that it is a great game and for the time I was able to play I enjoyed it very much and hope to receive assistance in this matter soon so I can continue to play this wonderful game.",
        "I had to change my rating for this game because I seriously believe it is rigged for me to stop advancing. Everything was great until I made it to pro level and now I'm noticing that whenever I am tied with another player with gems, an extra gem magically appears in the hole making me lose that round. How is it possible that I made it to pro level winning a good percentage of games and now I have played at least 50 rounds on level 3 and can't win a single one?",
        "To many play just to attack your ball after you hit. Regardless if they don't play well they win. A bit eh. The way it's done barely allows you to win. I agree with many others reviews. Something fishy about the scoring system and who you are placed against. Won't keep long if it continues. Could be awesome if it wasn't unfair. O.o",
        "This game is ok at best. More about luck then skill. Fun and addictive, yes at times. Ive collected all the trophies from 3 of the maps and was on a roll. Then out of nowhere a 15 game lose streak. You will get to the point past anger. There are a lot of pretty good/lucky players from around the world.",
        "Overall, game quality is pretty solid. Few graphic glitches here and there but can be expected. It would be nice to rotate to see a better perspective and easier to hit.   One must improvement needed is that when you play a bot, it's way too noticable. You need to improve the bot intelligence! I understand why bots would be needed time to time.  Coins could be cheaper too.  EDIT: Game froze on a Pixel XL, cost me lots of coins! Not happy."

        "I like the game its fun and engaging but the premium choices cost a lot of diamonds and you don't get a lot opportunity to earn them. 12- 18 diamonds for more then a couple  choices in a story to make interesting choices that wouldmake the storys better but you only earn 1 diamond a chapter witch you have to wait an hour or more to unlock or buy keys.  So you pretty much have to spend real money for this game to really enjoy it. Ill be deleting this app not worth my time.",
        "While the game is enjoyable and the stories are intriguing, it is way too expensive to make certain choices. There is absolutely no need for choices to cost 20 or 25 diamonds when you only get 1 diamond for each chapter completed.  This game is in no way good enough to warrant spending real money on it, especially considering the ridiculously high prices of making certain choices which would require making a purchase in every single chapter.",
        "The game is great. Great graphics, nice music, perfectly cued entrees  for new characters, amazing story line.... But they don't give you enough keys or diamonds. I mean, y s its understandable that the chapters are long but 2hrs for a recharge on keys? Really? Either make the waiting time shorter, give us more, or both. Now as for the diamonds, they give you 25 of them. But each special choices is always way to much. And you never really know when your going to need them for something serious. With that said either give us more keys, lower the cost of the choice, or give us more diamonds per chapter. Not like 2 but 5 or more.",
        "It's a brilliant app, though sometimes I wish there wasn't as many gem choices. I fully considered buying gems until I realised how quickly they'd be used.   My favourite story was It Lives In The Woods, though most of the choices are gem choices. The story itself is fantastic, and I love the diversity of characters.   I had a problem with a story playing up and after a chat with the team was told to restart it. I didn't mind but I didn't get any keys to compensate what I'd already spent (I don't buy them I just wait for then to recharge, but it did mean I had to respend keys on one story because of a issue out of my control)   Overall its a great app and highly playable without spending.",
        "Diamond choices come up way too often for how much they cost and how little you get. The keys have an unreasonably long cooldown to get them. Options like watching ads to get diamonds would be a great option, especially seeings how you have that option in HSS and HU:RS. All that aside its a good game. Lots of the stories are enjoyable and its visually pleasing.",
        "Great graphics and great stories. Right now they have like 30 \"books\", so there are lots of options. I've been playing since 2016 and the app just keeps getting better. Can get a little pricey for the preminum choices, but otherwise it's a fantastic app; very additive and entertaining"

        "This game was absolutely perfect and was very much enjoyable, but now to unlock the full experience you have to pay. One of the reasons I enjoy this game and recommended it to my friends is because it is one of the only games that isn't locked behind a paywall. Overall, I have had countless hours playing this game, and trying to land on everything and return successfully. Instead of the microtransaction, why not institute a merit-based system for unlocking parts?",
        "Very great!  Here are a few suggestion from me to make your game more enjoyable :)  1. Can you please make the earth scale correctly because its diameter is around 12.000 km and moon orbit is around 380.000 km  2. Please make a smaller powerful engine like the 9 engines of the falcon 9  3. Please make a button that is simple to cycle from another rocket to another one to ease the attempt of landing a booster  4. Please add an ocean on the earth for some splashdown  5. The last one. Im a free 2 play player and i cant enjoy a majority of the new update :*(",
        "This game is awsome. Loads of fun. Told my friends about it. Could you add a free sandbox mode and more free parts. Thanks. Keep up the good work. Shouldn't have added micro transactions. It just ruined the game for me. Had to take it from a 5 star to a 3 star. Please bear this comment in mind for future updates. This game was 100% free when i downloaded it in december last year. Since then, you added a new build system, free parts which make the game absolutely amazing, and then you add pay for parts. Thats just buzzkill.",
        "Very fast and simple rocket building and great graphics. I wish there was a sandbox mode with infinite fuel. Also there is no indication for loading screens when you hit the launch button. Somethimes you think you tapped the button and end up sitting there for a minute or two wasting time.  Edit So glad they made a small payment option. Well worth the money and glad to support",
        "Great!  Only thing I miss is the ability to rendezvous and dock with another object.  In a moon landing, you could leave a stage in lunar orbit and pick it up for the outbound burn.  Also, karman line should be 100 km??  Edit:. Great updates.  I have no idea how to use docking to reattach parts that have been undocked though.",
        "Can you please add option to center the map on the rocket/vehicle when being in the map mode? It is difficult to switch between near objects in the current version, since I assume the map is stationary relative to the body in which influence sphere we're in at that moment. Also, a \"docking guide\" would be cool in some future update"

        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info.",
        "The game is a lot of fun if you are willing to put A LOT of time into grinding things out. They have made huge changes for just quality of life things, but they have kept the core game the same. Grind, grind, grind, grind, and grind some more. You can get everything in the game just by playing it. No need to pay anything. However it would be a lot easier if you could spend 1000$ on the game every couple weeks lol."

        "It has a lot of bugs, but it's a fun game. It has a lot of potential, if you decide to keep on working on it. One major bug that i've noticed is ITEM DOESN'T EXIST. For instance i saw a Scar laying down on the gorund in Military base and when i tried to pick it up it said \"item doesn't exist\". Fix this please, otherwise, a decent game.",
        "Everything is well put together tmain thing I love is that each area is different from on another like at the school ive had alot of vertical fire fights or power plant or the supermarket. But one thing I think u guys forgot is that the ump 45 takes .45 acp rounds",
        "Controls are terrible. When aiming directly at a player between the crosshairs. Bullets still miss. Terrible game if you're reading this go download rules of survival. That's  what I did. Also sometimes during the middle of a game a loading icon will appear. You won't be able to move or shoot your weapon. You'll pretty much die. When in the safe zone you will still take damage even tho you are in the white circle. To many hackers.",
        "I love this game free fire and this game are my favorite mobile games so far but there should be some changes like you should be able to aim with an iron sight. And the aiming could be better and what I mean by that is aiming is already hard on mobile so I just think stability should be really good without any attachments or like the aiming system on free fire battleground. The graphics are not the best I've seen really just up the graphics a bit and add the ability to aim with a iron sight. Other than those things I love how exciting the game is as well as how close it is to pubg.",
        "Mind Blowing Game..But Could You Guys Please Include \"Voice Chat\" It will Make the game more Awesome.. Its so tough To Contact With Team Mates. In chat box By typing..Please..see in thus matter.. #Devlorpes"

I thought that the different colours gave you the ability to collect more balls so not really sure what the point of the game is... no way to won or lose ... just click ... I like things with skill... I can handle the ads and would even pay to remove ads if the game have a point.. a purpose a win/lose sort of deal but it's not I don't think I will be keeping this game .. unless they add a little skill to it",
        "This isn't a game. You just hold a button until it disappears and then hold another button... Really. And then there is an option to just have the buttons automatically hold themselves. Then the next level happens and there are new colors, but nothing else is different. Maybe good to keep your baby busy but I wouldn't condone that sort of thing",
        "It's decent. I like the sounds it makes, and the colours look nice too. The forced ads I can't skip after 5 seconds is the annoying part. I get that you need ads, but come on man. I buy 3 upgrades and have to watch a full minute ad. It's like an ad simulator. Honestly if I wanted to play with balls, and watch ads I'd play with my own balls, and throw some ads on YouTube(this part is mostly for humour). Just so you know I'm not salty, annoyed yes, but not salty.",
        "I like the game as it's one when you don't want to think but want to do something. It's very easy. However you watch more ads than you do play the game. So annoying I had to sit through a 1 minute cat chat advert without being able to skip it. Then a 10 second level then another 50 second unskipable ad so annoying",
        "Ads are non skipable which is awful. Skippable ads are ones that pop up that you don't want usually. The full ads like on this game are only usually shown when you are getting a upgrade to a boost or something free etc. Terrible design as you can't win either",
        "I love a stupid game, I really do, not everything has to be top tier strategy or reflex based or whatever  However this is the most boring clicker game ever. At least normal clickers have a theme or SOMETHING to pretend you're doing... Anything at all. Here, you don't even have that. No context, no theme, not even a change of shape or whatever  It's sad gaming has gone this low"

        "It's nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it's not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It's just not fair.",
        "A lot of Numberlink programs have \"fake\" puzzles - they have multiple solutions unless additional non-standard \"rules\" are followed... which are NEVER fun. This app doesn't do that. These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.",
        "I loved flow free from a young age. I've played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I've tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs",
        "Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.",
        "The best, the OG, the original puzzle time-passer! (second only to Tetris) I love this game, I've been playing it for years! The original starts to get boring after awhile, but with all the different variations they come out with, it never gets old. A very fresh experience with one of the recent updates, feels much more refined when compared to the one I used to play.",
        "Simple yet clever, Free Flow is about connecting brightly colored dots together without crossing the lines. With an abundance of board shape, size, variety, and difficulty, there's something in free play to challenge nearly everybody. Those who find even the largest puzzles too easy may alternatively challenge themselves in time trials to finish the boards as quickly as possible."

The ONLY hold backs is the controls, but u really can't do much about that problem unless u actually had physical/analog joysticks built n2 ur phone.?. The basic control problems u have w/ ne downloadable games.",

It is a fun game but why are there pressure limits sometimes I don't like it but this game is it for teens it's for everyone it's really fun and well sometimes I don't like it when it takes me a long time to get money for a shark",
        "Love the game but in the last couple days, I'll get into a warp and it'll freeze completely on me. And It truly disappoints me because I could've had so many coins by now. I cannot play the game at all with it not freezing and making me start over.. I don't know if it's a virus or what but I wish it would get fixed."

        "I will consider rating the game five stars if you can add new levels and lines, but the \"hearts\" feature forces me to watch ads, even though I paid to remove ads. I will give the game five stars if you gracefully remove the \"hearts\" feature. I'm asking CM a question: \"Will you please change the game back to the original way we played it? And add new levels? 'The Easter' would be creative, and the diamonds can be eggs. How about an Easter Bunny line? I like all the new levels, and the new lines we can unlock. Can you add more remixes to the levels? There are only 3 existing remixes, if CM had forgotten.\"",
        "I originally had it as 5 stars, but I noticed the longer that I've had the game, the more bugs I'm starting to see. Sometimes the music won't line up with the levels, which is the point of the game, and other times the game won't register my touch and will screw up my progress. If this gets fixed that would be great, and I'd move the rating back to 5 stars!",
        "I really wish you guys didn't update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can't listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!",
        "Amazing game... Loved it...😍 The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it'll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it's okay 😊",
        "The game starts off really strongly and the concept is unique and the music is fabulous.. but later on things get so progressively difficult it makes flappy bird look like a piece of cake... And in the later on levels there's not much sync between the music and the cube it's really hard to play... I enjoyed it initially but now I'm just going to uninstall it...",
        "This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn't as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn't there but now it's forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads."

        "On level 2185, had over 800 different boosters and suddenly all of them are gone, serious glitch in game... emailed their tech center for over 1 week now and only get a automated response and nothing from a real person. Wasted 3 years of time and data on this worthless app.... recommend not installing or uninstalling it... customer service sucks",
        "Ive played this game a long time. New update and instead of making the game better you screw your customers. I lost all my boosters and you expect me to continue? If nothing else its a matter of principle. You punish me by taking everything ive bought and earned, ill punish you by never giving you another dime and i will let everyone i know who plays or asks about any of your games ro stay away.",
        "EDIT: Update on 3/22/18 fixed NOTHING! New levels still locked as well! Worst update in candy crush history. Riddled with bugs. It didn't add new levels like it should have. Unlimited boosters don't appear on level when they should. And boosters are no longer allowed on lower levels. I'm at level 2100 something. I should be able to use boosters when ever I want! And I should be able to have unlimited boosters appear on all levels, not just when they feel like it. Fix and I will give more stars.",
        "Would love to give a better rating, but after the most recent update the game has very bad lag, worse than the usual lag it's always had. Updating this. Was hoping update today would fix the lag. It didn't. Also, adding 2 extra steps in order to replay a stage sucks. You know the old saying; if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
        "So frustrated with all the candy crush games. I periodically get angry enough to quit for awhile,  but end up back. Why am I upset? I was just in the middle of a rare winning streak and had earned a number of special candies to start games with. I was up to 2 hour on the fish, multi color candy, and the juicy jawbreaker, with 3 hours of life. Suddenly,  i still had the life but all other rewards disappeared. This is far from the first time. I am tired of it. I am removing the king games and I am not coming back this time. I get glitches happen but I have never had any  Indication  that anyone gives a damn. No one makes anything right or even says,  sorry. I'm ok with a game having issues but I am not ok with being treated less than.",
        "I am getting 2 hours unlimited gift daily but i cant use it because after 5 minutes its goes up i dont get it for actual time which it shows pls fix it"

I might get another game similar to this one but i will have to erase this one. Also, it only gives you a little bit of time.",

I bet that u make money every time some1 sees an ad on in your game, but u won't make any money if that person stops playing the game because of how much ads. I have been playing this game for 10 minutes and already come across around 100 ads. I might take away some of that cash income because the amount of ads Is insane. Would u rather make No Money, or A decent bit of money?",
        "The game could be better if you tone down the ads a bit more... Maybe 10 games one ad? Or maybe more? Its really annoying when you get ads every end of the round."

        "To anyone saying the magnometer should be free; no, it shouldn't.  You guys are requesting it be free because it is in demand, which is exactly why it is for sale.  Parents don't let you buy things on the app?  Good. The magnometer is something EXTRA that is absolutely not necessary for the app to function.  Sure, it can help make the right move; that's why you have to pay for it... Without the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app.  With the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app and paying for it to help analyze your moves.  You are not entitled to a free move analyzer to help guide you simply because you want it to be free.  That's not how economics works, hate to break it to you.  There are many, many ways to analyze moves, positions, and get better at chess; the Magnometer is not and will never be the best way to do so. It is simply an added convenience that you can choose to pay for to help you find or analyze a move/position.",
        "Feels great to have a simulated match with a Magnus-like computer AI opponent. Will definitely destroy you even at the lower age levels. The only thing I don't like in the app is the gray color graphics of the board and the chess pieces. The upside about this is you can surely change that setting if you got the appropriate in-game currency to purchase a different color scheme, with some playthroughs that are needed first to be able to get them.",
        "You know this is the best chess app. The magnus tuned engines works great. You actually improve with each passing day. Few points too. I would have given it 100 stars if possible if the graphic would have been better. The graphic you know, like black and white makes a very depressing combination. Also an option for online game with others would make it a perfect app.",
        "Sound effects and graphics are distractingly poor. Missing basic features like turn confirmation. You can see a video on YouTube of Magnus himself making a mistake in placing a piece using this app.",
        "This chess game is very good, I would give it five stars except for an internal error that will not post my record of wins, losses and ties against Magnus. Maybe I fried the memory with all my losses...😁",
        "the engine is actually good, I gave that 1 star for that, yet the interfaces are sluggish, very clunky, slow, and you can't even change the default board colors without playing a lot of this, with ridiculous brainpower credits.  it's slows down my new smartphone too much when another chess apps are practically lightweight. and without good sides such as analysis or online multiplayer matches."

        "Ok so ive been olaying this game for a long time now, but I had to delete the game for storage purposes. Once I game back I logged in with my facebook account and all that but nothing loads. Which is fine I just have to wait. But now my issue is that the actual levels for the wedding event, and the normal quest, it kicks me out of the app and it does thatt every time. Please fix this issue. Maybe then Ill give it five stars.",
        "Great addictive game! Starts out cute and innocent. Recently found out through a spoiler thread that it does take a darker turn in Ch 15. The U.S. servers are currently only on Ch 12. Still a great addicting game that many players start out thinking \"Awesome! A great game that I don't I can have the option to play for free!\" Soon they cave when that ONE outfit comes along that they HAVE TO HAVE lol.",
        "I love this game! It's really good for creative people who like to design their own outfits. I just downloaded on my new phone and started over (I don't have Facebook to link my progress with). Please make it available to link with Google play so I don't always lose progress!   Also, since downloading again, I found that some of the names are different... I was very confused, since the voice over still says the old names. I like Yoko way better than Bobo!!",
        "I loved this game, and am V8. So its not like I am against paying. I am against the ranking event especially since you devs LIED TO YOUR PLAYERS and said we wont be getting one again. We will not pay 100s for a non guarenteed reward. It would be more HONEST, if you set up the suits as 300 USD each recharge.  If you are smart at all, devs you should understand that business ethics is just as important as profit and will benefit everyone in the long run.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events."

        "It's good. A decent game that forces you to grind and wait, OR you could spend money to buy gold to open more chests. I would have given it 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that to watch ads to get rewards, I have to give it my LOCATION, ALLOW IT TO MANAGE MY CALLS, and access to my media. Why do you even need my location and phone number to watch an ad for rewards?",
        "Love this time killer. Its a simple game, simple concept. Easy to learn the controls by yourself, and unlock stuff. Simplistic graphics, and will most likely run smooth in any device. Now, the only issue here is, that unlocking a chest is a tad bit too expensive, and gaining coins and stars are a bit hard. Tho, i havent unlocked quests yet, so i dont know. Either way, Awesome game, cant wait for future updates, and i really hope the devs will add new worlds, characters, weapons and customisations maybe?",
        "I love this game in every way. It's a great time killer and it's fun to collect the helmets. The chests don't wait too long to open and the challenges keep you from just messing around. My only complaint is the lack of creativity in the weapons. If I work hard enough to get a new helmet I would like to see at least one unique weapon per helmet. Instead it is a different combination of the regular weapons.",
        "As a 3D MMORPG dev it is hard to find something that is enjoyable on this damned store. However your combination of simplicity mixed with a variety of prefabs and abilitys alongside particles and everything else make this an excellent game. You dont spam ads, you don't make it incredibly difficult and you don't make it pay to win.  A tip of my hat to you guys. I would give this 5 stars if I didn't have a buck fifty skins in my face all the time....",
        "Great game......the only problem in this game is that the lack of information about a weapons..... i wish their are something like a short tutorial about the types of weapons or a short video on what happen if the weapon equiped..... since the game is just currently launch... its normal that it has minor bugs.... but please fix it as soon as the updates come....for a summary: A reallly great game and entertaining",
        "I enjoy the gameplay and various unlock/progression mechanics, but the game is extremely laggy. It may be my device, however. Also, some hitboxes seem to be mercilessly accurate and it can be very frustrating. That may not be something to change, but definitely something to note."

        "Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I'll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx",
        "I couldn't get enough patients, I couldn't get enough cash, and my staff energy seemed to drain way too fast. I love the surgery games but you maybe get one of those a day. I ended up uninstalling when room upgrades said they would take 12 hours. Too much waiting, not enough action. I liked the story so far too. Maybe I'll reinstall in the future if the times go down.",
        "It's a great game at first, but it takes so long to upgrade or save money or anything that you end up spending a lot of your real life money. Plus the surgeries all start to be the exact same, and the glitches... oh, the glitches. Zapped $200,000 out of my bank, and that bloody epinephrine shot is impossible to get without striking out. Oh, and $120,000 for research that will only make you $4,000? Why is everything so time and resource consuming???",
        "Controls don't work properly during surgery! There is lot of lag while performing an action while the timer works properly. Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "Love the overall feel of this, though some things need tweeking. For example, I only have half of the staff available and am now getting far too many duplicate cards concidering how many I have left to get. Makes it feel all too much like it's pushing people to spend real money, something that always ends with me deleting the game and moving on. Hope this doesn't happen in this case, but I'm not holding my breath...",
        "It's a nice game, I like the concept, you get to operate on patients and manage a hospital. Problem with the recruitment part, it was always giving me surgeons and wasted 200 hearts on the same person. There should be an option if you want to fire someone or replace with another staff. The biggest issue is with their connectivity, internet connection is very stable works with all apps except for this one, no idea why. Fix it please I would hate to delete this game. Thanks."

Makes you forget about the game sometimes as you can't do anything else untill it's complete. I refuse micro-transactions so this game now only gets visited once every couple of days. It's a shame really as it's great fun to start with.",

Edit: I have already provided screen shots to you via the Help & Support board, you haven't yet taken action. Please do so immediately.",
        "This game is not made for people who do not spend money. The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",

That cant get in even we need them somtimes we play it and we need a ninja and its not in the box to pick a ninja you will jut restart the game. Anyways but i still love it Ninjago is my  favorite have you guys watch the ninjago movie even there episodes. Thank you for creating this game.👍👍👍👍👍👍",
        "I'm a big fan of lego ninjago♥. Its just hands of time I fight serpentine and when master Wu spoke I saw a timeblade. When I was chilling looking at my mission's then Lloyd hacked into Zane's computer he said something I just have a bad memory.",
        "I think if you could add a few extra spaces for more ninja then everybody would be happy .the reason I'm giving this app a 4 star rating is because you can only have up to five ninja on a mission including your own .if anybody would like that to happen then give this review a thumbs up.",
        "I love the game it's fantastic but one thing can you please have the feature to ride the vehicles or make your own customer vehicle and could you please add where the ninjas are actually following your character",
        "I think the controls are horrible because I Am left handed and you've got to use your right hand to go forward and there is not much of fighting or ningargo feeling",
        "No controller support on Android TV. Very buggy playing on a tablet. Character gets stuck behind/in objects and you have to kill the game..."

What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven't listened to this game's. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I'm entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.",
        "I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it's meant to be \"skillfull\" but thats harder than skillfull, you can't even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don't care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.",

        "This is a great tool for your toddler (and fun for parents). I did pay the 1.99 to stop the ads but so worth it.  For under $2 my daughter has memory games, puzzles, fingerprinting, math, music, matching,  and the list goes on.  I spend at least $10 on a toy and for $2 it teaches and helps on long car rides and planes rides.  It's a great educational app and not a \"game\".  I would recommend especially if you're a fan of Masha and the Bear."

What is a difference if I buy better worker or he evolve? Maybe to include waiting for raw material after order? Include different sizes of workshops? I have some other ideas as well",
        "This game is really well done. The tutorial teaches you everything you need to know. Its an amazing game and its very fun for killing time. As a machinist my self I like the aspects it puts into play. So good job to the developers its a great game.",
        "What you see is it. Very simple game. Very simple practice. Just s classic build up your base, buy more expensive stuff to make you more money. I don't recommend to download it because of gameplay but because of it's amazing sound track. I LOVE LOVE the techno one that has a very short guitar rift in there. It's music is probably the best for a mobile game and definitely worthy of being a big mainstream soundtrack.  I read some of the reviews. A lot of these people probably aren't smart enough to pour piss out of a boot let alone operate their phone. There is a simple tutorial and even then it's easy to operate. It's not hard to make money like some people it is. Don't spend all your money at once, dumbass.",
        "Irony, factory efficiency game with no automation, zero, none. If you want automation pay $$$. If you want more in game coins pay $$$ so if you cant afford automation and you cant afford currency games done for you. Cant make your own premium currency without paying either. Just a free demo app at this point.",
        "I like the game just wish it was not over priced  There is a machine that will cost me 4000 gold and if i was to buy it cost me 80 bucks real cash to get it with only 1000 left over thats crazy high it be nice to have flash sales that would make more money for the game but also would be nice to have a cash or gold option when buying  The new machines and it be nice if some  Machines you buy will produce gold without spending cash  On the machines that will. lowering the price would be a big plus and a lot more people would be willing to buy cuz my saying is a fast dime is better then a slow Dollar so if they was to lower price they would make a lot more money faster just my opinion and it would be cool if you could do customization to work uniform and do a little bit of customization in the game just my thought on it",

It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven't bothered to update this in years.",
        "This game is AMAZING. YOU DEFINITELY need it. There is only 1 thing that I hope this game will have, I really want them to have CPU's on multi-player and on tournaments and duels because it says check your internet connection when I try to play them. But still this game is the best. So if you're searching for a game just get BIKE race and you probably won't need any other game.",
        "Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can't stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn't happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can't buy any of the bikes.",
        "It's a fun little game at first, but has many, many flaws. You have to link it to your Facebook account if you wanna play all maps. There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can't play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That's just ridiculous. Not to mention it's very buggy. Sometimes you're racing someone who's in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it's just stupid.",
        "Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you're racing friends.",
        "Fun game but its lame the only bikes that have boosted stats are super expensive. And it's really dumb that the stats don't scale up with the cost of the bike. They have a range of 100 to 350 with the ultra bike and 300 for the super bike, that leaves plenty of room for various speed levels. The helmet and trick type perks are cool but not enough of an incentive. Need more to play, pay, or fight for."

First adds would take forever to play then they wouldn't play at all and it would freeze up till you closed it out then my whole phone froze up has NEVER happend before. I UNINSTALLED this game and my phone is back to normal. Not worth screwing up your phone. It's a bit fun but there are other games out there.",
        "Game is fun, but it crashed (Samsung Galaxy S7) and lost all progress. Now had to start again (which is not such a big problem), but then the game glitches and I don't get anything for leveling. Meaning I can't get past car level 4 anymore, because there are simply not enough parking spaces. Will give 5 stars if this gets fixed.",
        "Just a typical merger. I agree the ads are a bit excessive and when you watch ads that actually help you the doubler only lasts 2 1/2 minutes. I like these kind of games though. And now it's take me to spam pop ups. Ugh. Gave it  another try anf This one still has potential...but for now it's getting deleted again.",
        "Too many adds. You keep getting random adds in addition of the adds you are clicking yourself in order to progress. There are many games that following the same policy but getting random adds without a reward while I'm opening just a menu is really annoying",
        "Awesome but I don't like ads, every time you wanna buy a new car there is an ad. Disappointed.",
        "No problem with ads just turn off your internet and play forever if you want x2 speed turn internet back on simple why so much complaining its simple. Great game and more cars would be awesome!!!"

        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",

Also, why does the Apple version have stars and the android version doesn't? I was trying so hard to earn enough stars to buy the colour packs on my iPod, and I got quite disappointed that I can't do that on android. I guess I'll just delete the game off android since there's really no goal to the game now.",
        "Very fun and addicting but nice calm relaxing game. Ads only happen after each round and not a big deal. If you want to keep playing this game FREE then add up with the package. Quiet whinning about ads. Someonbe has to pay the creators for this game including the upkeep and updates. How else will the creator make his money? 2 choices, either gets ads or charge to download. So I can deal with the ads. It's a FREE APP.",
        "Way too many ads. I just need something for my fingers to do while listening to podcasts but this constantly interrupts my listening pretty much after every round. I really liked the game but I have had it with thw ads and am uninstalling. It's just not worth it.",
        "I really like the game but as many others have said their are too many ads. Ads after every round and sometimes in the middle of the round which makes you start over and that gets annoying. Too many of thr same ads. I also agree their needs to be a redo button. It does get a bit pintle after you hit the goal but still fun.",
        "Too many adds, and it makes me restart every time an add plays, I've only had this app for 1 min, and have already played 50 rounds... Not. Cool. I would be okay with the adds if I could at least pick up on where I last left off.",
        "I'm not quite sure what's happened to this game. It's very straightforward and strangely addictive. However, just today after Android's OS update, it performs much worse. Where before when you pick up a block, it is elevated slightly above your finger so you can see where it's going, now it's just under your finger, making this game frustratingly impossible. If this is due to an interaction with the OS update, then 1010 is due for it's own update."

Terrible, terrible controls.  Edit: I'm happy to say they removed the Flip and Die feature and now the game is quite enjoyable. Well worth playing!",

One thing I would say is that I wanted to buy shoes before I got to the level I had enough coins but when I clicked it it took my money but didn't give me the shoes so now I have to play loads more when I could have got them five minutes ago. Please fix this and I will rate 5 star",

There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars. For someone who says \"too many notifications\", go to the settings and turn off that notifications button. Thank you for those hate critics you guys made. It really teached me a lesson.",

And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.",
        "Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I'm sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP",

        "I like how I can give the guests disgusting drinks and food a see and hear their really funny reaction! Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!😆😆 I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!",
        "I LOVE this app! And I'm so glad it's free! Everyone is like 'it's the same thing over and over again' but they're not actually getting into this game. They're are tons of different options to choose from and like Toca Boca says cook it your way. I LOVE TOCA BOCA!!!",
        "I'm giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won't make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least"

However one problem is the game not unlocking vehicles, maps, and helmets. The biggest example of this is the turbo turtles mission. I am somehow not able to unlock the turtle and skeleton knight even after completing it in various different ways. Even so, this game is an absolute must have for people who want to have a mix of competitiveness and fun!",

The controls are great and graphics a+. (they also keep adding new fun stuff that makes the game fun to play for even experienced players) great game 😀",
        "WARNING: every time you update the game, it cannot connect to your google play account for god knows how many hours or even days! The risk of losing all your progress is VERY high. If when starting the game you don't see the \"Restore\" button, quit immediately and start again after few hours when (and if) the restore button appears again. If you can't restore your progress and continue playing without restoring, then all your progress is lost!",

Who the hell cares about a dog when you can't even keep a jacket for more than a trip to a location... Update has lost my account again and do you know... I think that I have had enough. I'll come back if you do ever finally release it which I don't think you will until you stop wasting time on pointless additions and concentrate on the core gameplay.sort yourselves out, I am going to find another game.",
        "for anybody just starting out don't bother to download and play this game. I've been playing pretty much from the first version and have yet to find a fuel tank for my motorcycle. the developers either just don't listen to the people playing the game and address the problems people have with the game or don't care. with every update it's becoming more and more obvious they're more concerned with how to get more money out of players that are willing to spend it.",
        "Dog update just lost all my data including motorcycle, nearly finished acid bath, and atv, cement base with maxed out trunks, loads of stuff. Played every day for months to have it all wiped away in 1 update. They have done this repeatedly to others and yes it was connected to playstore. I have restored it before. This time it doesnt connect!",
        "What the hell i got raided and when i went to get a revenge raid i was not able load into his base. Then i restarted the game and all my stuff was gone that i had taken to raid my 6 iron hatchets, fully moded ak, fully moded glock and all of my tactical armour"

        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",

Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that's it. You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It's not fair. Lastly good job guys.",

        "Been playing since goblins vs gnomes (2014) and still play today. Not a diehard player, but as my buddy put it, \"hearthstone is the best toilet game ever\". It's pretty simple and easy to learn. Newer and f2p players have a bit of a rough go, but you can easily keep pace in this game for less than $100 a year.",
        "It's a fun game for a while before you will get frustating. Too much depending on luck no matter how good your deck is if you couldnt get the card to do your combo its useless againt an opponant that have better draw than you.  Also if you are free to play you have to be petient to get ass kick for a while till you have luck enough to get some useful legend card.",
        "I love card games and this got some awesome elements. However... The randomness and luck in this game is pure bs. You can be in a winning position and still lose because of 1 in a 10000000 chance of the oponent getting lucky. Even when I win I feel bad from winning because I know the oponet was unlucky.... It is very rare I get a game where I think. This game was awesome because we both did our best.",
        "I never even got to play. I have now tried to install 3x. The first two times the app became unresponsive. The third it caused my phone to crash and reboot. I have a pixel which should be perfectly capable of running it. If not then don't offer it for this device. First blizzard product that's ever pissed me off.",
        "Great game! Love all the really cool animations! I do have a problem that since I installed the game, my store has been closed 😐 I am installing it on PC right now to see if I can get to the store there. Game play is awesome though!",
        "Really fun game. 3 stars cause it closes very easily. If I get a phone call even when I dont answer the game closes.even on wifi it closes. Then it takes too long to reload causing me to lose a turn. This is the worst in arena because losing one turn will kill you and it becomes a waste of gold. Please do whatever you can to solve this problem."

        "UPDATE: The ads are much fewer than before and, from what I can tell don't show mid level anymore.  Previous Review: I understand having a few ads and banners before or after a level, but when you're trying to dig and an ad pops up, it is way too much. Otherwise it's a fun game, but you won't get past the ads for too long without uninstalling likely.",
        "Won't let me continue playing unless I pay, connect fb and bug friends, or I watch 3 videos,1 video every 24 hrs. So now I either wait 2 days to play or I deleted this. So disappointed. Was enjoying it.",
        "I thought this was a kids game so why do I have to pay money, connect to Facebook, or wait 3 days to move forward!? This game is for young kids right? So do you think a little 7 year old has money or Facebook, and everyone know the are not pacent!",
        "People if there's too many ads on the stupid thing turn the airplane mode you can still play your game 2 just remember to turn it back on",
        "It kept crashing right once I click on the first level. It doesn't work at all. Don't install this app, it is terrible.",

The 10 puzzles for 25 coins is a very nice idea to encourage you to do more puzzles to get those coins! I haven't bumped into any problems with this game yet, so that's good! I entirely recommend this game for anybody who likes puzzles, novice or advanced! :)",

But some of the hints for some of the puzzles are extremely confusing to figure out, meaning I've gotten stuck with several of the puzzles and this is very disappointing for me.",

I've read some reviews and I do admit that there is a lot of ads, but for the most part I don't really mind it. I don't know if its just my type of phone or not, but I can usually skip these ads pretty quickly. So yeah this is a great app! Keep up the great work!",

There are only two places to colonize and once you've done them and reached level 10 on both, there's really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.",
        "Be cool if there is boosts. Example if you get 3 perfect you get a free auto perfect boost or something. Also plz add a line of code to stop people from the date/time bug abuse - save current time to file. Player won't get money till that last input time has passed.  Also be cool to spend the coins on boosts",
        "Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot's more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn't bother me that much. 5 stars for the team",
        "It's a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the 'colony' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you"

        "Good and love the puzzles but the maths one in blue ruins it for me. All other puzzle improve your skills but this isn't since you have no time to caulate the expression it's more a test of memory then calculation because you can only 3 star it if you know the expression by heart if you try workout you answer right but run out of time. You should make is so each correct answer adds time so you can accurately l improve. Also most games are broken with not enough time to do the given task and workout same as previous has no buttons so you can't play it.",
        "The puzzles are simple yet challenging, and there's enough of them to keep your interest for a long time. Star ratings give the game good replay value, and the workout mode is a nice addition for something short and sweet. Ads can get a bit annoying, but there's not too many and the pro version isn't that expensive anyway. As for the skill-building element, I can definitely see a difference in my attention and reflexes since playing. Overall, I would definitely recommend this game.",
        "The image vortex game does not work. Is it intentional to make us skip the level by making purchases? Coz it doesn't work at all, atleast on my redmi phone. If all the images come at once it's impossible to pick the one appearing last. Have to remove the app though I was enjoying it so far"

        "This game has issues. The tutorial has a white background with white crosshairs making it nearly impossible to aim. You have to aim like 30 feet above your opponent and hope that you are lobbing the knife high enough to make it there. Sometimes I would somehow win a round without even throwing a knife. Other times I'd die in the first second of play after being hit 1 time but it would take me at least 3 hits to kill my opponent. Watched a video for a free crate and then the game went back to the startup screen like it was rebooting and i had to watch another to open it. Not very much to do either. Im out.",

        "Addictive game. Ive seen lots of people with issues restoring game on different devices.  Just wanted to say I've had no issues with mine. I simply logged in using the same info as when I purchased it. Give it a try. Only real complaint I have is a recent event. I've purchased all unlocks and until now extras, even enjoy the pc version but now even after I've handed out funds they want more money to enjoy features. When I purchased unlocks and extras the last thing I wanna hear is we've added more unlocks for more money, even though you already paid for unlocks.",
        "1.) You used to be able to fast forward game for free... That now has to be upgraded  2.) Everything costs money!!! In order to progress in the game you basically need to purchase the full version 3.) The fungus level is definitely the hardest to get past, played at least 10+ times and still have not won that level because it doesn't give you enough DNA to upgrade. 4.) Game is overall, Ok.  5.) I like the new levels! Like the vampire and ape one. It's pretty cool."

Which is smart I think. Gameplay is pretty fun and responsive. Upgrades don't feel unattainable. Definitely one of the better games on the play store",
        "There is a sudden difficulty spike in this game around level 20. Even if u have the best ship and weapons ur no match for the hordes of enemies. This is not right. Even after spending money the developers dont want you to win in my opinion. Dont know whats the logic.",
        "It's almost nothing without buying coins, u cant even win normal difficulty without ads and purchasing coins, how r we supposed to upgrade our weapons when every map gives u only around 200 and u need 20000 after a while for only one upgrade????!!!!!! Its graphic and gameplay is really good but like I said no progress in winning after a few maps",

        "Gave one star less because the missons lack mathematical accuracy There was this level to travel 8 kms in 130s and it was showing it an easy mission with a bike of top speed 172 kph 😂 The graphics and gameplay are superb I like the game",
        "There are some idiot missions such as combo overheading. I would give this game 5 stars if not those missions.",
        "I can't stop playing this!! The missions are really hard and thats what makes it fun! although i almost threw my phone twice. but this game is amazing! the graphic is good too!"

When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..",
        "Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven't gotten very far yet. Thing I DON'T like is you don't get an average..... IF you do, I've yet to find where it is in the game. That's in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯",
        "The Game is good. Some things to improve it:  save your profile using your Google Account. Play with Friends in Tournaments (ie. Teams, Challenges), ability to givie Hearts to friends without using Facebook Also can you PLEASE improve the notification! My friend sends me Requests to Bowl & most of the time I don't get notified. Thank U",
        "Not sure how the currency works or how to upgrade my levels. Played 10 times and still can't upgrade the ball. Do they expect real cash to upgrade 1 ball? Also the controls are touchy, I've inadvertently chucked a few balls into the gutter while trying to align it before my release. Some tutorials would be nice.",
        "I did like this fame but my lane keeps turning pink along with the ball so I can't actually see anything like where the ball is going.... and on quick fire again turns everything pink and don't let me take any shoots what do ever.. think it's a glitch in the game I'm not sure but tried restarting the game and the same thing is happening again and again... on all the different lanes and extra games in bowling king...",
        "Great graphics and realistic feel to the lanes. Controls are a bit wonky, however, and purists won't like being being able to steer the ball after it leaves your \"hand.\" LOTS of attempted upsells, but its free to play features ain't too bad on their own, either. All in all, a decent little bowling game."

After this last update I lost slot. It started off awesome but once I started investing money in the game it's like it just took my money by taking the gifts and coins.  Such a waste of time and money when no corrections are made.  Trying to give the developer a chance to redeem themselves from this error.",

I want the barista to automatically start the machines if there isn't one already there. i want to be able to hire another barista. I want to put my menu on the other wall. I want smaller windows. There's basically a lot of things i feel limited on and i still haven't figured out if i can change the color on wallpaper or not.",

I used to play this game a lot and I've noticed the prices of everything have went up and including the spices. You no longer have the option to buy the cheaper furniture forcing you to spend more so customers come in to the Cafe. Very greedy and game makers. Sort these issues and give me the diamonds I'm owed or take away the ads.",

        "Bug that you have to wait endlessly to enter daily raid seems to be partially fixed. But: 1. Raid is even more fraudulent than before...no mattet you defense, dragon will one hit you. Fraud, there is no reason for a mechanic you cannot do anything about except exploitation! 2. I have all the upgrades and do pretty much max dmg, but there seem to be people out there that do 20 times the amount I do...except they don't, because they simply DO NOT EXIST!!! AS IN BATTLE MODE THEY ARE SIMPLY MADE UP BY THE DEVS! THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY REAL PLAYERS!!! 3. The skill that decreases % of all dmg does not do so...it virtually does not reduce damage at all, but still it costs 50 crystals per % point. Also fraud! 4. You pay for somethin but you cannot keep it. If you change your phone, everything is lost forever! This is criminal behaviour! CONCLUSION: Probably the most fraudulent and criminal organisation out there. BEWARE AND DO NOT INSTALL, AND FOR CHRISTS SAKE, DON'T SPEND MONEY ON IT!!!",

        "Its world best game ever played.  It is like a small GTA of phone or for android. It doesn't look too good but if u download and play it will like a real GTA. It is a quite big but the game is super amazing. It is not too interesting in starting but later u can play it like a GTA. It also not need any extra files to download after downloading from play store but it needs Internet connection.",
        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Great game thanks. as smooth as we like it well-done. To google players if you are  looking for action GTA 5 style then this is the game for you. I can't wait to get home from work every night make a brew and chill on this till I run out of battery lol class A game. (Again thank you for making this game) can't wait for updates fingers crossed",
        "Huge Kudos to the developers for making this game!! It's amazing it's literally like playing GTA but on your phone it has the story mode and it all makes sense!! The graphics are ok but I'm sure if they made this again in a Los Angeles version of some sort the graphics could get better and better!! Overall Amazing game and there's nobody else making games like this on the app store!! Great job! 10 out of 10 stars!!!",
        "Wow this game is so fun! when you go the airport, there are planes yay! and one thing you have to add to the game, please add some more hotels that are in the real Las vegas and I love the daily bonus and the one thing I hate, the military base where you get killed by a jackalope tank, bustard helicopter and the iron horse and please make the military base free to enter without getting 5 stars note: version is 3.6",
        "Best game I've ever played! In fact it is the only game I've had on my phone for 2 years. But there are some minor errors that keep occurring, such as when you are running or driving any vehicle, the control pad keeps stopping and I have to lift my thumb up and put it back down to regain control. Now I know it doesn't sound like much, it can mess up your drifts and the gas will stop as well. PLEASE FIX. Thanks"

        "Edit: Fix the controls! Under the default setting the gas would randomly stop working, and while using auto accelerate the nitro randomly activates even when my thumbs are nowhere near them!  Runs smooth and looks great for a retro style racer.  I wish more devs would release games like this, the free game isn't so much a demo as it is a kind of shareware like they released in the 90s.",
        "Lack of game play is what gets me. Don't get me wrong, it's a smart tactic. Offer a free game with *just* enough content to get you hooked then push a \"pay for\" ad to keep playing the rest of the game. May as well call it a trial or a demo mode, that's all it is. Which it's a shame, I'd rather watch a couple ads here and there vs that tactic.",
        "So I downloaded and wound up buying the full version about 6 months ago. Was awesome. Outrun meets Cruisin USA. Loved it, beat it, 80% through trying to get perfect on every course to unlock a different ending mostly just because I want to keep playing and then it updates. Way after I purchased, a whole brand new set of course tracks. It's the best pocket change you'll ever spend.",
        "It was a good game. Too bad it doesnt open now after the update. It says something below the logo screen and then dissapears too fast you cant read it. And when it goes to the gear connecting thing to try to connect it crashes.",
        "Can you guys pls fix the game because when I started to play then while its loading THE GAME GOT CRASH! The oldest version work for me but this version it didn't work. Thx to read this.",
        "It's a great game, it has good graphics and awesome cars. But one thing that I don't get after I have downloaded it why do I still need to purchase it.... really that's not cool....if people found out about this they may end up uninstalling the app....if only you could give it to me for free."

        "It s a good game , by a good company,many options (that many options that I have not tried each and every one!) But I have rated it 3 stars as:- no 1:- there comes an ad after each and every nail you design , sometimes even after every step you do! Due to that one star Gone and no 2 :-When you are making designs on the nail , you cannot make strips , hearts , umbrellas and stiff you can design with shiny nail polish , I wish we could do that also and now because of these two things , two WHOLE stars gone , only three stars left.",
        "Buyer beware, I purchased the \"unlock all manicures\" option less than a year ago, not only to unlock options but also to remove Ads for my kids. It's less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed.",
        "I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn't get me board everytime i have different desins to do.",
        "A really nice game which also got me hooked up! Nevertheles, it frequently and automatically shuts down, deleting what was there.....this really broke my litlle sister's heart, even mine. For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....",
        "Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!",
        "I  am finally at the final last level! Before I thought it was boring but after I reached some levels farther I thought it was awesome! And it is the best game ever! YEAH!!!!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💙💙💚💚💛💛💜💜💗💗❤❤ AND when I was playing my 1st game all things were opened but when I played in my small sister's tab all, things were closed! I got everything for free!!

I probably would have continued to play but the sheer number of advertisements and some coding logic that makes it annoying after every game to wait for the ad to go and to even after selecting the Google account, it keeps asking for that... It's become annoying beyond the point for me to continue. Otherwise, great game.",
        "Really good and fun game, but there is a major bug, with what you can play for ever: You can just close the game if you miss (as long as balls are still rolling) and when the game is restarted, you get a new chance. Ever and ever again ..",

        "I enjoy star stable horses, it's an enjoyable game. However I have two suggestions.   Firstly, the first horse a player transfers over to their account should be either free or cheaper because, not every player is a star rider and not everyone has as many star coins as a star rider player. So I believe this would make non-star rider players find star stable horses enjoyable and more satisfying once they've reached level 10 and transferred a horse to their star stable online account.  Secondly, there could be a star coins daily spinner. This of course should not be accessible to star riders and only available to non-star riders who do not have the money to buy star rider or star coins. The daily spinner could increase the star coins amount maybe 5% a day possibly till a certain day, for example day 10, and if the player misses a day, the spinner will reset to day 1.   Overall, I love this game, it is fun and the horse's graphics are amazing. The tasks are quite easy to do and not too complicated for younger players. I look foward to future horse and updates with star stable horses.",
        "I love how you let  us get 2 horses, but we should be able to keep the horses without signing in for star stable online. Also, why do we have to wait 24 hours 2 train our horses. But any way it is a GREAT  game!🐎🏇🏇👍👍👍👏",
        "I'm giving up!!. Can't get through most of the training tasks. They don't help or update. Boring as hell. You do the same thing over and over again. Horse is pretty, but the game's not worth playing."

There should be a storyline with this game like a real superhero(and not someone who helps bad guys too)something I found awkward.   2.The area is descent but please add the underground train terminal with some action there too. It will just take the area to a whole new level   3.There are no days and night. No whether change, nothing.   4. Add more fighting style for the protagonist.   5. Please add more buildings and the climbing up is lethargic.   Else it is a great 100 mb game. Keep it up!!!!!! 😎 😎 😎",

        "Honestly, I love the game, but the only problem is the AI on the figure 8.. as soon as they hit you, if they do, they will just keep on pushing, even if you slam on the brakes. And on the racing side, idk if it's a glitch, or a feature, but I will hold the accelerator and I would lose a lot of speed in the corner (that happens irl I get it) but when I hit the straight, sometimes It'll seem like I have 400hp and then others, it'll seem like I have 4..."

        "I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance",
        "I LOVE THIS GAME This is good game design. It rewards you no matter how high you go with a beautiful little tower. The colors are really satisfying. It keeps me engaged since you can \"regrow\" your blocks. That creates tension too--something to strive for. It's so simple but soothing and really addictive!!",
        "A Great Game For When You're Dumpin'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I'm in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren't too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I'm happy to say that. I don't like to stay too long. Great game!",
        "So,  basically it's a pretty fun app to play when you're bored. It's a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It's a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don't really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!",
        "Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn't have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic.",
        "Good, with a major flaw I've ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I'll tap, and the game won't register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I'm on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I've closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It's an issue I'd like to see fixed."

        "Very addictive. I'm a big fan of both your games &lt;3! Awesome graphics, awesome set up, everything g is awesome! I can say some resources are hard to get tho esp a well. But other then that its pretty cool! I've just started so I've notgonna do a whole lot yet. Went to a yellow area once but man so not ready for that.. Also seems like I can't never keep stuff to heal me or even find it? Keep up the good work!!",
        "Solid game, definitely becoming one of my favorites. Only thing I have an issue with, when we die, respawn us back in the zone we died at, for a chance at claiming our body. Also, a friend system outside of a guild would be great. Chat and trade would make encounters with other players more entertaining. Last thing, classes would complete the game. And don't just do three classes if implemented, do 5 or so. But A+ to the devs for a wonderful game!",
        "Great game, restrictive on recipes, needs to improve learning them better. Durability can improve with repair proficiency. Lower proficiency lower durability,  houses could have durability consistent to material. Stronger longer lasting. Anything and everything on enemies gatherable would be awesome, i.e clothes off walkers armor off knights. Environment growth above dungeons could be progressable. Never completed dungeon no growth completed many times a knight.  Fishing would be nice. Hire vendor would be great in player compound. Upgradable structures is cool. Learning them.",
        "I love this game, very addictive and fun. Few things i would like to see change. When you die you can not always find your body to retrieve your things or get to them due to monster. I uninstalled the sister game because if thia as it become impossible to progress when you loose all your best stuff. Also should include the add option to make energy easy to get.",
        "this game is very cool but seriously you really have to spend money to enjoy it fully.The energy system is garbage and walking from place to place is tooo long... seriously 24 MINUTES,also inventory space is insanely limited and it wants you to spend money for more slots. I understand you have to do this in a free game but please don't make the game unplayable becouse of that. I still hope this game will be better in the future becouse i enjoy my time playing it",
        "I am picky. This game grabbed me and hasn't let go! I willingly bought in-app on day three, and I LOATHE micro transactions with the white hot intensity of a thousand suns.  The ethos of the game is perfect, dark, eery, and forboading.   Love the crafting and foraging. Love the RISK inherent in death. Eau to play, hard to master. Perfect.  The only improvement I can see is to have the world be larger, the storyline more full, and add character modification. In effect, just make more of what is already amazing."

        "I reckon this game is so good! I reckon it needs a test mode track so when you finish fixing the car fully to 100% you can test it. And probably alot more cars to fix, and also instead of having just one place where there are garages. You can go all over the world to different type of country's where there are different cars like Australia has commodores, Japan of skyline etc. Love this game so much ❤ hope you take this into exception",
        "Overall the game is exactly what you think it would be, a mobile version of car mechanic simulator 2018. That being said the rotate and zoom features of the camera can be a little irritating at times. It's also very hard to make money to get to your 4th level of tools when you can't completely repair the majority of cars that you get. It can be a little frustrating to purchase a car only to realize that you cannot completely restore it.",
        "Great game and efforts of game generating team are appreciated. I wld suggest to add few things like  tires wheel rims tinted glass at extra cost and if used will pay more while selling. Also sometimes when we buy car from barn in some cases few parts could be made missing so that player wld need to search and then purchase new to add more fun. After u get all tools and all cards then it is boaring....",
        "Trying to find a support link?? I have all tools yet wont give me a bonus.... Love the game. Camera can be a pain sometimes but you learn where to and where not to touch parts. Also why not have buyers or clients stop in... Finishing a car 100% and only making 2k after putting wok into the car Then 10k into parts... I would fire the guy selling cars... Just my two cents.",
        "For the developers: this game is broken. I play on tablet Galaxi tab A   Start the game Remove battery Buy new battery Install new battery Cant tap the sell option Game freeze Nothing work Retart the game 5 times always the same",
        "Nothing like the older apps like this. Camera control is hard, going from warehouse to parts catalogue constantly to remember bad parts to replace is a pain, then an add plays further impairing your memory. Disassembly  got way less interactive and so far I can't repair parts, just  purchase from a catalog."

Longest level I've played is maybe 15 seconds. I have beat the first two sets of 50 levels within about 10 to 15 minutes. I'm curious, you know how there are game runners who beat games in a record time? Is there some kind of game Runner tournament or any challenges for this game? I am beat this game completely in arecord time. Thank you developer for making the best game ever. This game can actually bring out the genius in anyone. Btw, I haven't used any hints also, I'm impressing myself... Yay!!!😎😎😎",
        "\"contains ads\" is an understatement! unless you plan on paying, dont bother.  you play a stage for 5 to 10 seconds and get an ad after EVERY SINGLE STAGE! AND THE ADS USE DATA.  videos. long ones. spammy. uninstalled.    i would have maybe paid if the game did not turn me off so quickly with their ridiculous amount of ads that made me annoyed instead. so i uninstalled instead of getting far in, and rewarding dev with $$$.",
        "Dumbest game ever! A silly trick is enough to complete 20 stages in 5 mins. Trick -&gt; Just extend the start point to the direction which you cant cover by a whole traversal! Oh forgot to tell you, out of that 5 mins, 2-3 minute is just ads!",

        "Very fun game. Multiplayer is awsome! Please add private matches so i can play with friends.   Physics still need work to hold up to real world standard. Rocks dont follow thru on take outs in real life as they do in this game. Also (rules), a rock needs to make it all the way over the hogline in order to stay in play.  Thank you for making this game!",
        "Best curling game I've seen Enjoy the graphics, controls, love the 1 on 1 against international players and career game options. Seems consistent and easy to learn. Needs a few tweaks like... throws that don't make hog line or touch hogline must be taken out of play. Have seen the bug that others reported, sometimes rock after thrown disappears , some kind of glitch that happens occasionally.  Sometimes the sweepers don't react to my movement to sweep. Would love to see 8 stones instead of 6. If you love curling, this should satisfy",
        "Great game except for hackers. There is a hack that allows some to bump or change finish of a throw. Yoy can go from having 2 scoring to opponent having the score, changing after the rocks stopped. Developers have not replied ti report. Fine for some fun but don't waste your money in upgrades",
        "Good fun. Physics seem good, sometimes my sweepers don't sweep at all but I don't think that makes too much difference. I'd like to play alternate ends rather than winner goes first and the rocks don't spin which would add a bit of something to the graphics. I've yet to play online, just practicing against the CPU.",
        "Decent. The game is close to curling. Issues are that the only real way to earn coins it to play online mode. If you do career mode you actually have to SPEND coins to play, and there's no payout for winning. The rocks don't behave like real curling stones, but it's the best curling game you'll find on your phone.",
        "Physics are not like real curling, rocks are dead in the house when hit, physically impossible doubles and triples, improper use of the free guard zone rules (if a rock is in the house, it is free to be removed...not in this game).  Connecting people across the globe is a cool idea but you frequently lose people and you win without finishing a game.  I've played for 35 years so I speak from experience."

        "This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!",
        "Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don't like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option",
        "Great game, I totally love it. I don't mind the ad but I get annoyed of too many questions of Selena Gomez/Taylor Swift/Beyonce/Ariana Grande etc top hits. How about the legends..like David Bowie, Prince, Foo fighters, Guns n roses, Smashing pumpkins.. other than that, u all admins really rock!!  Edit: So I finally get questions like hits by David Bowie, Oasis..so cool. Well done fight list!! And they do consider our suggested answers!!❤❤❤",
        "Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it's good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can't take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren't recognised either. I'd enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.",

        "Update:  now the game won't let me start a new game.   Original post: Buggy to say the least. Paid to remove ads since it was only .99. And now the game randomly quits, and erases any games I've started when I exit from the game for any period of time. Was find until I removed the ads. Great way to treat the people paying your bills."

        "Spin my ride No more speed, I'm almost there! Gotta keep cool, now gotta take care. Last car to pass, here I go! As the line of cars are going so slow! 5 star rad! Gotta get back to the game, all. See ya....Speed thrills!",
        "Can one also be able yo take turns??  I dont like it straight all the way to nowere. And brake should be fully efective one should STOP anytime he wants and also dont sale cars it should just be affordable by coins  Its really a gr8 game but only a little more work.",
        "The game itself is very fun to play and very entertaining, however, the points system is a bit off. The reason for that is it not about the distant (which I like about) it about how many overtake you can take in a single game. That is what I dislike about this game. Also the cars... Not a lot of cars (need more). Few questions: Will there be such thing as upgrade speed or car customization? Will there be special event like special map that the highest rank get some kind of reward? And lastly will there be a competition of ranking ?  If all the that happening in the future this game definitely deserved 5 stars .",
        "Basic. You have to over take cars... That's it. When they talk about the physics being like simulation they are lieing. Left right go stop. Poor 16bit sound that you will want to turn off. It's like a game from the 80s. Uninstall.",
        "The game is very good but I really wish if the score is for the overtakes as well as the high speed that will be a lot better. Also, I wish if there were more cars. That would be really interesting. Actually it needs a lot of work because it's very boring",
        "Hey, this game is just so good, just make few improvements like, try to create bends in your highway and add more cars, a little road features like tunnels, two way traffic feature. This way you will have killed me. gameplay is so nice anyway."

        "This game was absolutely perfect and was very much enjoyable, but now to unlock the full experience you have to pay. One of the reasons I enjoy this game and recommended it to my friends is because it is one of the only games that isn't locked behind a paywall. Overall, I have had countless hours playing this game, and trying to land on everything and return successfully. Instead of the microtransaction, why not institute a merit-based system for unlocking parts?",
        "Very great!  Here are a few suggestion from me to make your game more enjoyable :)  1. Can you please make the earth scale correctly because its diameter is around 12.000 km and moon orbit is around 380.000 km  2. Please make a smaller powerful engine like the 9 engines of the falcon 9  3. Please make a button that is simple to cycle from another rocket to another one to ease the attempt of landing a booster  4. Please add an ocean on the earth for some splashdown  5. The last one. Im a free 2 play player and i cant enjoy a majority of the new update :*(",
        "This game is awsome. Loads of fun. Told my friends about it. Could you add a free sandbox mode and more free parts. Thanks. Keep up the good work. Shouldn't have added micro transactions. It just ruined the game for me. Had to take it from a 5 star to a 3 star. Please bear this comment in mind for future updates. This game was 100% free when i downloaded it in december last year. Since then, you added a new build system, free parts which make the game absolutely amazing, and then you add pay for parts. Thats just buzzkill.",
        "Very fast and simple rocket building and great graphics. I wish there was a sandbox mode with infinite fuel. Also there is no indication for loading screens when you hit the launch button. Somethimes you think you tapped the button and end up sitting there for a minute or two wasting time.  Edit So glad they made a small payment option. Well worth the money and glad to support",
        "Great!  Only thing I miss is the ability to rendezvous and dock with another object.  In a moon landing, you could leave a stage in lunar orbit and pick it up for the outbound burn.  Also, karman line should be 100 km??  Edit:. Great updates.  I have no idea how to use docking to reattach parts that have been undocked though.",
        "Can you please add option to center the map on the rocket/vehicle when being in the map mode? It is difficult to switch between near objects in the current version, since I assume the map is stationary relative to the body in which influence sphere we're in at that moment. Also, a \"docking guide\" would be cool in some future update"

Really fun to play, this is the longest time I've ever played such a game in my phone. Absolutely love it!",
        "this game is good till about 8 hours in where your waiting days to build anything. Gems are really hard to come by so you have to be wary about how much stock u have. And there's no way to dispose of unwanted items in your warehouse (that I know of) but yeah, it's a catchy game",
        "Pretty much a money pit. It's designed to frustrate you into spending money. Everything takes stupid amounts of resources to build or expand. The expansions are tiny. It becomes impossible to fill orders because they all want items you can't make because you cant build anything. Caravans usually ask for ridiculous amount of things and you have no storage room. Everything takes too long to make or regrow so even if you have room, the caravan times out. And the rewards for filling them is measly. It'll still take weeks to get enough to defeat monsters that block expansions. Don't download if youre looking for a fun game.",
        "I liked this game, and have played it for months, until a few days ago when I noticed the \"price\" of buildings required to progress take a huge jump up!! I will gladly support a game I like by making purchases but I'm not about to spend my house payment just to progress IN A GAME!! Not cool, and makes me regret the money Ive spent so far. On to the next!!",
        "Question why do I have to give 30 diamonds for one shield? And Everytime I expand my barn it on expand from 5-10 I need more room then that over then that.. I wake up out my sleep just to play this game. I need more space please and Thank u.",

        "Awesome game! Only issue is on season 7. Race with save 8 seconds on perfect drift.... it says 3 laps but one lap doesn't count so you have to do 4 laps and you can never save 8 seconds. When crossing finish line game keeps playing and doesn't finish, time runs out and you've lost. Please fix",
        "The car will control itself... If you hold left it will turn left for a period but will start to try and straighten up... To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed",
        "Awesome Game... no need to spend money to get best cards you can easily earn them... Can play offline too... There is a glitch though in season 7 - save 8 second stage... even after finishing it wont give 3 stars and fails me.",
        "Good game, really fun. On season 7 the 6th drift game you cant pass it. When you cross the finish line it says wrong way and doesnt let you finish the gane to get the last star. You end up doing 4 laps, even with 20 secnonds still on the clock. Please fix the issue so I can complete the season",
        "Kinda hate the drift feature, like the car just auto drifts in the direction u turn. This gets annoying too since u can't turn normally when needed and the car just starts drifting, making u hit more obstacles. Graphics are good, my phone can handle the very high settings so I haven't played on the lower settings.",
        "Love the game. However, after finishing the race, an ad pops up and after closing it, the screen is all black and it stays that way. It happened to me a number of times. The stage is complete but I didn't get any of the cash rewards or the cards. Please fix this or at least give me the rewards I didn't get. Will give it a 5 stars then."

        "Purchased the full unlock for $7.99 and every time my daughter gets to the pinkie pie level at the crystal empire it freezes up at the same spot and she can't finish the game I want my money back.  Additionally, the purchase is supposed to remove ads yet once you exit a level an ad pops up again.",

        "Video adverts fill the screen every 5 second, and attempts to close them take you directly to the play store. Closing the play store then loads a demo of the advertised game. Then closing this reloads the my little pony game from the beginning so you lose all progress anyway. Totally unplayable and not acceptable to give to children, Budge should be asahmed of themselves! Disgraceful.",

I wish therr was a way to go back and do the tutorial again and I accidently pressed during the first one and missed how to land. Lots of trial and error on that one. Also would be nice to know how the scoring exactly works.",
        "It's getting frustrating.. I'm into level 14, have up graded skills and equipment but yet still can't manage to get a bronz let alone a silver or gold in the very first jump in the game. Along with finishing a constant 16th about 95% of the time make me think it's rigged. What's up with that??",
        "Fantastic concept and artwork and potentially amazing game ruined by a half arsed tutorial and lack of information, pure laziness.  The fun of the game turns to frustration as you get good distance and terrible scores, but why? You assume landings but the game gives you no information on correct technique. Also same for takeoff and mid air lift.   Come on devs its lazy and ruining a game with huge potential. Uninstalled...",
        "By level 4 no matter what score i get the bots always get about 15 higher. 1 game i would get 130 and the bots would get 145. Then when i get 160 they still get 175 showing this is rigged. That makes it so annoying with a lack of help from the developers make it annoying otherwise would b 5 stars if these issues were fixed",
        "The game has a great Idea to it, but it really needs so tweaking in the physics deparment of the game, on certain Stages I go further with a Bad Jump then a Excellent one, and the wind doesnt really play that much of an effect in the game. But overall great and fun game, amd very addictive.",
        "This game is actually very good, I play a lot of mobile games as its normally all I have time for and this is challenging and fun, the career mode is good and also like the upgrades..  I will definitely be keeping this one on my phone for a while because it is a really cool game. If you don't like ads then click you back button to get rid of it from time wasting or spend the buck to lose them forever.. Well done on a cool game, make some more like it!!"

        "Amazing game!! I have purchased 1 or 2 bikes already, I would even pay to get new bikes, but it is very expensive. Please consider lowering to prices or making better bikes more accessible. Ive been stuck on the same level for 5 weeks. I want to continue playing but im loosing intrest not being able to advance. Maybe you could trade your old bikes in to get something in return for a newer bike. Im sure you will never read this, but you do have something special here! Thanks",
        "Very fun BMX pump game. Seen a few reviews say it's gets impossible after level 3 when it becomes pay to win. I don't agree I've just reached level 8 in a few hours. If you ride bikes off road and understand how to pump you'll love it",
        "Its way to hard to win and and the stats do nothing.  You have to be perfect and even then they fly by.  Still LOVE this game.  Just takes away the fun when you get left in the dust and you play the same lvl a million times hoping maybe one time you will be perfect.",
        "I loved this game for 3 days. Then it got to the point where I couldn't beat a level without upgrading my bike, but I couldn't upgrade my bike without spending real money. So disappointing. Don't waste your time if you don't want to spend real money!",
        "The game is fun up until around the third level. After that it becomes near impossible to win any races without spending actual money to upgrade your bike. Had a lot of fun with it up until that point, but it's definitely not worth spending actual money on. Deleted the game after pay to win clearly became a necessity.",
        "It was fun for a while - until it becomes impossible to beat any opponents with your current bike. The difficulty spikes around level 7 and the process of buying a new bike or upgrading your existing one becomes very frustrating, as you can't win any races to earn any money."

        "Since it turns off when the app isn't open its useless. If I have to find my phone to turn the app on to whistle and find my phone it seems like a waste of time lol.",
        "I downloaded this yesterday and I love it. Me and my sister love to play find the phone but I turnt the application off (thinking that it would work in the background and you wouldn't have to keep turning it off) and put down my phone and my sister came in and scared me and I knocked my phone off its stand and lost it (exactly what this application is trying to prevent). I did manage to find it in the end but it took a while. This is an amazing app and would definitely recommend it but it would be ideal If it worked In the back ground and you wouldn't have to keep turning the system on and off but otherwise app great app :)",
        "It doesn't work unless you have the volume on I'd like to make it so you guys could actually turn the volume on and off also my voice dictation doesn't work unless the app is off very great concept",
        "It is a very good app and I would recommend it, it had helped me find my phone before and I am pretty sure it will do it again.",
        "This app is pretty great but for some reason, when I try to increase the volume and I say yes to viewing the ad, nothing happens so I can't really fix the volume to my liking."

        "There is an abusive player on battlefield 62 and the developers have not been very responsive.  If you want to play a game where a player repeatedly tells others to kill themselves, douse themselves in gasoline, threatens people, makes sexual assault jokes and literally tells players with cancer he hopes they lose their battle and just harrasses players to make them quit and even says that is what he is doing then this is the game for you.  Edit:The developers reply shows another issue with the game.  If they read the part where I said the developers have not been very responsive they would realize I did contact GM support about this issue.  They just have not done anything.  Nothing has been done even though multiple players have contacted them.  This is why they have 1 star review.",
        "Was really looking forward to playing this game and it does have potential, but it's so frustrating with bugs that makes it so disappointing. Sort the bugs out and you'd have a great game.",
        "It's a good game overall. The in game support is minimal to non existent. Your better off asking players for support. Its a good team building game. Like every other game like this it's pay to win but with strategy and a good team you can still have fun. Again it's a good game. I just hope they sell to a smarter company with better skills in game development and customer service (because without customers, you don't have a game) and then this would be an even better game. Give it a shot just get a good active team and don't expect help from customer service. Be careful buying packs and if you do screenshot EVERYTHING. Hope this helps",
        "If army men strike stuck to there rules, and didn't allow people making death threats, abusive language, to play, it would be better, I would not let anyone under 21 play this game as the explicit content in chat would lead to children learning much foul language and receiving death and rape threats.  Ask anyone in bf 62",
        "So many glitches to what could be a great game....slow on fixes....no lvl buffer so watch out for maxed out players who love hitting low players...be sure not to come to bf74 as it has been held hostage by a single player called Welpia and his corps ROK.....YOU WILL BE MISERABLE.....numerous unanswered complaints to customer support by numerous players....numerous players. May rage quit on this bf....attempts to get cs to act have failed....other wise a great game with great potential so long as you dont get stuck in a bf with one who calls himself Welpia or any corsps. Named ROK or Kor",

And it's like being in pre school you can get banned for saying a bad word 🤣 i wouldnt waste my money or time on this game"

Developers of this game, you must fix the caracteristics of different characters in this game. Literaly all have similar characteristic +1 and +5 etc. And what is the point to collect other characters? For example \"Zero\" character to have +8 bullet pircing and +12 reload, and other characters to have +2, +6, +9, +13, +18... also for weapon is the same thing... make all caracteristics different. You can reword weapon for rank, rank 5 win something, rank 10, 15, 20...",

        "This game is actually okay for a mobile app. The downside unfortunately - as with so many - is that there is never quite enough of anything to progress without spending a considerable amount of money. I invested a lot of time on the zombie event only to find that time was running out and I would not be able to complete it without stumping up a relative fortune. I would have bought this game but refuse to pay to play and watch a ton of advertising in the hopes of getting the gold or tickets or cash or whatever. For what you might pay for stuff like this go and buy a console game. Heck you could buy the console as well on what uou could save avoiding this. Deleting it right niw. Adios greedy developers",
        "This game is a lot of fun, really addictive and completely free to play. Of course you can buy stuff if you want, but it's not necessary.   Multiple game modes, a ton of upgrades.   This is a good one."

        "The only problem I have with this game is that, if you have brought everything out of each of your stores and still have coins available WHY CAN'T WE USE OUR LEFT OVER COINS AND BUYS SPOONS? Cause you can't do nothing with left over coins in each state. Other than that, it keeps me ready for any challenge.",
        "I absolutely loved it compared to the other games because it's absolutely free with literally thousands of levels and different menus (so you don't get bored)... It's a great balanced of easy and challenging (but still achieveable without spending a single cent)... My only complaint is that every now and then it hangs (but that's quite rare)... Great job!",
        "The game is fun when it works. Every time I unlock a new restaurant or a new region or bonus level or ANYTHING it won't download. I get a \"connection error\", and the only way to get past it is to delete the game, re-download EVERYTHING (which clocks in at over 100mb) and try again. Update 3/15: I emailed the devs over a month ago and have yet to get even an automated response.",
        "After all changes in Dublin its n impossible to win levels without purchasing spoons and boosts. It was a great game but it slowly got ruined by the greedy developres i guess. Well..guess what! I am not spending a dime on it and I will just stop play it.",
        "This game is fun, but it would be much better if they make it so that you can watch video ads so that you can get more spoons, boots, and lives. You can only watch a video once or twice for a life. I definitely won't spend my actual money to play this game. It's not a home counsel game.  Also, this game gets difficult quickly. I'm in the Paris level and barely making it through. I like to play this game for fun and to pass time. But the difficulty increases makes it not as fun.",
        "I love this game but the fact that you can't use coins to buy spoons really annoys me. I wish they at least had an option to convert coins to different currency so that you can buy stuff in the next locations. What are you meant to do with your coins after you've finished the city?? It's such a waste."

        "Fabulous game! I absolutely flew past all the episodes and the online save feature works fantastically well. I successfully recovered gameplay from about 6 months ago. I got back my progress and all my gold. One of the best games out there :)",
        "Definitely a relieving break from the onslaught of talking Tom spin offs.. This game here is the most redneck tower defense kind of game you could get, and I love that. It's a standard shooting tower defense game, but with variety in enemies and even multiplayer! Who woulda thought?",
        "IT can be scary because it fell like you go lose but then it fell. Better because you won i JUST GOT THIS GAME 🎮  2min ago and am on leavel 5 GANG GANG AM A GIRL",
        "Fun best game, easy to play and all i can say is fun as hell. I guess i could be more fun if you add some gore effect or blood splat. Super fun if you can see the bullets hit them.",
        "I've loved this game for such a longtime!!  I always make sure I download game whenever I upgrade to a new phone...it doesn't bother me to start all over bcuz I could play this game from beginning to end everyday!!  Game actually allows u to start where u left off but many times I choose to start from beginning..i wonder if there's ever going to be a sequel to swamp attack...swamp attack 2, swamps revenge??  Lol...i HOPE SO!!!"

        "Hasn't even been 10 seconds into the game before it shut down 🤣 - I thought it would be different for me as I have the S8+. Obviously NOT. The game started off very well and easy to navigate. Ease of controls. I will uninstall as there isn't much point keeping this game when it has already failed itself.",
        "Let's be honest here. The concept was very creative and unique, but the game was very poorly designed. The slide is not smooth and   feels very unstable, I wasn't able to enjoy playing the game. The graphics are very low and the game itself is slow. Apart from that the idea was very well thought of but I feel you should have added more time and professionalism into the whole design, the game has potential.",
        "One thing I find annoying is the adds! The game itself is addicting, but every time you die you have to sit through these long adds. I guess you could pay for the game without adds, but if your like me and you don't really like spending money at the app store, patience my friend... the game is worth it...",
        "I really like this app but the the amount of ads are crazy! Wayyy too many. On a good note, the personalisation. I really like the different range of balls and the night time vortex, where everything stands out, and is all black. The trails are really neat too! Although the ball is quite sensitive when dodging around the obstacles. It is still great! I got a score of 104 on my second go! I'd definitely recommend this app! Also i have the samsung galaxy s4 so you can definitely 8nstall this if you have the same phone as me!😊",
        "It is shuting down again and again, in starting that  heppen after 2-3 min then under 1 min and now I open and it shut down in few seconds. For my Moto x play runing 7.1.1  Love concept and game environment.  Control is fine.  Graphic are good.",
        "It's hard to control and there are WAY too many ads. It lags so I'll be doing fine but it'll make me crash because it paused for a brief moment. If all this was improved, I'd love it. I love the concept of the game but everything else sucks."

On tablet i am loged in with a google paly account, when i login to same account on my phone it doesnt ask me to download other chapters and i dont have any items or achivements. Is there any way to fix it or to make it work? PS: Its a realy good game, its my style. In MY OPINNION its batter than Shadow fight 3.",

Such a wonderful game it is. Even if the meter hangs to impossible I can beat the competitors. Very nice game used to play it often. At lesiure time I think spending\u200b in it is the best. As you can earn  daimonds  by just watching the ads.",
        "I love this game. I've never been good at fighting games like Tekken or soul Calibur but this game is a very simple take on the genre. I love how very martial arts based this game is and the hit boxes on the characters are quite accurate and simple to understand as well as the moves. Being a martial artsist my self this game has given me an outlet to mentally practice distance management, fake outs and strategy as well as practicing to be like water. The famous Bruce Lee saying. Love this game. Also the rank up system and the grinding isn't too over bearing or tedious and makes it fun through and through.",
        "Great game, my only problem is that it took a long time grinding for the money you need to buy items. It took me about 5 hours of grinding just to upgrade each weapon/armor, 6 hours to buy new ones. Still a great game, loved the way it's in shadows, making it harder to tell who you are.",
        "Game is awesome. But for past 2 days whenever i open the game, it closes after intro showing that unfortunately SF 2 has stopped. Pls do something as i dont want to uninstall it. Also I hv sent feedbacks 2 to 3 times but no reply or fixation. Do something about it.",
        "I have been playing this game for over 3years now and I know how far I have gone with the game... Just lost my phone and I got a new one and... Google Play can't restore Me to my previous level.. Please fix because I can't just start playing the game over from the beginning.. Thanks"

        "I really enjoy this game, but I have found a flaw in the design. The game speeds up as you go and after a point it doesn't go faster, but after around 10,000 you notice the ball start to move forward on the screen and after about 20,000 you don't even have to move the ball to not die. It just misses the spikes. I know you might be thinking Its not on the leaderboards, but that's my next complaint. Im currently 6 on the leaderboards, but I've gotten a better score and it won't update. I quite frankly destroyed that score and it doesn't show up. Thank you for your time and I hope this helped",
        "Game is great, far too many ads, after each level AND major issues with the videos giving rewards. I watched 4 and only received 1 reward which makes the game unfair and not worth playing.",
        "I HATE the vibration when u die I almost uninstalled the app bcuz of that. I also have a problem with pop up ads. I really like the game though",
        "Fun game, but occasionally an ad will pop up while I'm playing, causing me to mess up and die. I was having a really great run when an ad popped up. Not cool.",
        "Theres random ads in the middle of playing and you cant move for like 1 sec and you die to a spike.",
        "I think this game is very addictive. To all the people that say u have to many adds well i dont i can actually play the game without getting interrupted"

    "description" : "يعتبر محمد صالح بلطي – المولود يوم 10 أفريل 1980 – من أعمدة موسيقى الراب في تونس، ولكن هذه الشهرة لم تات من فراغ. فمن العاصمة وتحديدا سيدي حسين بدأ بلطي الراب منذ المراهقة لتستمر التجربة مع كل منSton, Kanide, M2O, Tshibo . كانت مجموعة أولاد بلاد من أول مجموعات الراب في تونس والتي بدأت مسيرتها سنة 1997 بمجموعة من الأغاني التي كانت بمثابة مرآة عاكسة لليومي الذي يقضي على طموحات واحلام الشباب كما نلاحظ شجاعة في طرح المشاكل الاجتماعية دون خوف من الرقابة البوليسية في تلك الفترة.تفرق أفراد هذه المجموعة وأصبح بلطي ينتج أغانيه منفردا، كما أن سنة 2002 تعد الانطلاقة الحقيقية لهذا الرابور الذي فرض الراب على الساحة الفنية◄ إذا أحببتم التطبيق لا تنسوا دعمنا بالتصويت ب 5 ***** نجوم .بالطي ياليليبلطي ياليليYa Lili baltibalti Ya Liliياليليyalililalilli7amoudaBalti - Ya Lili Feat HamoudaYa Lili | ياليليجديد بلطيبلطي ياليلي - Balti - Ya LiliBalti بلطي – Hala Mala حالا مالاأغاني بالطي أغاني بلطي رابbalti 2018balti 2017balti maztoulabalti mister youbalti wala lalabalti yatimاغاني بالتي أغاني بلطيأغاني بلطي 2018أغاني بلطي 2017اغاني بلطي mp3جميع اغاني بلطيجميع اغاني بلطي mp3اغاني بلطي حزينةاغاني بلطي مسكينةبلطي مظلوماغاني بلطي ومستريوبلطي يتيمراب بلطيشافوني زواليأغاني راب 2018أغاني راب حزينأغاني راب حزينةراب سودانيراب سوريراب عربيراب ليبيراب مسلمراب مغربيراب مصرىراب كلاشراب جزائري",

        "Great tool for learning logic concepts! I look through games/apps like this occasionally, but only to help advise people on what will help get them started. I code for a living, primarily focusing on python, java, c++, and bash. I highly recommend starting here. Beyond the suggested sites, I would recommend Codecademy and/or Sololearn for learning to code outside a classroom.",
        "I personally like the game. All levels are possible which some people say otherwise. I wish there were many more levels as I did them all within an hour... Or maybe that's the point? Anyway, it doesn't teach you code in the slightest but it does teach you the concept of functions and loops. Mind you, the loops in the game are all infinite. You wouldn't want to do infinite loops in the real world."

I will not start over.i enjoyed the game played it for years. 700+ days played without interruption.",

During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don't want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn't want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.",
        "Maybe the reason people think its boring. It's probably because they are boring and lame. I beat the first level without a problem, they didn't because they feel like everything should be easy and they shouldn't have to work hard for anything. The game is challenging and fun if you like a challenge. If your a lame, whinny, expect nothing to be hard, and can't handle a challenge as tough as making toast, then this game isn't for you.",
        "These other reviewers are jerks! Lol. The game is awesome! And my 4 year old can even play it well!  I like it so much, I'm downloading it onto my phone (4 yr old plays it on my old phone)  just to see how far I can get lol",

        "This game is stupid because you have to get a part of the key just to get more lives and the bad guys are technically cheating because they have guns I made it to the last level and it was impossible to beat the boss because he puts fire everywhere on the second level the guy keeps shooting you so it took me an hour to get off that stupid level  it took me about five days to get of the last level but I suggest that you just play the first level. This was a ripoff it doesn't make sense to wait that long for a stupid freaking game I'm to cool for that dumb game. Another thing that is stupid about the game is the remote controls its confusing because they all look the same they should put the names of what that control does in the buttons. And the thing builds the stuff for you at a scale of 1 to 10 I pick 1  I rather play with realistic legos than the iPad ones don't waste your time on waiting for the game to download  its a ripoff",

His best friend in the whole world is Shaggy, and you can usually find the two of them running away from a monster or snacking on double-decker sandwiches in the back of the Mystery Machine.<br><br>For app support contact LEGO Consumer Service. <br>For contact details refer to http://service.lego.com/contactus <br><br>Our privacy policy and terms of use for apps are accepted if you download this app. <br><br>Read more on http://aboutus.lego.com/legal-notice/Privacy-Policy and http://aboutus.lego.com/legal-notice/terms-of-use-for-apps <br><br>LEGO, the LEGO logo, and the Minifigure, are trademarks and/or copyrights of the LEGO Group.<br>&#xA9;2015 The LEGO Group.

        "It has a problem, on the map it shows a guy with a hat, but when I go there it is just a building with no one there And I can't get any new missions.i have only completed about 4 missions so they can't be finished. Please fix this.but great game",
        "Great game but more like a sandbox game. The way you are looking will go off in random directions. Few glitches. Wish the sniper rifle had a scope. Wish there was different shooting mechanics. A little lag and too many damn ads there is even an ad for no ads.",
        "Great game, but it's annoying how you have limited ammo, I mean yeah! It's realistic, but Ammo is also expensive, and I hate how You can't jack a car because if they're at a red light, and you're trying to jack their car, they may start going, or when you toss them out of the car, they annoy you and sometimes KILL you. So even if you do kill them when they're inside of it, you're doing damage to the car, not to mention you can't even Rob stores like I thought you could. But still. Awesome game!",
        "I hate this stupid game I have just played this game and you know what happend it crashed everybody do not play this one game and the second one of this it is a stupid game i never even got to play it and i still think it is stupid sorry for the words just fix it plz JJJJJUUUUUSSSSSSTTTTTT fiiiiixxxxxx ittttttt if i could put no stars i willllll",
        "I love it! Except, when I blow up a police car while it's parked, it respawns and about 18 police cars are after me! Although, when that happens, I get killed and spawn on top of the tower with the helicopter and when I do, the police car that I blew up is driving around, crashing into walls, blowing up and then going back! I couldn't stop laughing. So... Nothing wrong (except for the load of police after me when I blow up that car), I love it, C ya!",
        "I loved it because you can get into people's car and then get out again then kill them because they are trying to kill you so kill them. and there is a tank and a helicopter in this game and I like it so you could kill people walking and get money or there bullets and wepends. that is why I love this game."

The game takes you a thrilling adventure, and although the object stays the same I find myself never growing bored. The way that each new character changes the level is just awesome. Each character is well thought out and designed amazingly. If you're looking for a game to pull out in a waiting room, or while you're bored - then give this game a shot. You definitely won't regret it.",
        "It's definitely a fun game. But I cannot figure out where the in app purchases are! I looked everywhere within the app and there is absolutely no place where I can find in app purchases!! But play store says that this game supports in app purchases. So I'm very confused! Can someone please help me out here??",
        "Its awesomr and makes the time go by so quickly. The tiniest problem is that the gas is too little, but thats the point of the game!",
        "This game has so much potential... I started playing and immediately enjoyed it, they've got the game mechanics perfect, everything is easy to get into and the core gameplay is pretty fun. But simple. This usually isn't a problem because game designers usually build complexity ont on top of simple mechanics. Not these guys. The vast majority of jumping platforms, which is all this game is, are incredibly easy to do once you get the hang of it. And that's it. The game doesn't progress at all. It never gets harder. There are some trees and eventually a couple black holes to avoid. Like I mean 3 in the first 100 platforms. Then after platform 100 and something they introduce this drum symbol thing that you can bounce off of. Do they design jumps that implement these bouncy things in a fun and exciting way? Nope. You just go around them. I made it to platform 200 before I finally gave up. This is just lazy game developing.",
        "A great game for relaxing and honing your jetpack skills. It becomes a little boring after a while though, seeing as it's primarily the same activity over and over again. Otherwise perfect =]",
        "Such a great, simple, enjoyable game. I love the visual effects, the art team did a great job. Sound design is great too. I agree that the game is easy once you get a hang of it, but so are games like agario or *cough cough* all of ketchapp *cough cough*  Honestly the devs did excellent, even with ad implementation, all around 10/10 game"

        "Perty good Edit: We're in the middle of an event and the game won't load. Finally says down for maintenance. It would be nice to get a heads up on when that happens. Gonna put a hindrance on the event that's over on Friday. Do hope it's resolved soon. Still like the game tho, but would like it better if I can play.",
        "Well a very basic game, as any other idle game. Has no real extra things that would wow you. Notifications less than a minute after closing the app (or simply pressing home) can get very annoying. As if I need a notification to tell me I closed the game.",
        "Right.  First off, If you are not a fan of Idle games, then don't play. This is the epitome of an Idle game.   The Early game is pretty simple. Click, Collect, Make your way to Level 80. You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn't bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn't been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event's are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events'  All in, pretty good.",
        "Well guess they deleted my last post cause I complained that the game took up 1.8 gig till I uninstalled it and reinstalled it then lost my saves because of bad programming.   Don't waste your time or money on this company.",
        "One of the best \"tap\" games. Love the satirical theme. Who would have thought that politics and money were SO interconnected😁. Just to be clear to some, I AM being sarcastic!!!! Great time waster. And that's NOT fake news.",
        "They put so many buttons to purchase things ion the main screen. When tapping as is the nature of the game, it brings up confirmation for your purchases. If you're trying to play fast, you could easily spend $20 in mere seconds without noticing. Put all the purchases in one place instead of cheating players."

        "Nice game, cool graphic and i just loved it.... but you didn't get all the stars from me because it takes forever to start the game, once it is start it works pretty smoothly. So please fix this problem for all the stars.",
        "Game is still good but why are the events impossible? I enjoyed the Bow event because everyone was one the same boat. Now its just a P2W thing. Dont play this id you're not going to pay because its impossible to kill anything.",
        "Can't seem to open the game... It hangs at the loading screen with \"downloading please wait\" the downloading lettering blinks and the game never opens... Previous version was fine with my device.. Plz fix soon... Otherwise i love this game",
        "Not gonna lie love this game and I'm rating it 5 stars but the game would be way better if you could somehow jump. Its still rate 5 stars. I recommended at least trying the game out.",
        "Its nice but theres one problem for me.When i logout and login again the game loading glitches and it wont let me play.Pls cix this glitch but anyway thankyou and its still really fun to play",
        "This game is for people who love to be stuck in time, since this game came out there hasn't been any proper updates except from adding new unnecessary stuffs to the game so kids can waste their money on, the time limit in the game is 4mins for either team battle or free for all; this has been the way thia game has been for years since i started play the game anything new in the game is all about spending more money, what tyoe of developers are you guys? Do you even play the game? It gets more boring every second, the are no proper changes no organization of your weapon and other stuffs in the game... It takes like 2+ minutes to change to another outfit because the list is too long, YOU DEVELOPERS NEED TO FOCUS ON THE GAMEPLAY AND NOT NEW ITEMS... Add in squad battles so it can be more competitive and allow people to be able to see their stats and then players will care more just look at what other games are doing in 2018 and don't get stuck in time...GOODLUCK"

Until i close the app and restart it Tried making a fresh Charecter and goes straight into other characters but just not my main.. This started happening an hour ago",
        "I can't get certain menus to work. In shop its the purchase for mount gear, all i see is random text and it freezes the game. Some of the event menus do the same. Ive been playing for a little over a year and never had this problem. Please help.  Also the merit shop menu is broken. I can't buy anything and the event ends today. Ill update as I see other menus broken.",
        "This game sucks.. I always get thee same armament with only one star!  and some items are soo expensive that the money you pay is not worthy for the br you get and in return you'll get low br and also low money not worthy.. If they make this game less expensive maybe I'll give it a four stars... But no! not this time",
        "Makes you pay good money to be strong then merges you with much older servers that allows a no pay player to be much stronger ... horrible customer service also! Edit 3\\18 I see Gatorcade replied to this saying contact them for help. I did 8 days ago with no reply... So yeah like I said horrible customer service",
        "I paid money on This game only for it to stop working once I did...plunder doesn't open for me, mounts won't open for me...assassins creed play won't open...if I do open them....game immediately freezes and I have to shut down. Funny how I pay money and now I have Chinese characters all over the damn game...  THIS is absolutely a pay to play game...except when you pay...the game apparently stops working....",
        "Hey guys.. So when I try to level up my mount I click on the icon and when it comes up most of it is blank except a few words in another language. It freezes the screen so I have to close out and sign back in. Also I can't get anything on plunder either. Some help would be greatly appreciated, thank you."

Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don't register as pineapple hits for the counters. There's a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it",

The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.",
        "Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.",
        "Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.",
        "BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn't have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What's bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I'm not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game.",
        "How can I say this? I can not stop playing this!! Everytime I set a new and higher record I want to achieve and I only stop until I get there xD atm with 6400 coins and everything unlocked 😁😁 please release new content for months and months!! It will make me so happy! Thank you for this game."

        "Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.",
        "There's always a bug when there's about to be substitution of players causing the players in possession of the ball to run like headless chicken. Pls fix that. Add SULLEY MUNTARI of Deportivo La Coruna to the game pls. 'Need FTS18 with embedded dream league soccer ffs! Seems many players who have their current teams in the game are missing. Lawrence Ati of Sochaux in Ligue 1, Joe Dodoo, and many more. A quick update with massive changes will be great 'cause the game currently sucks!!!",
        "Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don't get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a \"Create a Player\" option under 'My Club' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It'd be so nice if you add that.",
        "Look what I experienced. Dls needs development. The commentry needs more reasonableness and intelligence. The behaviour of each player, at least the famous ones should be unique. Controls need more improvement. Add real team logos for the opponent teams. Update players team data according to the recent transfers. And one more issue, while playing local multiplayer we need an extra device to connect two phones. This is a bad experience. If we can connect with each other simply by connecting wifi and hotspot of the two phones respectively, it would be great and simple.",
        "This game is awesome overall. But some changes could be made like adding German league players (especially AUBAMEYANG though he's moved to England) and when you face them leagues top players( in the game) you could add the legends like Pele, Maradona, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and others. Hoping to see these changes in the next update. Thank You!",
        "I will love it if i can send players on loan and be paid some coins instead of directly selling them off. Also switching players for a few or no coins will be great. Since players like pogba likes changing his hairstyles, it will also be great to effect some changes in some players hairstyle. More leagues are needed, if possible, German,  Chinese, Nigerian and south African league. Lastly, commentators find it difficult to call the name of a created player, work on these and this game will be perfect.  Thanks"

        "Loved this game!!! It is my new favorite game I love all the powerful weapons and armor. I wish there was chestplates instead of amulets and leggings instead of bracelets and an easier way to find out what your hero level, But else then that it was perfect. I loved how you can choose the controls to your own preference. Chame on anyone who gave it a less then 5 Star review. I still dont know ho to tell what your hero level was but still my favorite game.",
        "I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there's only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can't beat them! Keep making more awesome games!",
        "I can't help but love a mobile game that doesn't constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it's tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.",
        "I'm really loving this game it's simple but still a ton of fun. My one complaint would be the sometimes the grind is too long and I almost gave up... I wish the developers would throw in some kind of experience boost in the store instead of just being able to buy coins. I would pay real money for an exp boost and would love to support the Developers! just give me the chance!",
        "I understand that people want their games to be entartaining. But i dont understand why there is a thing that downgrades your item upon trying to upgrade it. I have soent the last 3 hours trying to upgrade my helm to lvl 15. Guess where it is now, On goddamn lvl 11. I have spent less time grinding mounts in wow than getting my gear to lvl 15. Stupidest thing ever. One tip. Play the campagin lvls to lvl 40. Then dont do campagin at all and run hell for gold and xp. Repeqt to lvl 80 and then get rekt by the stupid item upgrade system."

        "03-23-18: HOLY SHEET THE SCI-FI UPDATE IS CRAZY AMAZING! Outerminds has done it again! I wish they made more unique celebrations (like SciFi) other than Christmas or Valentine's in the future, such as Easter or even a Video Game Mashup update. It is time to rewrite my review!  So far, it's my favorite time-waster in my device. Never utilizes the Pay2Win paywalls for the most of the time (It's one of the best non-Pay2Win apps in the era of Pay2Win), and never crashes at all! Bugs aren't frequent! There are easy ways to save Bux and Brains in the game, which gives almost every player the opportunity to customize without any problem.  The game is hugely customizable. It's like being a home designer and a Tuber at the same time. There's lots of different customization options for your room, Tuber, and stuff. I also love to switch to a certain theme during events like SciFi or Valentine's Event.  And next, the videos. You can name your videos whatever you want, and you can select a combination of genres. You could make hilarious titles like \"PewDiePie Plays His Game\" or \"Edgar The Rapper\". And then you can pretend to act them out.  One of the best parts of the game is that there are almost no annoying popup video/banner ads, unlike in most games I've played like Vlogger Go Viral. The only way to view them is to simply go for a free shipping boost by watching an ad (which does not interrupt gameplay. Watching ads is also in Quests too, and it's fine as well.)  I like the Puggle minigame as well. It doesn't make the game feel boring as it can help boost shipping time while being a playable Pachinko with Edgar and Maya.  The game's community is also very cool. No cancerous fights or something, many players of this Tuber Simulator mostly focus on hatching Pixelings, participate in room contests, and get tips on how to grind Bux! Check out the Google+ semiofficial community as well.  Probably the greatest Tuber game on the web, Outerminds. I'll send you a Sponsor Eagle filled with \"Good Job\" messages. Keep your game as good as possible, there's no time to lose in beating PewDiePie to his #1 spot!",

        "As much as I understand that you want to make a few bucks, the amount of advertising and the way the advertising is being presented has gradually become quite intrusive and annoying. I would much rather pay a one time license fee that this crabby implementation of user annoyance  / advertising. The other problem is that on the high end phones (read pixel 2) the board are so big that the tiles as a consequence are made very small so they fit with a final result that makes it very difficult to see/read",
        "The ads are very annoying and I have lost interest in playing  the game anymore. I have to start over for each play. Ad won't let me continue. Someone has Really messed this game up. Just fire their butts and send them down to the river swamp. No need for them to be in the public when they can't leave well enough alone.",
        "I think the game is great. I love Mahjong. I'm unhappy that I paid 1.99 to stop the ads but when I collect my 2,000 coin bonus I still have to watch an ad to receive the bonus. I will not be paying 1.99 next month just to still have to watch ads.",

        "Does not even lay tiles down in a solvable fashion. Had no repeats thus shud be solvable in any order, wasn't, what's the point? Sort ur algorithm out.  Also, non stop ads and u want us to pay monthly for ad free? £8 one off fee wud b highest I went for an app I'd want to keep"

The reason I gave it only 1 star is just to seek your attention because I wanted u all to add an effect of sound of engine as the car speeds up which will make the game really more realistic.

        "Nice game but the random number generator is non existent. Hold three numbers and roll again, even with free or earned additional rolls, are ALWAYS the same number that was there! This would fail state regulations on gambling games. Fun but a sucker game for rolling anything that counts as statistically random",
        "This is fun, IF you can figure it out. I like playing yahtzee but this is complicated. Every time I get extra dice, the ???? spends them or takes them away from me so I don't get to spend them the way I want to. That sucks.",
        "Love the game! But recently did an update for the app now my game glitches out. Takes forever to roll the dice. Only updated the app cuz it said they fixed bugs & made faster well it did the opposite for my app.",

Perhaps i used bad tracks but its nothing like rockband blitz. It cant decide jf it ants to be a car racing game or a rhythmic game doesnt succeed at either. Looks neat at least. But hard to tell where tongo next with most graphics",
        "Whoa. I'm not a huge fan of the starting level, but the retro level is so perfect. I love the style of legacy, but It's too busy, so I can't tell where the obsitcles are. I love how you guys do the ads. If there's a car or level I want and I want to be lazy, I can just watch a couple ads to get it. Not only that, but It's my music. What a great idea. Kudos. I'm 100% on board.",
        "In my short time playing, i realised youd better choose a lo g song, because there will be an add before you play and after you play. They get in your face with adds. Games ok tho",
        "A rarely come here and review games. But this sure is a gem. Super happy to play music racer. The concept is beautiful.  5 stars all the way. I will stream the game in my Facebook account .",
        "Amazing game that flows incredibly smooth at 120hz on my razer phone. However, since the last update it starts to stutter when its in game and this ruins alot of the experience, if this was fixed, it would be one of the best games on the market for me.",
        "I've liked the game a lot but the new update has caused unwanted songs or app noises  to appear. A simple fix to this would be a in game delete option. I'm on a nexus 5S"

It's too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.",

Second, the controls don't suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.",

        "Very realistic and nice game. Missions and descriptions are entertaining. Controls are also great.   Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!",
        "Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!",
        "Great game but more issues to address.  The longer flight durations are a real waste of time,  make them more challenging rather than waiting for the destination. Also add more controls as the ones we have are not effective. How do you tell me to slow down yet i don't have the option for that?",

There were only one pair of cards with two dots and they overlapped each other, which of course I could not pair them up. And there were three pairs of one strip appeared.",

A 30 second, non skipable ad. The ads are also there after you finish every match. I know you need to make revenue but jeez. Calm down."

Thank you for this game 5stars! Your doing just great devs!",

I want to tell u thie guys..  ur game was absolutely great.... 125 players that impressive....graphics is good.. some minor buys ... plz reduce the sound of the heli...the most important thing is the render distance is soooooooooooo good.... i don't know how it's achived with in 180 MB .... I'm telling u this I really liked ROS....but not any more.....bc In here their is no such a lag and it can in any device... skill based  .. very good rendering distance.. the bullet drop is so realistic...jumping mechanism sooooo great and all this good things come with in 180 MB .. I love u guys.... GREAT WORK. keep it up....I really look up to the next update.......😘😘😙😙👌👌👌👌👍",
        "there are some bugs, that i knew the player is in the building and in his/her phone, but in my phone the player just float in the air its good for me to kill that player, but its not good if the player was me.  fix the building.  add or fix some features like: 1. the distance of the safezone in the mini map. 2. after automaticaly open the door, please make it close automaticaly too. 3. make the control wheel just by move the camera not by the direction arrow. 4. foot step is just too small. 5. make a gun fire radar. 6. make the animation of the character more realistic.  its ok to me if the update makes the game become 500 mb bigger than previous version.  i love this game. its run nicely in my phone.",
        "Hard to attack, easy to die. I already point the crosshair to the enemy, and when I start shooting, the crosshair miss the enemy and start to move around randomly, looks like I attack the ground, and end up died. Also, hard to find weapon and ammo. Your game is good, but not good enough. You are trying to fully copy PUBG, which is played on PC, while your game is Android-Based, hard to control. Hard to control. Easy to aim, but never hit, because the crosshair like to move around and land the bullet on the ground. Try to play Free Fire Battleground by Garena. Overall, Free Fire much better than yours. Uninstalled!"
