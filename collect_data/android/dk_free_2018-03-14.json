        "It is OK,  however it is not what the game was letting on. It's more of like a game like Simpson tapped out or something. Like any mobile game, actions take hours to complete and you have energy that can run out stopping you from being able to play for a while. This is EA's way of getting you to buy their over priced boosts. But it is not bad, it is fun and enjoyable, and it is cool to design your sims and construct your own house. I also kinda like the feature that you can buy new clothes rather than using the simple clothing you can wear at the beginning of the game. Overall it is fun and enjoyable, but it doesn't feel like a sims game",
        "I like it. What I don't like : 1. I lost a lil bit of my progress. Idk why. I was lvl 7, then i jump to another app. When i back, I was lvl 6. 2. I don't like when placing furniture etc, it's hard, especially on the wall since the wall can't show up manually. Need work on some control. And I really think, the button option for house view need to be there on UI. 3. I miss the food, energy, fun, bladder, etc bar. Somehow it makes the roleplaying more real. 4. Can't it have stairs and second floor? That would be awesome.",
        "Really like it so far. But, if you have 2 beds and 2 characters, shouldn't  you be able to take a nap in a bed and have it reset for that character, not both characters? Also would like to see more activities with other sims outside the house. Should be able to sell / remove things in storage that you no longer use. Also, when I propose the other sim isn't able to move in and it doesn't save.. so I've proposed 3 times now.",
        "Disappointed about not being able to control the children for free! This is not as bad Free Play but not as good as The Sims 4. There are definitely some glitches, I bought a stove then watched an ad. The ad made the game freeze, when I came back to the game the was no stove and the money was gone.",
        "It's a really good game I love it. It's so modern and relatable. The graphics are great even the new styles they have it's all pretty good. The only problem I seem to have is that when I set a Sim to do a task and then leave the game when I come back the task isn't done and it's like I didn't assign it a task. But it's just a minor glitch sometimes it actually completes the task. However it's still a good game to get.",
        "I think it's a cool game and has potential to become something bigger. But I would like a graphics setting option so I can set them higher as it looks pretty blurry and low quality.   I also want more online features as well as more (full) soundtracks (buildmode soundtrack as well as create a simple)) froms 4 game as i love the soundtrack from the Sims 4."

        "Fun game to pickup and play, I purchased the No Ad's because they where getting overbearing. But now that I have unlocked all the bats I have nothing to do, we need more content apart from new bats. We need to have more than just 15 bats added per update, we want objectives, maybe switch up the gameplay a little. More substance is required.",
        "1 star rating there's entirely too many ads.  I understand you need ads for revenue but this is too much.  You will learn the hard way that gamers do not like over the top.  1 star also because you have to click multiple x's to exit the ad.  Even then some ads ignore that you clicked X and take you to a site anyway.  RIP this game in 4 months tops.",
        "Game itself is cute and I bet that with some effort you could make it more fun than it already is but..... WAY TOO MANY ADS. change it or stay with 1 star  Edit: it even forces you to watch ads in order to upgrade! What the actual f....",
        "The game is fine, could actually be fun to play if it weren't for the excessive amount of ads. It's completely understandable to have some ads (e.g. the one at the bottom of the screen, or giving the player the option to double their money by watching an ad) but to force the player into watching an ad after every 3 rd play seems quite unreasonable. I played the game for 5 minutes and had to watch 4 ads. Again I understand you need to make your money and ads are a way to go but not that many. Maybe tone it down a bit and increase the payout for viewing ads.",
        "I would like the game so much more if it was harder to go farther I am at 55,000 and no incentive. If there was more bonuses like hitting a tree or hitting a window and breaking it would be a lot better becuase game is too easy. There isn't enough bats each day I go 5,000 meters farther needs more incentive.",
        "Absolutely terrible. An ad every 2 hits are you kidding me? You should be ashamed of yourselves voodoo. You made what could be a fun enjoyable game unplayable. I understand ad revenue is incredibly important to making money for free games but if no one wants to play then there is no point for advertisers to pay you."

        "Very good game. Something that is an upgrade from Score hero. BUT.  1. The controls -The range u can pass in is very limited and would be better if we could ass anywhere we want. Also, if there was a power bar for how fast we want the ball to go or a ground pass or cross etc.  2. AI - Sometimes they would go for a tackle and completely miss the player or ball. Also, They run so aimlessly and quite annoying. Please fix this so that this game is more enjoyable.  I feel like much is to be improved but this game has potential",
        "Amazingly evocative and addictive football game – up to level 4. After that it gets REALLY frustrating. Your own team AI suddenly seems gimped, with players making bizarre mistakes, and you get constantly matched against opponents with much better players than you. Makes the game feel much more about luck than skill. Could be so good if it felt more fair. One thing that would make it better is the ability to choose a hard, medium, or easy match; the harder the match, the bigger the bux payout. Would make it much less stressful to play.",
        "Scripted sorry excuse for a football game with retarded players where the entire point of the game is upgrading your team but player levels doesn't matter because they have never even heard what football is.  If, however, you decide to download this game, unlock the 10-0-0 formation as soon as possible because your team will not play defense anyways. Doesn't make a difference if you play 5-3-2 with level 10 players or 0-0-10 with level 1 'players' , your team will still play like a bunch of retards.",
        "What I dislike: Poor Game! It needs improvements, modifications and changes... I'll think of reinstalling it when I realise that their are chances the gameplay would change because I see that we are not free to move our players, you should change the way the defence is and let it be by swiping, same for goal keeping...  What I like: I like that my country exists in the game, I hope that you add it to \"Dream League Soccer 2018\" 's custom player, I'll be willing to sell the player and buy him again just to adjust the country...",
        "Very luck based. I've lost games without hardly touching the ball and not even being able to get to try to tackle. They may tackle when there not even near players. And if you win the ball from a tackle, at least half the time you don't keep the ball. SORT OUT TACKLING!",
        "Game is horrible. The defense is 100% luck and if your player gets the ball anywhere near an opposing player he will slide tackle you and you will lose possession. If you want to play a game like this just play score hero. 10/10 would not recommend.👎"

        "I really really like this game. My high score is 1076 and my highest stage is 61. I play is all the time and have 70000 apples. On my upgrades, I have XP level 270 and have a 138% Chance for golden apples. However, since the update I haven't seen a single golden apple. Why is this? It's not too big of a problem as I have enough apples to buy all of the knives again 5x, but I like the satisfaction of seeing all of the golden apples when I play. Also, I have a 270% Bonus Prize apples and when I open the free gift, it only gives me 100% bonus. Again this isn't a problem but I would like to see the highest amount of apple's I have earned. Thanks I enjoy a lot of your games Ketchapp! Leopard up the good work!!!",
        "Changed from my 5 star review as my game is glitched, I have all the knives and almost 1000 score so I have spent a lot of time on this and it is annoying that I have 48% chance for golden apple and after an hour of playing the regular mode, saw hundreds of regulars but no golden apples, this only occurred after I spent 30,000 apples upgrading power ups and now I've lost what I gained on that power up",

        "This game has potential, don't ruined it because of money. I have never been watching so many ads In my life just to get some 2 stars parts. Instead of being creative and making cool machines, this game is turning to - either pay to win or watch alot of ads to win. What's the point of \"playing\" in this game?",
        "I love this game. Been playing since almost the beginning. Idk how I feel about the ultimate league but it's not bad. I'm digging the concept of the kings part of the gang fights. I'd really like it if you guys could have it show who's online in your gang like it does in the championship lobby. Oh and notifications for your gang chat would be great. I'm seeing comments about the game crashing, and heard issues my gang has had also. Hopefully that's taken care of soon. It would be nice to hear back on this comment to know we're being heard. Thanks",
        "Cute, simple, fun to compete. Strong presence of Pay-2-Win when Tier-1 players are 1-shotting you. Can advance timers by watching ads so use wifi often. **Dropped a star because I can't do this anymore; it's only asking for gems now**. Clubs (gangs) only hold 25 people and cost 100 gems to start. Need Bolts to upgrade, chests to get them, 2h-6h to unlock or watch 2-12 ads (not anymore for me?) So grind while playing games or watching movies.",
        "I very much enjoy this game because it is a lot of fun and us very exiting to play. Not only are you able to fight different people online, but you also get to customise you're vehicle. And you get to chose what your character's outfit looks like.",
        "I truly love this game and would give it five stars...if only it would give me items that are in my tier, get to tier four finally get tier one weapons of the same class. I like a challenge but this is absurd stupidly absurd",
        "Game was fun. Then I started hitting the wall where you couldn't progress unless you paid more money. Then this most recent patch introduced a bunch of bugs that kept losing parts and golden tix. Then their support was unresponsive. Not fun anymore."

        "This game was practically stolen from Piano Tiles 2, even the sounds and they copied the design terribly. Sure, they bring new things that are different from Piano Tiles, but it's done terribly. The one thing I saw different was the bar at the bottom and getting the actual score, but after more playing, I realised that the bar was just there so they could sync up the music with when the blocks would come to the bar. They didn't even at least sync up the music to when you hit the black boxes, I experimented. All in all the game is terrible because of my own experiences and things they didn't do very correctly.",

But way too easy for me because my high score is over 7300. BUT STILL! I LOVE THIS GAME! I BOUGHT THE LAST BALL AND THE LAST BLOCK IN THE GAME!",

        "I'd give it 5 stars buttttt there's a problem..... like the other people said theres a glitch. If that vets fixed it would be awesome. Until then its pretty bad for that glitch... but I waited and ate my pizza and then the crust fell on the floor and the dog got it... sad day......",
        "I am having the same glitch where the ball does not show the socond time you play it. Pls fix this, but other than that the game is still fun and addicting 😂",
        "The game keeps glitching out because when I click on play it shows no ball so I have to restart then it works then it doesn't. It's a cycle you need to fix. Besides that it is a good game",

        "I gave it three stars because not too far along in the game, it turns into a \"pay to win\" game. Some boards simply don't give you enough moves, so you're forced to use coins to continue or retry and lose a life.  I don't mind hard games, but I detest micro transactions being needed so soon into it.. I'm at level 24, that's it, and already the board doesn't even give you a fighting chance to beat it without using coins.",
        "Love this game! I have been playing Gardenscapes for quite some time and I would see ads for this one. So I decided to try it. Now I am hooked! However, I wish it was like Matchington Mansions where you can go to other players mansions and if they have items that you don't have (furniture, flooring, wallpaper etc.) you can click on it and acquire it. Not sure if this game has that option because I am not that far along in the game. Other than that, it is FANTASTIC!!",
        "I love decorating the rooms but I am having to pay too much to get enough points to do it.   I also don't like that each room requires more points to do the tasks than the previous room.  I have changed my rating to low because you end up spending too much of your own money to get powerful to get your stars to complete the tasks.  They also lose your purchases.  I bought a desk chair yesterday and now it is missing and the task is gone too.  Rip off.",
        "Never thought it would be this addictive! At first i thought \"Oh, its THAT game that always pops up in advertisements.\" but after deciding to give it a try, i am hooked!   I introduced homescapes to my mom as well and downloaded it for her and she finds it adorable and fun as well. We both take time to chill out and have fun with the puzzles occasionally when we are together.   I cant find a single flaw or critique for this game, its amazing :)",
        "Everything is awesome. Love the gameplay, love the graphics and  etc. BUT please can ypu speed the \"end stage\" part?  I am talking about the part where you finished the stage and you start collecting the  coins.  Can you speed it up? Because watching my 7+ moves turn into airplanes or bombs and watch how they make more money is good but its taking too long.  Especially  when I have an infinite life's  for hour or so.  Can you make so that after you finish the stage it will simply fast forward to the end?  Thank you",
        "It's a nice game alright - lovely graphics and a nice gameplay. But I can't help thinking that it was made for one single purpose - to pull money out of your pocket. The levels are too hard, the moves are never enough so you either have to give up and loose a life or pay for additional moves. Such a shame, I really liked it but I will have to delete it."

        "This is the best game ever! It is easy to play and the best part I like is you get to desing your avatar to look cool. I know a lot of people complain about you have to pay money to get robux, but if u have money just save up and if u can't, get over it.Also another feature I like is you get to make your own level and I think that is really cool. The only thing I do not like about this app is it does not let you build a level of you play on a tablet or phone. Another thing is I don't like all the glitches. Like all of a sudden it kicks you off the game and the next you are back in the game.",
        "I love this app very much! But what I hate about this app are too much oder (online daters) which now roblox users made some disgusting and inappropriate memes or posts. And too much bullies, for those who don't have robux likely got bullied in the game and if we report them roblox doesn't read... that's all",
        "I love this game. I will play it with my free time. I will tell my friend to go and download it so me and him can play on the same game. He plays Minecraft more but I lost focus on it. But he says he likes playing jailbreak and tycoons. So I give this a five stars. BTW, best game ever made.",
        "The new update you guys made is horrible.. I loved this game so much but then you updated it and now every game I play lags. No matter how low my graphics are at. I've tried deleting the app and re-downloading it but it doesn't work. Please fix it cause now roblox is barely playable",
        "I have been playing thisbfor the longest time and there have been bugs and glitches sometimes it would crash my phone even if I update it it still does these thing could you fix it please I hate having my phone crashing as I own a business and need it for out and about trips and stuff. Thank you ever so much my complements to the creators."

I know its the game because its when I'm about to pick up something important or jump at a crucial point. Also this ismy 3rd phone and it does it on all phones. This error needs to be fixed.",
        "I love the game. Been loving it for years. I've been noticing alot lately though that when I watch the ad video to double up on my mystery box, it's not doubling my prize. Getting kinda frustrating and just not worth watch the ads anymore. Can you fix this? If not, I more than likely will delete the app and free up the space.",
        "this game is slightly good but  it is lost its priority to me day by day. initially this game was awesome but now a days it seems to me boring, authority takes this game only for business purpose. after finishing level 30 i lost my patience to this game. it gave more ad. but not increase their game quality. so finally i take decision to uninstall this app to release the space of phone.",
        "I am beyond upset, I had about 50 keys and more than 8k in coins. I spent all my time simply doing tasks, daily missions, and much more to get to where I was far in the game. When I logged back on, it showed I was logged in still but I have lost my keys and my coins, it reset EVERYTHING and it even did the whole intro for the beginners. I don't understand what happened.",
        "This game is amazing but I would add that  each game you get a key and lots of coins. Also some people might be playing in a different country than America and they would like to buy something but they don't have dollars 💵 I LOVE THE GAME",
        "Could add more city's it sucks revisiting and not getting new characters.. also the special city boards could have some special effects instead of ... I don't know... looking like a hot dog... what's the point. A hot dog with super speed and stay low would be ideal. Love the game, but to keep playing.. maybe give us something new. The only thing I love is wordy weekends. But only to get the coins back for what I spent on the characters"

I thought that the different colours gave you the ability to collect more balls so not really sure what the point of the game is... no way to won or lose ... just click ... I like things with skill... I can handle the ads and would even pay to remove ads if the game have a point.. a purpose a win/lose sort of deal but it's not I don't think I will be keeping this game .. unless they add a little skill to it",
        "It's decent. I like the sounds it makes, and the colours look nice too. The forced ads I can't skip after 5 seconds is the annoying part. I get that you need ads, but come on man. I buy 3 upgrades and have to watch a full minute ad. It's like an ad simulator. Honestly if I wanted to play with balls, and watch ads I'd play with my own balls, and throw some ads on YouTube(this part is mostly for humour). Just so you know I'm not salty, annoyed yes, but not salty.",
        "Ads are non skipable which is awful. Skippable ads are ones that pop up that you don't want usually. The full ads like on this game are only usually shown when you are getting a upgrade to a boost or something free etc. Terrible design as you can't win either",
        "I like the game as it's one when you don't want to think but want to do something. It's very easy. However you watch more ads than you do play the game. So annoying I had to sit through a 1 minute cat chat advert without being able to skip it. Then a 10 second level then another 50 second unskipable ad so annoying",
        "I had to delete this game because every time you buy an upgrade for the ball an ad pops up. There is no reason to be that money hungry. Dont download, you'll just get annoyed because it becomes unplayable really quickly",
        "So... paid for \"no ads\" which apparently means \"some ads are gone but the most annoying ones are still there\" no ads should mean no ads. I paid for it now I feel ripped off!"

        "So, what makes this one of the best games made?  Let me start by saying the game play is fun.  Try to get the top medal each round. The game on its own is smooth and simple.  Graphic and physics are decent as well. But what makes this the best game?  Ads are not intrusive. You can simply back out of them without the \"wait 30 seconds to continue.\"  I've actually watched ads in this game since they aren't forced. I keep them up because I wanted to.  This does not mean they aren't there or have little countdown timers, but you can simply hit the back button to close it. Next, you don't deal with \"you didn't get a perfect score, want to try again? Buy more lives.\"  Exactly. NO IN APP PURCHASES. None!  Thank you!  Keep playing until your heart is content. Lose all you want and retry. They aren't looking for your money. Trust me, try it and you'll see. You also may find yourself more interested in the ads. I know it surprised me that I was. Every developer can learn from them!",
        "Fun playing. Passes some idle time. Habit forming. How much more do I need to say before get something free? Lol...",
        "I loved!it.the graphics are  great and the whole game is fantastic but I think you should add some sneaky levels to make it more interesting and add something else about the levels because it's starting to get boring so at least add more but it is still mind blowing ;)",
        "Great game....way too many ads. I would pay for an ad free version since the ads annoy me so much that I'm going to wind up uninstalling it.",
        "This is a good game to practice your skills,and jut have fun,I recommend this game to anybody that wants to build their skills if they love pool like I do,and over all its very relaxing, I give it a five star.",
        "The game is great, but there are way too many ads, and you don't have an option to pay in order to disable those ads. It's just annoying"

        "I absolutely love this app for passing some time. The only issue I have with it is it's very hard to precisely pick a color from the color bar and/or start a color-by-dragging operation without instead starting a scroll operation. This is even more true on the new 3D pictures. You need to add a 2-4 pixel dead-zone before initiating a scroll/rotate.",
        "I love the game, it just a relacing, no brainer type game that is instant stress relief.  My only negative is that I paid to remove the adverts, which isn't cheap only to find that for some puzzles you still have to sit through 30 seconds of mind numbing dross to play them.  The removal of the ads should remove the need for ALL ads.",
        "I really liked it better before the 3d puzzles. I really miss the magnifying aspect. I don't use a stylus so my finger is in the way and I can't see the numbers well. I guess I'll get used to using g 2 fingers to slide the picture around instead of it rotating.",
        "The controls are so dang sensitive, not just with the new 3d ones, but with /every/ picture, that it makes the relaxing activity of coloring into a frustrating challenge. It doesn't help that the 'hit boxes' of the pixels is so much smaller now, you have to tap in Just the right spot or the whole screen speeds off in one direction or another. Hope this gets fixed soon, I want to love it again ;n;",
        "I used to love this game but with this new update it's become tiring. The 3D picture controls don't work well especially with a stylus. And now, even the normal pictures keep freezing. I wish there was a way to hide the 3D pictures and stop the glitching",
        "I love this app. It's relaxing and more compact and cheaper than all the art supplies would be. It's worth the £4, even with the occasional locked piece that needs you to watch a short video to access it (I'm assuming these help fund the constant updates with the new daily art).   EDIT: YES! I love the new 3D function. More of that please. Also, the create tab? LOVE IT! Just made my favourite picture of my dog on hard. That's going to take a few hours to complete.  So, I was hoping all my completed pics would have been moved from library to My Works to save scrolling to incomplete pictures but I do love the 3D pieces so... Please! Just delete the completed pics from the library, keep them in the My Works tab.  Good job on the new update. It's a great app. Five stars if you get the completed pics out my way. 😉"

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",

        "Much has improved since my original review (see below). There are special events going on quite often to help with earning coins and powerups, and the levels don't seem to be as tedious. Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "There is not enough options to choose from when placing stuff in your garden and the hard levels should give you two stars and the really hard levels should give you three stars. Also the further you make it into the game the more stars you have to use to complete tasks, the amount of stars to complete tasks shouldnt go up it should stay the same. One star for easy tasks two stars for medium tasks three stars for hard tasks and timed tasks thats it! Fun game though and good time killer other then that.",
        "Fun way to pass time and super addictive but most of the levels are insanely hard. Some can only be completed if you're lucky enough to get the bonus items in the right place. Also the safe box is getting on my nerves. I thought it was a limited time offer and would go away but it's been there for 2 weeks now!",
        "It is very entertaining. I like it way better than homescapes although I like that game, too. I just find gardenscapes way more fun and less boring. A lot of different activities to enjoy, too! The latest update on skipping the effects at the end of each level is nice especially when you're on the last couple of minutes of your unlimited life. Good job Playrix Games!"

        "It is amazing no matter what I play this alot and still love it. Has great graphics great gameplay and I will never get bored. If I had to have one game on my phone except YouTube this would be my number one game so keep going but one thing you should make lots of more songs like really new songs",
        "It's really REALLY fun and addicting. I absolutely love it. The only thing I don't really like about it is that you only have a certain amount of lives. But other than that, this game is AWESOME and I mean awesome when I say AWESOME. You should totally download it, I really recommend it!!",
        "One of my favourites from cheetah, however, on certain devices the games sound seems to get altered on certain keys making the game very unsatisfying to play. However, on my Samsung the game is a joy, I am using a Sony experia right now so I guess it's only on certain devices, but I feel like the alternative sound should be optional. 9/3/2018 I'm so glad that the game has recently updated and the noise issue has been resolved, the game is as lovable as it was before if not more!",
        "Just something fun to pass the time if I'm waiting or just plain bored. I suggest playing with ear phones if in public, because the wide variety of classical music is great. Better than expected.",
        "This game is quite fun it's addictive and really great the only reason I gave it a 4 star not 5 is because you have a limit of how many times you play it depending on the hearts at the top looking like this =❤ so that the only problem but other then that I recommend all people to play it",
        "Been playing this game for years and I still love it. New songs are being added regularly and it's easy enough to get gems to unlock them. Ads aren't distracting and micro transactions are limited to those too impatient. Great designs. 10/10"

And another thing that's a problem is this phone heats your phone up badly in less than a minute and it makes me cautious of my phone.I hope these issues get fixed soon. It's a good game but you've been warned...",

The best i liked was that our cats which we use in battle and are able to survive come back to us only and we can use it next time also because in other games like cladh of clans our troops which we have used and survived are just wasted. Moreover the graphics and gameplay is also nice..🖒🖒🖒🖒",

        "Just downloaded this app.  So far a very well executed app with excellent layout and controls/easy and fluid to use.  Much better than other Sodoku b/c no ads during actual game play!  The only \"con\" is that I cant put graphics behind gameboard. Only suggestion: Would like to see options for backgrounds like in Solitaire. This would truely make it a 5 star game!   Ps. I was not paid/reimbursed or otherwise incentivised for this review in any way.",
        "I like this app, but it feels like it could be more educational. I get stuck on the expert puzzles and often have to use the hints, the way the hints just tell you the number in a selected square doesn't help me work out what I'm missing. If the hint could show me how I could reveal another number would be more helpful to me. Otherwise top notch app",
        "Great app. I can do Sudoku on the app with the 'write' facility for numerical notes and I like how it removes them automatically as you fill in other areas. But I still find it very difficult to do paper Sudokus because I can't fill in the right answers without loads of workings out on the more challenging puzzles. The app makes this aspect easy.",
        "I would greatly prefer to start by touching a number rather than touching a cell.  I have to hunt for a cell with the number I am working with, touch that to show where all instances of that number are, then touch each cell and the number to place either the number or a note that this might be the number.  If I could select the number first, I would only have to touch each cell to place that number, then turn on \"note mode\" and touch each cell for a note.  Only half the taps per game, saving both time and the muscles in my arthritic hands!",
        "Great app! Loads quickly, gameplay is smooth and intuitive. I also haven't found the different levels of difficulty to be repetitive, which is a good thing. I have found with other Sudoku apps, a pattern emerges from each of difficulty so that I almost know what the puzzle will look like by picking how hard it will be.  This one isn't like that thankfully!",
        "Easy to use.   Love the pencil so you can mark choices.   Also like that it tells you if you make a stupid mistake like putting the same number in a column.   Haven't tried the hint feature yet,  but hoping it will help me learn when I don't see any options."

        "The game itself is fun and enjoyable, BUTTTTTTTTTTT the developers want too much money for upgrades. Adds are infectious and numerous. The weapon upgrades that can be earned are so far out of reach from earning through game play. They just want you to buy them. I'd keep and give the game a better rating if the previously stated issues weren't involved. That's the sad part. I'd like to play it more, but not going to spend $50 plus for a weapon upgrade on a phone game.",
        "Good game. Advert after every mission and some bullets can go through the guy you're trying to shoot at like a hologram. Graphics aren't good at all but you have got recoil and swaying scope that I noticed as well. All in all, pretty good game. Maybe add a toggle to gold your breathe in the future so that it doesn't sway?",
        "Soooo good as a good dish when hungry..  But i have 1 request to you that We can play spec ops only once But this stage is really nice so,  i have to play it again for enjoyment and money also... For upgrades of weapons And i don't know how to change my country in profile Plz give me some reply",
        "After the update on 2nd Mar-18, Spec ops not loading. Game simply terminate itself while trying to load spec ops Level 16. Everything else is working fine. I'm stuck 😓😪 Update: now I can't play even Daily Mission😩😤",
        "It's a real fun game for shooting.  I am giving 3 stars because gears are very expensive. I have reached level 8 without buying anything because all my earnings are not enough to buy a decent gun. You want people to pay rather then buy through skill earned point. But still great game.",
        "I like this game but you have to spend money to really enjoy it. The only way that you can get other guns is if you buy it with diamonds (lots of them) and by going premium which sucks. Graphics isn't even that good for you to spend money for this game. A waste of time tbh. Deleting it"

        "Was pretty short to begin with but Nintendo has supported this game well, adding additional content, even a new mode. The simplified game mechanics to fit Mario gaming on a phone work great and feel natural. The story with it's additional challenges to open new courses are fun, toad run is addictive, the remix 10 is somewhat redundant content wise but also good. I'd rather pay $10 up front than have in-game purchases, the reception to this game indicates that I'm very much in the minority on that. Great game, very fun for a quick session of Mario.",
        "Awesome update! Make the game worth again, when it seems Nintendo had abandoned Super Mario Run, they back and release more content for the half of the price. This is the kind of update I was waiting for, once I didn't paid the game yet, I think this could be a great time to purchase. Probably in the future they will release more content, but the price will back to 9.99, so the best time to purchase is now! Great job Nintendo, I love your games since my childhood.",
        "Favorite game. It has a one time cost for full version and not a monthly fee or several different things you have to buy to enjoy it. I like the updates with the remix, and the star courses. I didnt like that there was so little to do before I bought it. I got bored quick. But was surprised by the cost, and love it after buying it. I do wish we could see our friends land and share things we don't need and give rally tickets to others.",
        "I think it is a great game but i do not like the controls. Yes i know it is meant to be a run but i think it could have a  more traditional Mario controls. The graphics is pretty good. The difficulty could be turned down as the Bowser level is always taking me another 2 days to unlock aft finishing norm lvls. And lastly, i think u could make the village livelier.",
        "I absolutely love this game. I make it a point to not spend money on mobile games cus they typically turn out to be a cash trap, but this was just like buying a regular video game. No adds, and even before buying the full game it doesn't shove \"buy our product\" notifications down your throat. Nintendo has always had good games and I have no doubts that I will keep playing this every day.",
        "This game had great potential and did well with it. Just because there's that wall of 10$ to pay isn't that bad. You had to pay much more when New Super Mario Bros Wii came out (If you bought it). I really like the graphics and how you are challenged to get newer characters like Daisy, Toadette, or even Luigi. 👌👌👌"

After Builder Hall 8 update whenever I click by boat to go Builder Base the game shuts. I am not able to upgrade my Builder hall. SUPERCELL you are super we know plz fix this issue and let me know. Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "HI SUPERCELL . some players ruined the clan because of Clan Games. Why? They will join ur clan and check if we already achieve the reward like book. They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",
        "If you deploy a troop that hasn't got a primary target never, and I mean never, does cover the least space possible. It always goes with those weird angles for just an easy target. Just go straight forward.. Cover a line, we don't need unnecessary last moment turns. I play this game since 2013 with different accounts but this thing stays the same. Plz fix it",
        "It was a wonderful game . Thank u SUPERCELL ,for giving us a wonderful game. This game graphics was awesome. But I have a complaint against u. That is : if you update this game's features , from where can we get memory. We don't have that much memory in our phones.        Just joking....... Your updates were also awesome. Hope u provide us many games like this coc"

        "This is garbage. Dev trying to create a puzzle games but force player to watch ads if want to add additional free hints. The 5 free hints is unrecoverable like other puzzle games that I played! Also sometimes the games shows some ads, even worst player are force to watch ads just to unlock certain levels! Do yoy what more garbage is? The puzzle dont make a senses, with limited once 5 free hints, every each puzzles  are pretty stupid as they are not logical (even you want make a troll still need to make its logic like other puzzle games).",
        "Just another pointless stupid game. It has no instructions and then glitched and if I watch ads I still get no free hints. It won't go any further than the girl on the cliff",
        "Entertaining! Ads are as always quite annoying unfortunately: got stuck a lot (somehow) and had to spend ages watching videos just to get some hints. Generally though, nice little game! I loved the references to some of the games! ;)",
        "It won't let me get past the part with the girl on the cliff and trophy thingy. It won't let me click on her neck or do anything and it's frustrating. I hate it",
        "I have a question how in the hell do you play this game? there is no tutorial. there are no instructions there's nothing but watching videos for free hints on what you're supposed to do in each level. I would like to actually play the game without having to watch the videos the whole time. Do not install!!!",
        "This game is not for narrowminded people who can't think outside the box or see past their noses. Its a different kind of game. A fun game. The whole point is to figure out how to past the levels without the help of hints. The answers are not impossible, just different. There are no instructions because that would defeat the purpose of playing. Instructions would basically give you the answer without you having to think for yourself. I commend the creator and developers for keeping things different instead of making another common and usual game like Word Find. If you're disliking the game then go play scrabble, word find, match 3 or combat whatever, etc."

        "The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn't make it better at controlling. I don't know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌",
        "this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It's so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It's just so addicting and I can't get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the 'play online' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊",
        "So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I'll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It's in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I've ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍",
        "Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃",
        "I'm highly addicted to this game. It's a thousand times better then agar.io in my opinion and it's really cool that you get to create your own skin. The only downer is that I just wish there was some music because you start to get a bit bored after a while.This game is NOT a waste of time, and everyone needs to download it to experience the awesomeness!",
        "Its amazing and highly addictive. Actually one of the few games that not only hold my attention but my kids as well. The only two issues I have is when lag strikes its basically impossible to play conssidering your hand takes up part of the screen anyway. Then every time you die you have to close out of an add. Which if you have a curved screen some of those are hard to close out of.  It would be really cool if in addition to building your own you could create your own list of worms youve made and name if you want."

        "Cool looking game played like 15 matches. Annndd then it started freezing. In a single player match i would fire 2 shots and the my entire phone would stop and the only way to get out is to close the app. Im using a galaxy j7",

Have seen the bug that others reported, sometimes rock after thrown disappears , some kind of glitch that happens occasionally.  Sometimes the sweepers don't react to my movement to sweep. Would love to see 8 stones instead of 6. If you love curling, this should satisfy",
        "Great game except for hackers. There is a hack that allows some to bump or change finish of a throw. Yoy can go from having 2 scoring to opponent having the score, changing after the rocks stopped. Developers have not replied ti report. Fine for some fun but don't waste your money in upgrades",
        "Very fun game. Multiplayer is awsome! Please add private matches so i can play with friends.   Physics still need work to hold up to real world standard. Rocks dont follow thru on take outs in real life as they do in this game. Also (rules), a rock needs to make it all the way over the hogline in order to stay in play.  Thank you for making this game!",
        "Good fun. Physics seem good, sometimes my sweepers don't sweep at all but I don't think that makes too much difference. I'd like to play alternate ends rather than winner goes first and the rocks don't spin which would add a bit of something to the graphics. I've yet to play online, just practicing against the CPU.",
        "Decent. The game is close to curling. Issues are that the only real way to earn coins it to play online mode. If you do career mode you actually have to SPEND coins to play, and there's no payout for winning. The rocks don't behave like real curling stones, but it's the best curling game you'll find on your phone.",
        "Physics are not like real curling, rocks are dead in the house when hit, physically impossible doubles and triples, improper use of the free guard zone rules (if a rock is in the house, it is free to be removed...not in this game).  Connecting people across the globe is a cool idea but you frequently lose people and you win without finishing a game.  I've played for 35 years so I speak from experience."

If you're trying to complete a challenge, every couple tries it will reset to free play mode and you have to go intentionally kill yourself which sometimes takes way too long. Then if you don't tap the challenge button exactly right, you have to free play again. Then every time you get back into the challenge screen, you have to scroll all the way through every one you've completed. The game would be fun if it wasn't so infuriating.",
        "I paid the 2 odd dollars to remove the ads since i really enjoyed the game. If you are thinking about doing the same DON'T. Paying the money removes ZERO ads. It simply allows you to skip most of them after 5 to 10 seconds rather than watching the whole 20 to 30 second ad. They still pop up just as often and are just as annoying. Personally I would wait for another developer to make a good clone of the game, shouldn't take long it's a simple engine.",
        "Why would someone only play one round of this fun game? Install this game to find out.  Hint: greedy developers like to hit you with multiple ADs between every attempt. These one-off games are only an attempt to be the next Flappy Bird, but with the most annoying implementation of AD serving.",
        "If you're a sucker like me then you paid the $2 something to remove the ads. Doesn't work, obviously a scam. Helpful Hint: If you play with data and Wi-Fi off the ads actually disappear regardless of whether you paid to have them gone or not. Although this shouldn't have to be necessary it's the only way you're gonna enjoy this game as there is and ad Every. Single. Time. You. Die.",
        "Terrible game. I can't pay twice without having to sit through a full 30 second add. I found it faster to exit out the app and go back in to avoid adds. But there are just too many adds that it made it not fun after the first few goes.",
        "WAY TOO MANY ADS! Its so frustrating that after three failures an ad plays for 30 seconds. Also, why are you asking for access to my storage and location and the ability to make and receive calls? As a developer, get with what your customers want. Then I'll consider buying something."

I'm already making lots of gold with automating raspberries. Raspberries give away so much gold. Good update.  Keep up the good work. Thanks, Idle Farming Empire. What a good replacement for Farm Away.  Idle Farming Empire is like the best simulation for farming. I gave the game 4 stars for a reason. I liked the game. Look under the review! There're many people rating the game 5 stars. It should really be rated 4 stars.  Over 100,000 people rated 4 and 5 stars. I like this game. Thanks for everything.",

Can you have a warning if you will spend more than 50% of your gold on coin upgrades. Also i dont like having the duplicates for the boxes! One more is to have a stats area! I love the farmer upgrades and the easy progression of the game! I do love the different crops also!",

        "Fun and easy to play, perfect way to pass time. Sometimes it seems that you don't get the points when harvesting tho. Example: the total was 17.04m and I harvested 500k and the total didn't change even tho it should have been 17.54, seemed to happen frequently which slows down your progress.",

So i had lemins making me 180bb everytime it was complète. So i do instant delivery of 50 lemons, boom im only making 28bb everytime it was complete. Im so made the developers would do this.

        "Excellent brain exercise. It would be better that, instead of giving a 'resigned' message, which implies it was wilful, a 'time expired' reason was given, as sometimes a player unintentionally leaves it too long to make a move. Or differentiate between the two. I.e. if a player resigns it is 'resigned. If a game times out it is 'timed out'.",
        "This game is extremely addictive if you play the right way. It can help millions of your brain  cells  stay alive. If you want to be a great player, you must master with 2-letters word and 3-letters word. If you are not good  at it, then you'll be struggling against your opponent.",

        "I've been playing candy crush for close to 4 years. Today I'm on level 3139. For the very first time I got the jackpot on the daily booster wheel. Thought it was impossible to get. Have read other comments saying no jackpot ever. Well today is a first for this challenging, sometimes very frustrating game. I play every day just to keep up with the free boosters. It's a free game that is fun.",
        "It's a very lovely game with nice graphics and I love the challenge and the difficulty, it helps you to think and make good choices but I don't understand why I will have to buy the gold bars that I earned playing the game. That's not just right. There should be options to buy additional gold bars not telling me my gold bars is filled and I need money to get it",
        "It's really addictive,like I'm a Sugar Crush- aholic :-)  But..... I had collected 60  gold bars and I couldn't get them unless I paid 2.99. So I wasn't to impressed by that. But nevertheless it's a great game so keep up the good work. Two thumb's up for me",
        "I love playing this game and would give this app a lot more stars, but for some odd reason I am not showing as completed the Goal of the level I am currently on. It's very frustrating to me because I have hit the targeted first Star and had recently hit ALL THREE Stars showing normally that I completed the Goal. No dice. I hope someone fixes this bug soon. It's making me not want to play anymore and I love playing this with my kids.",
        "It keeps telling me my \"gold bars are full\" when I do well, but wants real cash when I try to use them. I refuse to spend real cash on an online....but addictive as hell that I am tempted to! Advise...If you have the sliqhtest of addictive personality. Stay away...."

        "Awesome Game!! Really I like this game. I dont even have words to describe it. Totally Fantastic... Whatever you say, this is totally cool. But I have a request...please add a column of legendary bikes. Like there is Common, Rares, Epics, and Specials , there should be a column of legendary. Waiting eagerly for the next update. Thanks a lot of making this fabulous game. And I would also like to appreciate the colours and graphics of this game. Thanks to the team for making this game. I advice this game to those who are looking for cool new games. Please install it and have FUN!!!! Dont just look at the pics, install and you'll be amazed.",
        "Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death",
        "Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I'll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.",
        "This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can't seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn't be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it's not something you have to add, it's just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven't seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it's an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘",
        "This game would be great if it wasn't so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn't slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.",
        "Love it. Only thing is there is a glitch when you watch an ad for 200 thingy things you get a menu that lets you get 200 more. Than again, than again. Its better on our side than yours but it would be a good fox so you have to earn them! I love all your games, wish I had all of them but I have limited storage!"

And then you have that \"Aha\" moment. There it is.  The trap is set. Lol you are not continuing to play because it is addictive. You play in order to collect coins so you can buy stuff to make the little fish happy. 💘 the graphics kind of a little like an underwater Farmville with the plants 🐟 and decorations you can get fort your aquarium. I do play with 🎶 turned off. Cute game so far.        Graphics make it better than Candy Crush.",
        "With an easy guide, on 'How to play'. Once you get going its great fun. Dare I say quite addictive. Fantastic animations. Amazing back ground music. Plus, no app freezes either.  Its an 'A☆' from me at least.  Only, what would be a great idea. Is all the piggy bank jewels you build up, should be awarded for your hard efforts. Should not have to buy them back.  Only purchase jewels when desperate.",
        "Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I'm 32 and play this often so it's not just for kids . Give it a try it's very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen 😉",
        "Fantastic game! It's great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.",
        "Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can't do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!",
        "I love this game, its very challenging. The only thing I don't like is that your aquariums end up way overcrowded with stuff before you can move to the next aquarium. Of course you can move on to the next one as soon as its unlocked, but I won't move on until I have all 3 stars. So honestly, I guess this is just my issue. I probably should have given it 5 stars, because my issue is the only reason I didn't."

My complaints are: the sound design is awful, it's very low quality; the music doesn't go for very long before it loops; the saw level doesn't have any good skins. Otherwise it's quite addictive, plays best with the sound off and the Wi-Fi so you don't get the ads (which aren't too frequent, but they're there).",

        "This game is perfect for everyday use. You continously 'climb up the ladder', it gets harder and harder which makes it challenging. The adds you can watch are very useful, as if youu watch like 2 minutes worth of adds (30 sec each), you get like 16 hours of 2x boost, which is very useful. The ingame currency which you are supposed to buy with real money, can be obtained by upgrading shafts, elevator and warehouse, that, again is a great thing. And it's a long game, in which you can challenge yourself to get your shafts to maximum level and stuff like that. One more thing, BIG UP to the devs, which are so responsive and helpful with your mails and so friendly, and I cant say that about everyother devs, there are not many thst actually care about their players, but these guys are awesome at doing their job.",
        "Well my husband has been playing this for quite some time and he has great taste in games. So I got the game and I find it's great when you're bored. Not too fast and far from slow and just enough to keep you interested",
        "best game i love  there was an add that is like thata game which it is showing how to play and then me and my brother started liking it and then we decided to download this game so....now we arre addicted to it...now we love this game...i am so glad that someone made a game like this....thx   ps:sorry if i spelled some word wrong",
        "I think it's amazing its crazy different world's different things to collect and your workers work while you are not playing and when you come back it tells you how hard they worked and how much money you earn that's its also cool because it just came out that's what I think about it",
        "Things continue to go well although I have had to wait around quite a while as of being in ak and al in net worth the extra mines have made things faster and has allowed me to store up some super cash for use later"

        "Overall, game quality is pretty solid. Few graphic glitches here and there but can be expected. It would be nice to rotate to see a better perspective and easier to hit.   One must improvement needed is that when you play a bot, it's way too noticable. You need to improve the bot intelligence! I understand why bots would be needed time to time.  Coins could be cheaper too.",
        "Needs more obstacles on lower levels. Noticed good players staying in lower levels because there isn't any competition. Clubs are better than a beginner wich makes sense but higher levels should only be limited to a certain amount at a lower level. Over all I love it though",
        "I think it would be a lot better if you could play a single player instead of having to play individuals who are too scared for a rematch. Everything in the game requires making a purchase or waiting an extremely long amount of time to get a free gift. It's fun to play, don't get me wrong. I just feel that it could be better by having the choice of playing others or by yourself.",
        "This is overall the best golf game I have come across or any app, in general, relating to sports. My only problem is that sometimes people do not want to, not do not have the ability to create a facebook account. I wish there would be a way to play with your family; without the facebook account users perks.",
        "This game would be awesome if it matched you with people equal to your level but it doesn't. So I spend more time trying to get to the higher levels and not able to upgrade equipment. Of course you could always purchase money but I'm not big on doibg that!",
        "Main screen isn't immediately obvious what does what. Also a bit annoying that my level changed and I didn't see the wager increased so i was quickly running out of coins until I realised I could step down again. Good game so far though."

        "Trying to find a support link?? I have all tools yet wont give me a bonus.... Love the game. Camera can be a pain sometimes but you learn where to and where not to touch parts. Also why not have buyers or clients stop in... Finishing a car 100% and only making 2k after putting wok into the car Then 10k into parts... I would fire the guy selling cars... Just my two cents.",
        "For the developers: this game is broken. I play on tablet Galaxi tab A   Start the game Remove battery Buy new battery Install new battery Cant tap the sell option Game freeze Nothing work Retart the game 5 times always the same",
        "The gameplay is great, but the game crashes a lot. I run it on a Oneplus 3, with nothing else open, still it collapses fairly regularly. I can't imagine how bad it could be on some less powerful devices, but it's fixable, so I'm not pessimistic. Also, if you could add two-touch swipe to the Engine part, that'd be great, it's tiring to tap parts just to move the picture, or zoom out and try tapping something in the area where I'm headed. Thanks guys!",
        "Nothing like the older apps like this. Camera control is hard, going from warehouse to parts catalogue constantly to remember bad parts to replace is a pain, then an add plays further impairing your memory. Disassembly  got way less interactive and so far I can't repair parts, just  purchase from a catalog.",
        "Whenever I open it, it crashes immediately, probably due to the quality of the graphics. Please maybe downgrade the graphics as a default option, and have an option in the game to change it to a higher quality. I use the Samsung Galaxy S5, not the most powerful thing in the world but I'm sure you can fix it.",
        "Game is great but has now crashed twice and has made me restart on both occasions. It's pointless to spend money on as it will eventually get wiped."

Not only is this game  challenging and exciting,  but NO ADS.  5 stars from me",

        "Well I've played this game since it lunched and I love the game but I will give it 2 stars because after every update I am getting ridiculous amount of lag that it causes the game to become unplayable. I can't even land on the ground anymore 7 of 10 matches it locks me in the air and I cant even land and the other 3 of 10 I die because of lag. This issue become real after season 1 started I didn't have such problem in season 0 and my phone is perfectly fine for this game too. I will give it higher rating after this issue is gone. Thanks",
        "To be honest, i love to play this game . Gameplay and graphics are fine. The bad thing is, there is no apps that are running in my phone's ram yet still laggy. I put my setting in a lower graphics and also off my power saving to maximize and no limits for the speed of my phone. Secondly, there is a glitch to this game and i also send a video and pictures to prove, through email. Still no feedbacks, do you really manage your emails for feedbacks and troubleshooting? This is one of my hatest that developer is not checking the player's feedback that's why there is no improvement. Fix this asap or else if there is another game that are good more than your game, it's your lost. Sorry if i have a wrong grammar. Thanks.",
        "I got some problem. My device cannot see the 'ground' when its near enough. It span at least for 1 or 2 km and i can see through the 'ground' i can also see trees, bushes, stones and buildings on top of high ground which usually blocked by ground. And that make matters more worse, u can see players walking around on top of hill when im from the bottom",
        "First of all. It's an excellent game compared to other survival games amongst its categories. However, I experience an insane amount of lag for the first 10-15 mins inside the game!  Definitely unplayable! It takes a huge amount of luck to survive in this type of frustration. Please fix this issue real soon!",
        "Good game .... For your information I have Redmi note 4 (4 GB ram) .. Sometimes it works AWESOME but sometimes it lags like hell.. the player cannot move from the position in the game. The player keeps coming back to the same position.... don't know why it happens sometimes, otherwise AWESOME game ...but please netease ... PLZZZZZZ fix this and plz let pc server and mobile server play together in one match, like the fortnight mobile game has done it....... It will increase the interest and fun..!!",
        "Your game lags way to much that it made my phone glitch out. Please fix your issues. This is not fair for me to lose due to your inability to moderate a game you created. If you don't fix it then please remove it from the marketplace. Until you fix this it's impossible to play"

It happened only once; looked like the opponent was hacking the game. He was potting all of the balls like that, and there was also full network. If you can fix it, then the game can be improved.",

The Irish and Indian flag are kind of similar so im guessing thats where the issue is coming from.  I cant seem to edit my location either.  Would be great if someone could help but if not, ill be happy to continue playing against random beautiful Indian women 😁",

I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "First of all It's joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱",
        "I realize y'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don't pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I'm pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It's a pretty good app and I've sent many people to download your app.",
        "8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don't win any games until those coins are over and I'm only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don't know why this is happening but it sucks because it's putting me off the game.. it's like 8 ball is making sure I'm losing hence the rate 3"

        "Sad and pathetic that after months still no complying to the latest Android standards. Deleting account and uninstalling. Unity in design is important to me. This is the only square icon. Apple manages to do that. Google offers a chance to do the same and it is ignored. So now I'm ignoring you. Bye. Previous feedback: No support for Android Oreo 8.0/8.1 (Adaptive Icons). And please don't just shrink the icon and use a white background. Looks ugly. It has 2 layers: icon and background. Quick and easy to implement! Thanks :)",
        "Too many cheaters that aren't caught+accounts suspended/cancelled. Seen enough gyms taken down/built up without any actual players in the vicinity.  Should have given an automatic single level increase to both items and Pokemon storage with introduction of new items and Pokemon.",
        "After the last update everything went well. But its stupid that no help came from niantics devs, not even a sorry. This all the stars I can give to them for the sake of me getting to play the game against .",
        "Still needed more testing It felt like a rushed product. Had very few features it was advertised to have. Last update took away more than it gave. If anything it feels like they've put less pokemon spawns out there than when it launched. If this trend continues it was just a very short-lived success only due to the name of the product used... has potential to be better but is being squandered on \"fixing\" things nobody is too concerned with like changing clothes or text errors.",
        "All of a sudden I am not allowed to play this game on my Nexus 5 (when it was working on prior versions). I just get the message \"My Device is not compatible with Pokemon Go\"... Great job guys for blocking someone who wants to play legally from playing...",
        "This game is still fun thanks to new Pokemon and new challenges. If you like collecting, want a reason to walk more, or just like finding and trading up cute and cool pokemon, this game is still a delight. Receiving a bonus for even slight everyday use has led me to get out of the house more, and Pokewalks have become a fun couples activity for me and my fiancé.  The updated gym system makes it easier to earn coins, but frequent sales might lead you to still buying them."

        "It's a great game. I have a few suggestions, though. You could add siblings to the character/life, I think there's somethings you can do with that. Maybe put an option to come from a poor, average, or wealthy family, too? Also, everytime I age, it stops my memberships to art class, music class, and gym. It would be greatly appreciated if you could fix that. How about pets, as well? And friends.",
        "This isnt really even a game it is more like if you could control almost everyting you did in your life. It is extremley interesting and i wasted hours on this game when i was supposed to do some self assigned homework😂😂 my guy died in prison and he had 6 kids. He lived a good life. He had over 1 million dollars in cash and in net worth. RIP sean. You will be missed",
        "I am beyond addicted to this! It really is a lot of fun! But you have to have strategy to get things done right. I'd like more options to do things so hopefully there will be updates. All and all great time killer and I'm so happy it's on no wifi too! Great app",
        "Very run game.  Just wish you could save your progress when you have to exit out for a phone call, text messages, reboot the device or anything that requires you to exit.  That's the only reason I gave 4 🌟's. Once they add save life option I will change to 5 🌟's. Great game though. Would recommend everyone to try this game.",
        "Very nice. I think more careers should be added maybe a family tree option and being able to play on as one of your children? Maybe make transitioning easier it's kind of hard to and takes many lives to get it. Also maybe different traits could be unlocked like 'baby momma' or 'alcoholic'. Overall I love the game and it's very addictive nice game.",
        "GREAT GAME I think this game is worthy of 5 stars. The concept and simplicity of the game is really good. It makes you think about how short life really is and how your actions affect the future. I wish they could add more possibilities to the game. Like more unexpected thing like diseases and conflicts. Make the game unpredictable too. And i wish that they would add more varieties of jobs. I managed to live a perfect life while having perfect stats just in my second try so spicing up the game would be nice."

        "So nice to sit and enjoy a game of challenge. Almost as much fun as chess, but easier to carry. Great way to relax while waiting for the zombie apocalypse or the bus to come. Thank-you and keep up the awesome work.  *UPDATE* 17 FEB 2018.  Have started my friends and family trying to get Top Score. No one is really trying as they are all enjoying playing the app to care. Brought a tear to my eye. Once again, \"Thank-you\"  for a truly  wonderful game.",
        "Simple tile game with a nice learning curve. Easy enough to be able to relax while playing and challenging enough to not be boring.  Instant gratification for finishing levels, packs, and difficulty ratings.  There are 'rolling points' that I haven't figured out the use for yet. Coins to purchase hints and other stuff. The ball can have different 'skins' that you unlock as you complete grpups of packs.  TLDR?  I'm having fun. Maybe you can too.",
        "The graphics, controls, n the gameplay are ALL 5 by me. I was expecting this game to be boring but finally, i downloaded it n it was a BLAST! I could NEVER take my eyes off this game as its AMAZINGLY fun. I was not expecting it to be THAT fun, but it was!!! There is absouloutly NOTHING WRONG about this game. The only  thing that is wrong is when people say bad things about this game. But there are NO glitches, barely no adds n NO expectations! This game is absouloutly my MOST favourite  game OF ALL the others.👍",
        "5 Stars simply because it fulfills its role as a casual puzzle game with ease. Game requires you to make a path for the ball as it adds more complicated maps and other map features as you advance through the game.",
        "Great game. Starts easy so you can get your eye in and then gets harder. Fun to play and not so difficult that you give up and uninstal. Ads are over fairly quickly and I like that you can choose to watch some to get extra coins.",
        "When the first time I saw the fame I thought that it would be a very boring game. When I saw it multiple times and red the rewies of other people I downloaded it finally. And it over come to be an amazing game."

I understand it will be discontinued in June and I wish it wasn't so.    ...Hey Uno & Friends, could you please not ask me to rate an app I've already rated??? I was asked to read it again and then I came back to find I had made that specific request not to ask me to re-rate something. Your app needs to be reprogrammed so it knows if someone has rated it or not. (sigh)",

When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",

Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",

These uno players are ready to rock this app! You will never not have people playing. It would be kind of cool if you could create your own avatar though.. & pick outfits and such. Not necessary, but a fun little quirk (:",
        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it."

        "This is by far the best chess \"trainer\" for me.  It's got a nice flow and the game isn't \"stupid\" like most other chess apps/games I've played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I'm making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.",
        "I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!",
        "I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn't show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.",
        "Simply Amazing Graphics. Gives real chess game feel. Great work developers!!! Pls make rules column in settings for beginners. I wonder why people call this a bad game if they can't complete levels. You need to try harder.. I Reached middle level in 6 games, It was a good game..",
        "So far it's o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It's not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game",
        "The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw."

Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.During the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.Chess is popular and is often played in competitions called chess tournaments. It is enjoyed in many countries, and is a national hobby in Russia.Features:- five different themes- seven levels of difficulty- two players mode- game assistant (Helper)- realistic graphics- sound effects- small size",

Along with finishing a constant 16th about 95% of the time make me think it's rigged. What's up with that??",
        "Fantastic concept and artwork and potentially amazing game ruined by a half arsed tutorial and lack of information, pure laziness.  The fun of the game turns to frustration as you get good distance and terrible scores, but why? You assume landings but the game gives you no information on correct technique. Also same for takeoff and mid air lift.   Come on devs its lazy and ruining a game with huge potential. Uninstalled...",
        "The game has a great Idea to it, but it really needs so tweaking in the physics deparment of the game, on certain Stages I go further with a Bad Jump then a Excellent one, and the wind doesnt really play that much of an effect in the game. But overall great and fun game, amd very addictive.",
        "Took me a little while to get the hang of the controls but it's fun once you do. Could maybe do with some hints to help get the best body position in flight, as this took me a while to figure out. Otherwise, it's a good time sink.",

It shows me the loading screen for five minutes, then crashes. It would be wonderful if there could be a fix for this.",
        "I recommend anybody who is reading this review should play the game. The game is way more better than the original Sims. Plus it's free. And it's a lot more realistic. Only thing is it does need Wi-Fi and it takes up a lot of phone space but it doesn't drain out my data too quick. Seriously I rated 5 stars for the quality and the quests.",
        "I like this game so much (it's so much better when you are a VIP 15 player) but it's unplayable without tons of LPs and SPs (takes so much time to complete some simple actions) other than this it's the best life simulator game",

        "I played this on my old phone which was a Moto but yesterday my phone broke on me so I went and got a new phone it's downloaded quick but when I tried to open it it's keep saying \"Sims free play as stopped working\" and it's really annoying me since I loved playing this game and I reached level 12 on my old phone and I can't even play it anymore.... PLEASE FIX IT",

        "NejiOmeGa here!🙏 I have got to say this game is a \"quick paste first place!\" type of game and I love it so far been training like a pro to be on top!!🙇 I've loved it ever since the updates, oh yes did I mention I'm a returning player?? An exquisite job well done I have so many new opportunities to reveal, but so many opponents to show who's Royals! So all is said I just ask that you watch and battle me tuff clasherz😂😂",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "Well after playing it for so many months. It now has not let me play for about a  week out of no where, it loads to 50% and then it asks to try again later I have uninstalled it many times and retried time after time. All of my other games work just not this one. Don't really know what to do. It sucks because this is my favorite game too.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖",
        "This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game."

        "great game, so much fun and very addictive and a great time killer. can make friends from all over the world. i get great gifts for playing everyday. if you like this type of game you need to download this one, even if you have never tried a game like this please just give it a try. i had never played any kind of game like this and now i play 3 different ones everyday, so take it from me give it a try cause you never know you may become a daily player like me. THANK YOU GoG  for this GREAT GAME.",
        "It's great game more addictive than any other game I've played I've even caught myself  ignoring my console games just to play this more. You don't need more than 5 bucks to be a GOAT you just need to understand how to build you kingdom how you like. For instance,  I like to have more troops then building up my kingdom so I go for my troops, troop research, my wall defense and my troop resource gathering and resource load capacity. I've never played this type of game but it was easy to catch on. Please consider playing this game and come battle me.",
        "A giant mess of people who pay a ton of money to prey on anyone with impunity. Absolutely no rules regarding who or how often you can attack someone significantly lower in level. Even if you are stupid enough to pour money into this garbage, you will get your butt handed to you by someone else.",
        "Really just downloaded it to leave this. Saw an ad for this that clearly wasn't this game. The RTS they show is Cossacks: European War (or at least one of its sequels). It's a great older game on PC. This on the other hand is a pay to play monstrosity. So save yourself the hassle. Also seeing if I get the generic \"people don't have to pay etc.\" response from dev or if they have a defense for the false advertising.",
        "See the ad every time theres an ad playing so I said hey why not. The game doesnt even start. Lol what a joke. Maybe some marketing dollars should be saved and used for development. I am convinced your company has no financial, software OR marketing epertise. Lmao get ur old jobs if u can.",
        "This is for the makers of this game you need to introduce rules so that players who either work for the makers or spend 100's to become strong very quickly... cannot destroy the enjoyment of the game for those of us who would like to grow in the game and play the game properly to become strong through perseverance and hard work... the cash rich players are ruining this game for everyone..."

        "Frustrating! Whilst it appears I have the tactical acumen of a cabbage, this game is frustratingly addictive! Only slight quibbles is the music is annoying so I have to mute the phone and it would be interesting if all the blocks were repeated in all directions. Ie 'L' shape on its left side on its door side, upside down etc.",
        "Update sucks big time. If you mute the game, you'll hear music. If you unmute the game, you hear the blocks. The only way you can play silently is to turn off your phone's media volume which is annoying. If you cannot mute it ingame, why do you need that bottom then? 😬😬😬",

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "Honestly gameplay and all is good but the game is so p2w it's not funny, it would cost u over a hundred dollars just to complete every reward for new Valentine's event. If you like this game play private server instead this version is a giant cash grab. Not competitive for f2p at all",
        "There is certainly alot to do, but is there really much to DO do? I've just been continually tapping red dots and getting free prizes, which (although nice) doesn't feel like I'm especially earning anything, you know?  Feels like a game that will keep you occupied for maybe months, but a year after you delete it will you really REMEMBER it? Probably not.",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend."

        "Its a legit fun game to play but...  For me I get streshed because when I need to do it over again then u  streshed by not doing it...    Its still kind of a good game though..  Also on YT thanks for...   !!!! 2 SUBSCRIBERS!!!!  I know its not alot but I am rlly happy and I'm thankfully to who subscribed to me on YT :)  My name was galaxy DJ but now..  Its AngelPlayz I haven't even uploaded any videos yet 😂😂 but thanks for the support!  I might be making new videos about roleplays bloxburg builds and games to enturtain u guys to not be bored!!   I LIKE TACCCCOOOOSSSSSSSSS.....  🍍🍍🍍 .. This is so long lol...   Sorry how this is so long 😂😂😂😂 Well yeah that's all I got to say..!!?  Cya peace GUYS🍍🍍",
        "Its a really good game but they should make it a bit easier. They should have a thing where they ask your age so that they can determine the hardness of the level. But good game I would try it. One question for RobTop games, though, what is with the \"buy full version\" how is there a full version. Reply to me robtop. I need to know. Not sure about it but worth a try and see if you like it. # Amsam production review.",
        "The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won't annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie",
        "This game is fun and great but there are too many advertisements and always make me feel annoyed by that. Please fix this and I will rate 4 or if it is better,5.  it was 2015 when i said this. now it is 2018. NO CHANGE. all the ads were still there!!!!! so everytime i want to try again, AN AD WILL POP UP AND BRING ME TO THE PLAY STORE AGAIN.",
        "Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it's fun because it's challenging and there's super fun things in GD except hacking because that's no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I'm super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂",
        "Well, I admit, I'm addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn't be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can't Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍"

        "It's a pretty solid game the only thing worth mentioning is if you could imply that when you win a shirt that you actually have to pay for it. After a level when it pops up it seems free and I wasted 400 coins on shirts accidentally. Other than that its pretty good",
        "Great game, ads can be blocked without a connection to the internet, but if you're on a streak or attempting a challenge, using one for a continue is nice. I'm honestly addicted, shooting my little comrads to safety.",
        "This game does not have a casual mode so every time you play its time sensitive. This greatly reduced playability. Coupled with the most jerky aiming I have ever used brought this game down to a solid 2⭐.",
        "I truly enjoyed this game. I have been playing frequently for about two weeks. I loaded the game to continue farming for stars to see everything has been wiped as if I just freshly installed it. Seems I'm not the only one this has happened to. Developer: restore what other individuals and I have bought and achieved please. Very unhappy"

        "This game could use better and easier ways to earn money for opening the chests and scoring or pay outs after each prize or game. So you can get better equipment and achievements. Would help keep players more interested. My only dislikes so far. I most definitely enjoy the game and think it's pretty awesome!",
        "Great game. It is easy to use but still challenging. The controls are smooth and consistent and there are plenty of things you can purchase but don't have to to enjoy the game. Only reasons for losing a star is no way to play alone or practice, it has to be against someone. Also, there is not a way as far as I can find, to turn off notifications. Lastly, it does use battery pretty fast. Is is not a \"battery killer\", but does drain it faster than other games. However it probably does take a bit of power for all this game does.",
        "Excellent game against real people who reply to you if you click one of the comments (for those who say it's a computer we play against). My only problem with it is there should be an option to buy gems with coins rather than have to always pay real cash for gems. If it had this option I'd give 5 stars!",
        "Was fun at first, then massive losing streak due to other players making every single shot perfect.  But most of the time when I start spending money I do better.  Odd.  I think I found a cheater during a putt.  He lined up correctly, however with the power he should have missed the hole.  I tried to watch the replay, but it is the only replay unavailable.  Then when we do the tie breaker shootout, he hits with pinpoint accuracy on the edge of the rough/fairway to get within 2 ft of the hole.",
        "After playing for a while it just isn't that great.  It shows too much of what other people are doing and then makes you go first.  Which is the opposite of competitive. I've now tried for a few months but honestly it's designed to make you spend cash.  I still play a little but constantly think about uninstalling it.  It gives you a free golden tee shot maybe once a week.  The rewards are meh... Because you know if you won too much you wouldn't need to spend real cash.  For the amount of rewards you get it should play the free golden tee shot 3 times a week.  The best feature is that you can save a shot and upload to YouTube easily.",
        "Rigged. I have lost 12 straight at a much lower level than I'm qualified for, while playing several holes consecutively without a bad shot. Opponents keep making miracle shots, while my perfect shots are suddenly unaffected by the wind, or end up six inches into the rough. This game sucks.  Rigged against players who don't pay."

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "This game is definitely extremely addicting! I find myself playing this game more than any other. I'd give this game 4 stars simply because there are way too many locked boxes that I have on my land that I can't open. I think there should be an easier way to get purple gems or have a way to get them on every level we beat. Atleast 5 gems each time. I have over 50 locked boxes",
        "I actually really like it. But since the new update yesterday there is no chance to get \"rid\" of the chests without paying. This is annoying. I have not the space respectively the storage to keep them",
        "Don't waste your time. The good reviews are for a different version. There is a point when everything just stops and you are lucky to do 1 merge of anything in an hour. They are really trying to force you into being a sucker and they are pushing the limits on the time so you spend LOTS OF REAL MONEY. Over an hour wait to move 1 thing?? I am going to send a google report about this one.",
        "save to facebook is broken. twice I have saved to facebook, then uninstalled and re-installed the game to fix crashing issues. the first time, I lost a day's play. so the second time I was very careful, checked to make sure it had saved \"just now\". that time, I lost 2 days of play.  a save game feature that loses days of achievements is garbage.",
        "Unhappy with how the game keeps kicking me out and when I go back in I find my progress has been deleted. As if I hadn't done anything. Especially after I spend money to buy gems."

        "I've liked this game for years. Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you're still coasting or you're in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You've had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven't fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!",

I hope my tears will help u guys. :)",

I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it's just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............",
        "Great game, but I only have one issue which prevents me from giving 5 stars. This issue is that the hot rod doesn't go as fast as it should, I know this because I have grown up around hot rods and Rockabilly since birth. This is only a small problem for me, but it prevents me from enjoying the game as much as I'd like to. Please improve it.",

Not to mention they keep upgrading and making it beter and better, keep it up fellas....i havent experienced any of the problems mentioned withthe updates others have but until then great game"

        "This game is awesome and I love playing it. Im trying to build a massive farm in the village. Great time killer and addictive.You can build anything. The down side is though, that if youre building an enclosed area, the villagers get in and you have to wait for them to get out so you   can close it.",
        "You shouldn't have a certain amount of blocks. Also you shouldent have to unlock everything except for the basic packs. The way you have to jump I am not a fan of I wish it was on the other side. Lastly is it would be nice to have doors,so the viligers couldn't get into your house. One more thing is I wish you didn't have all of these assignments to do to get money and diamonds.",
        "This game is amazing. It wastes your spare time which is great. Just one problem. The blocks go down too quickly can you make it so the blocks dont go down?  Thank you!",
        "I like it I just  really want more  jums and the videos only  work  sometimes. I don't  like   how  people  go in to my house and I  don't  like it  how you  have  build  the building  to level up  when I was  playing  it  made me  do a building  that you have to  unlock  the  building",
        "I love this game Ssssssoòoo amazing u can build anything and explore more thing u can build ur own house and decorate it the perfect game for me . Install this game amazing.👆👍👍👌👌",
        "It is excellent but please fix my problem with the blocks when you get to level 3 the blocks have a number when it's number end we can't build a building"

        "When it's not crashing, it's fun to play.  Sucks when it doesn't load of locks up during game play.  Also it gets expensive as you have to buy packs at $99 a pop after the 1st 2.  The game play is addicting, but no fun if you cannot afford the special offers they continue to throw in your face every time you log in.  I love final fantasy games but this particular one is a money pit!.  Not to mention the constant crashing",
        "Please understand that there is really nothing free about this game except the install. While the gameplay WAS very promising at first, purchaseable bonus packs take any strategy completely out of the game. Now, in addition, each new element of the game that has been released in recent weeks requires cash to unlock. I can only use about half of the games features now. Bummer. If you're willing to pay, have a blast with this game. Otherwise leave it alone!",
        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15"

        "Ive been playing this since the beginning and noticed that its amazingly improving and getting  more fun and playable. Yet something is missing an that is coop or multiplayer where u can fight, build etc in thr beginning till the end. If they can add multiplayer, I know that many more will play and i have no doubt that it will be a great benefit to the devs! Still its a great game and it just needs coop or multiplayer. I say to them\"Keep up the good work!\" Also check \"Outlived\"Ul see what i mean :)",
        "Very fun to play and really addictive. The only problem I really have is the levelling system. Don't get me wrong it is a good idea to need to be a certain level before you can unlock items, however it doesn't make sense that your HP and other stats stay the Same, as if you were still a Lv1 player. Lv20 vs Lv1. Both as strong as each other (if you ignore weapons an armor). Like I wrote, it doesn't make that much sense and spoils the game slightly.",
        "Overall the game is fine. I'm satisfied with the graphics as well as the up-to-date events and the recent update having new weapons and pieces of clothing. PLEASE GIVE ME JUST 4 ENGINE PARTS AND JUST A CHOPPER GAS TANK then I PROMISE I WILL RATE YOU 5 STARS VS RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ALL OF MY FRIENDS! I open the boxes in Bunker Alfa for so many times then I get 5 chopper wheels and I have no choice but delete it :( I'm trying to be patient... Please I need those parts!!!",
        "Good Game But It Needs Some Pets, Some Robotic Armor, Level 5 Walls, Bunker Alfa 5 and 6 Floor , ATV , Helicopter, Repair Lab And Etc. So please Kefir! Do this Changes In The next Update or After 1 Mounth. And Good Luck For Making Grim Soul Survival and Last Day On Earth Survival a good!",
        "Love it but would be better if I didn't lose all my stuff when I die. Sometime when I go to an area and die then return my body is not there only to lose every thing.  Should also be a way to fix weapons and armor. Melee weapon.. perhaps add a fix option for lol 40 stuff.. 2 stars till it's fixed",
        "This game is very fun and addictive! I got right into it as soon as i started to play. The only thing i would recommend is changing the price of the chests. I feel you would get alot more revenue if they were marked down. The game is going to be alot better when you open it up multi-player. Can't wait for clans."

        "Way too difficult. One mistake and you could loose weeks worth of stuff. Stronger players can easily keep you from growing and advancing in the game. It's taking me 4 times as long to grow as my friends. You have too spend a lot of real money to be able to keep up with the competition. I have played for 114 days and have made no progress hardly. With 350k dead troops",
        "This game could get 5 stars if there was a limit on who can attack based on size/strength - as it stands, you are constantly attacked by players 20, 50 or even 100+ times your size, which totally negates lots of time and effort taken to advance in the game.  There is no way to retaliate, even if you play as a group.  This seems to be a common complaint, yet the developer does nothing about it.",
        "Please be advised that this game will not let you change your location after level 5 unless you pay cash, then you can't move to any world that is less than 80 days old. And they won't refund your cash. It's a shame they hustle you like this because it is a cute game. But you get robbed and can t play with friends already in it",

Because of inventing this fake game in the name of god.I have just deleted this game.The best game company is COCO and .",
        "Until they have a cap on how low someone can attack you don't play this game. There is no way a level 25 should attack a level 12 . This game is just out for your MONEY"

These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.",
        "I have now completed a 365 day streak... During this past year of playing this game daily, I've had an idea. What if once you hit a certain amount of streak days you unlock a new something? Like a new pack or flow color? That would be nice so that you are working towards something. :)",
        "I loved flow free from a young age. I've played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I've tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs",
        "Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.",
        "Was a great game until about 48 hours ago. I didn't mind the ads but now after every level I complete there's a video ad. Even then I would deal with it but it closes my music player. So after the ad I have to go to the music player and start it again but then when I switch back to the game I have to relaunch and reselect the level. Gets annoying to have to do after every level"

        "i NEVER got my 3x gold pack for completing the legendary championship challenge that i worked so hard to get(required 500pts, i had 550pts. And they said i can catch the legendary shark with just a basic lure, well i was grinding at it like 8hrs a day and not even once. And my lure is fully upgraded and using PRO gear. SCAM!!! All that work 4nothing.",
        "Crashes/freezes way too much to be worth my time. Oh, and be prepared to pour money into this game. Opponent \"magically\" catches a monster fish with 2 seconds left in every 1 on 1 match and wins. A complete scam and money pit.",
        "Everything is pretty amazing tbh. But still some bugs that annoys me. Like this morning came 4th in championship but when silver pack was on its way my screen just went blue and nothing more happened.. Closed app restarted yet nothing.. And I mean ppl pay for buffs.so yeah I got ripped off. But overall amazing.",
        "At the start you can play for about 1-2hrs; Then you have to wait for 8 more hours because you can't upgrade anything, or earn anything. From then on it's more of a chore then anything fun. The game starts out confusingly so lots will spend the free in game currency they give you, that you desperately need to speed up pack openings! Then before you even know how the game progresses they ask for a review, and reward the player for giving a 4 or 5 star rating(these are the only options). Not very admirable practice in my opinion! They have a solid foundation of a good \"FTP\" game; But seems like they are more interested in making money then developing a desirable gaming experience.",
        "Very nice and clean interface, easy controls and after playing for hours, I have yet to see any ads. That means a lot to me and I feel more compelled to spend money with them just for not being hounded for it."

The game itself is a lot of fun. I enjoy it a lot and its great time killer. But NOT getting what I PAID FOR does not make me a happy customer. This issue needs to be addressed and fixed.",
        "I 9/10 love this companies games however this game has Flaws. You will have nothing that hits the bottom and it will say game over. I am not happy with it ! The ads literally make you click on it and then take you to Google Play store to download it which is very annoying. I would not download it not a good one.",
        "Way too many ads. Every two games you get 30 seconds of advertisment. At one point an ad popped up during my game and made me lose. Played this for 5 minutes and uninstalled, dont even bother to download the game.",
        "Like previous reviews said; great game but the problem is with the ads. I PAID for the ads to be removed and it did nothing. In my opinion an ad after every game is over kill. Like the other Voodoo games. Have the ad bar like every other game, then when someone hits the save me button that is when you force someone to watch the ad. It's a give and take scenario that has worked very well for other games. I'll waste 30 secs of my life to have a second chance but I will not after every game.    I am very annoyed that I paid money to remove ads and they didn't fix it. Ratings like this will continue if you do not fix this issue asap",
        "I always play games with music in the background and while playing this game my music would be constantly shut off because of the ads, I don't mind the ads themselves, just the fact that it constantly interrupts other sounds playing on the system is very irritating.

And it's already beginning to to tick me off. Come on, fix this. I understand the ads if I wamt to continue my score, but I paid for pop-ups and other ads to dissappear entirely. It'll get a better score when the issue is resolved."

        "This game is literally rigged so that you only win 50-60% of your matches.  You can only advance by continuing to actually play, they will purposely match you with opponents you can't beat then once you have a few losses they give you easy opponents to run over.  The pattern has become so predictable that it's annoying.  One moment you'll win  5 matches then immediately lose 5.  Boring, predictable, rigged.  The formula reminds me of Hearthstone",
        "Nice game to play during your free time. One thing I found a bit annoying is the chest. U have to wait for 1 chest to open only then u can start another chest and wait for another 4/8 + hours to unlock that chest. Why can't wait for some hours to open all the chests simultaneously? Pls give it a thought.",
        "A Good game  If only there were some private mission or some things would have been challenging and intriguing. And waiting for a chest box to open is really awful. It would be great if there was an upgrade system without the chest it would make things more better.",
        "Its a bit og a joke, got to 1000 trophys in a flash and now stuck between 1100-1300 for weeks. Highly inconsistent with cards opposition have same cards but serm to get to use them way faster then you. A ploy to get u to buy coims probaby against bots",
        "Loving it, what a surprise!!!!! I was not expecting this game to be a blast to play. It's only been 30mins since I downloaded this app..... I'm so pleased I did. What are you waiting for???? I'm just a guy who will tell you the truth as to whether I like something or I don't. Sadly it's been awhile since I have had  that excited stupid look on my face, believe it's very silly looking and I love it. Cheers and thanks to the folks who put the hard work in to create this piece of joy.",
        "Mediocre game, extremly unbalanced, especialy come time for competions for prizes. You can barley make the castle requirement to compete and they pair you up aginst players who have top tier cards from the last castle. The only way to realy progress is to spend money. I spent 30 dollars and pushed up a little bit but not alot.  You would have to spend hundreds."

        "I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.",
        "I think it would be better if you got more gems. You can barely win anything on that little slot machine. I also noticed that you no longer get gems for every day you log in to play. Sure, the money is nice but you can't upgrade with just the money you earn while playing. I spun that slot machine 80 plus spins and barely won anything. Do the gems even pop up as a winning combo? They used to but not anymore.",
        "I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It's pricey but we'll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn't need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get",
        "I loved the game but after the first restaurant you need gems to upgrade things regularly and they do not come around often after the first restaurant. All the achievements are money based. Money is easy to come by and I have only won on the casino once and all the fun is lost grinding to make money to spend on the slot machine to try and get gems. I'm on the second restaurant and I'm bored of waiting for gems to upgrade now.",
        "They should call the game Cooking Fever Lite just because that is honestly what you get with this game. Fun and addictive in the beginning, but eventually you realize the grind for gems has low yield and is largely chance based, and the rate of growth for your restaurants significantly lessens. It drains the appeal if you're looking for a fun freebie.",
        "It would be nice for updated casino with new slot machine games and also some new restaurants.  Last one was quite sometime ago?  Are you still actively developing the game or you called it quits like some other games I had to uninstall because there was nothing left to do in them.  Just curious....."

It says it failed because I would not allow them access to my friends list. Something doesn't seem right about that. Never had a game NOT allow me to login, after denying access to my friends list. Sorry, would prefer you not send messages to all my friends with my name tagged on it.",
        "Fantastic game.I am loving this game. Still there is few problem.Miniclips please solve the issues. After players matching ,game is hacked/stopped by several times.Only way to win that kind of match,any of one player has to quit or network issues.Its waste of time,also harm for devices (battery drainage,high heating). So,admin plz look after these prob.Why it's hanging or hacking.",
        "As football based game it is superb, in terms of gameplay, graphics etc. But the biggest idiotic part of this game is that if freezes like magic. The whole game main screen becomes unresponsive and stays like that no matters the game is restarted or the damn phone is. Get this thing sorted out Miniclip. You have a reputation to maintain or not?",
        "I think this game is a really fun addicting game. The main reason why I got it was because of 8 ball pool. That game is also very fun. The only thing I don't like about football strike is that when I get on sometimes it won't let me click the spinner. So it's like my phone froze. But my phone didn't freeze. It's just the app. So can you guys please fix this.",
        "At first I was skeptical about this game. I had downloaded it and went without playing for a couple of weeks. Then,one day I just happen to open the app and play. Best move I ever made for an app! This game is just flat out addicting, fun and challenging.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much fun it is and that there is, most of the time, something new.  Chalkenign friends and new people always makes for a challenging and fun time waster. Even if I don't have the time to play, I still make time!! Haha",
        "Edit: Got worse because it costs me money & gold and the broken controls are causing losses. Uninstalling.  Defense. It's broken. I just tracked the touches through the debugger and 2 out of 5 times I swipe right up, but the goalie jumps down. Fix that or many people will switch to other games.. I know I will."

        "Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It's nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don't want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn't get a key.",
        "All in all it is a really great game there are very few ads, its fun, the graphics are crisp. Its amazing except for one thing. On one of the levels all of the monsters have exactly 666 health and im not religious or anything but I'm pretty sure that if some one who is religious see's that, well lets just say that it might not be good for the company, so I suggest you fix this.  Thanks.",
        "Good little time waster, simple classic gameplay but puts its own unique twist on it.   Side note: I clearly played this game more than they thought anyone would as I have started getting repeated designs when I upgrade my spells xD",
        "It stopped working on my One plus! Help! I was excited about the side games! *********************************** Excellent, addictive fun. I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn't level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can't progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.",
        "Fun game. But it's a crapshoot if you can watch adds to use those two spells. I don't mind watching adds to use the spells, but over half the time you just simply can't watch any adds. Some times you can watch 6 in a row if you want, other games you can't watch a single one. Fix that!!",
        "Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion."

The game is displaying that levels are coming soon, but my questions is when? So pls solve this problem. And pls rply for my review so that I'll understood that u had read my message. Thank u and sry if had hurt u in above msg✌️✌️✌️",

I'm quite interested in finding out what else is in store in this game.",
        "The game is nice, follows its simple rules well. Only issue I find is the slow rise in difficulty, it being that it's easy to pick up but hard to find that point where its difficult. Otherwise, its a good way to pass the time. Also I do like some of the soundtrack.",
        "Don't want to play hours of boring levels to get to (hopefully) more difficult stuff. I would have no issue if the levels were at least different from each other. It takes merely 10 seconds to get through the starting levels but there are just too many. It's wasteful.",
        "Good for burning time. Fun puzzler. The ads are atrocious; I understand wanting to get something out of your creation, but I'm burning through levels so quickly it seems like ads are every few seconds. The game isn't exciting enough for me to buy ad-free. They're pop up ads, which are the worst kind for accidental clicking.",

Please comment back so I know you read it. I am urging you to do something about the problem. Please if you do comment back note if I offended you anyway. If you fix this issue I have you will be getting 1 extra star then you will have 5 of me. Please consider this carefully"

Adverts are frustrating but necessary unless you want to pay to stop, BUT very annoying when they pop up as you just lifted a puzzle piece and because of advert it just drops randomly. Also being able to rotate pieces would be handy, granted not as challenging however.",

        "Very good game and a great time killer. It can take some time to get your team up to strength to fight certain levels. They have spoiled the game slightly with the all new alliance wars  that some people didn't want. It's impossible to find items to ascend your hero's to the next level to make them stronger. Also to level up troops it costs a lot of in game food to level them up. You need a lot of patience to play this game. If not then don't download. I wish I hadn't now.",
        "I've been playing this game for sorry one year now and I do like it but it has a few flaws.  It takes a very long time to level up heroes, it's very hard to get good heroes because it's just by chance, and you don't get very many gems at a time if you want to get anywhere in this game you have to spend money.  Now they have a VIP 4.99 for a month you get 30 gems a day, and extra regular summon, and instead of just be able to upgrade one building at a time you can do two at a time.  It really is helping me get all my buildings to the same level. There is also alliance wars now and they also have challenges.  With a few tweaks I would give this game 5 stars hands down.  I definitely recommend it.",
        "Great if you buy your way through the game. The fun lasts a few hours and then it's an endless grind of frustration. You won't get any better characters unless you purchase them with microtransactions and will lose....... A LOT.  Greed wins and the sheep that can throw their money at a mobile game will triumph.",
        "Feels like there's too much going on at once with the base and everything, and it eats up an ungodly amount of battery... But it's a cool game! Match 3 with strategy RPG assets. The strongest point is definitely the art.",
        "I enjoyed this game for some time but after a while your forced to spend real money & or grind & grind to be able to level to be decent enough to get anywhere.! Would be nice if you could watch videos to get free stuff besides only 1 per day.."

Second make all types of tools available i got to level 10 and needed  sissors but need 500 coins  and its impossible to earn that many so you need to use real money and well frankly thats BS. Also need to work on the accuracy of the tools.  This has potential and a great start  but needs some work. I will be deleting it in hopes someday you will put some more effort  foreward.",

        "It's sad to see people complaining and giving bad reviews about crashing but not knowing it's probably because their device is  g a r b a g e. I have j3 6 which is pretty bad and still runs well. Very optimized, sleek game. Also alot of updated to keep the game fresh and the microtransactions are very fair.",
        "Very fun game, wish it wasn't energy based, would definitely enjoy it more. The fishing is 'new' right now and i have to say the percentages are garbage. 75 percent is more like 50, 50 percent is like 10 percent,  25 percent is closer to 50. This is just my personal experience. The games is really fun though, expect to get annoyed with the fishing percentages however. Also energy gets spent super fast in this game, very fun yet very limited.",
        "I fell in love with this game as soon as I opened it the first time. But there is a problem which forces me to give it a 2 star rating. It kicks me out of the game every 5 minutes and that way I can't get any progress done. I absolutely enjoyed the little playtime I got and I want to play it more but it won't let me. Great job otherwise devs!",
        "Fun and amazing game, great time killer for me, I just love these pixelated games so much.. to be fair it sounds like it's more Terraria and pokemon mixed typa thing y'know.. 5 stars",
        "Been playing this for about a week.  It's a lot of fun with a variety of different things to do.  Running out of energy for doing dungeons doesn't matter a lot as there are three or four other things to do in game that don't require energy.  Will be making a purchase to support the devs.  Good game!",
        "The one and only terrible thing in this game is the energy system. The fact that you need to wait for half a day for the energy bar or to recharge is just way too much...  I would suggest having the quest to cost half the current energy.  The rest is okay to me"

I again installed it and started from the beginning and after completing 573 games & 1487 stars I am giving you just 2star rating because game lag all the time sometimes the ads got struck or maybe during rewind I lose my $1 but the game didn't rewind back instead crash and auto shutdown and I ahve to start the application again. Before adding 30th season please update your games stability it will be more useful.",
        "Surprised at how good this game is... very clever concept and I'm only half an hour into it and I'm already hooked! Recommend it to anyone who's a fan of football, well in fact, anyone who's a fan of gaming in general... well worth checking out, chuffed I came across it. 5***** for all features from me. The developers really did a fine job. Get it now is my advice! Peace out people :)",
        "Would like more customisation options for my character. This game keeps crashing for no reason and doesn't like to reward it's loyal users. It is a fun game if they just let you play it. Fun game, but the gold farming and inattentiveness to what the users want will ruin it. Great game, lots of potential if taken in the right direction, but WAY to glitchy.",
        "Like most other games, there is too much effort to bait you into micro transactions. The older games were so much better. It's a shame the Devs have resorted to such money grabbing standards.",
        "I like the tactic aspect of it, pretty good time waster. Took me a while to beat it, but didn't have to spend a dollar to do it. The story itself is very unrealistic and after 15 seasons I completely stopped following it and focused only on the games.",
        "There should be a full match game like this that isn't scripted. I love it! Should be an energy free mode maybe? As its a bit pay to win\\microtransaction heavy.  They've made some changes, if you like ads and Facebook popping up after everything you do, then this is the game for you, dropped my rating 1 star as a result.  Also took out the ability to watch adverts for in game currency, now you have to pay. Even more of a cash grab now."

        "I was searching for a new game to play now that I got a better phone. This is the first game of its kind for me. Can't wait to see what other games like this exist, but this one is by far the simplest and best. Some of the prices for stuff is outrageous. My only warning is to not spend money on items that will become useless later. The game constantly changes depending on your current level. 5/5 *",
        "I LOVE this game My only complaint is in campaign mode it's said more worlds coming soon for YEARS!!! If they're not going to add a world eny time soon  they should at least change the coming soon part. But overall this is a good game and it seems like Cubic Games really care about what the consumers think.",
        "I think this game is brilliant. An absolute pleasure to play and I never get bored. This game should be voted one of the best games ever. Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can't join my sister and were only five levels apart.",
        "This game has some faults (microtransactions and pay to win) but overall is amazing. Doesn't need a powerful phone to play, can occupy you for hours, and can help you meet new people. I got this game a month ago and haven't stopped playing since. This is one of my favorite games of all time, over all devices and consoles. I highly encourage you to download this game if you enjoy minecraft-styled graphics and multiplayer fps. And surprisingly there is a truck load of customization: Clan Forts, Home Base, Skin Editor, Armor, Weapons, and Pets. Sandbox has lots of toxicity but is tolerable. Overall 10/10 and a must-get for try hards and casual gamers alike.",
        "once u reach high lvl gems are litteraly near impossible to get. Please add a way where you can buy gems with coins and vice versa also event keys with gems or coins, overall a good game but definitely a pay to win game which I really hate. Also more campaign would be nice as it is promised in the end of the 3rd world.",
        "This used to be really cool. If you want to be strong buy gem weapons. It is too hard too earn coins or.gems. Also your opponents must be with same armor or level. I once fought a guy with the minigun shotgun and diamond armor and before I rekt everyone with the demoman but now it sucks"

Lowering graphics still not effective..... I ve been having 20 fps or less since a month and my kd is 0.91 since a month...... My device is j7 prime if it helps",

Hi, great game but as others mentioned lag issues, can't move at times and my biggest problem is logging in. Gets stuck on authenticating all the time. Even if I get into a game I disconnect consistently. My WiFi and mobile data are not the issue. Please fix asap, I'm sure you are, so we can all get back to enjoying this awesome game. Cheers"

        "Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I'll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx",
        "I'm very upset with this game. I've been playing it for more than two months. I've put a lot of time and effort into this game and I made sure to play it every day for the rewards. Unfortunately, the game started glitching so I uninstalled it  and reinstalled it and all my work is gone. All my money is gone. It's very unfornate. I refuse to start from level one when I was one level 22. I loved this game. Not anymore. 😤",
        "It's a great game at first, but it takes so long to upgrade or save money or anything that you end up spending a lot of your real life money. Plus the surgeries all start to be the exact same, and the glitches... oh, the glitches. Zapped $200,000 out of my bank, and that bloody epinephrine shot is impossible to get without striking out. Oh, and $120,000 for research that will only make you $4,000? Why is everything so time and resource consuming???",
        "Controls don't work properly during surgery! There is lot of lag while performing an action while the timer works properly. Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "Let your app data be backed up... My old phone has to be replaced and after a lot of work everything was still not saved. I feel this is a pretty simple thing to have included and a dumb thing to leave out. Fail. Thanks for taking my money and running.",

What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven't listened to this game's. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I'm entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.",
        "I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it's meant to be \"skillfull\" but thats harder than skillfull, you can't even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don't care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.",

Beautiful game, love to play, just too expensive, and any bought coins don't last long cause losing is so costly. Too bad because it's a fun game.

You have to win at least a couple games without using the free points to purchase additional cards or wild cards, opening up as many cards as possible for as many options and longer streaks, and playing some of the \"cheaper (points wise)\" and easier glade challenges. Winning a games without additional cards barely gets you above where you started and any add'l cards drain you quickly even if you win to the point that you lose all and you have to accumulate another day of points for another 15 minutes of play.  Bonuses are just too slow in coming and wins just don't count for much. I love the peaceful backgrounds and graphics though.",
        "I liked this  game, but each game cost to much to play and you go through credit to fast.  $500 a game, then it goes up pretty fast to $1000 a game, then to $1500 a game, etc... plus reply as wild cards cost a lot.  There are other solitaire   games that are less frustrating  I  would rather play.",

        "This is a jewel in the Talking Tom series.  I am an adult, and I am thoroughly hooked!  I have to be on every day to do the daily challenge, no matter my schedule.  The snowboard side world is amazing.  I have never been able to ride a skateboard, much less a snowboard, but I admire the snowboarders and skateboarders who can.  With this world, I can, and it feels real!  My only caveat is that after Ben's world, there are no more new houses to conquer and work on.  So I earn gold bars and diamonds for nothing.   We advanced players need more houses!  Make Tom a vacation home or hunting cabin, I don't know!   Anyway, love the graphics, even the side ones as I run by don't go unnoticed.",
        "I've got a new phone. All my other games have been put on this device and they are all restored from where I left off from. This game won't let me and I have to start from the beginning which isn't right as I also recently spent money on a character.. put my previous game data back up",
        "Super fun!! You go through sooo many places!! However, the controls are really bad. It's soo choppy. It takes like a hour to load!",
        "Sometimes it's been my favourite game ever but I don't why it is worst controls in all games and it is hanging a lotttt. According to my previous rating I gave it all 5 stars but now I'm giving only 3 stars just becoz of controls just only this.......plz fix this becoz I love these graphics a lott and I have very high scores too. I have sufficient and enough space in my phone and my all other apps are going good but just becoz of this all apps are reacting and it takes a lot of space and hanging a lotttttttt. Plz fix it so that I also give it 5 star rating.😕",
        "I love it. But the only thing DON`T like is turns around while he is runing. Then you hit somthing because you were destracted.😠😠",
        "I think this developed because of true story once 36 years ago a theif  came to a house the watchman was in the garden he don't know the theif stole all gold so this story is developed as a game"

        "Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it's only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that's bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it's a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I'll rate 5 star$",
        "Hey... I would give this game 5 stars but there is 1 main -VE POINT. FUEL takes TOOOOOOOO LONG TO RECHARGE.  The point of this game is to playyyyyy the game. I don't want to keep waiting. I downloaded your great game TO PLAY it. Please try to solve this issue. I will definitely give you 5 stars if you fix this. Please listen to us and read our comments. Most of us are mentioning this 1 -ve point. Thank you",
        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "For a shoot 'em up racing android game it's really addictive. I'm always playing it. It's fun. My only complaint is the time it takes for the fuel to charge, 30 mins? Come on! Otherwise very challenging. Challenge accepted!",
        "I really enjoyed this game until it started crashing mid game. Happened to me just recently and I wasted all my available fuel trying to frantically restart the game.  I was just completing the assigned jobs when the game suddenly stalled and I had to restart it again just to find it stalling again, all the while consuming the fuel with each restart. Hope to see this problem rectified soon, otherwise it's an enjoyable game nonetheless."

        "FIFA mobile peaked with FIFA 14 in almost every way. It had career mode, better controls, more realistic have gameplay and better ultimate team. It's a real shame you can't play it any more. Another thing they had always been lacking from FIFA mobile is the ability to properly customize how your team plays. This means the player who wins is the one who can best adapt to how EA had set the team up to play. This makes the game less rewarding as I do not like my teams to play in the way that EA ways them to. 😔😔",
        "In the vs attak mode if i lose a game i lose 8000 fans and if i win it i get only 6000 fans. It is a great game but this is a problem. More over in some matches i donot get great chances to score while the opponent gets 10 great chances. It very unfair. Many times if the game hasn't started and my server crashes i loose the match and stamina. And i cannot play the game for a hole day because of server problem evenif my internet connection is quiet strong.  Execpt this everything is gr8.",
        "I request the developers to consider the following points... 1.The team can't be substituted while playing season games. 2.The game shows unknown errors sometimes while playing and crashes. 3.It would be good if getting the elite players become easier.. Rest it's surely one of the best game of EA and undoubtedly for the football lovers..Keep updating... I would like it more if you improve the physics of the game like curving the ball etc....please make it....",
        "The only I wanted to tell is that the game shows that the master players are very rare and we have a chance of getting them but trust I have been playing fifa for a lot of time and I never got like a player in like chance or in free packs I do not even get silver players. So I suggest that you increase the chances of getting these kind of players.",
        "At first when I down loaded it I thought it would be a cheap version of real FIFA that you often have to pay for. I expected bad graphics, crashes and lots of bugs. I WAS WRONG!!! This game is literally the best ever. 01.03.18 Although in the new update I went to type something on leagues and the game just crashed, it also made my phone spam so I had to shut it down and reload my phone up, please investigate this.",
        "You have to add these 3 things please...,.......... 1.Adding commentary will make this game an real editors choice game. 2.Getting good players is lot of hard than u think so find a way. 3. Most important......... Loading. It's the biggest problem almost every players experiences so please keep these in mind which will make this game the best"

        "I was addicted to the game the first time I played it.  Still love it and have put it on every device I've had since I was first introduced to the game.  Pou has been a constant source of entertainment for over three years!  Love love  love it!  Oh and I almost forgot to tell you that I am 56 years old!!  Lol. It is really that fun to play!",
        "I love this game there are so many games to play within.  One thing I would say is that I wanted to buy shoes before I got to the level I had enough coins but when I clicked it it took my money but didn't give me the shoes so now I have to play loads more when I could have got them five minutes ago. Please fix this and I will rate 5 star",
        "After I posted my recent comment, there were some angry comments pointed out at me. I apologise for that. I mean, this game in great! There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars. For someone who says \"too many notifications\", go to the settings and turn off that notifications button. Thank you for those hate critics you guys made. It really teached me a lesson.",
        "It's been more than a year that you haven't added any mini game in any update. You've written on \"What's New\" section that \"We're working on something big\" but you .haven't shown that big work yet😅..At least add more mini games...And I'll rate 5."

The actual game plays ok, but not really anything special.  Would give a little higher rating if I didn't feel like they are up to no good by asking for rights they don't have any business asking for.  Stay away from this game until they change the permissions they are asking for.  Ridiculous.",

Getting so mad it won't load every single time it updates! I was trying to get to 1500 before my birthday fat chance in hell now.",

        "Loved this game. Very addictive. But just like other recent reviews, since March 2018 problems with no help at all from company. Have not received about 4 gift boxes or rewards for at least 4 levels even tho i completed them. Doesnt advance either. I have to search what level i stopped at. On one of my devices says no internet connection and sent me back. Have stopped playing on that device. Contacted company twice to no avail. Will search for a new game with totally different company",
        "Do not waste your money on the game. I use to enjoy it and had no problem paying for things. I believe a company should make money if they do their job. Since it was sold to a new owner they no longer answer anyone's questions. They send you to a link that has everyone else scrambling for answers. They also do not replace items you lose when the game has problems. They do not care if you purchased them. The old company use to replace items and gold bars when it was the games glitches. They actually cared about the people playing it. The owners now can not even be bothered to reply. If you play it only get the free stuff. Do not waste your hard earned money on this game. They will not spend any time to make sure you get what you paid for",
        "While you have infinite lives a great time waster. Also great if you want to spend silly amounts of money on a few power ups that  won't get you through the hard levels. And all the 'are you sure you want to quit instead of buying some more gold bars/candy hammers/whatevers' just make even trying to quit a level tiresome. If it takes too many attempts to pass a level I get bored, and that is where I am today. Bye.",

The sound on the game is on and the last time it worked properly was 3 days ago. I have to shut down the game for me to get the ads gone and still no sound. I have lost many chests and many coins this way. I updated the game and still nothing. Please fix because I have no idea what is going on.",
        "Great game with fun objectives that keep it challenging until level 15.  Only issue with it is that ive recently lost all.my gems due to some sort of bug and now i dont really want to continue playing just to get back to 500 gems to experience something other than sky summit.",
        "The blazing sand map is really boring. Only 3 different location there. But looks same all the entire run. Make some free space. It is very boring to run in sand all the time. Make variation like Frozen Shadows atleast. Add some location. Make some variations.",
        "Would have been a 5 on gameplay and overall, but as you move up the levels, the daily challenges are more difficult to achieve. For example, I have been trying to survive five tunnels in the lost jungle for four days now, but never get to run in the tunnels. I had a run today of over 20k meters and didn't run in the tunnels once during that run. Otherwise, great game, but the gameplay manipulates it so that daily goals are harder to achieve as you advance.",

I don't love that it freezes up on my phone 9/10 forcing me to force stop it to play it. I don't love the fact that despite having it on other android devices and having synced it after getting a new phone I STILL had to start from scratch.",
        "Game is becoming worst day by day.hey change the developers man!! Always getting strucked whenever a mission is done, there's a delay time,where your bloody joyride sucks and strucks. All of a sudden releases from the mission completed hangover and will come in to the game flow.and ends the game due to sudden activation,by touching zappers or missiles. All the testers who didn't discovered this hangover should be thrown out from the company",
        "I love the game overall, but the only downside I have for it, is how we're not getting discounts on jepacks and clothing anymore. I'm unsure if it's only an android thing, but I really miss that feature. That for me was the reason I grinded this game so much during the time, because I was able to buy them with 50% off, not just buy currency and get it straight away. It would be nice to see some more jepacks too, as well as other content.",
        "Most addictive game I've played in years. Only gripe is when holding screen to speed up end of level timer it restarts 2-3 times.",
        "The game is amazing. I've been playing this since it came out about 7 years ago. The thing is it brings back nostalgia for me and that plays a big part in the core gameplay for me. Thank you guys, you are amazing! One little issue though, sometimes the ads I watch for doubling the points or for the free revive don't work. It just says \"an error occured\" and it won't do anything. Could you please try to fix this. It's a shame after a good run not to be able the double my points or whenever I would need to revive, it just wouldn't work...",
        "I read their comments and they said that they're dying because of the ads.. For me the ads is okay because its not appearing on my screen so thank you and 5 Stars for all"

        "Think about playing all day Ridiculously good graphics for a mobile game, excellent soundtrack that matches the intensity of each level, and never gets boring. The free version makes you restart from the beginning instead of checkpoints, but I don't even mind because it's still challenging and fun with each replay. I do wish I could play in a different mode for free though. This would be an awesome Zen game.",
        "The gameplay is unique and challenging and fun but this game feels like a demo as all the other game modes (PvP , co-op etc) are locked for free users. And you can't even use checkpoints without paying them( like SERIOUSLY?!) So once the game is over you have to start all over again if you are a free user. Apart from that this game definitely deserves a try from people looking for casual , relaxing yet challenging gameplay.",
        "Great game This is a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing aesthetics and highly addictive. Totally worth the $2 for the premium version. I do have one problem though: even though I am pretty decent at the game, Google Play won't give me any achievements even though I'm sure I have earned some. It won't even let me open achievements or leaderboard pages. Is anybody else having this issue?",
        "I am going crazy for this game. Great time killer and stress reliever. Graphics, music, and everything else is completely superb. I am totally enthusiastic about purchasing the premium version, however, I could not buy it because I do not have any credit or debit card. Can someone please tell me if there is other ways to purchase, like deducting the fee directly from my SIM balance, perhaps?",
        "BEST GAME EVER... Love this game,  a must have on every phone.. Well worth the price, amazing graphics.. Also bought the VR version truly unbelievable. Just 1 wee problem... When you reach infinity there is not a lot of glass to smash for extra balls which is a must have especially when it goes super fast.  Thankyou and keep up the great work..",
        "Excellent game. Really superb game. Engaging play and the music works well. Plus fantastic breaking sounds. This game is both addictive and relaxing. Reminds me of the original wipeout. Another cool element is that each level adds interesting new elements. Only thing that would make it better is if my acheivements would track. Im on a galaxy s 7, and they don't track. At least my checkpoints save."

        "It's a rip off trying to earn jewels for game play, especially in the tower. It shouldn't be so hard. I been playing for a year and im still getting 10 pearls and 25 feathers for prizes. Also I have a problem with the match ups in the tournament I have a 370 rating but I'm being matched up against players with 460 ratings. That's ridiculous!",
        "I just purchased a new phone. And being I'm using the same e-mail address i would have thought it would have started me at the same level I had been on prior to the new phone. Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download.",
        "There is an extremely annoying ad that will freeze the app, I don't know what it is for, but it's animated, shows a city street, moving van, starts at 36 sec.  I can't leave it when it freezes, have to leave app entirely, go back to where I left. If I click again and same app appears I can't receive my reward.",
        "I really think the tower is rigged. 1 in 4 chance of getting the pig but it seems to happen ALL the time. Cant get past the 6th or 7th floor. However if you spend lots o money to buy gems I guess it can be done. Not for me I am out.",
        "He game starts out with tutorials, but they act like you've never played angry birds before. Theres a world map which is cool, but its not needed and is just boring. The worst part about this game is that you can only lose 5 times a day. I just want to play the game like how the original game played!"

It's exactly how I remember it being on our old computer, and it is SO ADDICTIVE. The very day I got it I played for like 4 hours straight. Literally. Honestly I love the game. A little unhappy about the ads but honestly you get what you pay for, and this was free, so I can't complain too much.",
        "It remains a classic, yet some parts are just too screwed up. After paying to remove the ads, the ad hoes with the play button still show up. The vase breaker was my favourite in the past. Now it is broken. 65% of the time ir reads actap like a double tap making it utterly unplayable",
        "It was good but then this happened. I was playing just like any other day. My phone had died while I was playing, so I charged it and left it untouched for about an hour or two. When I signed in, all off my progress was erased! Please respond and tell me what happened.",
        "The game was great than EA got to it with there sticky fingers and put adds everywhere, it isn't the same game I enjoyed ages ago. It's just another add infested game now, even if you do pay for it l. The charm is gone",
        "I have completed 3 rounds in the past on this game and wanted to play again not having to watch a video after every level is too time consuming. Years ago not as bad. after 5 levels deleted. EA took a good game and turned it into a ad seeking game. UGH AND UGH. Do not play unless you love ads. Other games you can watch ads at your leisure for prizes but not mandatory. Good luck but if new to game RUN..Lots to choose from.",
        "Ea is extremely greedy and will not fix the broken restore purchases button. I  contacted them about this issue and was offered in game currency for pvz2 and bejeweled and a generic sorry for troubles. Nothing about zzsunset that appears on the paid version of pvz or even if they own it or was scammed. Stay away from EA products"

        "Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?",
        "I would have given this game a higher review than three that I have given it, the problem is that I have noticed a problem when trying to save some money. For me at least when trying to save money through the daily giveaway/present of playing the game everyday it has stolen money from me discreetly whenever I get around the 1000 coin mark sometimes it is one hundred sometimes I have lost 400 with no explanation as to where the money is. It is for this reason that I have lowered my rating. (Besides the disappearing money I enjoyed the game.)",
        "This game is pretty good, for the most part. The only problem is the bots you go upagainst are  way to hard. I can never win. I would have gave them 5 stars but I gave them 4 stars because of the bots. And the game is kinda hard to control. When I move backwords on a veichel it goes up.",
        "This Game is really fun but the Spicky car is really stupid because it's so easy to die... really stupid... but other than that, the games awesome and I got the fist car thing but when I want to use it I can't find it 😑... the games the b💣mb. But the update I don't have so you should probably not get the update because people are complaining about it. AND ALSO ...CARS KEEP SPAWNING ON TOP OF MY CAR KILLING ME!!",
        "The physics is very hard to grasp leading to many fails and the bots often drive backwards and forwards until they can drive up onto my head. There's also no start timer, leading to the bot ramming into me before I can figure out what's happening. Great with human opponents, however single player makes me want to throw my phone out of my window. Great concept, horrible execution.",
        "New update stucks a lot and 1st time my mobile hangs a lot due to this game and btry drains faster than ever. plz crt these mistakes to continue njoying this game"

Everything is well thought, new levels and lines are frequently added. So far my favourite app ever, looking forward to playing some new levels and the match option.",
        "I originally had it as 5 stars, but I noticed the longer that I've had the game, the more bugs I'm starting to see. Sometimes the music won't line up with the levels, which is the point of the game, and other times the game won't register my touch and will screw up my progress. If this gets fixed that would be great, and I'd move the rating back to 5 stars!",
        "I really wish you guys didn't update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can't listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!",
        "Amazing game... Loved it...😍 The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it'll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it's okay 😊",
        "This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn't as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn't there but now it's forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.",
        "It's an amazing game. Sure I run around my bedroom screening every time I fail next to the end.... but there is something about this game that makes you happy. Is it the music? Maybe. Is it the back ground and the way it moves?possibly. It's all of those things plus more   In a nut shell I really really really really really really really really really love this game :p"

        "The game is fun, but results take 2 and 3 days and if other people are on higher levels they have access to better tableware and vases, pictures etc, so their rooms stand out more and they have a better chance at getting 5 stars. And some items I've purchased don't work it gives a message saying they couldn't find it in the warehouse. But the game never gave me my gems back and of money. NEED TO FIX IT",
        "Love it! Having played for several months now I would love to have a few more rooms to design.... Bathroom kitchen and attic are all possibilities. Also would like the voting to be a bit better... Some designs get high marks but aren't what was asked for which defeats the purpose really. Also can we have the option to pass on voting as there have been times that I've not liked either choice but have Had to pick one. Other than that it's a fab game.",
        "Entertaining. It's easy to spend a lot of the free money and diamonds on design, then you may have to wait a while to advance if you want to play free. It's clear there is no switch up on the top players, so when you go into competition, it's all about how much money you have to spend. Even when the rooms have a theme, people tend to vote for their taste, vs. if the request stated i.e. Mid-century mod, or traditional. Addictive unfortunately.",
        "I love this game!! \"it helps a lot\" with my shopping addiction because I feel like I'm buying real merchandise. I really enjoy the updates and how you guys added more room to be designed!!!! Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))",
        "I have been playing for a year now and I'm still in love with Design Home! True, it's hard not to spend extra money but I do believe that the makers have formed a game that can be enjoyable by those with money to spend to have fun but, also have developed a game with really beautiful items that one can buy very inexpensively, and even pieces that are in between. You can't get more thoughtful than that!",
        "I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars."

This has now happened to me 3 times where I have been at maximum levels into the legends arena and BOOM! All my levels are gone all my boosters  - which I have paid hundreds of dollars buying are gone. Support do not respond to my repeated requests to resolve this. Very disappointed I've been playing this for almost 2 years.",

        "I up my rating to 4. After playing 5 years, this game is really fun to play. I cannot give 5 star as i still having issues with the gem price too crazy expensive. Hope igg can revise gem price back, so many player can support this game, not the rich guy only. I believe you guys has realise many p2p player already quit, so better to revise the germ price again. Overall, i love this game^^",
        "Decided to edit my review to clear things up for people that says this is a money making scheme etc. To the people that say that, do u understand that this game is Free? The devs spend a ton of money making a game enjoyable for people, adding new content such as, new heroes, new events, new upgrading features etc. It's only normal to lock some heroes behind a paid service, and the heroes behind the pay wall isn't even game changing or op. U don't have to spend a cent on this game to make progress. Rolling heroes takes time but it's so rewarding when u get that one hero u were looking for. This is a great game and if u complain about ingame purchases for a game so well maintained then rather go play another free game full of bugs and zero updates.",
        "⚠ WARNING: ⚠ This game is designed to force you to gamble your money! If you want to have any chance in progressing in this game, then be prepared to spend thousands of dollars! All OP heroes are \"Gem Only\" and can only be acquired by \"rolling\" for them. Some heroes like Minotaur and Destroyer can ONLY be acquired after buying a certain amount of gems amounting to $1500+ USD. The people who says that they can get *ALL* heroes without spending anything are either dumb as a rock or paid trolls by IGG... This Game is *ALL* about money and nothing else... Most of the \"In-Game Events\" is about getting a chance to get an OP hero after buying a certain amount of gems. The rolling system is rIGGed to force you to keep rolling and buying Gems! Did I mention that the price of changing your In Game Name will cost you 15,000 Gems or $99.99 USD? If you want to gamble your money, you will have a BETTER chance in a Real Casino than this Pay-To-Win game! You've been warned!!! Thank me later...👎👎👎",
        "Best phone game ever!! If u guys make a castle clash 2 i will hate you guys!!!unless i get all 1.7 million gems i bought transfered!!but this game bere is LEGIT",
        "Game developers (IGG) only want to make $$$ they don't care about nothing else , as i  was enjoying game but after some time i  saw that they forcing to invest further in game if no , you will go down and down till from it will be nothing left  ... It's really not fair what and how they treat gamers ...",
        "Has anyone mentioned the 5+ daily deals that are advertised anytime you start the game up. I know they need to make profit, but chill. This game is almost a pay-to-win. Its only getting worse. I remember when getting a 15% gem bonus was a big deal, now they offer more, but its ridiculous. All these mini-extravaganza- games to get kids/people to dump money in this game is messed up. Some heros are only attainable through a pay wall or a ridiculously unrealistic quantity of gems. To get some heros you need to buy 500,000 gems in the given time limit. How in the world would anyone reach that when $100 only gets you an average of 26,000 gems at the moment. THATS WELL OVER $1,000. IGG certainly took a lot of inspiration from casinos. The game is nice and all, but this \"pay-to-get better heros\" is killing the game for me. It is not going in the right direction for the players. If you want the slightest chance of this game to improve, stop feeding them money, then it will get their attention."

Also, the game has some serious process errors. No way to check status of player actions for an advisor command. Well possible the player has made a flagon. Also in combat,  the spyglass routine says coins then locks into needing gems. Drawing board again, gang!",
        "If you like a fair and balanced game then this is not the game for you.   Events continue to be released more and more frequently in a vain attempt for the makers to gain more money.   Every event requires you to research Technologies and conquered provinces eventually making you advance forward in ages faster than what you really want to do. The faster you advance, the harder the game becomes thus forcing you to spend money just to make the game even moderately enjoyable.   All in all the only thing this game cares about is making money. They don't give a f*** about their fans for the people play this game.   Honestly the only reason I play is because I've been playing for years before this game became s*** and all about money.",
        "So, SO much potential. Alas the developers seemed to let their greed win out, as the in game purchases would make a console game feel poor. It starts off fun but the wait times soon become so enormous that you really loose the fun of the game with it. The ONLY way I would rate this game higher is if they drastically cut the wait times of soldier and increased production outputs, so maybe you could actually play when you want to.",
        "You definitely need patience to play this game. It's very slow,  and might seem boring to some in the beginning.  But that only happens when you haven't developed any gaming strategies and tricks yet. I've been playing it 3 years now, and it's the only game I've lasted with this long. It took forver to get anywhere good, and I intend to finish it ;)",
        "Giving 3 stars as the game has made great improvements with age gaps, but when you report big issues that greatly impact game play the support teams don't respond. Need to fix game crashing and lagging. Never used to do this to me.",
        "Building Either i can't see the option or it's just not possible. We need the abilty to rotate building. I have to much empty space i can fill with more buildings but can't. Example i can have 4 free spaces but it's a 1x4 space when i need a 4x4 space and i can simply get that 4x4 space i need by rotating the building taking up the necessary space."

        "The creators could really make some improvements. For example i've made a space station that can latch onto other ships, however I can't get any other ships close enough to latch on. We should be able to set other ships as targets so we can latch on or whatever. Also perhaps add wheels so people can build rovers that can land and travel on different planets. The gameplay is not too hard but not easy all you need to do is look at the tutorials and you are set and the graphics are good.",
        "Oh man cool game. Love it. Please add more planets and other objects!!! If love to try for io or Europa, Titan or ceres. :) I've landed on all bodies now including the the sun (which has a wierd bug btw). It would be great to have more parts as well.  A two to one reduction would be awesome for building Saturn Vue type rockets. It would be cool to to be able to carry and deploy payloads to orbit. Or to deploy and dock with other parts of the craft, Apollo lander style. Overall love the game.",
        "So I've been playing the game for a couple of months now. i think that there is an awesome game here, with already plenty to do. I do also think that there is lots of room and need to improve upon this. As I have been playing for a while, I do notice it becomes quite challenging to escape orbit with enough fuel to make it to other planets, like mars. i do recommend you add a cheats section that you can enable in the settings, with unlimited fuel, larger build space, indestructable rockets, etc. I also recommend more bits and pieces for building, like bigger and more powerful thrusters, or air vents for turning in space. For later development, a satellite system would be much appreciated, as well as a little spaceman that you can control when docked at a space station, or when you're on a planet. Thank you for an awesome game!!!",
        "I love it. The greatest game ever keeps your brain from stopping because this game is like a puzzle you need to think smartly, and build smartly. I want to thank you, from making this MASTERPIECE free. Please don.t ever add in game purchases not everyone has credit cards. You guys should download this game if your are bored. If does not takes up many spaces and ultimate fun and creativity.",
        "I love this game, i've been landed surface in every celestial object few times, included Sun. I also recommendation to other friends in forum to play it.  But, I want suggest to add some simulation like : - Rotation planet. - Perihelion/Aphelion. - Perigee/Apogee.  And also some feature : - List for delete few space trash like empty booster in orbit. - Name rocket every launch (it make fun & realistic).  Thank You",
        "This is such a fantastic game, it's so easy to use, but also it requires skill as well. An issue that I have is the the lack of function, like if you could build functioning satellites (mine consist of a frame and landing legs), maybe even rovers. Additionally, a larger building space and re-entry effects would be great. I am aware that you are most likely working on some/all of these issues. Finally, when do you expect the next big update will be?   *Sorry if this doesn't make sense"

        "Great graphics and great stories. Right now they have like 30 \"books\", so there are lots of options. I've been playing since 2016 and the app just keeps getting better. Can get a little pricey for the preminum choices, but otherwise it's a fantastic app; very additive and entertaining",
        "While the game is enjoyable and the stories are intriguing, it is way too expensive to make certain choices. There is absolutely no need for choices to cost 20 or 25 diamonds when you only get 1 diamond for each chapter completed.  This game is in no way good enough to warrant spending real money on it, especially considering the ridiculously high prices of making certain choices which would require making a purchase in every single chapter.",
        "It's a brilliant app, though sometimes I wish there wasn't as many gem choices. I fully considered buying gems until I realised how quickly they'd be used.   My favourite story was It Lives In The Woods, though most of the choices are gem choices. The story itself is fantastic, and I love the diversity of characters.   I had a problem with a story playing up and after a chat with the team was told to restart it. I didn't mind but I didn't get any keys to compensate what I'd already spent (I don't buy them I just wait for then to recharge, but it did mean I had to respend keys on one story because of a issue out of my control)   Overall its a great app and highly playable without spending.",
        "I love the game, its addicting, only problem I have is it should be easier to collect diamonds and keys. Like watching an add or a daily login reward. And after each episode part, you should get more than 1 diamond. It'd make it a lot better that way in my opinion. Also, the purchases say 1.99$ on the game, but it charged me 2.99$. Not a big deal, but either stick to what it says or update your game.",
        "As a guy I find the game fun to play and interesting. One thing that I dislike is some times I can't do so things because they cost crystals. You should have at least one or two choices per chapter that we get to make a free choice that will significantly affect the story. Also some more games where you can choose to be a guy instead of a girl. Other wise the stories are fun and engaging and I always can't wait to see how it progressives.",
        "I think the story lines are great.  But there needs to be more opportunities to earn diamonds to do more things in the game itself rather than finish a chapter get a diamond. And having to start new books when youre out of keys.  Also i think there should be more of a selection than just the romance.  Maybe more scifi stuff or even get into greek myths."

        "WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you",
        "Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It's pretty decent. I'm enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I've raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn't a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)",
        "First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I'll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC's (and MK's) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.",
        "As a lifelong Tekken fan this game is about as good as you could get for a mobile game. Sure there's microtransactions but they don't feel shoved down your throat and you'll get a decent amount of fun before they feel remotely neccesary. The gameplay is good, simpler but as concise and impactful as it always is. The only thing that I've found off putting so far is some of the writing is a bit... off. Just some out if character stuff but the story dialogue is mostly setup so it's not too bad.  Overall this is definitely worth a try if you want Tekken on the go.",
        "As a long time Tekken fan I am happy that we have a version for mobile. I am also quite impressed with how smooth the gameplay is. The graphics are impressive for mobile. I'm underwhelmed by the controls though.  For me Tekken is all about the controls, and while I didn't expect a full controller interface. I feel like there could have been a better control layout available. Also the interface and game play menus feel quite busy, like there is too much going on. They could take a note from the wb fighters on mobile in this regard.",
        "As expected, it looks and performs amazing. Fighting mechanics and modes are pretty innovative and thrilling. It is quite stupid to compare the console version with mobile one. Each one has its own unique style, so they should NOT look the same, cz' each one provides the fans with a different gaming experience. This surely increases the already huge number of fans of Tekken. 5 🌟 game"

And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.",

Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won't make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least",

Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!😆😆 I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!",

SO funny, it also sounds just like a kid is playing with the food, that I'm eating grapes right now,😂😂😂😂😁😀😊☺🙂😐",

        "I really enjoy this game has been the only game that has kept my attention for more than a week. Working on week 3 now, most of the game is free but if you want to grow your port quickly than you will need to play into the game. The game really starts to slow down after level 50, I'm up in the high 60 levels now. I do really enjoy all the quests and they do add bonus quests from time to time to help build up your port.",
        "A fun, easy-going game. No crazy-pace required and easy to advance.  The amount of unique ships is crazy, I think only fan of nautical history would really enjoy this aspect. The list of active ships should be available from your town, instead of only from map view. Other than that, it's quite enj9yable and not a complete time-sucker like many 9ther games. Well done.",
        "You have a great game here.  It's messing up lately?  But Seriously, I've spent many hours playing this super enjoyable game!  Side note.  Do phone game developers understand I only want to spend $5 to $20 per game?  There must be some serious suckers out there.",
        "I was disappointed with the \"loot boxes\" that were offered after the most recent update. I bought two and just got resources. I get they're a gamble, but when gems are so expensive to buy, I don't like to waste them. Sad. I hope they respect their player base in the future. Their constant updates are nice, though.",
        "Hey Dev, just a suggestion... you would sell WAY MORE gems if you priced them appropriately. Your current pricing is ridiculous! Change your prices and maybe add a few more option packs and I bet you would sell way more and make more.",
        "I would of given this game 5 stars a week ago, but I spent money to buy the starter pack, and then updated the game and have since lost everything. This game was awesome until that point. I sent a email a few days ago in response to my game being wiped but have not received any response from them, not even an auto reply."

        "Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I'm 20 just..😉😉 I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I'm in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️",
        "A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!",
        "Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn't respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I'm willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there's nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.",
        "I've noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don't think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying.",
        "I'm obsessed with this game. It's not just playing to beat your best score. There are challenges that you can beat as you play and it makes it okay to have a bad run sometimes because you can still beat the challenge lol. Not frustrating, just so much fun. Not sure if my review makes sense, just play this game ok."

For a simple game like this these facts fore me to give only one star. Fix the code and improve the graphics and it can easily get a 4 to 5 star rating.",

        "This is a cute little fun game but it keeps crashing I can't even open it so therefore that's why you got such low reviews. I was having a lot of fun with it until it started crashing. Even uninstalling and reinstalling did not fix the problem. I hope you eventually get it fixed it would be worth downloading again.",
        "Game play is alright but the adverts are annoying! Especially ones where come back on the game to get points: you can watch video for x2 the amount or just collect... Even the just collect end up watching a video! So might as well just have as x2",

And every couple times you do, an ad you can't skip for 5-10 seconds will show up. There's a point where after Prestige you spend 1/3 of your game time being spammed with ads.   Really quite a waste of time. No wonder they could afford having their own ads on other games."

It's also very childish and unoriginal, you don't get a serious feel when playing.. the ONLY plus is the graphics are good. But looks aren't everything",
        "I have to give this a 1 star for everything lol. This game has broken more copyright laws than any other mobile game I've ever played. The ads were completely false with other large title games gameplay. The game had the dignity to use a GTA V start up screen without crediting proper sources.",
        "Still early, things take longer to get done if you don't spend real time money, but it's entertaining, really dislike the prompts to like on facebook.  Nobody cares what my score is and I'm sure I'd lose friends if I filled their feed with gaming info.  Game is slow but fun.",
        "I just lost 49.99 on a recharge, and current event is glitching my score to 0! I sent screenshots thru line app @ mafiacitycs no one responded. This review will improve when my situation does. I've already spent Almost $200 and you guys are gonna lose my business. UPDATE: I've been in chat with customer service. I sent screenshots, and they say I've received gold. I currently have 2 gold so...Gonna say they're wrong I sent them screenshots and they are NOT fixing. I will change this comment when someone fix's my issue. This IS a great game. Doesn't mean I'm throwing away 49.99",
        "Froze every time after had been playing for a few days, always at the same point. Reinstalled, same problem. Liked the game for the couple days I was able to play. Customer service was not helpful",
        "Just another linear empire builder with an exponential grind curve. Some pretty graphics, but overall juvenile presentation and writing. Popups constantly accost you for purchases or Facebook invites, and flashing icons all around the screen serve to distract and annoy more often than informing of useful actions. Only a single attack order at a time means very limited \"gameplay\" when interacting with other players. The first 24 hours may go quickly, but progression hits a (pay) wall immediately after that."

Legendary drops out of bought chests are ridiculously low. No option to buy arena gear with diamonds. Etc. Balance the game then we can see if I'll spend $",
        "The game is fun and has potential. But it dragged down by the system that requires you to wait for your fighters to heal after each battle, and you have to have premium in order to heal them fast, or you have to move your fighters around after EVERY battle, which last less than 1 minute. It's so stupid, after my premium runs out, ill probably not be playing anymore.",
        "This may be a long review.  I have played fallout shelter also and it is more fast paced! With only a couple setbacks being that you need to defend the shelter from raiders/monsters which may cause dwellers to die and need money to revive. Also, if left dead too long causes other dwellers to either get ill or become more unhappy.     Now for this game:    Pros:  This game does have more story which I have enjoyed! Also funny social media posts! Has pvp and other events.  Cons:  Building times are long! Resource production is slow and resource requirements are high. Not good if expect long gameplay.",
        "This game is garbage. Just another pay to win game. You get put against enemies way stronger than you. By the time you get around to making your guys strong enough to fight those guys they put you up against guys way stronger than you again. Not gonna keep doing this. Uninstalling.",
        "Very good idea but poorly executed... Greedy people have ruined it and the game itself is not so much fun since you're bound to stay far far behind unless you pay.",
        "There are two problems with this game... One, you will get tired of looking at that loading screen REAL fast. And two, the real problem, the tournaments are shamelessly stacked heavily against players that don't pay through the nose. You will go up against opponents with twice the squad power and 5 castle levels higher than you. You will find yourself in last place very often. Only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars to an otherwise fun, cute, addictive, but shameless moneygrab of a game."

        "Whenever you die in the game you start completely over again. And after each game an advertisement plays. Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It's a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It's very competitive!!! I swear my husband can't beat my score no one has lol",
        "It's good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it's my opinion so don't get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don't have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn't play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀",
        "It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone's or tablets I find it hard to control I don't know if anyone else thinks so but that's my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company",
        "Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface",
        "A very addictive game that's great fun! The only problem is with the controls. It seems to go too fast without even hitting the speed button (if you have played it you will know what I mean). IMO the speed function is uneccesary, take it out of the game and it's 5 stars all the way!",
        "Great game however I wish there was a way to avoid the button that makes you speed up suddenly.  This us partially because you use your fingers to maneuver it and your fingers can get in the way of your view of the screen. It could cause you to kind if lose control of your worm."

        "Good concept. Too bad the ads ruin the calibration. Either the ad loads and is in the way or it doesn't load and shifts the page. This second issue is the worst of the two. This completely ruins the calibration and forces you to touch above or below the tile you want to remove. Often times leading you to remove tiles you don't want to",
        "Sadly, it could've been a fun game if I could actually tap where I wanted to. The tap is off by like a few mm or something. I have to tap above the try again button to actually try again, or else I end up hitting challenges... So during the game play the exact same thing would happen, which makes the game unplayable.",
        "There are way too many advertisements every time I start a game or lose or win a game I instantly get an 30 second ad which I have to waste my time on to skip it until I am finally done. Overall except for the advertisements it is a great game controls and game play is brilliant I recommend this game but you will get a lot of ads. Suggestion: Lower the amount of ads showen",
        "Nice concept, but like others have said the tapping is off. You have to tap half a cm above the block you want to pop. No wonder you advertise \"Only 1% of players make it to 10,000!\"",
        "This game is a great time killer! It is really addictive and fun but almost every time you die you have to sit through an ad which gets annoying. Overall this is a good game bit watch out for ads."

As with all great puzzlers, Six! is great in one minute bursts or hours of emotive fun.In the game you are challenged to interact with a tower block of varying shaped bricks upon which rests a hexagonal block. The aim is to get the hexagon down the tower block to earn points.  You do this by tapping the bricks to make them disappear bringing the hexagon down into the space cleared underneath.It sounds easy, but when the hexagon starts to roll or the tower tilts, and with pressure of high scores you’ll find it’s not as easy as you originally thought. If the removal of the blocks topples the tower  or the hexagon gains momentum and rolls off the screen, then it’s game over and you have to start all over again.

Not the case here. Man we have games that live life for you basically. But still cant figure out how to fix pac man. REALLY? And the ads an ad after every board. Ads ads ads and then guess what?

        "Ah perfect game. Fast pace not laggy smooth graphics, and playable on any devices. But i hope i can change my region like asian.. Bcoz most of the player i encounter is mexecan or spanish.. 1 more thing i hope you add a larger map i guess for team battle i think 4km x 4km is enough.. And 30mins of total playing time.. All in all fantastic game.. A two thumbs up for you guys. Keep it up",
        "Its amazing!!!! I wanted fort nite but even if i deleted everything i have, i still would not be able to get it. It costs sooo much room. With this game, i can have roblox,color switch, and at least 100 pictures and 10 videos, AND still have room for it. This the best shooting game i have ever had! And i have played gta and call of duty. So that says a lot. It is also very fair. U dont get a increase on anything when wearing special clothing. So new comers could be just as good as people at lvl 100. I would deffenety recemend it.",
        "Ok this game is the best battle Royale game I played and I've played all of them. This is smooth and fun and different. But you need to keep adding on the game please cause I love it. Add more guns like a lot. More snipers and possibly a big gun and more pistols and just everything lol. And maybe add some more places on the map. And one more thing, add 100 players to fight if you can",
        "This is no doubt one the 'Best' android game ive ever played so far.       But the main drawback is the lack of map choice..  and i personally think that it would be better if there is more customisable features like hairstyles,etc. and more items to buy from the store using money and not diamonds. Another suggestion that i would like to give is that.. on top of having voice chat if teammates can chat with each other using message, it would be terrific. Thankyou for making this game!",
        "For all this time I only played girly game like The Sims, Temple Run, etc but I decided to give this game a shot earlier today. GOD how I wish I tried it earlier! This is like the best game I've played in years, it's super playable even for someone like me (who have never played this kind of games before) and I just cant believe just how much this game has to offer! The graphic is flawless, no bugs or errors at all, the control is perfect, and it's superrr realistic. This game reminds me of Hunger Game lol. I feel emotionally exhausted while playing this game because I was always in a state of running and surviving. Very recommended!",
        "Look into the option to enalble driving like KNIVES OUT etc. When one uses a gamepad, player can choose the setting where u can use the two joysticks to drive vehicles. Now after mapping the keys , there r no more space or option to drive. Hope u listen, gamers are improving n evaluating your game for you n its FREE !"

        "I'm not much of a dance gamer but I love simulation games. This one in particular is very innovative with their design and gameplay. I was skeptical of how I was going to like it at first but it proved me wrong and I immediately took to it. The controls are easy to learn and I don't even mind all of the ads. Honestly, a really great game.",
        "It's really Fantastic BUT I didn't give 5 stars because 1.spa part is damaged it makes the game freeze 2.I don't like the mascaras they're not natural 3. Why the character is very pathetic,insecure and not confident. She must be a more confident girl when interacting with others. Please consider these problems.. I'm looking forward to playing the next sequel. Thanks a lot",
        "I get through one scene and the app closes itself. Really irritating because I get into the game after three adds finish the scene and wait for the loading screen but the app closes. If it is fixed I would love this game .",
        "Something that keeps happening to me. I dance off with another player. And i always win. Then it does firwworks and nothing else! What is wrong with it?!",
        "I really enjoyed this game however have to keep doing the same thing over and over just because I have to pay £6 for the doctor. A big let down and kinda boring now",
        "One of the best simulation games I've played,and it's OFFLINE!!!! A big deal for me cos I don't have much wifi to use and it's fun, exciting,and I love the stories. I really want to see more and more of these offline simulation games from Crazy Labs/Tab Tales"

Battles didn't work for me, so I wasn't able to unlock any land past a modest square. Ended up using pine tree logs to fill half the map with level 1 worker tents and the other half was used to get the best farms possible 😂",

Remember that this game is a work in progress at the moment, look at the issues and know that the developers are working on them all the time!

Pretty graphics, still need some work on the fine tuning of the game play, but that'll come in time I'm sure! Thank you for your hard work!",

Every time I leave the game and re-enter it gets worse. I'm at -35 battles and my 20 minute chest is now taking 9 hours and 35 minutes. None of my crop or treasures are replenishing. Ahhh!!! Please fix this!! Before I lose my mind. Lol thank you. I know the game is still in progress, great game!",

Although my only problem is that theres SO ads like a lot, also the outfits and make-up is SOOO expensive and its sometimes hard to earn coins and diamonds. But overall its a fun game and is a real time waster.",
        "This game is amazing! A real time waster and It's really fun! But it should really save to the cloud because I was on LVL 38 or something, I had everything, then I had to move to a new tablet and all of my game progress *poof* vanished!! Also, everything's a BIT expensive... Other than that, It's a really good game! Well done Outfit7 😄❤",
        "This would totally be worth 5 stars if it weren't for the ADS. I get it's a free game, but its one thing to put an ad on the top or side of the screen. It's one thing to optionally watch ads for coins and prizes. But its another thing when full screen videos pop-up, pausing your game and wasting your time. I was honestly thinking about giving this 3 stars just b/c of how annoying that is alone.",
        "This game has too many adds in it. Every minute an adds pops up and it ends up being a video for another game, so I have to wait  and watch  it until it's  done. Please fix this if you can. Over all it's  a really good game.",
        "It's gd but when you watch a video I don't get the prize at the end and it's sooooo annoying. If got that fixed then would be 5 stars. That isn't put you off or anything it's a really good game I enjoy it a lot",
        "Everything players have asked for is added. At a ridiculous price.  But if people are paying that's on them.   HOWEVER you shouldn't have to buy the adult /baby formula more than once. If you bought it you should be allowed to switch back and forth as you wish.    It's a really zen pass time  game :) also cute and interactive."

You just hold the gas button for a few seconds, and then you're able to just let it go. It's almost like yuou can leave it idle for a bit. Then, the spawn stricken mechanic is pretty much useless.

        "Brilliant, innovative, addictive game BUT please reduce the number of ads. That's why this game is only averaging  3.5* and why I can only give it 4*. People will stop playing very quickly as it currently is. Just take it down to an ad break every end of run. Also a way to easily view all positions on the leader board would be nice. Otherwise the game itself is great.",
        "Game is great, but every time you die (and that's really easy to do) you need to watch about 22 seconds of ads. Once i got a 15 second ad, but the skip time stayed constant and i had to watch the entire thing. The game also bugs you constantly about connecting your facebook account. So if you want to be able to play without interruptions constantly, you need to pay and connect to a facebook account.",
        "I would have bought the ad free Version eventually, but it was so annoying even to get used to the game, that I gave up. If you want more people to buy the game you have to give them the opportunity to play without being interrupted every death. Your game can be the best ever but still no one will play it if they have to invest the same time in watching ads that they invest in playing the game.",
        "Too many ads with a skip button that reduces ad time by 10 seconds. Literally, f off, dude. Can't play your game, I play for a minute and than watch an ad for half of that time. Unfair and boring. You almost don't get to play the game. Which is, btw, awesome",
        "Visually satisfying, nice, fitting soundtrack and pretty innovative. One thing is that it's extremely packed with ads. One every round you play. Maybe dial it down a little?  Also, maybe add tail patterns...",
        "It's a great game, for users complaining about ads, it's called ad blocker. When devs force a billion ads and make it unplayable, I use adaway, game is great after, but without adaway, don't bother!"

UNOPAY App is Iegit one which allows earning points just by doing simple tasks like watch advertises, videos and so on. Then you can exchange your points for AMZN/PATYM/PYAPAL and therere various options to choose from. Also TOYOCASH App is perfect for anyone in anywhere who has free time and doesn't wana waste it, you can use this while travelling, working.. simply earning by watch advertisements, videos!",
        "Just way too many ads. Eventually you start having to watch an ad after every second other level. Its a free game, so I get it but the levels are so quick sometimes I'm watching more than I am playing. Fun game, though. Easy controls and great graphics and sound.",
        "This game is outstanding. Love the graphics, simple to understand. Some appear quite easy and then you suddenly get a level that looks like it should be but has you scratching your head for AGES!!! Love it. I can live with the adverts, just wish i could put the phone down.",
        "Good fun and very addictive. I see people moaning about the adds 😧 but what can you expect from a free game? You get an add pop up after about 5 puzzles and to be honest it is only for a few seconds....just close it if you don't want to see them.",
        "Wonderful game, excellent graphics, its a free game, I solve 2 puzzles and a video ad plays I cant get over it, ad's are repeatedly played and I can't skip, but uninstalling cos too too much of ad's... after 2nd level game is very easy didn't find much interesting..",
        "Agree with other comments. Great graphics, fun to play, but the ADS!!!!!!!! eventually destroy the fun. Very repetitive after a while and challenge levels seem quite mixed. Have decided to delete the game mainly because of the ad onslaught. Other games have a much better ad/play psychology approach."

Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.",
        "A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it's a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you've done them and reached level 10 on both, there's really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.",
        "It's a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the 'colony' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you",
        "Well I was only shown this game last Friday and by today (Wednesday) I have reached level 10 on earth and Mars, both my rockets are fully upgraded. Nothing to do now, I thought you would be able to set up buildings and colonies and keep jumping to different planets. But no. If it's enjoyable but over quick, nothing more to it after you you level 10. Can keep taking astronauts up but to what end? You don't go no further, they make you money but you're maxed out on spending anyway. Shame, concave been really good",
        "Its a great game but ive fully upgraded my earth space ship and i am level 10 on earth and mars. I have about 8000 people on europa and theres no more planets to discover so its boring now. We want alot more plants and diffrent upgrades!!"

        "Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!",
        "Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm's Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!",
        "Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I'm just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it's going to be good.  We'll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!",
        "This game is awesome!! Just one thing... You might want to fix Power Trip, because if you miss the gravity pad in the robot part it's pretty much an insta-win. I don't know if it was meant to be there but if it wasn't, you should probably put some spikes there or something.",
        "This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10",
        "I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero."

Other then that issue, the game is great! It's a true 3d game, unlike some of the others I've played. Please fix the S-Pen issue, so I can enjoy this game on my Samsung Galaxy Note 4.",
        "The game is ok but it's annoying the way they have the review request. I'm so sick of it in the way, I'm reviewing. I'm not willing to pay a monthly fee for this game which is the only way to get rid of the annoying ad's. I'd rather pay for the other hand that doesn't have ads because they weren't annoying about it. I would be willing to pay a one time fee.",
        "First, I don't like the fact that you need to buy for full access. Second, the reason I'm righting this and playing it is because there were a lot of adds about it so i tried, and it keeps on telling me to rate us. Third, IT KEEPS ON VIBRATING. Literally, I don't need it to vibrate every time I press a new color.",
        "i would not recommend this game to anyone because 1. its hard to control  2. every time i press and slide it to color it makes this BZZT sound 3.their are WAY to many adds  4. not very many interesting pichers to color  lassed but not least  5. it wasseds time because sents it can move around it took me 1 hour to get ONE number done. i mean I really REALLY, don't recommend this game to ANYONE!!!",
        "It is very difficult to control.  I don't like that you have to pay for most of the pictures.  It's alright.  I think that it would be better if instead of paying for the pictures you have to watch an add.",
        "Horrible. The only reason people say its good is to get a reward in the beginning. This game is terrible it give viruses. It makes my phone slow and all this might just be my opinion but it really is a terrible game that I wouldn't recommend. One game everyone should get if they, yunno, ACTUALLY WANT FUN NON-VIRUS GAMES, is hellopets. And BTW sorry for the grammar and stuff I don't wanna go back and fix it."

Can this problem be solved or should I deinstall all king games I have? I have no problem with games from other developers, so this is on you, not on me.",
        "Awesome game, one of my favourites. Only suggestion would be that the bonus hours of unlimited lives could be gameplay hours, not actual time hours as it is sometimes impossible to continue playing depending on when you are awarded the bonus but on the plus side there are many opportunities to get bonus hours or recharges, much more than many other games.",
        "Fun & super adorable match 3 game - the only game I've kept playing for years (3-4?!) Variety of different mechanics and choice of animal helpers keep it interesting, and less frustrating than the Candy Crush games. Then again, maybe it's just because everything is so darn cute! So nice to see the New Zealand birds/animals in there too, go kiwi! :)",

What a joke a bit like the stupid pig you gave us for gold bars which you made out to be free but no... Of course you have to purchase so why put that rubbish in the game! If I wanted to check if I have PPI I'd wait for a cold caller, not an in game advert! You take the living p*ss!",

        "Well this game is better then most farming games i have played. The crops dont die is a major plus for me . The only thing i dont like is the wait time for things i think there to long at times. But other wise one of my fav games . Love the notification sounds there fun and i really enjoy the club that u can join find a good one like i did and u have a bunch of nice and helpful ppl. Would recommend playing this game and all the others tjis company makes",
        "This game needs the ability to gain more township cash. I have spent way too much real money to buy township cash and im not doing so again at this rate. Farmville isnt this bad and hard to expand.  You cant expand the barn without waiting on products by train or paying in township cash to expand. And that costs over a couple hundred township cash for each expansion. Getting a dollar or two here and there takes forever to collect. Plus the expansion makes small expansions so it doesnt help much.   If something dont change i may quit the game. I enjoy it and would like to continue but at this rate i dont see much point. I cant afford to pay more money to play.",
        "I think it an awesome game but need improvements! Take too long to get items to build and thats where the real money buying comes in! Really 160 to finish a building and such things! Get out of here!Im level 66 and theres no way i spend real cash like that for any game! Over all i like playing meeting new friends!☺ ty",
        "The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen",
        "Great game very addictive, and I don't know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats's kind of ridiculous. That's the only bad thing I have to say about this game.",
        "BEST GAME EVER! It's my biggest game but even though I have an old phone the game still runs really smoothly. There's always something to do, it never gets boring. I've been playing for 8 months. Super easy to use and learn. It's addictive. You also don't feel pressured to make purchases like other games."

        "This is a very fun game. It got me hooked for hours. However, there are still some things that need improvement. For example, when walking sideways along fences you can get over them. This is an issue as once i did this and fell into the water not being able to get back on. Also, the spikes do not seem to have an effect on the shark so they are useless. I do believe that the developer needs to continue to work on this game and introduce new items and uses for them.",
        "It's honestly a pretty good game, it's fun, even though there's no real end goal and a lack of side quests. Although many improvements can be made to the game, the worst part is the ads, it's really bad, and it's insulting as a player that they try to milk this much out of us. You have constant random ads that take over your game at any moment. 5 ads per chest you craft to unlock each slot, ads when you switch to the map, floating treasure chests that require ads to open, even more pointless ads at every crafting bench, and the list goes on. I would gladly even pay to play an ad free version, but this is just ridiculous.",
        "You cannot walk on wooden fundations and you cannot walk on single or double foundations. Please fix this it is very annoying and im not able to play the game, because when the shark attacks in a corner you cannot hit him with your spear. This is the same for the zombie. I built a little house on the raft and it spawned behind the wall of my house. Please fix it",

        "It's an OK game. I love the Just Dance games and how they encourage us to move more, but I feel like there's lots of room for improvement on this app, more devices should be compatible. I'd like to be able to use a second phone as the screen to play on, it would make the game a lot more portable. Maybe if there was a way to use a Kindle Fire as the screen to watch? Overall my biggest complaint is it's too hard to find a device to use as a screen. I don't hate it, but I would like more options to play, none of my devices seem compatible as the screen.",
        "Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren't enough. And one of them didn't work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.",
        "I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.",
        "Ok really liked this more when it had a free song selection, even tho at the time I wanted more free songs.. Being able to play a song once you get the free coins 100 per day(extra 100 for watching a video)... The cost of one song on this app... Makes this app a little less enjoyable. I believe free songs need to come back, or maybe more free coins. My children enjoy this but not alot for under fives... Children songs need to cost less coins. Songs prices should definitely not be more than 100 coins.",
        "It's fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I'm bored. I love the songs and dance moves it's awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it's awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don't know how to dance then you should download this game it's perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.",
        "How can I say no to this game? It's my favourite game ever. I even have all the Just Dance games (except the kids ones) on my consoles, which are Wii, Wii U and Nintendo Switch. But anyways yeah, I'd totally recommend it. Don't forget to tell your friends, your pandas, vegetables and fruit Loops about it. Happy Just Dancing! ☺"

Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.",

It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can't just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...",

I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don't read it before. I can't find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....",

        "Ad heavy. I understand watching ads to get extra money for upgrades, but are ads after every single race really necessary?  The game itself isn't bad. Really good time killer. The ads kind of make me want to stop playing, though."

        "I love the game, if you get it, join my clan, the tag is TsWs_ and the clan name is Thor's Warriors_ please join. I change titles when ever a new player joins. I've had Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, Lords Mobile and they take too long but  War of Clans doesn't take too long! I highly recommend this to everyone no matter if you're a boy, girl, child or adult. AWESOME advert/trailer!",
        "Downloaded this through another app (free golden eagles) where if you downloaded and played this game, and got castle to level 10 would be rewarded. Sent off request to support a number of times with proof and no reply, and after a week still no reward.   So if you are downloading this to get reward from another app don't bother as you won't get it",
        "The game has the same problems as the other versions. The events boost strong players which makes the gap in strength larger. The premium items are overpriced. Probably the worst I have seen, there is no protection for your silver. This means stronger players always have a reason to attack someone weaker and there is no protection in place after being successfully attacked.",
        "What is the point of having more than one Barracks if you can only train one set of soldiers at a time? Why can I only upgrade one building at a time, even though I have the resources for multiple building upgrades? I get tasks having time limits, but if I have the materials to upgrade all my farms at once, I should be able to. The ads you guys put on Odin's YouTube channel convinced me, but the game play is boring and slow after you get past level 6. Boo and hiss.",
        "I like the game but it is hard for players who can't buy a lot of packs. Some slight tweaks to make it not so slanted towards big spenders.  Maybe make some exchange rate for silver to gold without changing the silver availability or price. Someway that gold can be acquired beside the little in the ground. I understand the game has to make a profit and so you should but more people would continue to play instead of giving up Anyway just a couple of thoughts. Got plenty more on just general gameplay  that I think would be useful. Again, not hating as I like and play the game.",
        "Pure pay tto win. You will either pay or quit out of frustration. Build times are hilarious. Seriously, our Earth's sun will die before you max out your hero's knowledge or most any other knowledge.  The Stronghold is worthless and a huge waste of resources. It's more of a trophy.  Sure you can join a clan, get some bonuses and buy some shields with points, but you will be destroyed by the winners. Me, I had a gift card and blew on this game, now I just start fights and make people quit."

        "Excellent card game.  However as soon as you get passed reasonably priced starter packs you cannot play the game and why not?  Because you play two games then you need to spend huge amounts of money so you can play two more rounds.  Then you need good cards and guess what you have to buy them through a lottery system like gambling highly addictive but after maybe thousands of dollars you get the card you want guess what you need to evolve your card and guess what you need to buy your reagents big dough yet again.  Then when you have spent all your hard earned cash you need to buy special weapons to give yourself a good boost to your cards.  Do you get where this game and a right game it is too. It relies on you getting addicted so you spend all your time and resources on an endless quest for something you will never have uninstalled buy buy.",
        "Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "Dont expect any support for this game. I've been locked out and i am still waiting on a resolution, like many here. I've paid money and i know i wont be getting any compensation let alone how long its going to take to fix it.",
        "One of the few games that I don't mind spending a bit i.e. $10+ every month. Requires team guild effort to achieve stuffs together definitely gives a good feeling. Event is weekly and community is lively. Card's artwork feels like Rage of Bahamut but using matching puzzle style to deal damage. Skills of card matter as well increasing the complexity and fun. Only thing to improve would be cheaper ingame currency to encourage more people to have better decks thus higher activity rates.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition",
        "Was looking forward to playing this game, but couldn't get past the first loading screen. Closed and reopened the app multiple times and the game would be loading and then freeze my phone. I enjoyed the interactive ads enough to get the game, to bad the ads work better than the app itself"

Every so often, you’ll be gifted a new gem - and the faster you tap on box at the bottom of the screen, the faster the gems will appear.

Gonna put a hindrance on the event that's over on Friday. Do hope it's resolved soon. Still like the game tho, but would like it better if I can play.",

I have 45 gold I was ranked 3,000 in the presidents day event had A LOT OF ENDORSEMENTS FOR IT it ERASED my progress I hate that I have to start over again. Seriously need to fix this because this sucks never would've linked the game if I knew this would happen, fix it and I'll give 5 starts",
        "Right.  First off, If you are not a fan of Idle games, then don't play. This is the epitome of an Idle game.   The Early game is pretty simple. Click, Collect, Make your way to Level 80. You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn't bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn't been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event's are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events'  All in, pretty good.",
        "One of the best \"tap\" games. Love the satirical theme. Who would have thought that politics and money were SO interconnected😁. Just to be clear to some, I AM being sarcastic!!!! Great time waster. And that's NOT fake news.",
        "Not a bad idle game, but feels very \"pay to get anywhere at all\", let alone \"pay to win. Gold ingame seems a bit overpriced compared to most other game currencies and the offers to earn free gold don't work, either the offer just happens to no longer be there once you've done it, or it is still there and just doesn't register that you've done it, and this is after a few days of waiting, not the hour or two the app promises."

There are so many Hard silver times of under 30 seconds that is makes it pointless to HAVE a leaderboard. It's pathetic for people to do this just to feel like a winner for one be in their lives, to be sure, but the developers should have prevented.

The concept was good, the individual wood blocks are nice and minimalistic but then the developers pasted giant horrendous comic sans-ish fonts all over and we now have a game that needs a paper bag on its head. The gameplay also ends far too abruptly, no chance to assess your final screen and see your errors. Just so very ugly... I mean aesthetically displeasing.",

The graphics are good, the gameplay is nice, however there are no name tags on the items so players don't really know what the items being collect actually are, bear in mind that this game is played by various cultures in the world who have or have not seen these items before or have been brought up to use them differently.

Who could possibly rate this FANTASTIC  game with 1 STAR?!?!?!??🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌",

The only thing that annoys me is that when there is a tied up penguin and I miss it I feel bad I know it is just a game, but the squeals and the whining, it makes me sad will give 5 stars if fixed.",

        "Very cute game. It's nice to play to kill a few minutes. So far, I haven't needed to purchase anything to advance.  That's a HUGE plus for me. I delete games that want money so you can advance. Kid appropriate too!"

        "Alot of the elements in the stories are locked behind a payment, so unless the story talks about the image you kind of get left imagining what it is. If there was an option to earn tokens for said details instead of paying, I'd consider giving an extra star.",
        "It was nice, I was ecstatic to read one of the many stories until I got to a video, then it became boring and a bit confusing, because I couldn't play any of the videos so I was completely in the dark about what was going outside of the two characters talking. I know you guys are tryin to make money but that's probably gonna discourage downloaders of this app and make the app a wasteland, just give or take a few years.",
        "You can't be on this app for more than a few minutes without being hounded for money. Whether it's to watch videos that form part of the storyline, or just simply to keep on reading, the app is riddled with in all purchases.  Don't bother with it, there are many other apps like this that are completely free.",
        "Gave a 1 star for graphics, which was laughable- you need to pay $40 a year to see any images!! Blocks everything behind a paywall, limits how much you can read, and is overall an awful money grab. Don't even bother.",
        "I really love this app, I have read so many stories. The only bad part is having to wait 15 minutes after every part, and having to pay to see photos. But besides that, its a great way to read, and I'm a scary cat at it keeps me on edge."

        "The game itself would be great, but they don't check the questions thoroughly and have errors often. But mostly it's the developers that is the problem.  I had the ad-free version through the Amazon app store and it hadn't been updated in over a year.  It got to the point that it said it was obsolete.  So I had to switch to the ad version because I'm unwilling to purchase the game a second time.",
        "VIP machine to buy missing cards was a nice touch but to pay cash for the gems required to get the last 10 cards (which aren't necessarily the best cards in the game - so rather pointless) would cost 90 gems * 10 cards *$99.99/135gems = $666.60 ... does this strike anyone else as absurd?",
        "The game is fun it's very irritating though that every time I watch an ad to get an extra guess or a power up they don't work. It plays the ad and gives me nothing.",
        "Very useful APP. I never get bored playing it. An alternative way of keeping me engaged when I can't find a good book to read.",

Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I've tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It's the only maze puzzle app I've found worth playing! 😀💜",
        "I'm not far into it, but it's fun so far. My eyesight could be why it's not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It's still a very good game though.",
        "I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven't played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I'll have to download a separate kid version for her.",
        "5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes",

        "Where is the challenge? This game is as lame as the rest of the maze games. If you would  try make the game more challenging then maybe I would not have deleted it."

        "Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!",
        "Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can't just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can't advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it's basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.",
        "In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it's newer it's boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star",
        "This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said \"add break\". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them.",
        "The game desparately needs to offer more coins as skill level increases.  The frequency of coins remains the same while the skill level demands more and more coins (in the thousands).  Watching ads helps, but the player finds themselves doing that exclusively, which defeats the purpose of the game.  Physics, graphics and gameplay are good.",
        "One Of My Favorite Games  So. Let me start of by saying I LOVE it! So I like very few games, in fact nearly no games. But this  game is epic! It's interactive, fun, motivate and time killing. But there is one problem and that's there are to many adds and most of them are inappropriate"

        "This game is actually really fun, but two stars for the ads. They're not well-distributed, having reached a point where no ads would show up after a few runs, and then one would appear after every run no matter how short. A 30 second ad after a run that ended in just a couple seconds? Multiple times in a row? I understand ads needs to be there, but I'd like to have more play time than ad time.",
        "Very enjoyable game, quite addictive and jumping back into a new game is quick. Couple of gripes, there seems to be some slow down or framrate dipping after an ad has shown and the option to remove ads isn't working. Sort this out and it will get another 2 stars",
        "The game itself is pretty fun. I think I'd like it. But the ads are far, far too intrusive. Not only are there too many. But, many of them have timers. Some are 30 seconds, and you can't break out. Too annoying. I have no interest I sitting and waiting for ads to finish",
        "Too redundant. After a couple times it's boring and way too many Ads. I only played 5 rounds and there were Ads after every round. That's 5 Ads for every minute of gameplay (give or take). Developers are making a killing. Little too greedy if you ask me and all of you are falling for it.📵",
        "Its shameful how some developers ruin their games with such amount of ads! A new ad every new page!! WOW! For that kind of games, the ones you die quickly - it's not recommended to have a new video ad on every page! It makes you get board of the game and you end up watching more ads than playing the actual game.. 2 stars for the concept and beautifully ruined game.",
        "Waaay too many ads, especially in the beginning when you're still getting the hang of the gameplay. Having to watch a 15 second ad after every crash – given how often that happens – is unnecessary. Granting 3 lives between ads would do a lot to keep players who would otherwise say \"I don't have time for this\" and drop the app like I did.  I would even be willing to pay to get rid of ads once I know that I like the gameplay, but the current system interrupts play so much that I couldn't even get to that point."

Also no longer says how manybingos are available when round starts. Tremendously bad update. This game went from one of the best to one of the worst. Please fix",

Good thing I know where the collect buttons are..nothing but black square...😥this really sucks. I went to see if i could play my games..what games?  No cards. Just big black square!..",

        "Its fun but could be better.  For one issue am running into is anything I carft by way of fire, work bench, etc I cant take item out. So how is one suppouse to progress if you cant get items. Energy holds u back becuase it refill is way to long of wait time. Not really anything worth buying seems like even if u buy amour or something seems to beat smack you. Also be nice if resources would we spawn after a time in your strong hpld.",
        "Damn good game. Great concept created a game with very good graphics and game play and made a lot of people think there actually playing and competing with other players. I do love this game but I would love it even more if I was actually playing against real people instead. Don't try to make me believe the other players in the game are real all someone has to do is uninstall and reinstall the game to see. Wow same strongholds with the exact same stuff to steal but totally different players. Again still good game but I will no longer put real money into just to play with myself. Instead I will use fake money lol",
        "this game is very cool but seriously you really have to spend money to enjoy it fully.The energy system is garbage and walking from place to place is tooo long... seriously 24 MINUTES,also inventory space is insanely limited and it wants you to spend money for more slots. I understand you have to do this in a free game but please don't make the game unplayable becouse of that. I still hope this game will be better in the future becouse i enjoy my time playing it",
        "Great game, restrictive on recipes, needs to improve learning them better. Durability can improve with repair proficiency. Lower proficiency lower durability,  houses could have durability consistent to material. Stronger longer lasting. Anything and everything on enemies gatherable would be awesome, i.e clothes off walkers armor off knights. Environment growth above dungeons could be progressable. Never completed dungeon no growth completed many times a knight.  Fishing would be nice. Hire vendor would be great in player compound. Upgradable structures is cool. Learning them.",
        "I love it! It's a wonderful game,  well made and had beautiful traffics graphics but, the energy recharge is slow,  which makes playing the game longer than 10 minutes impossible. Plants should grow back as well as trees after a certain time. I also made two purchases and never received them. I bought talons and a weapons cache. Please give me my weapons or my $8.99 back.",
        "Its a good game actually, BUT...  * You need to make trees grow at your stronghold. *Need to have deers roaming once in a while in yr stronghold. *Energy regenarating needs improvement. * You should be able to gather seeds from your plantations *Should have rain collector,ponds, lake or rivers to get water and to fish for food. * Maybe berries that grows within ur stronghold area. * Energy spending is to fast that makes us play for just five to ten minutes only. * You should design a game that is enjoyable to play by giving us more time to play it, not everyone can afford to buy with real money. Hope you can make changes so that we can continue to support you. Thanks."

        "You shouldve stuck to the roots pf the game.  You made the game very 2 dimensional by removing the acceleration boost you get from doing flips like you had in the first game, not to mention you also dumbed down the contols. You shouldve kept the original style of the first one. Mad Skillz BMX is one of the only reasons i keep my tiny ipod touch around.",

Had a lot of fun with it up until that point, but it's definitely not worth spending actual money on. Deleted the game after pay to win clearly became a necessity.",

        "Awesome game!  Earning money is easy especially with online play and watching ads.  ONLY downfall is earning gold can be a pain,  seem like the only way to get gold is by beating a boss, buying gold with real cash and levelling up which can take some time.  Other then that it's a very addictive game if you love BMX that is.  Folloq me on instagram @evans_customz",
        "Very good game but I wish there was a better way of getting gold without having to pay out of your hard working money. Since when did games start asking for cash? I would pay to buy the game but buying gold is stupid as hell.. either way very good game"

And I get even more coins. It's really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and",

That cant get in even we need them somtimes we play it and we need a ninja and its not in the box to pick a ninja you will jut restart the game. Anyways but i still love it Ninjago is my  favorite have you guys watch the ninjago movie even there episodes. Thank you for creating this game.👍👍👍👍👍👍",

        "I think if you could add a few extra spaces for more ninja then everybody would be happy .the reason I'm giving this app a 4 star rating is because you can only have up to five ninja on a mission including your own .if anybody would like that to happen then give this review a thumbs up.",

If a child is playing this and wants their favorite character, parents are having to shell out money to keep them happy. it should be either buy it or earn it.",
        "Grafics are amazing!!! Constantly wanting you to buy gems that help you move along in the game.  You can send characters on tasks that are suppose to drop needed parts you need to advance and they rarely drop. Not sure why different updates cause the game to crash more often. But again,  when it works, the Grafics are really cute!",
        "It was fun until it won't stay on long enough to do anything.  I have started it 6times this morning!!!  This has been going on for awhile but today crazy.. I am going to uninstall it if there is no fix soon..  I have played this game going on 2yrs.. very frustrating..it runs even worse since y The stupid update..thanks for nothing!!!!",
        "This game is really cute and fun. I greatly enjoy it. However, the resource cost jumps quickly to ridiculous rates and there is no ability to assist friends. I could get over the resource cost if friend visiting and helping were to be added. That would make this review go from a 3 to a 5.",
        "You guys need to up the gems for watching videos 1 gem is just not enough, you guys are making it so hard to collect characters, it takes months just to collect a character worth gems it is ridiculous. Also for some reason since the pooh bear update began i keep getting kicked out of game play it is getting frustrating coz i actually enjoy playing this game. It brings out my inner child",
        "So my first bad review just disappeared? What kinda bs is this damn game on? Your screwing me on getting the Genie! I got rarer characters easier than the Genie. When I wrote a review about it, it was gone not 5 mins later. I request a response to this issue immediately!"

It's pretty simple and easy to learn. Newer and f2p players have a bit of a rough go, but you can easily keep pace in this game for less than $100 a year.",
        "Really fun game. 3 stars cause it closes very easily. If I get a phone call even when I dont answer the game closes.even on wifi it closes. Then it takes too long to reload causing me to lose a turn. This is the worst in arena because losing one turn will kill you and it becomes a waste of gold. Please do whatever you can to solve this problem.",
        "I love card games and this got some awesome elements. However... The randomness and luck in this game is pure bs. You can be in a winning position and still lose because of 1 in a 10000000 chance of the oponent getting lucky. Even when I win I feel bad from winning because I know the oponet was unlucky.... It is very rare I get a game where I think. This game was awesome because we both did our best.",

        "Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn't came in two years it probably isn't. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don't pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges.",
        "Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.",
        "I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.",
        "this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It's a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that's it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame",
        "Funny characters, endearing cartoon aesthetic and enjoyable game play, but after a couple hunts forces you to wait over 8 minutes before you can actually play again (in order to entice you to pay to make the wait times go away). What kind of game compels you to QUIT out of BOREDOM after playing it for 5 minutes?",
        "When I updated it to this new version. my profile got automatically reset . I was on lvl 71 with all of my squeezers full upgraded except two of them.. I had saved my profile on google play. But it was showing my previous save when I was on lvl 36 ... this is tooo baad.. I am hating it"

        "10%... 3 hours later. Still 20% Now every single thing is a money making scam. I used to enjoy this but my liking has gradually decreased... The 6 islands used to be able to be explored leisurely... No. I Don't Want More. \"Hire A Worker\" \"You Dont Have Enough Food!!!\" NEED MORE SHOVELS!! Cannot Leave Islands. Have To Piss Away Cash Money On Gems To RETURN... MORE COIN PILES WOULD SURE BE NICE",
        "It's a nice game that gets you hooked really quickly. But as for the gameplay, all you can do is make your workers do tasks and then come back some hours later when they're finished. The expeditions are nice, most of all the graphics and the love to detail. Still it's impossible to fibish the expeditions in time unless you don't have no others hobbies. *smirk* But all in all it's fine! &lt;3",
        "It is amazing.really keeps you hooked on.. However when it comes to completing the quest, resources get over quickly and as per the time we need to wait for 3hrs for getting the refill,or buy it with the diamonds.... Lower the time limit for resource production like in different expeditions..as that will unable us to play more and complete it too on time.",
        "Game is addictive . Would give 5 stars if you add more workers to start with.  Need to make it way less time to make supplies . Make quests less things to complete them . Instead of 4 to 5 apples or whatever should only be 1 . Great game but people will stop playing if you don't stop making it so expensive to play.  Not every one has real money to spend they way you make them to play.  When you run out of apples you charge 10 diamond's to refill the next time is 20 and then 40 come on . Please make this more player friendly.  There are games out there who care about the players and not the money . Please be one of them . Then I will give 5 stars",
        "I thought it would be more about solving things, but there are no brain challenges for now and I'm on the 10th level. I've noticed that a few times some of my coins disappeared. Slow as you need to grow a lot of food etc. before you can do anything. You would have to spend quite a lot of real money to make it reasonable pace",
        "Just wish coins would add up over time. You have to keep getting them as soon as they are available. Don't like having to it for an hour just to be able to do something in the game and then there is nothing to do but collect the coins every couple of minutes a few at a time. But this is a great ongoing game except for that."

        "this game is good till about 8 hours in where your waiting days to build anything. Gems are really hard to come by so you have to be wary about how much stock u have. And there's no way to dispose of unwanted items in your warehouse (that I know of) but yeah, it's a catchy game",
        "I liked this game, and have played it for months, until a few days ago when I noticed the \"price\" of buildings required to progress take a huge jump up!! I will gladly support a game I like by making purchases but I'm not about to spend my house payment just to progress IN A GAME!! Not cool, and makes me regret the money Ive spent so far. On to the next!!",
        "Super easy to run out of storage, then when you try to sell nobody wants to buy anything even if you price it 75% off total price because they're full too. It would be nice to be able to delete items you can't sell, don't want, or can't use. Really want love the game.",
        "It's quite annoying that you have to wait so long for all the buildings. Days. And fighting the trolls. Again, days. And that it is so hard to get the flame amulets that you need in order to make progress. It saps all the fun out of the game.",
        "I gave a name to my village but after logging in through fb i get only my fb name displayed. I wanted the initial farm name only to be displayed. At first the game was fun.. but now time taken is too much for each task to be complete which is frustating",
        "Awesome game really cute awesome graphics only MAJOR issues that will cause me to uninstall the game is the storage capacity I have been hung for two days and still can't go any further due to ALL storages being full"

But it still needs a bit more to improve.. I would love it even more if you had more stuff.. And if you didnt had to pay for anything  at all.. Also, please just open the spa and the other stuff you cant get unless you pay!",

        "I downloaded this game for my little sister and the first thing she said was that there are way too many adverts and I agree because whenever she clicked on say the dress up or nail salon or gym and adverts would always come up. The game also lags too much even though she has a brand new IPad. However at this time I would not recommend this game. My sister said that she would play the game again if you reduce and have a limited amount of adverts. As well as the advert problems the game keeps telling me to buy everything and it pops up every time I think when you press the 'X' button it shouldn't show again. Please fix this now. As much as my sister loves this game the adverts really annoy her. Would not recommend this game!!",
        "This is from my daughter, \"I like the game but there's some things about it I kind of don't understand. Some of the controls are a little difficult like the one where you have to tap 1 or tap 2 when she's practicing. And its fun. Some of it I like a lot.\"   This is from me, \"the app is annoying until you buy it. It downloaded a ton of icons (ads for other games) to my picture gallery without informing me. My daughter likes the game a lot and it's fun, but a bit intrusive with the free version. The gameplay is good overall.\"",
        "Love everything about this game!!! At first I was skeptical, but then once I started playing, I fell completely in love with it!!!! The only downside of the game is that I am waiting for the other challenges to open so I can compete. Other than that, this game is great overall...5⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
        "I think u should have all four slots open to play on  so you can improve on your skills. It gets boring just playing the two apparatus. How much longer do we have to wait"

There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can't play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That's just ridiculous. Not to mention it's very buggy. Sometimes you're racing someone who's in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it's just stupid.",

But when I'm connected to Wi-Fi there's too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you'll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I'm playing the game??!! It's too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.",
        "Well before I say my review, I would like to clear out a few of the negative reviews. There are not very many ads at all, in fact I barely ever even get any. Second, the controls don't suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.",
        "I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don't you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?",
        "THIS GAME IS THE WORST!!! Save yourself some time and DON'T install this thing I can barely move the car so please make easier to control. I know your trying but I,m sorry I,m uninstalling this game.",
        "I don't know why the controls have a 3.7 rating, they're actually pretty good. The gameplay's decent and the graphics are too. Btw I get over 600 score everytime just to let you know because the controls quote on quote \"barely move the car\"",
        "It's stupid. It's really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn't turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked."

Sure clan stuff looks nicer and I was excited about the infinite scouts for videos, however that perk is gone. Really makes me lose interest since I'm not gonna pay to play. Not to mention it also recently got way more difficult to get gems and overall this game is getting pathetic.",
        "Love the game. The game play is great. Only down side is that I feel that the game cheats against me sometimes by adding enemies. Only happened about 3 times now. ***edit*** I have since realized there are certain pigs that do add more pigs when hit. The game doesn't cheat. I'm extremely happy with the game play and ability to build a great team without paying a whole bunch of money. You just need patients and good planning.",
        "Personally I don't like PvP system in this game. You don't play with other players in real time so I even don't know how it can be called PvP. Additionally system put you with a player which has much more power than you, so there is no chance to win. Time wasting.",
        "the game is really fun and humorous. I love the clan feature- found a great clan to be part of. there are glitches that rovio needs to iron out that affect play. I am hoping this new big update helps fix all that. the changes look to be really good. excited to see what they've done.",
        "I did not expect to enjoy this nearly as much as I have. The frequent events are nice and having a guild just makes them better. I don't feel compelled to be social be because there is no chat, just playing the game. It is a wonderful balance.",
        "Only had the game a few days. Was going great till the update today and like many i hit the fetching player profile and it has a server error and cannot connect. Glad i haven't spent months on this game like others for this to happen. Hope the problem is resolved soon. It had become and addicting game."

        "I really enjoy this game, but I have found a flaw in the design. The game speeds up as you go and after a point it doesn't go faster, but after around 10,000 you notice the ball start to move forward on the screen and after about 20,000 you don't even have to move the ball to not die. It just misses the spikes. I know you might be thinking Its not on the leaderboards, but that's my next complaint. Im currently 6 on the leaderboards, but I've gotten a better score and it won't update. I quite frankly destroyed that score and it doesn't show up. Thank you for your time and I hope this helped",

        "Game is great, far too many ads, after each level AND major issues with the videos giving rewards. I watched 4 and only received 1 reward which makes the game unfair and not worth playing.",

So I hit \"solve\" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I've recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you've ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?",

        "My favorite puzzle/physics app. After I reached my goal of 3 stars on all the levels, I was sad my conquest was over. Then I discovered a whole other area of the app that consists of user created levels to solve. Now I've got new puzzles everyday thanks to the active fans in the brain-it-on community and I submit my own levels on occasion by using the level editor. If you like solving puzzles this is a great way to escape for awhile and exercise your brain at the same time.",
        "I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.",
        "this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates",
        "A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it's really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it.",
        "Hmm, what to say? I enjoyed it thoroughly (and I still am enjoying it). It was far more challenging than I thought, and I enjoyed being challenged by it. After all, that's what the game's about, isn't it? It's definitely a great game overall, and I'm looking forward to seeing how much further I can get in it. Also, it's really fun to just throw a massive block at a puzzle when you're confused. Sometimes violence IS the answer, it seems.",
        "LOVE this game!! Literally, I don't think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it's just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜"

        "Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you're given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.",
        "Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.",
        "Must be the shortest time I have had a game installed. Pace of gameplay is SLOW and I hate the voice of the game. So annoying! If I could skip the animation before and after a level it would be much better.",
        "Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.",
        "Liked it but sometimes it just wouldn't give me the right bubbles to win at the end when I absolutely could've. If there's 4 bubbles left and none of them are yellow why do you give me a yellow one? I felt cheated",
        "The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item."

Also, why does the Apple version have stars and the android version doesn't? I was trying so hard to earn enough stars to buy the colour packs on my iPod, and I got quite disappointed that I can't do that on android. I guess I'll just delete the game off android since there's really no goal to the game now.",
        "Very fun and addicting but nice calm relaxing game. Ads only happen after each round and not a big deal. If you want to keep playing this game FREE then add up with the package. Quiet whinning about ads. Someonbe has to pay the creators for this game including the upkeep and updates. How else will the creator make his money? 2 choices, either gets ads or charge to download. So I can deal with the ads. It's a FREE APP.",
        "Really annoying when ads pop up and you have to start from scratch. That's really my only complaint about this game, but it's a big complaint. It sucks to feel like you get really far and then all of a sudden it stops in the middle of the game. This is a finished game not an interactive advertisement where it stops you from going further.  In all honestly it plays simply and I like it a lot but it needs some improvements.",
        "I like the game a lot but it would be nice if there was a way to take back or redo your last move. There's been times that while I'm playing, the piece I'm placing ends up 1 square off from where I wanted it to go. Situations like that is where a \"redo\" or \"do over\" option would be very helpful and greatly appreciated. If you were to add that, it'd be a 5 star game for sure. Also some other colors options that didn't cost money would be great too! Other than those couple of things, keep up the great work you guys!",

        "This is an idle game with effort and pretty fun writing, with a lot of ways to feel rewarded without cracking your wallet. It's obviously not the driving game but if you want an idle/clicker, you can't really go wrong with this one. The character diversity is a genuine highlight more games could take a note from.",
        "It's okay and the graphics are really nice, the sound effects are good but ultimately, you play and play and play and play and still not got to the other towns. I've got to about the 7th and had enough of trying to get further and not progressing much. It's okay for a few days but after that, and like someone else has mentioned about the ads, too many to get little rewards",
        "Really fun and adictingl but for samsung galaxy core prime this game has A LOT of bugs and glitches. Tried to play for more than five minutes is making the phone first freeze the screen then restart itself. Some cabs never arrive. Need a lot of bugfixes right now. Other than that it is a good game that i like.",
        "For a game so heavily reliant on ads to deliver benefits to the player, it is a gamble sometimes whether or not those ads will crash the game and therefore cost you the prizes. The game itself is all right, but this gamble drags down the experience when it doesn't work.",
        "Game runs like a clunker. There is no smooth transition from one screen to the next or even when trying to click on the people who need a ride. There are FAAAARRRR too many cutscreens for all the various cabbies to hire. It gets tedious after a few minutes. I played the game for no more than 10 minutes and am already tired of it all. I was hoping for better.",
        "It's like owning your own transportation service like Uber or Lyft, but in arcade Crazy Taxi meets Monopoly. If you hire drivers to your service, you not only make more money, but you expand your  territory. I love the diversity of the characters, how you have new with the classic arcade characters like Axel, Gus and Gena. And I also love the concept is modern, but has the classic arcade concept and feel with the scratch cards, gems, and money. Bonuses are earned through accomplishing objectives, and of course, ads. Thanks Sega. 👌👍❤"

The pictures showing the terrains is probably copied off of MCPE's pictures (I am not saying it is! But it might be). I really like this game I really do but there needs to be some changes. People aren't going to like this game if there isn't some changes. I just read a comment saying this game is \"gay\". That was incredibly rude. People shouldn't call it \"dumb\" or \"gay\" just because this game needs better graphics or it has to many ads. Does anyone even know the definition of \"gay\"? There is two meanings for it but they both mean your happy! Stop calling the game names! It is not necessary to!",

Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don't get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don't mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!",
        "It's honestly a fun game, and I'd love to use it as a stimulating activity (ah, who am I kidding, it's just a great time killer), but it makes my head hurt-- and that's a problem. I'm not even the type of person that is negatively affected by fast-paced graphics or rapidly changing colors. It'd be five stars if it didn't give me headaches, but, for now, it gets three; good graphics, smooth gameplay, but no matter how great the app, it isn't worth physical discomfort. (Note: if you are looking for something similar, try \"Run\". It has the same sort of concept, but without the advertisements and headaches.)",

It keeps me entertained while I am bored or when I am on the bus on my way to school. But there are way to many ads and I hope u guys please fix that. 💜",

        "This truly is one of the best simulation games I have played and ×what makes even better is you can play and not be forced to spend real money. I love this. It's a great time killer , you can get creative. Just o.e small issue is when trying to relocate any building or decorations it's hard to control that part. But it's AWESOME",
        "This game is good but got it through Sony's store an i got an older version. When i came here to update and rate it an i discovered i had to install it again. Now i got 2 games both linked to Facebook but no way to continue the old game data on the new one. Oh with surprise its not even on gamelofts sit. Please help",
        "I love this game and would like to keep playing. But since the update I couldn't get into my stadium, the game would crash. Now, it won't even open. I even uninstalled it then reinstalled it, but it won't even open. It's just a black screen then back to my home screen. So, I loved it, but I can't even play it, so I guess I have to delete it :'/",
        "For some reason the game has been force closing after every ad I watch I watch an ad to rush 5 mins and it force closes after the ad plays and doesn't give the 5 mins off. Please fix this I have paid money toward this game and I watch ads to help also thank again for making the best city building game ever. 5 stars will be back when I can watch an ad without force close. I play on galaxy s7 edge    Loving this game it gives you a huge island with all kinds of different terrain to expand your city and also has plenty of ways to rush things by watching optional ads it's very rewarding and there are mini games to entertain and reward you  I've only had this game a few days now but It is so much better than sim city build it that I don't even play sim city anymore good job Gameloft can't wait for future updates.",
        "It's pretty cool. Definitely has a little challenge at beginning having to wait for the resources to be made for everything. I'm gonna play it for awhile to see if gets better. Graphics are alright but game control is little touchy when placing new buildings.",
        "Well I was really enjoying the game until it was time to expand my storage (in lvl 7). The arrow pointing to the storage button with the guy on the left saying this one's free and I can't click on anything. Like it's frozen, but not frozen because things still get highlighted when going by them. What's the problem here?! Restarted my phone, cleared junk and other apps, ???"

        "This game is fun, but it would be much better if they make it so that you can watch video ads so that you can get more spoons, boots, and lives. You can only watch a video once or twice for a life. I definitely won't spend my actual money to play this game. It's not a home counsel game.  Also, this game gets difficult quickly. I'm in the Paris level and barely making it through. I like to play this game for fun and to pass time. But the difficulty increases makes it not as fun.",
        "This game is designed to make you pay to progress. On levels where you have to serve x # of customers, they are slow to come put so you fail without buying extra time. On levels where the goal is earning a certain amount of money, a large # of customers come out who only want drinks, so you fail unless you buy more time. It's always just 1 or 2 customers short or just 1 or 2 $ short. It's frustrating and aggravating.",
        "Very fun and competitive game. Please get rid of the double tap trash feature....sooo frustrating! It really passes by time. I'm totally addicted and hate myself for my purchases sometimes. Could use a few better graphics and I wish the lives lasted longer. Overall, great game!",
        "Great game. I hate if you don't make the challenge you lose the money and you prepare the food and the customer took the order and you get nothing,  but over all I enjoy the game.",
        "This is a great and challenging game UNTIL you get to Mexico.  But with a lot of patience and taking advantage of every aid that is available, you can do it.   Fun and challenging.  Use your boosts wisely.   Food court challenges are a bit pointless.   You have to use up your boosts to finish, so that you get the same boosts as your prize.",
        "Tutorials on bonus challenges are still not there. Ive been collecting daily junk for 2 weeks now to try and get past 112 on the Paris level (1 spoon after 3 days, 800 coins etc). You no longer get power ups. I love this game but your just money grabbers which is is why I refuse to buy anything. Normally I would but the games blatently out to sting people.  Don't send your usual \"glad your enjoying the game\" either. I've gotten this far so fix it or i'm f×××ing off."

        "Am not much on matching games but this one I felt compelled to comment on because it's much different than most. It's whimsical, very cute and animated. I think children would certainly enjoy this game quite a bit but is also adorable and entertaining for adults. If you like matching games you need to download this game, I'm sure you'll agree it doesn't disappoint. 👍👍",
        "I used to LOVE this game... But then they added ads in the game every time your screen changes! I get you need ads to make money but it's ridiculous with this game. In addition they are the video ads that blare and made a scene too. I'll sadly be uninstalling the game now. I'm so disappointed.",
        "Excessive ads to the point where I get them if I accidentally tap pause and after every level. It's another candy crush style game with levels locked behind Facebook friends, money, or patience.",
        "I like the game but when doing the daily quest (fb) it will NEVER let me get to the end. It always resets! Very frustrating. Please fix!",
        "DECEPTIVE AD! Pains me to have to write this, as in general, I love the comic Simon's Cat typically... BUT while playing Wordscapes, saw an ad showing a spot-the-difference with b/w sketch of animated pigeons. Reminded me of the Highlights magazine, tapped it... saw it was Simon's Cat and thought that was awesome. Downloaded this and found out it's ONLY a Bejeweled-derivitive match-game!!! So now Simon's Cat is at the center of bold and textbook false-advertisement and/or misrepresentation! -_-",
        "It is kind of fun, but a lot of times in the middle of making connections between the tiles it just stops and you wasted one of your little moves. Some levels are really easy others are not really manageable without coins, which leads to the problem, that the 'free' game will get you to buy it anyways....."

        "By a stroke of luck I got my old game back in February 2018 after a span of a year and a month. Good to be back. A suggestion : why don't you have something like a banking system wherein you can exchange the different currencies in play in the game. There could be a selling price and a purchase price which gives the bank a margin",
        "The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I'd like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.",
        "Thanks for new upgrade . Even when the game was slow i didn't stop playing. I love this game. It's not only a game for me...i am a President of my club and i have to lead my members... in less than one year i reached level 50 and almost all land expanded...just  you have to understand how to play... be smart... some advice for beginners  start participate in mayor competition...this way you will grow faster",
        "I absolutely love this game. I play it all throughout the day. I've made really good friends with the people in my club, and we are all over the somewhat new \"club wars\" feature. There was a lag, but it was recently fixed. There's always something to do in this game, and you can play at your own pace. You don't have to spend real money to play the game, but I'll admit that I spend a dollar every now and then for the 30 days of green buck income. I love this game so much that I've even started a second city on another device with my other email.",
        "The more stuff is added the lagier it gets. Game freezes when buying items, when going over your city, with the chat, loading the flobsl trade, travelling to other cities and basicly everything nowadays. Requires multiple restarts of the game and reboots of my phone regularly to keep jt playable nowadays. It used to be really good and smooth, but it only gets worse each update and no improvement in sight. I only play now because I made some good friends in my club, but the actual fun is long gone. :(",
        "Really started loving it but, it's so highly optimized that it would make u bound to buy simleons-cash. Thus the game becomes super slow for u unless u pay and eventually booooring.   When u r in need of an item, the game wont show that item on global HQ. U will hav to play the game knowing the fact they r makin u to suffer so that u give them dollars."

        "The only game where I'm experiencing so much lag even though my Internet speed is good. Its happening more after the 3.1 update. Why sacrifice the gameplay for graphics? It totally sucks and game insight need to sort out this problem. Game is becoming worse instead of getting better. Oh, and it's totally pay to win. Other games are much better now.",
        "Oh mannnnn😥 Its a damn addictive game love it too much but............ The game has totally become pay to win .Guyz make some improvement.Dont just earn money through game.Gameinsight should  decrease  gold cost of gold  weapons.And also introduce new assault and shotguns without including any event. Make those new year guns available soon and dont keep its gold cost higher than juggernaut coz its fire rate is damn slow .Plz after reading this review make  changes in game .This will not only benefit players but also your company in increasing your game lovers and customers.",
        "Hate the multiple control point matches. Rewards are way, way, WAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY too low considering how incredibly expensive weapons and upgrades are. You win, you get 30 trophies. You lose, you lose 60. They welcome hackers/cheaters into the game. You pay real money for gold and upgrades, you are guaranteed wins and quick 0 hit kills. 100% pay to win. Greedy. No more from me.",
        "Not sure why people are saying this as a bad game and all.  I loved it and recommended it to some of my friends also. They also loved it.  Game is online multiplayer mode and even if you didn't like it in the first 10-15 minutes, give it some more time and u'll definitly keep playing it.",
        "Don't waste your time or money! Game needs serious rebalancing, later game guns feel powerless against ridiculous tank-like armor and headshots mean almost nothing! Would give the game a better review if at least headshots dealt more damage.",
        "Have had this game for a bit its not bad but dont always get the kill when I'm the only one shooting at an opponent and same when I'm shooting an enemy, a team mate kills them and i wont always get an assist. Could you add more? Maybe get creative with a campaign or more maps so we can have a choice between capture/ defence and team death match. Still worth a download for those who like a good fps"

But can msp add a private photo send so only People  you know well can see your photos! Thank you if you can and please add more things to app .Also can you add more chats games and shops to msp?:)",
        "I love it. It is so adictive. You can meet people, who can eventually even be your bf or gf and you get to have best friends. The chatrooms are so fun! The computer version is better but the mobile game is just as fun. But MSP listen to me, you NEED to let the mobile game bring the pets you buy with you in chat rooms. BC when I'm on this mobile game I can't bring my pet with me and its annoying. But other than that I LOVE THIS GAME!😘😘😘",
        "This game is great...but there's an issue. If I click on the VIP button (on my tablet) to try buy VIP, it logs me out! can you try to fix this issue please? :'( Also, I have £35 but apparently I can't afford a diamond top-up.",
        "Hi movie star planet! I dislike something's on movie star planet like how people get bullied for things and how expensive VIP is! And also How expensive clothing and stuff is make it all free! And leveling up...On the app make a way to level up quickly as well. Also... BRING BACK SAMANTHA!!!! MEH AND HER A BFFFFFFFFFFFFFF'S!!!!",
        "I like this game. I've been playing for 4 years now but not much has changed. There's tons of glitches as well. I can easily get free vip.",
        "I love this game! It's super fun on all devices,  but I find you are more privileged if you are on a PC/Laptop of some sort. Maybe if you could add a lot of things from the PC version to the mobile device version things would be a lot more fun. Mainly Wishlists because they are really fun! MSP is currently updating at this moment"

        "Please add more cars and make the graphics more realistic, and make the sounds of the cars realistic, unique, and smooth. Make each car have its own sound, the sounds they're supposed to have. Add the car stats and add a nitro feature. Add the brand each car is supposed to have. Make the cars spit fire!. Add weather conditions like rain, thunderstorm, lightning, and windy. Please add cars like: Ferrari F50 GT, W Motors Lykan Hypersport, Ferrari FXX Evoluzione, Hennessey Venom GT, Bugatti Chiron, Ferrari FXX K, McLaren P1, Dodge Challenger SRT, Chevrolet Camaro SS, Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4, Lamborghini Veneno, Chevrolet Corvette Z06 C7r, Ferrari 458 Italia, McLaren F1 GTR, even the Devel Sixteen Prototype. Please add these cars on the next update!. If you can, add them in packs!",
        "I can't say I love it,maybe I can. But any way, this would have to be in one of top hundred games😀. There are a few things I would like added though. Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed this😀😁😀😁😀😁.",
        "This has to be like, my 5th or 6th reinstallment of this game since there's no ingame reset, but darn well worth the data(little bytes). I usually like more realistic car games, but even the \"extreme\" warp in physics in the gameplay doesn't distract from the fun. These are the cars you'd want if you're trying to beat the traffic, run from the cops, or solve a parking dillemma. Great fun time killer! One thing though, the other reviewers are correct in their complaints about how often and when ads pop up. That shouldn't happen smack dab in the middle of a maneuver.",
        "This is crazy like I understand that you need ads but the fact that they are popping up on the middle of the screen is crazy! Like I woodnt mind if you had a small one at the bottom is the screen but the fact it pops up at random in the screen is really annoying and finds the game. I do love this game but the ads ruin it. Please fix this!",
        "What you should improve is that YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ADD's I MEAN SERIOUSLY I WATCH MORE ADDS THAN THE GAMEPLAY. I ONLY PLAY FOR A LITTLE THEN MOST OF ADDS SHOW UP. I WQ5CH ADDS THAN PLAY8NG THE GAME FOR CRYING OT LOUD!!",
        "This game was just really really good! But please please make the exact same game but instead, if you do something illegal like crash into another car, the cops start chasing you. If you do do this I will comment on every single game that comes up on the adds. But, there is a tiny bit to much adds. Anyways, AMAZING fame!!!😊"

        "Unique offering by Infinite .. I haven't seen a game like this before nor did I expect to .. you form a pot as it spins on a pottery wheel. You can widen it, narrow it, make it taller or shorter. The goal of the game becomes forming pots as per Aunt Chloe's instructions and then painting it as she dictates. You send the pot to her for cash.. and more pots to make. The controls are decent but a bit quirky at times when trying to form the pot.",
        "Fantastic and very creative game... I give it 4 stars... And leave 1 star only because its brushes are not free after african.... it is my humble request to developers that please provide some more brushes for free.... And if possible (free the whole brushes 😋)... Ha ha ha ha... Nice job developers....👍👍👍 Akash Prafulla Barik \"Baadal\" (India)",
        "Loved this game! A relaxing timekiller when you have nothing else to do. Quite addicting as well. Inspires me to do pottery in real life! The only things I don't like is that you have to buy the full version for $5, alhough if it was entirely free I'd probably get bombarded by ads.. A fun game, nonetheless!",
        "I installed it for time pass, but my 21 month old baby without even we teaching her how to play, learned it on her own, and she is an expert. She gets scores as high as 272. I know it is very bad for such small baby to play in mobile, but sh gets very upset.",
        "This game definitely deserves five stars. Here are a few reasons I love it.  1. Graphics- The quality of the app is surreal and offers the viewer a fun experience in the gameplay.  2. Gameplay- The letters/messages you receive to re-create the photo of are very intriguing in my opinion and I wish I could get the full version for more.  3. Thank You- The work that must have been put in to this game is incredible and I hope one day I can get the full version. I enjoy all of your apps and hope to see more.",
        "It's just that you have to make the full version download free. We don't have to make the payment of the Game. When we download the game in the starting of the game we get message but after that we don't. Now l'm bored 'cause the messages for making new pots are not coming...... Pls just make it what l'm saying. But baki all is a good job.............................."

        "Waste of money. No matter what you spend you never get decent cards. They stack the odds so no matter how you buy cards you'll always get ripped off. Mom's box is supposedly random yet I've bought hundreds of boxes I've never got anything worth a damn. I've played over a year and wasted a hundred bucks on this game w no reward. I strongly recommend you don't spend a dollar on this game. It won't help. The game will still screw you. Money will not help on this game.",
        "Such a fun, entertaining, and addictive game. I love all of these cartoons it's so cool to have them all in one game! The  Only problem is that it can run slow and it lags. But all around it gets an A +.",
        "This game is pretty much pay to play. The only way you will get good cards is is you pay for them. They have free gems you can earn, but getting those are hard as hell too. When you try to show proof of you earning the free gems they make up excuses as to why they won't give them to you. Overall it's fun but you are going to dump a lot of money in this game just to be disappointed.",
        "I loved this game at first played constantly but recently it messing up bad for me. Whenever I try to battle in any way it picks my cards for me and plays for me. I can't figure out how to fix it and have uninstalled and reinstalled a few times and has to start over every time which SUCKED!! Since I had a TON of great cards!! Each time the game would work fine for a bit and I could battle and be able to pick my own cards.Then one day it stopped working again and again. Super dissatisfied and disappointed.",
        "Really good fun to begin with but then you hit lvl 6 and it becomes insanely difficult. Like they just decided to suck all the fun out of it. Shame because I was really enjoying it up until then.",
        "ILove this game however just recently it started crashing and now when I start it up it will just sit at the loading screen at 24 percent and wont go further so now I am unable to play the game which is a bit annoying."

        "Pay to win: In all my years of gaming, i have never played a game more pay to win than this. If your opponent has bought the tower packs and plays carefully, there is literally nothing you can do with your tier 1 and 2 towers. The only viable strategy is to buy lots of 2:2 wizards and hope your opponent messes up, if your game is as imbalanced as this unless you pay, don't make it free to play in the first place",
        "The only thing I do not like is how you need the vip membership to use the special modes, which I get you guys need money to keep it going but I think like one day a week there it should he free for that day or and hour or two. Keep up the good work Ninja Kiwi 😊",
        "So the ads 30-60 secs, a very small x in the corner to close the ad when finished, in-app purchases, optional ads for extras, bad servers which disconnect frequently...  All suggesting that you pocket a lot of the money without reinvesting in the game, it's a shame since I love TD games but the ads are too much on this and it shows that you're trying almost everything to sap money out of people which takes the fun out too. Uninstalling until the ads are significantly reduced in time.",
        "You have hackers playing this game. I just played a game against a guy who ballons kept passing all his towers but no points came out of his health. I rember why I delted this game in first place. I could have a ton of gallons go thru people's line and they not lose health.",
        "Only fast when showing an ads 😤 and frequently unsynchronized. It made me confused because sometimes the ballon pass trough but the enemy's health bar are not decrease. And when watch the replay. Enemy has tower that not showed in real game.",
        "I have an idea people. If you face people who are not losing a single life, have infinite money, or automatically beat you, then report them. They then can only face hackers like them. And also, I love the game. I mean, those bloons popping are soooooooo satisfying! And you should ban the hacks that are online like infinite medallions, money, or lives. Basically,  I would give this a 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10."

        "I used to play this game a long time ago with my brother. I thought since after all these years so many new updates have come, the game must feel different. But it's the same. I love the tune that plays as you play it. It's so nostalgic. My brother isn't anymore with me but playing this game makes me really very happy. It's just like I am back in those old days. Specially for me, as it has so many memories, this game is the absolute best.",
        "I have a problem with my account. My punk zombird was maxed out. Level 3. Then when I opened the game, my punk zombird was gone... I obtained that by waiting patiently and gathering 90 diamonds. I had to watch 3 15-30 sec long video for 2 diamonds each. After watching the 3 vids, I had to wait another 8 hours for it to be available again. It took me a month to obtain that bird and then all of a sudden it dissapears?! I obtained it again but I had to start all over again. I uninstalled this app because of that issue.",
        "The game is really addictive. but repeated zombie birds are generated and diamonds are getting wasted. Please change that. One bird one time please. One bird should be at max 3 level not another set. It's wasting my internet to watch video to get diamonds for collecting birds",
        "I was confident to delete the app from my phone cos it says that the game will be saved on my fb acc. But only the highest score remained and the potion got back to 1. I was already at 56! Deym! Ayusin nyo buhay nyo! Sayang effort ko! Aba!",
        "I love this game cause it kills our time when were bored. Yep, we, my mom also is addicted to this game hahaha, shes always getting my phone and play this game whenever im sleeping. Love it, I recommend this game to everyone💖 you'll be definitely love this game. MobiGame you slaaaay hahaha",
        "I personally loved this game. First off,  u cant jump for high periods of time cause u to run into the bombs. Secondly, whats sup with these prices? Thats ridiculous. You cant level up with prices that high and u have to buy 💎 gems and coins just to get a level up... But tum... Very great game overall."

        "It's casual, relaxing and fun. Super cute. And it has 2 huge pluses: first of all it feels rewarding since you actually have a realistic possibility of getting new fluffies; second, you don't have ads shoved in your face every 5 seconds, in fact you pretty much never see them.  Really great at the moment, hope it stays this way. Lots of respect to the Devs for staying away from annoying cash grab techniques.",
        "this game is adorable. the only thing i'm not quite sure about is the rainbow system; what does it do? how does it work? it would be great to have a page that explains the details to those of us who aren't great at working this stuff out. i'd also like to ask why there aren't plushies for these things??? they're so cute! i'd by tons of they were real. anyway, great game, and the little fluffy cubes are the sweetest things and i just want to hug them all.",
        "I love the fact that you can unlock new characters in different catagorys the graphics are great and the idea is awesome. The only thing bad about it is the game play add some treasure bonus or something like that to keep the players from not getting bored a bit. Also it glitches a little bit sometime and it prevented me from getting my high score. Anyways I love the game very addictive to try and get every fluffy and rainbow fluffy Love it but how is it a rainbow fluffy? Anyways LOVE the game very addictive",
        "There is just to much to say about this brilliant, creative, and fun game! It keeps me busy while im bored and on a road trip! I saw an ad for this on instagram and decided to download it, and let me tell you I was not disappointed with the outcome. I've been seraching for games like this and I have finally come across such a fantastic game! The Fluffy charectors should be sold as toys because of their adorable look!",
        "ADORABLE! THE FLUFF'S FACES ARE JUST SO CUTE! But that isn't why you're reading this. Over all a good, simple game. Getting new fluffs is similar to crossy road, but it's kinda like a Minecraft dropper map. My only complaint is that the fluff is so big it's hard to see what's coming up, but that does add to the challenge.",
        "I love Fluffy Fall so much!! It is SUPER kawaii, fun, fuzzy, and enjoyable. It takes up your time as you try to beat your highscore!! Mine is 45.  I am really hoping that it updates, because I want all the monthly gem stones to be in stone section. I think it would be cool to have my gem stone. And play as it.  Anyways, I really love the game, it is so amazing!! If you love kawaii and fun games, get Fluffy Fall!!! 😊💕"

        "I think WAR ROBOTS is amazing!  I love how you make all kinds of robots to put into battle! I like how the robots can have special defense's like sentry mode and sheilds.  I also think it is cool to have different battlefields and different robots to choose from! I like it when you make more robots for people to buy and put into battle. I wished that everyone would play this game. But, I was wondering if you could lower the prices for the special robots and guns? Thanks!  From, Julian🙂😎",
        "Reminds me of the mechs from some Animes. Fun. Easy to upgrades mechs and weapons by watching videos and going into open battles. Haven't joined a clan yet. Been playing for about two months now. The only complaint I have is facing lvl 30 players with lvl 12 Mk II mechs and weapons that clearly belong in higher leagues. I understand Pixonic's loyalties lay with their paying customers first. Because it costs money  to develop new mechs, weapons, and maps.  But something needs to be done about the Tankers. A week in the LP queue doesn't seem to be enough to discourage Tanking.  I still believe that the game is fun. And I won't let cheaters discourage me. Sooner or later I'll be up there in higher levels myself.",
        "This is the longest running game I have on my phone...so that should tell you something. It's fun don't get me wrong but it started out as a great game but has now changed to a 2 star game due to the fact that they keep on making it more and more a pay to play game. If they keep going down this route I will need to quit. I don't mind paying for a good game but in game purchases are getting crazy.",
        "Love this game. Very close to mech warrior. Some things need to be worked on I'm such as how long it takes to upgrade some stuff is kinda slow. Hoping they make a way to upgrade 2 things at a time. Then also need to make matches a little more even as far as weps and team. In due time I hope but other than that I play it all the time!",
        "Why is the Pursuer in the pic with the Mercury and Hellburner but not in the game? Also, I think you should make some of the new bots/weapons, or old component bots/weapons, purchaseable with Gold and/or Workshop points, as in buying the whole bot/weapon with Gold/Workshop points. Being in the offers is not enough because they almost always come with unwanted components for other weapons/bots that we don't want. Anyway, great game overall, my little brother and I really enjoy playing this game :)",
        "300$ for a new Robot Inquisitor. And 200$ for each of other new robots Haechi for   example. And no real way to obtain earn these new weapons and robots by playing the game. Only by money. The situation was bad already but now it is catastrophic. I dont understand what Pixonic is doing. There is no future in this direction. It is wrong decision. It will provide money for them in short term but it wont lust long."

        "Very Cool Game... I just started playing this game and I'm having a lot of fun.  I Love the 🎏 in the background.  I wish all card games could have backgrounds.  It makes the game more fun to play.  Not that were not addicted already... LoL!  I also like the fact that the cards are big enough to see.  For my Ole' eyes.  I love the daily challenges as well.  It's so much fun!  More games should be like this one.  I highly recommend it! 😎",
        "Way too many ads. A lot of the ads run for 15 secs or more and you can't cancel them until they are finished. Many of the other ads that display in the bottom of the screen make the game unresponsive a lot of the time. Would have preferred the opportunity to purchase the game to remove the ads. Pity there is no option for -5 stars. I hate apps that force ads on you without options to remove them.",
        "I like to play in landscape mode.  The pictures displayed of this are NOT what is displayed on your screen.   In landscape mode you get almost the portrait sized positioning of the cards just flipped sideways.   Very cramped and uncomfortable play no matter what pretty theme you are on.   I am having trouble finding a fun relaxed plenty of room app to play solitaire, but I do know there are others filling the total landscape screen without themes that I enjoy playing more than this,  sorry to say.   I am more sorry that I wasted my time with this.",
        "I like it,  just when I try to do daily challenges I get this ad that tells me to wait for a while..... That kind of makes me NOT want to play.  If you can fix that,  I'll give a better rating.  Thanks 😊",
        "The colorful scenes are awesome! Fish are my favorite. I just had a problem that when I did a daily challenge the rating placard would pop up but I had to totally exit my game and restart to clear it. Everyone says way too many ads but it's giving us a break to drink coffee or run to the bathroom! Just like commercials on TV.😜",
        "First of all, the game wants you to rate it by the second hand. You don't have the option to, \"rate it later\" like on other games. That way they get better ratings because everyone loves the graphics. There's more to a game than graphics people. Some of the ads are very long and others are just plain inappropriate. You only win about 1 in every 10 hands. The game cheats and the daily challenge is a rip off. The \"magic\" option rarely helps in any way. I have played many different Solitaire game apps and this one is the second worst of them all."

        "I really like this game . It is awsome. I always play this game when I have to cool down and sometime don't  want to do something. Great time killer. The thing that I like the most in this game is that , there are more than 100 levels and that if free of cost. What amazing and challenging game. But there is something that I really don't like  andbi want to warn you while you are downloading this game. The thing is that whenever you had completed a level an advert comes always. And that is really very annoyed for me. Well all over I want to say that it's  a really very good game and I am very gald that I am on 22nd level and soon I will be in in 23rd.",
        "Ok but I'm on level 9 and 8x8 and I just started it yesterday so yes pretty easy. Oh and by the way if u were going to get it just to warn u there's soooooo many adverts when u complete a level (very annoying)☺☺☺😑😑😑🐜🐜🐜Antnoing u get it hahaha!!!🐜🐜🐜",

        "I absolutely love love LOVE this game. Im no bot i swear. This game is so addictive. Gameplay is great. A few suggestions however. Sometimes i find my \"sword\" just going right through some fish, and it doesnt kill them. Also, maybe switch up some ways to get Stars. I find myself saving so much to get the 99k sword fish and never buy any other fishes. I feel like the players should work their way up slowly and not have to play with only the \"daily reward\" fishes. Just my suggestion  Thank you guys!",
        "Smash was a bit too hard since its such a small area with way too many people, the boost reload time should be decreased by about 0.2s, and you should make the stars more easier to get. But overall the game is pretty good",
        "Great game, good servers, rarely any lag, and addicting. However, the price for characters is pretty steep, their not even worth buying since you'll get better daily characters by the time you have enough stars to buy a good character. Save up for the end game characters. Also, the left joystick is fairly close to the edge of the screen and makes it a little hard to stay on the screen. You get use to it after a while but it would be nice to have other control setups or custom controls.",
        "Great game. Just the spawns on Kill the King and stuff suck since people can spawn right in you. Also, it is kinda rigged when you have the default fish vs someone with one of the best ones.",
        "Great game! However it crashes a lot for me. Almost every game when I did the entire app crashes. Would love a fix for this thanks",
        "Great game, its so addicting!  But there is only 1 problem, theres so much lag. Pls fix!! :)"

The grind to level up Heroes makes me want to come back and carry on, unlock other heroes and further upgrade my Kingdom. My only issue is the fact that resources are hardly able to be kept. Being under constant attack from other groups and unable to allow my Kingdoms walls to regenerate properly before I am able to move again seems to be a recurring issue and one I do feel needs to be looked at and tweaked. Nonetheless, I'm impressed with the game. Continue with the good updates and this game could be one of the best mobile games out there.",

        "The game is NOTHING like it is advertised. It's yet another pay to win game with blatantly misleading advertising that does not reflect the gameplay at all.  Misleading people in to trying the game speaks of a lack of ethics and a lack of belief in your own product being good enough."

Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.",
        "I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I'm playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can't complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍",
        "This game is both funny as serious it's a great way to make kids understand the danger of some things around them. Like trains and wires and different things. As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.",
        "I think that there could be less ads. When I'm trying to replay he game an ad pops up which is really annoying. What I would say is that this is an excellent game but just less of the ads",
        "A truly wonderful and entertaining game. Very well supported with great updates over the years. Latest version (Valentine's) appears to be buggy (animations jerk ahead) ruining the gameplay. I'm unsure it this is the game or my phone.",
        "I like it a lot this game is so good but there is one thing that really bugs me.  There is way to many ads.  Every time I play a set of games to get a good score and I click play again or main menu or practice it gives me an ad.  This really bothers me please put less ads or at least do not make them quite as long."

It doesn't feel very smooth.  As an example : Say I scroll all the way down and pick a game to guess, going back puts me back at the top of the list. Also, previously unlocked hints seem to disappear when the exiting the app.",

Just play a better trivia game. Moreover. Don't give us awful games like Unity, Watch Dogs, and League of Legends. Anime is anime. Video games are video games. Video game adaptations of anime are still, at there core, anime. Leave those out of these kinds of apps.",

I just wish there was a difficulty setting so you start off with easier games and then it could get harder as it progresses, because at the moment I can't pass 70% of the levels without using hints.",

And addictive including this one it's fun and ever since the first play I've been hooked there are barely any adds and the graphics are phenomenal. I play it all the time plz don't change this, if u do your going to loose my five stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟.",
        "Most of my apps are from Ketchapp. Their creativity and style of games have just been wanting me to download more and more! Right now, Ketchapp is one of my most favourite game groups ever! Keep making more! I don't have any improvements, which means that their games are top notch!",
        "Patheitc. Being such a fast paced game you cannot have the blocks starting to move a split second before you're going to pass it. Makes the game pretty impossible from the first level. For something that was supposed to be fun, is more frustrating. You need severe luck on your side to get a win. Recommended do not download",
        "Its a good concept, but you need to update it, and make sure the blocks no longer move. Right now, it is by far the most luck based skill game. It is impossible to dodge the moving blocks, so if they are to move, they should move much slower",
        "I think it is a great way for amiee to get design for her Xbox 360 and help her get over with her anger with her sister and to help her to figure out what's the matter but what is the most important thing is to be a fantastic family together but why are we so lonely.... Well i think it is a great opportunity to make new friends to life",
        "Good, but difficulty is a bit tough. Unless I was a Jedi, it feels like I'm starting on what should be a hard level. The AI is way too slow as well. I wish you could could change the color of your ball and race online with others in real time."

        "I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance",
        "Great simple game with AMAZING colours❤ I love this...dead simple and fun. It took me ages to work out how to unlock the new skins...click on the banner that has the amount of diamonds you've collected and what looks like 3 sheets on top of one another  (it comes up before you press the start key...)",
        "A Great Game For When You're Dumpin'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I'm in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren't too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I'm happy to say that. I don't like to stay too long. Great game!",
        "So,  basically it's a pretty fun app to play when you're bored. It's a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It's a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don't really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!",
        "Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn't have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic.",
        "Good, with a major flaw I've ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I'll tap, and the game won't register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I'm on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I've closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It's an issue I'd like to see fixed."

        "The concept is great and was actually quite fun, but the ads were over the top. There is a permanent ad banner that covers up a part of the game screen which is just horrible design. Also I opened the game up again and all my saved data was gone. I had unlocked 3 \"world's\" and poof all gone. That was the reason I uninstalled.",
        "Amazing addictive game. Try it out! Not too many ads, and just the right amount of challenge without pulling your hair out. Sometimes there's a hidden dot in the title, or ones that are almost the same color as the background, but it's not bad enough to lose a star.",
        "Updated with no fix...  problem still persists.  No exit button and controls for the back button are very wonky. Need to add dedicated exit button or fix what happens when you tap / swipe the blank park of the screen. Trying to bring the controls up from their hidden state selects options is frustrating. You end up starting games. Very unpolished controls, imo.",
        "Great game! Relaxing and fairly simple with occasional challenging levels, exactly what I like in a mobile game.   One annoying thing  I would like to flag up to the developers is that in the new erasor and draw modes there is no way to know what colour you are, so you either have to guess or go back to the menu, which is very irritating, couple of ideas to fix; keep the progress bar at the bottom there whilst you are doing your moves, as you always play as the top colour. Or just a simple dialogue box or even a dot in  the corner that pops up as you start the round to tell you. Would be a much needed qol change.  Still gave 5 stars as the game is great, but a fix to this would be a welcome addition.",
        "Fun, relaxing, thought-provoking in a very simple graphic. The ads are bad as they interrupt the mild tones and flow of the mini-puzzles. Over all very nice but needs more to be anything more than a time-killer",
        "Cool game, only bad thing is that tutorial levels are rated as bronze so you can never have all gold.. I tried doing the same tutorial three times in a row, then it is counted as gold, but when you exit the game and enter again that it is bronze again"

Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels \"fixed\" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.",
        "This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.",
        "I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn't really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don't know how many more points you need.",
        "This game has many issues! It continually freezes and shuts me down. I can no longer play on my tablet, which I purchased just for games, and have to use my phone. I don't like using my phone because it drains my battery. I am so ready to quit this game and return to candy crush instead. Latest updates have rendered JP and other perks useless.",
        "Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the \"boards\" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it's addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It's becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.",
        "Way too many glitches and loss of coins/rewards. Money hungry gsn. Trying to get money from people in every which way possible. Ads are rediculous. Quit making changes to the game! Worse with every update! Will change my rating when they start rewarding better for your time put into game. Money hungry. Money hungry, money hungry."

        "The game is boring, all you do is try to make your base bigger and the screen only gets bigger like one time. It's really easy to become number one on the leaderboard and eventually you just want to die, this game sucks compared to any other game ending in io",

        "Its world best game ever played.  It is like a small GTA of phone or for android. It doesn't look too good but if u download and play it will like a real GTA. It is a quite big but the game is super amazing. It is not too interesting in starting but later u can play it like a GTA. It also not need any extra files to download after downloading from play store but it needs Internet connection.",
        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Huge Kudos to the developers for making this game!! It's amazing it's literally like playing GTA but on your phone it has the story mode and it all makes sense!! The graphics are ok but I'm sure if they made this again in a Los Angeles version of some sort the graphics could get better and better!! Overall Amazing game and there's nobody else making games like this on the app store!! Great job! 10 out of 10 stars!!!",
        "It's a very great game,Nothing but love.   But I got a notification  that there is an update,I updated the game but I still can't find the new added missions in the game. Secondly I am on day 87 and my day 90 supposed  Reward changed after I downloaded the update.",
        "Honesty its just like GTA which a great thing but the thing is the installation time let me share my experience to one and all reading hear... When I was downloading it at the first its done but it starts downloading once again but I am not sure is it my problem but I just wanted to share with you guys... The game is boss",
        "Can you make the map bigger that you can own your dream house,a mechanic/ garge.Make  sticky bombs and upgraded weapons. Put jets and tanks in the military. Also make it a lot easier to gain money and gems lower the price on planes ect. ( the stuff that costs gems.)Also would like to sell some of my items for ither money or gems because ive git 4 baseball bats that i would like to sell and bring back the pawn shop. That's all!"

        "Its a really good game. The only thing is, that I wish there was maybe some instructions that appear at the beginning, because I didnt know that you couldnt hit the black lumps etc. Maybe if you add little phrases that say what to do and not to do, then it would be almost perfect.",
        "Great time killer I love everything about it and it is a great game to wake up to. The only down side is that you fall off the ledge and that makes it harder to dodge the black. Everything else is 5 stars so that is what I think about roller coaster.",

They always happened at the beginning and I hate it. I don't think you should not install it its not fun.",
        "This game is amazing! It is addicting and fun to play!! The only thing is that I was hoping for some sort of introduction to the game, to tell me how to play etc. Also, I was hoping to be able to choose what kind of ball i use, the black one is plain and kind of boring. But overall its an amazing game!!"

        "Awsome game. Completed all levels without any hack jzt waited  for hope   ( the lives ) evrbdy shld try this. Sry i gonna uninstall this app only bcoz i finished all levels. Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.",
        "The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don't get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new \"enemies\". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you've lost some lives. But that's not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.",
        "I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It's more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.",
        "Remember the old days when platformers taught you through trial and error how to interact with new game mechanics? If you don't like that, you'll hate this game. So much fun, so creative, and once you start to get down one of the new features, it ramps it up and keeps you learning creatively how to beat the level. I love this game, it's a fantastic platformer that will challenge you to learn as you go instead of giving you a tutorial every time something new comes up.",
        "Completed all but just couldn't get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I've ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.",
        "Amazing game reminds me of the old school games . But the only problem is the lives you give us to play. They are so few and they take a lot of time to refill. PLEASE remove the life or ball things from this game it will be the best if you do that cause I was playing and level by level I was getting exited and I wanted to rate this game 5 stars but suddenly this GAME OVER thing comes and I had to give you this ratings.please let us play without stopping and waiting for the life to come."

But the rest of the things r fun. The best thing is..... This game DOES NOT have any adds AT ALL. I would waste my time, or do whatever i can, just for this game to be funner. But plz dont let me pay fees! Im only 7 years old n this is my grandmas account. Tks",

Awesome😒 Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don't reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie's handling. You killed it, literally. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.",
        "Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I've never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.",
        "Lost all in app purchases which amounts to stealing. Beware of doing in app purchases. Way to many ads. App also crashes a lot. Support said they would help then didn't respond after that. If my son was able to lose his progress and the money we sunk in the game because he was using multiple devices and didn't know what Cloud and Local meant which cause him to lose his progress then mabe this game shouldn't be labeled E for Everyone. Change the rating to Teen if they have to know what cloud means or risk losing there in app purchases.  Google change the rating on this game.",
        "Good graphics. If you fail and do exact same again you may pass level if you level up car, you end up failing sooner and have to slow down but after trying 7 r 8 times gets annoying and the level up car is worse than your basic car. Too frustrating so deleting",
        "The game is my little boys favourite but the recent batch of adverts in game (Yahoo specifically) don't close - meaning you have to force quit the game. Lazy programming and terrible QA process from the developers. Avoid.",
        "Whoever decided to put the HW Poppa wheelie in the game is an idiot. Loved this game until i came across that car. Im seconds away from fully upgrading and moving on but i couldnt let it go. That car is a load of frustration."

Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don't register as pineapple hits for the counters. There's a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it",
        "Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.",
        "Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.",
        "Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.",
        "BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn't have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What's bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I'm not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game.",
        "How can I say this? I can not stop playing this!! Everytime I set a new and higher record I want to achieve and I only stop until I get there xD atm with 6400 coins and everything unlocked 😁😁 please release new content for months and months!! It will make me so happy! Thank you for this game."

Im also becoming abit bored by the game because the cars i have left to by can only be acquired via tokens or cash. Not everyone can afford to pay continuous amounts to get further in a game. Scrap the cash and reward good driving. By the way, this is the best game 🇿🇦I've ever played",

I already know that Gameloft will give best graphical experience ever but the game is frikkin good .but the recent update have a slight problem. It is the details of objects takes time to form fully. But the race is done before it . Please fix this problem.",
        "You virtually have to buy them blue tokens. Not enough gold being handed out. But it gets worse, this was once a top flight game, now I wanna delete forever and never return. It Still Crashes. And None of the luxury cars, go way, way too fast and you'll never actually win either a challenge or actually race. This game is totally horrible now."

        "It would be better if there were more tile choices, besides the basic 3. What really annoys me is that if you pause for a few seconds to look up or think of a move, an ad pops up. A 30 second, non skipable ad. The ads are also there after you finish every match. I know you need to make revenue but jeez. Calm down.",
        "I've always loved this gamed.  I wished I could be able before I die to learn how to play the way I see them playing in the movies, the correct way. Not the way we play on cell phones and tablets. I would just lost LUV to play with the tiles, to feel them in my hand etc"

Players ask him why he does it and not play bigger tables. His answer because game allows me to and I can knock out player after player. Regulate players if they have X amount of chips play on bigger tables. Let the smaller players gain chips and enjoy the game.",
        "I really enjoy this game .At first I just added it for one of the games on app like to gain points for gift cards.And of course to learn how to play poker. Now if their no points given for this game I would still play it. I totally enjoy this game , and the people that play it. Its truly an enjoyable game. This game is a keeper know matter what.tthe only thing I wish is that their was more coins given .",
        "Obviously alot of horrible poker players out there. I've never spent a penny and have won many tournaments and large pots. My money stays managable because I manage it. And the adds only come when you first boot the game, after that maybe one add every 30 minutes, depending how long you can hold up on a table. Great game, odds are just as if playing for real. Reading all the bad reviews is funny cause it just shows how many idiots there are out there trying to gamble. Poker is a language not a game ;)",
        "Worst poker app there is. As soon as you make money it makes you lose no matter your hand. Probably bots. Only bad whole cards win. Play if you want but DO NOT SPEND A CENT ON THIS APP. It's fixed. Che k out you tube for proof. Then the send garbage email to say it's not fixed. Sent to every bad review. Please play a different app anyone.",
        "It appears that I have reached a certain point where my free play is being met with bot resistance. I've gained over ten million in one day and lost it all and more in suck outs. This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you'd have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun",
        "Platika...I know you said the game was functioning normally in accordance with the rules. I however have several screen shots proving it is not. I would be happy to send them. Still dont know how the rules would dictate a straight beating a flush? Maybe you can enlighten me?"

        "I'm really enjoying this game. It beats the previous bid wars-storage auctions & pawn shop game I've played. Could you please add the opinion to change the cash to English pounds (£) and the chance to open more lockers and better chances on getting rare items. And tell us which cities we could find certain items we need to have in storage to complete missions.",
        "I love the game, it's really great and I'm excited to see what all the new updates will bring. My only complaint is with Mutts place, sometimes it will freeze after tapping to reveal my trade. And it usually happens 4 or 5 times sometimes longer before it finally works. Plan on sticking around to see improvements! (: I love this game.",
        "I just played it for 2 weeks and for me its a play as you are want game. Not taking too much of your time. Might require some update like fixing the stack up issue in the semi legal trading. Moving Forward maybe they can add a Player vs Player Bidding battle instead of CPU where in there is a limit of the money you can bring.",
        "Game not working... the part where you go to mutt's and trade objects with him is totally froze. I have an object stuck there now well over a week and once going in to his place the game freezes and has to be restarted just to open again. Can only play part of the game due to constant freezing issues",
        "Have a problem, mutt's semi legal store thing won't work. The black screen to show the result thing shows up top left corner, but it's just stuck there. And the rest of the screen shows the normal background for mutt's semi legal store, and I pretty much can't do anything when this happens. I have to reset the game, and each time I try to \"show results\" in mutt's semi legal store, same thing happens. Please fix this",

Trying to clear the frost moves the screen, pulls down drop down menu from the top, pauses repeatedly, zooms & unzooms repeatedly...nightmare! Game has too much going on with collections, story, various games....to enjoy the game. I like the parts where I find stuff. The rest just gets in the way and bores me.",
        "It's fun. It reminds me of another game I used to play, not sure if it based on that or by another company. I find the puzzles OK. Some are getting a bit difficult. I enjoy playing it but I get the feeling very soon I will have to spend some real pennies and when that happens I will probably stop playing.",
        "Great combination of several puzzle genres thanks to the mini games between hidden object scenes. Easy learning curve and reasonable story line. It could do with some different music for scenes as the two tunes got repetitive quite fast. Music can be muted though",
        "More complicated game mechanics than most hidden picture games, but the game walks you through them very well. Instead of a linear path, you are given the choice of several quests to choose from or you can ignore the quest and play any stage you have unlocked. Completing quests helps you learn more about the game world and its inhabitants. Very enjoyable with several mini games as well.",
        "I love the game. I could play it all day only it wont let me! I absolutely Hate the bs energy scheme! Yah I could pay real money to buy play time but it would run out quick.  Its just a FB game. I want a hidden item I can play as long as I want.",
        "I'm addicted to this game.  You don't have to spend money to enjoy it either.  Illustrated beautifully and I love the fact items move around plus also have different modes to keep you intrigued. I only find it frustrating not having enough energy to keep seeking"

        "A very fun and addictive game. I make bows all day, but it's nice to be able to shoot from my couch at night.  The influence of wind on the arrow is accurate when it comes to drift. A little costly on the upgrades for those that don't buy their way to the top, but all games are that way.",
        "Starts off ok but completely rigged to deplete your coins and to get you to spend money. Bow repairs and inconsistent wind effects among a couple of tactics. Also payed to upgrade my bow and sights and it was gone next time I logged in.",
        "Ok game, but bingo mode is a huge pain.  My shots filled out the opponent's card better than mine.  Stupid way to lose a lot of progress/coins.",
        "I'm having issues with the speed/timed sessions.  Towards the end, the animation sequence will glitch, resulting in my opponent having time to get off an additional shot, while I'm attempting to reset and draw the bow.  Outside of that, it's an excellent game.",
        "Game would be great if it didn't lag out after 6 games. I've lost more gold in rush due to the game's performance degrading than I can keep track of. Once it starts losing frame rate just quit or you will bleed gold.",
        "Game was fine. Lately, keeps freezing and somehow opponents are getting 10's when I CLEARLY see them hitting nowhere near the middle. Matches are freezing while i'm ahead, then match ends and says I lost. Somehow i've lost 20 million coins, and not from legit losing either. I also just played a match for 1 million coins, i had over 1 million in the bank. I know sonehow have 0 after I clearly won the match but it said I lost. Either people are using cheats or the game is not functioning properly"

        "I love this game. Its very addicting and fun, but I find that there are barely any female dragons. This upsets me very much and I would like for this to change. The only females I see are the dragons with names like  motherly dragon, belle dragon, viktoria dragons, and sleeping beauty dragons. There are also descriptions like \"add some girly pink to your collections with the gummy dragon\"(which is also coincidently a girl). Then I see cool legendary dragons, but OH plot twist they're all boys. This is a very fun game no doubt on that, but please, stop with the sexism and make cool female dragons. Thank you.",
        "Just a few gripes. 1st of all I LOVE DRAGON CITY. Been playing for years. About your survey, I would never. You ask for too many permissions. Tree of life....when I get a Dragon here comes the same Dragon adding up for hatching. Like why? 815+ dragons are more than enough. Why do u keep adding, adding, adding. We could NEVER get all of them as it is. Why more? Love me some Dragon City like a said in the beginning.",
        "This is #8 for Top Grossing Simulation and you can see in the game that they are trying everything they can to take the #1 spot.  During events they have a unique currency, if you spend real money on that currency and don't use it you're SOL. They don't compensate you by turning it into the next events currency.  Breeding and Hatching eggs takes enormous amounts of time be cause they want you to spend money to speed it up. (The rare the dragon the more tine it takes to breed and hatch, like 10-45hrs from what I've had).  Lastly only get 2 of 5 island, you have to SLOWLY save up crystal or pay real money to unlock them, islands fill up quick. You can youse the free gold but you better have a lot of Facebook friends playing as well or you can't unlock them",
        "I feel that this is a fun and addictive game with lots of potential.. p However , please make quest battles in the arena longer , I was at the last battle but couldn't play it , because it's time was too short . 2 days is not alot, even if I play like 3 times or more a day.",
        "It's a really good game, but just one problem:  there's that island that uses grid coins, and everytime Deus says \" this island has a special currency:Grid coins\" , it kicks me out of the game. Only when I go into that island and press 'ok' , it kicks me out. Please, Please, PLEASE fix it! I love playing dragon city and monster legends. :(",
        "Like the game, but it keeps locking up an I lose my battles that I have won.  Also, some races and challenges are way too tight time wise.  It's a game, but when you make it impossible to get anywhere and we don't get credit for what we do it isn't any fun."

        "I'm really enjoying this game - it's surprisingly advanced for an app. Plays very smoothly and looks pretty. One annoying thing is I get network connection bugs from time to time flashing up. They don't stop me from playing tho, so meh. Also, the way they match players together is sometimes pretty suss, ships that wipe you out in two seconds flat...or less... just shouldn't be matched with you. But, overall pretty great.",
        "One of the first games where there is a decent balance between paid and free gamers in gameplay. Amazing game. Just touched Level 50 and got rewarded an Aventador for free. Now to continue blowing up ships. Oh yeah great graphics too. A few more maps could help. Also you should be able to invite your friends. And I sold my super-heavy cannons but a fix would be appreciated.",
        "Help! In game issue, I have a \"superheavy cruise cannon\" in my inventory and it looks as though my \"Arbiter\" ship has a special slot for that type of weapon but when I click the slot my cannon is not there! Instead it shows up when I click the slot for regular turrets, any help is appreciated. Username:RoyalStickman, amazing game will put rating back to 5star after",
        "Was loving the game but now ships show that they're dead and yet they can still attack and he can't Target them. Fix this and I'll put it back in 5 stars. Also haven't been getting my daily log in or my league position award. Starting to think the developers don't care",
        "Would be 5 stars except for 2 things. 1- Once you make a purchase there should be no pop up ads. Most apps do this don't be ridiculous. 2- High fail rate on improvements even at high percentage chances(failed twice on 90% and even worse at 80%) Maybe give half the money back on a fail its too expensive to absorb multiple failures",
        "Fun game with potential. Controls are decent, targeting is buggy, graphics are good. Still some lag issues, even on strong wifi. Needs a little more balance added, with variations in range and role. Sooo many ads, but that's ok at times, because you can essentially farm premium currency to get mid-quality ships, but the paid-for ships and weps are obviously better in-game."

The game doesn't allow for moves that give the same outcome, which is rather frustrating. Please fix!",
        "Amazing concept  to learn chess in  right way.... Need some improvements.Facility to set up custom board and piece need to be included. Graphics,AI could be much better. Chess Opening explorer need to be added . Lessons with positional understanding in middle games need to be added. Hope you will make it better and better with every update.",

        "It's beautifully graphic and pleasing to the eyes! The puzzles could be a bit tougher and opening theory could be added!  Apart from that, it's very wonderful and an interactive way to learn and enjoy chess. Person of any age can enjoy this app!"

        "love this game!! The control are easy, the graphics are amazing, really well made!!! I would LOVE to see some BIG updates soon, like able to somehow earn gold plz?!?! And maybe have a little more variation of parts u can change. And hopefully some new tracks will come out Right?!? But GREAT JOB to the developers and everyone who put effort into this game. Thx guys  :D",
        "Very nice graphics, the customizability of the cars are pretty good, definitely one of the best free drift games out there! However, it could need accelerometer steering, as the button control is quite difficult to use for me. Recommended for the graphic fanatics. Drift on! - Jay",
        "It's an okay game. The customization is actually really good and the physics aren't too bad either hit the optimization isn't great and there aren't that amen cars. Would love to see an MX-5 though. For some reason my upgrades don't seem to be applying though.",
        "Well... Ive bought all the cars that you can without gold... All you have to do is get to 50x and you will have around 120,000cr and thats enough to buy all the cars... And put what you want on it... Add more cars and add tuning, also remove the god damm machine gun exhaust not all drift cars do that... Fix it because its annoying and it also over powers the sound of the car...",
        "Iv been looking for a desent drift game for ages and now i found it. It has great gameplay and controls and good grafix to this game has hella potentual keep up the good work i cant wait for future updates IL RATE THIS GAME 11/10"

I wanted to make a suggestion, but I just can't remember now. Oh well...",
        "Fun game. I wish the rate of death was more consistent. 37,000,000 a day at one point, but waiting 6 months for 100,000 to die towards the end. The disease didn't change, the rate of death shouldn't decrease just because there are fewer people. Good game otherwise",
        "Quite an enjoyable game and different to games I normally play.  It is a strategy game were you have to try and create a deadly virus and wipe out the world, before the scientists find a cure.  What makes this game different is that instead of trying to save the human race, you try to destroy it.   Just a good job it isn't real.",

        "I Absoulutely love the update! Each design is so unique! I was wondering, will there be mythical animals as legendarys or, as rare. For example The Aura Wolf, an elemental wolf with feathered wings. If you think my idea is silly, I understand! Also, this game is so smooth and fun! It's a must play! I play it everytime I am stressed or need some fun. Anyway I hope you like my idea, if not it's tottal fine! Keep up on the good work and awesome games! Best of Luck for the future!",
        "Hello Turbo rocket games, i love this game and i have some ideas to make the game better: you can add a new playable animal like: eagle (legendary animal) and he can fly, but he can't fly high (animals can attack him). And for landscapes ideas: swamp and the boss of the swamp is a big crocodile (12,000 health), desert and the boss of the desert is an ancient camel (5,000 health), jungle and the boss of the jungle is a big tiger (10,000 health) and can you add another way to get elixir? like when watching ads (give 100 elixir per ads), and when kill a boss (50 elixir per boss when killed). And can you put an ati-hack system? I looooove this game ;)",
        "This is one of the best animal rpg games I've ever played. The only thing I'm confused about is how to get a pup. Both of my wolves are above level 10. The female is level 12 and the male is level 11. I made them fall asleep in the den, but I'm not getting a pup. Could you explain this to me? I'll enjoy the game a lot more if you do.",
        "I think this is better then all ur other games in SO many ways. Although, I was wondering if u could add more animals than the wolf, fox and lynx. You could add maybe a deer, tiger and African wild dog?  Tysm if u do!",
        "OMG THE NEW UPDATE IS AWESOME ITS LIKE THEY SAW MY OLD REVIEW AND DID ALMOST EVERYRHING I ASKED THEM TO DO OMG LOL XD GREAT GAME!!! 😁😁😁😁😁😁 COULD NOT B HAPPIER ABOUT THE NEW UPDATE! 😝 Edit: ANOTHER AWSOME UPDATE!!! BEST WOLF SIM IN THE UNIVERSE!!!!!! 😆 😆 😆 😀 😁 😁 I LOVE THIS GAME MORE THAN I LOVE MINECRAFT AND THATS SAYING SOMETHING COMING FROM ME!! 😀 😀 😀 😀 😃 😃 😆 😆 😗 😘 😘 I LOVE U TURBO ROCKET GAMES!! 😘 😘",
        "This game is great! There are a lot of things to unlock via treasure chests. Although, a few more animals to hunt would be nice. The graphics are much better than other Online Animal sims; and, the way the animals move is much more fluid. The new update improved many things! I especially like the new legendary skins and actions. I'm also glad that the family can do actions, too. I'm now awaiting for new maps and new animals! Maybe a Mountain Lion or a Wolverine as a new playable character? A cool map idea would be a desert or a farm/ranch. I think this game should only have predatory animals as playable characters. You should make a separate game featuring prey animals for the people who want to play that sort of game instead of adding them to Wildcraft. If you are looking for a COMPLETELY FREE TO PLAY game similar to WolfQuest, get Wildcraft!"

        "Maybe it's just my phone, Galaxy S7, but even when i knew what to do i had to tap over and over again to get a response. Seriously, tap the object 10 times and nothing happens then tap it an eleventh time and it reacts. Very frustrating. Spent most of my time just repeatedly tapping the object. Game is a good concept, but really bad controls.",
        "Fun and challenging for awhile, but I found most of the levels after 50 impossible to figure out without a cheat sheet. Got frustrating. I'm at level 60 and about ready to throw in the towel.",
        "Some levels are straight forward. Others you just have to skip because there's no logic or something is missing. Could be good with some type of help if you get stuck rather than just skipping an entire level.",
        "Not responsive to most touches. I finally got a cheat only to realize it was the game.  Ads were not frequent but had a strobe light going off (health issues) and would not turn off. Had to close out of the game every time so I just quit playing. Typo many similar more challenging games out there to try and work with this one."

        "I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there's only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can't beat them! Keep making more awesome games!",
        "Loved this game!!! It is my new favorite game I love all the powerful weapons and armor. I wish there was chestplates instead of amulets and leggings instead of bracelets and an easier way to find out what your hero level, But else then that it was perfect. I loved how you can choose the controls to your own preference. Chame on anyone who gave it a less then 5 Star review. I still dont know ho to tell what your hero level was but still my favorite game.",
        "I'm really loving this game it's simple but still a ton of fun. My one complaint would be the sometimes the grind is too long and I almost gave up... I wish the developers would throw in some kind of experience boost in the store instead of just being able to buy coins. I would pay real money for an exp boost and would love to support the Developers! just give me the chance!",
        "This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn't always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing",
        "I really like the game. But there's one thing that annoys me: when I don't play this game for a few hours and then I do another battle in dungeon, the game crashes after killing last monster in that battle.  I found out that if I switch on mobile data it works. So I wanted to asked why is that. EDIT: now all works just fine. 5 stars",
        "Love the game. Some feedback - it would be nice if you could choose a wave to start from in Hell. It takes about an hour to get to wave 300. More xp levels and perks and abilities. currently capped at 175. Crafting? Ability to make your own gear with random abilities and rare level. And, the map is boring. Cryo grenade is awful, doesn't freeze bosses, and the standard grenade takes off HALF the specified damage. Meant to take off 750, damages for 375."

        "The art style is amazing. The Zen mode and overall atmosphere is relaxing and entertaining. My big issue is after resetting my progress once I completed everything. You loose the coin doubling upgrade that you pay real money for. Why must I re purchase some I have already bought. Why does resetting my progress reset something I purchased with real money. I feel that is a little unfair and even from a premium purchaser is pretty jading, I really enjoy the game and will change to a 5 star once an answer is provided or it is fixed.",
        "I remember back when this game would cost money on iOS. I would literally try to download every single third party helper app just to look for this game. Now that i actually have a phone, its free. I think this game is great for both relaxing and competitive play. And I am so hyped for the Odyssey. I check often to see if it is there. 10/10 would recommend this game.",
        "The thing that makes this game great is the visuals and the audio. It is absulutley beautiful and the art style works so well with the type of game. Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I'd very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there's a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style",
        "Alright, so the game is pretty good. All I ask for is more tricks, and the ability to upgrade some bonuses (coin magnet, feather hover thing, and the third one that I haven't grabbed yet.) All in all, if you could do that, it'd make the game so much greater. Apart from skipping missions and revives there's no use for coins.",
        "Its a simple game with very simple things but still is exciting to play. If you are looking for a little mental relaxation or peace and still be able to enjoy the adventure, then this is a perfect thing. There are things I would love to improve. For instance the landing - and background music should have a variety. Also the zen mode is a cool little bonus but the music volume should be greater than other sounds. Hope to see these improvements..",
        "Good graphics, but can get boring after only like 3 minutes. Also the makers of the game should add a another different mode where your running away from a villager/camper and see how far you can get. You could improve or modify this mode that i have made if you want"

        "Absolutely nothing to do after completing campaign mode because all the events after RQ100 are pvp based and with a RQ150 limit while you are only around RQ110 - 115 when you complete campaign.  Even if you paid a lot of real cash to roll for good S class cars it does not mean you could go further after the relatively short campaign mode.  The game is so dead after you 100% the campaign and there will hardly be any reward for you to make way to RQ125 + in order to be competitive in those pvp events again.  This game probably just last 2 weeks tbh.  Great hope and great let down.",
        "Couple if things wrong with it. 1. If you 3* an event, when collecting your 3 rewards it sometimes kicks you out ofter collecting only 1 or 2. 2. And this has really naffed me off. I've taken part in 2 events today and was in 1st place. I've logged back in and it says i'm unranked as if i haven't taken part - glitch or hack from another player?!?!?",
        "I think this game is amazing! And is perfectly good in every way!! I can't stop playing and look forward to getting new cars. There is just one tiny error that bugs me a bit but I can cope with it. The error is the color of the Ford fiesta xr2. When you race someone else and they have this vehicle on the card the car is black with a tiny red trim on the side but when it's on the track it is completely red. I do hope you can will fix this small mistake but apart from that this game is great!!! Thanks for reading :)",
        "Definitely a game for car buffs. It requires using your \"mind\" to win. I'm not to sure about my rating yet. But, will definitely change if needed. It's unlike any game I've played & I like it! Someone wrote a review that this is a lazy person's game... LMAØ, I wish they would show me the games they play while they are running, swimming & mountain climbing \"while\" they play, smh HAHA!",
        "I love the concept and it's been great to see how far this game has come, but I've been playing since beta and nearly every update wipes my save data and forces me to restart. Luckily, I don't get too far into the game each time, but it is frustrating and enough of a buzz kill for me to drop two stars. If there was a cloud system implemented for saves this game would be a five star in my book",
        "Update 2/22/18: Pay to win alert: The developers don't care/wont help. I've literally been trying for 5 months now to beat the final boss and i still cant win. This game is not worth your time if you're looking for a \"fun\" for everyone game. Its a pay to win lie of a game. I loved this game but sadly i give up. WAY too frustrating. Don't bother asking the developer for help. They'll just make an update that makes it even more frustrating to beat."

        "Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven't gotten very far yet. Thing I DON'T like is you don't get an average..... IF you do, I've yet to find where it is in the game. That's in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯",
        "The Game is good. Some things to improve it:  save your profile using your Google Account. Play with Friends in Tournaments (ie. Teams, Challenges), ability to givie Hearts to friends without using Facebook Also can you PLEASE improve the notification! My friend sends me Requests to Bowl & most of the time I don't get notified. Thank U",
        "Not sure how the currency works or how to upgrade my levels. Played 10 times and still can't upgrade the ball. Do they expect real cash to upgrade 1 ball? Also the controls are touchy, I've inadvertently chucked a few balls into the gutter while trying to align it before my release. Some tutorials would be nice.",
        "Not to bad of game play. Does have minor bugs such as the 1 v  1 quickfire games; where pins downed before time is up near the end of players not counted.  I would avoid that section of the game.  The ads are often annoying popping up between games.  The ads are often difficult to figure out how to close or stop.",
        "I did like this fame but my lane keeps turning pink along with the ball so I can't actually see anything like where the ball is going.... and on quick fire again turns everything pink and don't let me take any shoots what do ever.. think it's a glitch in the game I'm not sure but tried restarting the game and the same thing is happening again and again... on all the different lanes and extra games in bowling king...",
        "Quick fire is the best but theres only one down fall, the seconds. When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins.."

        "Love it! When I downloaded the game I thought I'd just delete it because it would have too many ads or have glitches or just be a dumb no - wifi game I would ever use again but it's actually really fun and addicting. Saving up gems to buy cool random balls to play as is really need cause ya never kno what you're going to get and same with the platforms. What I'm trying to say is this os an awesome game and keep up the amazing work Ketchapp!",
        "I love the game my tablet is glitched so it can be hard to play but wen it works i play all most all day such a good game and I like wen u can get new balls and pads it's so nice to see new ones ( I love this game and u should download it )",
        "It is amazing. My brother showed me it his record was 108 and when I played it is totally wrecked him by 187😊😊☺☺😂😂😁😁😀😀😃😃😄😅😅😆😆",
        "Awesome game just need to fix it a bit when you touch the diamonds it goes a little bit  faster and then you die so i would not do that",
        "Okay this is a good game but it glitches a lot and does anybody else have the problem on the knife game were It won't start properly?",
        "This app is fun to play but also has too many ads. Sometimes it plays an ad right in the middle of a game."

Cute animals and decorations. Love that I have several choices on some items. I hope new animals and habitats are available soon!",

For almost all levels, so far, I found there is a subtle trick that makes it easy to solve. Also since I completed all levels I really can't agree to the \"impossible part\". This is a great game design with sub plots. But please let us have the new levels soon.",

        "I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the \"mine\" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it's nicely done!",
        "I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.",
        "Overall the app is really great. It's the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you're not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.",
        "Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it's just my phone. Also I'm not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)",
        "Input delays keep getting me killed. Instead of marking a bomb my input sets it off. I'd prefer two different inputs for marking or removing tiles.  I'm using a stylus too so I know it's not an issue of accidentally hitting the wrong tile.",
        "Good game, same as old time windows PC. One suggestion: please show the advertisement only if 15 seconds or more gameplay is complete. Because I always click randomly at different squares initially untill the game builds up, and due to this, if a mine explodes, then I always accidently click on the ads that are displayed at game over screen."

This is a great game that could provide substantial income on well placed future DLC and franchise games.",

They dont care about cheaters just money.",

There should be a legendary option.  2. It would be nice to have a match summary and timeline at the end of a game.    3. There should be an auto-save game feature when playing against the AI, in case the game drops out.  Edit: They seem to have addressed my third point.",

Very rigged, fun when you get the chance to play which is once every 12 hours due to them asking you to buy the premium version. Highly unfair"

        "An advise read it plz and writ for it if u like! The game is awesome , nyc and funny and chalanging too. but i think it could b more intersesting if we get lifes in it. for example my high score is 22 and i never get on 22 again i remain on 16 or 19 but if i could hav one lyf there i shall surely reached my high score or more...\"thanku\"",
        "So basically I just sat down to play stick hero. And my goal at the end of the day is to reach at least 100 cherries. Same today. But as I start playing I don't find any cherries on my path. \"That is weird!\" I say to myself. I try to double tap to get cherries it doesn't allow it. So I go to the home page to see how many cherries I have ..... the icon isn't even there???   Despite that concern, love the game its so much fun ! For u people who are looking for a fun catchy game to play here is the perfect game. Please download so much fun and a great game to put on your device!",
        "Awesome but I have some ideas This game is awesome and it never ceases to make me happy. But buying new characters is kind of pointless. Developers you probably won't see this or even care if you do but I think that when you buy new characters the characters should have abilities that you use once a round for free or you can refresh the ability using cherries.",
        "Bug The game is great, and addicting. However, when I tap to go below to grab a cherry, and tap again to go above the bar it doesn't register the second tap so I end up dying. I've played this on several phones so I know it isn't a problem with my phone. Please fix this. It happens every single game. *It now freezes for a split sec and makes my bar go ten times higher than it should. For that, it's now 2 stars. Your other games do this too.",
        "False Advertising I mean, in a way. The help example is slower than the actual game. The platform grows faster and the guy runs across instead of the leisurely stroll in the 'tutorial'. Maybe have an option for speed, slower or faster depending on what the player feels like tackling that day. Still a fun game, but come on. We're not all finger-ninjas.",
        "I downloaded this game about a month ago. I can not seem to reach my high score of 72. Although, I average about 40. Overall, it is a decent game, and a good time - waster. I don't know why a lot of people complain about the ads. If you do not want the ads, do not download free games. Simple as that. I like the walking / stick version better than the water melon slashing one. I find that one to be a little bit too easy."

I would much rather pay a one time license fee that this crabby implementation of user annoyance  / advertising. The other problem is that on the high end phones (read pixel 2) the board are so big that the tiles as a consequence are made very small so they fit with a final result that makes it very difficult to see/read",
        "I think the game is great. I love Mahjong. I'm unhappy that I paid 1.99 to stop the ads but when I collect my 2,000 coin bonus I still have to watch an ad to receive the bonus. I will not be paying 1.99 next month just to still have to watch ads.",

However, almost every time I hit the undo button, an area of my drawing gets distorted (usually slowly grows bigger than I drew it) and also a random straight thick bar will also form on its own in those distorted areas. Very frustrating for someone who likes to draw with detail. Please fix. Also, now when I try to open a game with a friend the replay doesn't show any letters, and when it's time to guess no picture shows up. It's just full of bugs that keep me from simply playing the game the way it's supposed to be played."

        "I really enjoy the game so far but I have a few suggestions to help.  1.  Fix how we level up player skills.  Stopping the bar in the right place is annoying to do.  2.  Add more attacks like...a double back dash attack for your regular and power punch, a forward dash for the power punch and for the special skill when you get it, more combo button presses like light punch power punch light punch power punch etc.  3.  More characters.  I love the bone breaks it was a great touch.  I hope you keep updating this regularly",
        "Obvious cash grab like 99% of the play store these days. There is a definitive and game ending lag to this game which is hard to overcome, it needs fixing. And 500,000+ coins for a pair of shorts? Like I said, cash grab.",
        "More attacks, combo attacks, real damage if the arm is broken it should go limp and not work that would be cool,and can you please let people constantly and continue to hit the downed opponent after they already lost, you know extra cheap shots, more brutal honesty keep going I love it.",
        "I LOVE this game just as much as I do SOCCER HEADS,  great graphics, animations, bone structure system,  characters. But OVERALL just a really nicely done game developed by a really nice developer who knows his stuff. 🙃",
        "Great fun game with potential - needs a bit more upgrading features - like costume or skins of \" historical boxers etc. Upgrades are limited to lvl so huge gap between character enhancements make it feel a bit unprogressive at times - definitely deserve a try and will love",

She is constantly bugging me to buy them again, but since I have already purchased them I do not think I should have to. Please may I have a full refund so I can purchase again or better yet fix the problem, then I can give 5*",

If someone could fix this for me or refund me that would be great. I just got 6 new babies and she can't use any of them which is ashame cause she loves this game.",

        "love the game, really brings us into the world of dinosaurs. although I'm new at this and alot of the offers you have to pay for to get ahead. I think the difficulty showed be lowered a bit more for new played because some people don't have money on the spot to just purchase meat and dinos off the back.",
        "The game is very good with levelling up and progressing achievable with time. The events and some of the special unlock creature packs can be difficult and slightly imbalanced . But that's the way of a game with purchases. Overall is a good game if you stick with it haven't bought any extra bucks and I feel I'm at a reasonable level.   The only aspect which I think could be added to improve the game is a park editor style which is featured in similar games. As now I have used most the space in the park and takes forever to rearrange every item and dinosaur which I have . A simple remove all and place singularly would be perfect addition",
        ".     It doesn't tell you how to get past level 75. Or how super power your dinosaurs,  example the opponents dinosaurs that have the purple glow. Also unable to redeem the points on either visitor world or the world ran by facebook. Jurrassic World the game also doesn't tell or show you how to get your dinosaurs to the ultimate stage where  these issues. That's why they get a poor rating from this consumer. If everyone boycotted the game and cancelled their memberships, you can guarantee they would fix all glitches and explain away the issues that are asked.",
        "This game is freaking awesome. I just live it. The graphics are great, the controls work amazingly, and I LOVE the designs for the dinosaurs. The only problem I have with the game is that very recently, I would open the app, it would load all the way, and then it would crash and kick me out! I really hope that they fix this. I use the LG Aristo, but it has always worked fine. I want to get back to playing the game, so Ludia, please fix the game.",
        "I love the game. Its amazing. The biggest problem I encounter is the loading time of the game. I use a verry good wifi conection and even in this case it takes 35 minutes to load the game. Btw I have a huawei p9 and extra memory card of 125 gb so no storage problems. Since download I still have this long time in loading. To bad the game is amazing.",
        "Sorry for being alittke harsh. Thank you for fixing it. Now I can use the prize drop. And I don't get a million enteladons at once. I hope in the future this game becomes more of a hit than it is right now because the new jurassic world movie. thank you ludia. 👌😃👍"

Might be good for kids learning ... Except the full version is outrageously expensive: $3 per *week*! That's $150 per year!",
        "The sound of the piano is superb while it is hard to play a piece of music as they have sacrifice the view for a clearer view of the keys arrangement. However it would be nice if they come up with an idea with full view of the keys without the compromise of the piano keys in view would be great. Otherwise it great. Also on a second thought if they could give more choices of music pieces for free instead of premium would be nice.",

After some good hours it get's really repetitive... Right know it feels like nobody takes care about rhis game anymore. No more patches, updates, no new stuff. It's a shame. This game has some potential but it's getting wasted here.",
        "Very Relaxing! Just watching the acid mix with water, then the black hole making it disappear is sooo satisfying! Definitely recommended! But the stuff you pay for.. Its kinda dumb. Like, pay for this and this and not satisfied, yeah, just get rid of that. &lt;3",
        "What a wonderful little way to give your boredom a time out. Developer, great job for what I read as a cool way to give back to the world freely! I have wondered if more pictures are an upcoming addition...? Back to my sand box! 😃",
        "I LOVED IT IT IS AWESOME I LOVE HOW U CAN MAKE THINGS EXPLODE, but... i dont know why we have to PAY for the AWESOME stuff!! Am not giving 5 stars untill it gets free or at least cheaper! 😎",
        "I'm kinda unhappy with this game just a little because you have to pay for the premium stuff and ther isn't much to do without it and I don't wanna pay for it, is there a way for me to get it free like downloading more of your games?! I really do like this game but like I said I might not have it that long because there is not much to do on it I need the premium stuff! Thank you for the hard work on this game but it is not enough to satisfy me fully, anyway let me know what's up!...",
        "I did not expect much but this game instantly became one of my favorites. To many things lags the game alot and I wish there was an undo button. P.S. the premium version is only $1😮😮😮😮😮😮😀"

It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn't like how easy the drawings were and I don't think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn't recommend this game if you don't like colouring. It's ok!!!!",

Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn't color the whole background, because what if you didn't want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!",

        "One of the best motorcycle game to date, weather conditions are great, bikes are great and handling is great, but the bad ai on higher difficulty level a few times are ridiculous and messes up everything.  Sometimes a truck speeds up to 150km/h just to close off that small gap, where you could slip through, but next time all cars in all lane slow down at once, so you can't pass anywhere, even though there's nothing in front of them. This is really annoying, when every second counts and there's no way to pass them for 4-7 seconds. Apart from this the game is great. The keep changing weather conditions is great too.",

        "I played this a while back and decided to come back and see if anything had changed and it sure did. There have been several updates that I love (the new maps, new sharks, equipment, etc.) and I'm glad I'm playing it now. In game currency price for items has been balanced out which I love and the missions system is much better now. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes progression-based time-killing games like Hungry Shark World.",
        "This game is amazing! Everyone needs to play this. I would've given a fifth star however you need to not only buy all XXL sharks to unlock the \"!!\" Sharks but max them out. Definitely download this, just one tip. Don't delete when you have progress. I've downloaded, played, got bored, and deleted 3 times. Now I'm never deleting it. I have so much progress, if I never deleted it the first time I would have everything in the game",
        "Finally! For the the longest time I've been waited, the gaming performance has been improved! No more annoying lag and the gameplay feel a lot smoother now and I am so happy about it. But the graphics still needs to be improved because it doesn't look too good and some minor bug needs to be fixed.",
        "Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it's so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I've had to start all over again... but the fun continues!",
        "Do not upgrade your Sharks.  The bigger the shark, the more difficult it is to play.  Big sharks have more drain on health and hunger, causing you to die more frequently. Impassable areas due to size of !! shark and less fishes to eat when health gets low.  Not to mention how slow these big sharks move!  The more you spend on bigger sharks, the less fun you'll have.",
        "I've had to start this game all over from the very beginning 3 times. After working hard to get all the way to the top sharks, the app will suddenly refuse to connect to your Facebook account and want you to start a whole new game. Waste of time. Very frustrating. Not enjoyable at all. Find a game that's enjoyable. This one is definitely not fun."

        "you need more choices for style like maybe theres  should be clothes lvls too and maybe more hair coloring the colors that you picked are kinda un useful you need more hats  too  the three hats hats are kinda ugly an dwere trying to make it pretty so maybe a funny section of hats and a modern section of hats and necklaces they need more like maybe you could costumize one for your character     and maybe you could choose more charcters  for your desighns i know i know this isnt a quick review but it was just som ideas",

        "It's a good game I just get easily bored with the same thing plus I wish it had a razer so you can make a hair to the side style that would be cool but other wise I liked it",
        "I like game because we are free to create hairstyle in our own way there is no copy mode and i like that i think you should add more colors and some more accesories and hat for a complete look in game and last thing is add new accessories  and colors without deleting old ones they are also needed in game and KEEP YOUR GAME FREE SO WE CAN USE OUR CREATIVITY.",
        "I like it I do the best salon I can for the girls and my pics of them for when I finished r amazing but I think that there should be some boys in the game as well because I am a bit of a tomboy and boys are good in hair games and I think that there should be a shaver item so that you could cut of all the hair because I really want to cut of all the hair and do a complete redo ok"

        "Well after playing all the battleships games on Google play store I must to say that his one is the best of all. The game have the best graphics, the best gameplay and one of the most important things in my opinion there is a lot more ships and different types of ships than the other games. So if you enjoy playing games about battleships I recommend you to play this one instead of the others. The only negative thing that I found is the lack of ships in some countries except for Japan and USA, it would be great if they add all ships that are present in the PC version.",
        "Excellent Game overall. Good graphics and controls (once you get used to how a ship moves) feels very real. Gameplay is fair but challenging and is addictive when trying to LVL up. Costs are reasonable but bonus cold be higher for premium account when compared to console prices. Customer service very good. I had a loading issue and advice was prompt and issue is resolved. Would edge about 4.7 out of 5 for me.",
        "Fun game at first and got all the way to a tier V battleship!! It was fun until I started going against OP destroyers. I can broadside that tiny ship two of three times but it doesn't matter. Couple of torps and down I go. They move faster than i can track. Will be going back to Battle of Warships.",
        "Very well executed port of a good game. Mostly sane monetization. The only problem I see is the premium price. In desktop version it is slightly less than 10$/month which is on the cheap side for MMO and makes a very good proposition. Mobile version is almost 30$/month which is frankly too much. I may consider 10$, or even 15$ per month (same as AAA MMO games on desktop with a ton more content), but not twice the price, especially for a mobile time killer.",
        "Great game! Love to play it. Had 1 problem so far. Was playing a battle ship. Was rammed by a destroyer... Had all my guns on him. His ship went OVER mine which meant all my guns were now facing the wrong way. He on the other hand torp'd me to death....",
        "The game is fun and they did a good job, but there is a lot that could be greatly improved. The destroyers are way too powerful and cruisers a bit useless. Also AA fire from ships is close to non-existent. And the rewards could be a little bit higher in order to keep the game fun for a longer time. Also the in game communications must be improved so that it's possible to give tactical directions like: capture the area or defend our area, and mark targets."

        "Great time killer! Simple to play, though a few information/help would be nice for a few items, the auto sell option and the bailer so you know exactly what they do.  The developer does listen to the players and fixes things! Only true issues that I have are 1)the materials needed to build the buildings in incredibly high, not really obtainable for game play, even for someone who would play constantly",
        "It was a good game, until new update. The car body now go to scrap and not in the selling list, thus reduced the profit earning. Also in buildings needs to be repaired, materiap required is of huge quantity. Graphics needs to be better. Game play is easier to understand. Also in bank no complete cash statement is available, like complete diamond spend statement is available and not cash one.  Will surely give 5 star after fixing above points",
        "So far, not bad.  Update:  gathered enough parts to repair the university and it won't unlock.  I emailed the developer and haven't heard back.  It is such a cool concept with little to no support or point.  Why gather the materials if we can't use them?  Plus, it took weeks to get the stuff.  Like most cool games, nothing more than a good concept.",
        "You had my attention, and now you have my money. Yes, this is a good game. However, it costs too much real money to advance this game. There are many missing pieces and too much to acquire to be able to progress. Maybe instead of making it so in depth, take it down a notch. Let people use junked cars to fix cars and sell them, if this is already an option make it easier to do so. I think this is a good game just too in depth and not enough give to make it entertaining and fun at this time.",
        "The game is over good. It's definitely fun for your car enthusiasts but I am now level 11 and I can't obtain \"glass\" to build any buildings... The game is getting boring because I can't move up, it's pretty much scrap cars and sell parts... I don't want to rate this game too high because I believe it still is a work in progress, but yes it's a good game and I would recommend it",
        "It's a decent concept. Good time killer for a little while. I don't know why all these games take energy. Just let me play the damn game. And the constantly fluctuating prices to sell the parts got old REAL QUICK! Apparently the creators of this game have never been to a salvage yard in their life."

You can only get so far with the \"free ponies\" before you hit a pay wall that requires parents to purchase additional ponies to finish the quest.  The reason I say \"free ponies\" is that your child is subjected to a ridiculous amount of ads in order to play. The only way to get rid of the ads is to buy the ponies.  Even though my daughter loves the game and it's easy for a 5 year old to play, I had to uninstall it due to the ad content.  You really should be more careful who you solicit ads from for content designed for children under 8.",

The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can't go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.",

I have no interest in trying to play something that shovels ads in your face more often than you can actually play.",
        "I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i'm asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting",
        "Too many ads. It's annoying especially when you are connected to the internet. The King Boss is not working and is always saying \"Something went wrong, please try again later\" and crashes the whole gane. On the other hand it's a super addictive and fun game to play.",
        "I'd happily purchase this game but that doesn't seem like an option. Tge ads, especially the LOUD BLOW UP EXPLOSIONS game that go on for 30 seconds are especially annoying. I'll gladly buy it, if only to not deal with Fing ads all the Fing time!!",

The only thing is that I wish there were more combinations, there are things I've tried that you'd think would make something but don't. For example, Crayon (or Pencil, or Charcoal, or Paint) + Paper does not make Art.",

It has more items but mixing some items don't really make  sense like Domestication and grass makes wheat that is one item that don't make sense otherwise you can cheat from little alchemy 1 so yeah 55 star from me!",
        "For whatever reason, when I play the game offline, and try to play it again later online, it says there is a progress conflict, but the number of elements listed in each version is much lower than listed in my stats... Works fine if I keep playing offline though... Also, for some elements the number of combinations I have left is wrong or rightdown self-contradictory. Please fix!",
        "The interface is not so good. Big icons are not convenient, we have to scroll down long everytime, I could only imagine how much effort would it take if I had 500 items discovered. Please make icons small or a different tab just for icons or just make it like little alchemy one.",

I've used it before, but now it won't let me use it anymore. Perhaps it is an issue with my phone rather than a glitch in the app.",
        "Huge, glaring problem: once I create obsidian for the first time, I can't create it again. It doesn't show up in the table of ingredients on the right hand side. Searching for it in the search bar reveals it doesn't seem to exist. When I try to combine the ingredients to make obsidian, the game basically says, \"yep that's how you make obsidian\" without actually making any."

Also TOYOCASH App is Perfect app for anyone in anywhere who has free time and doesn't wana waste it, you can use it while travelling,working.. simply earning money by watching advertisements..",
        "I love the series more and more with every installment. Great game, with simple aesthetics and a fun way to coklect gear and powers. The animations are rag-dolly sometimes but other than that it's perfect. I have one suggestion for Nekki. Why aren't you guys making games for consoles? You're too advanced for mobile. You could be the future mortal kombat sensation.",
        "Graphics are awesome, it controls and plays very well. Fights are slick and intense with wonderful animation that makes great use of slow-mo to highlight big moves and finishing hits. The only real barrier to me giving this a full hearted recommendation is that there are microtransactions ALL OVER THE PLACE. If you don't like those distracting you constantly, not the game for you.",

But it's mission are pretty hard.I have a request can you please make a second name change because when I first started playing in excitement to play this game I had chosen a bad name and I wanted to change it. And I think like me many players had done this so please think about this.",
        "Loved the new BGM... ABSOLUTELY beautiful. Just one thing, please make the animation speed a little bit more fast. It's slightly annoying to wait that long for a window to open to show the equipments or switch between armour and equipments. Please note that.  But overall...it's the best game I've ever played. Kudos",
        "Nekki .. I don't know what's wrong with my app apk. I can't select the country, I mean Legion/Dynasty etc. There is a request which i want you to up upgrade asap in the game. I want you to add a option of 'Multiplayer' so that we can play the game with our friends too. Perhaps the game is awesome. Loved it."

        "It's a fun relaxing game. Its so addictive that every device I have, must have this game. I have it on my phone, ipad and tablet. Except my laptop cuz then I would get no work done. About the ads, one pops out each time you finish a game, so I'm not to bothered by it. Also, theres no videos too watch in order to earn coins or diamonds because none are needed. I just love it. Its stress free.",
        "I really enjoy playing this game. It helps me to relax while I am watching TV, or even using in split mode while watching a video or something. It's a bit different then the way I originally used to play Klondike, but still a great game and easy to get used to quickly! I don't mind the 5 second or so ads between games. It's the price you pay to get a good, free game. It's not like they play constantly and during a game there is usually an ad on the bottom screen but it will quickly move if you go to start a new game or need to access the other options.",
        "I would have scored higher except there is suddenly super annoying music being played that there is no option to turn off. The ads also now autoplay loud music. I agree with another poster who said it starting to seem like you lose more so you see more ads. I liked this because it was good for a quick game while getting ready to sleep. The music ruins this. I'm going to try another app now.",
        "I love the game solitaire played it on many different computers over the years. Downloaded three other version on my phone. All of which I deleted almost straight away because they were finicky and I didn't like the format. This one is easy to use and no glitches. So far so good.",
        "Terrible ads. So bad they hid the menu bar behind an ad banner so you click the ads just to access settings. Pretty sure they recently increased losing deal rate to make more ad videos play. So many other solitaire aps available so skip this one.",
        "I play solitaire to look busy in public. My brow furrows a bit so it probably looks important. I have social anxiety. I was informed that a 5* review would let me bypass ads, which are sometimes loud and totally give away the fact that I'm doing something useless."

And maybe you could even make more pickaxes for the flower forest.",
        "Ot was a good game, but after the first prestige, I have never felt more disappointment in my whole life. Also how do you get to the biomes like ather and wasteland?",
        "I like the game I'm just annoyed cos when I went on.to receive 70000 picks it says error save game file gone! What!!! So now I have to start all the way from the beginning. I love the game it's just I'm annoyed",
        "I love the game! But its kinda hard to get runic, and i don't have enough space on my phone to keep installing and uninstalling things, you think you could do like an achievement system to get few runics at a time and as you advance in that certain topic ex. 10 taps or picks = 1 runic and then you get to 100 taps and you get 3 or 5, stuff of that sort. It would make it a lot easier to get them and you could keep adding new achievements as you upgrade the game. Anyways keep up the good work and keep on adding on ❤👍",
        "Its fun and a bot repetitive. It alao can get boring and there has been times were i left this game for weeks, but its actully pretty good until you prestige then it becomes super boring",
        "Disappointed. After first prestige it restarted all my progress. My picks, my monsters item, my mythical, my runic and everything!!!"

        "I really dislike how limited you are on steering. More than once I've found myself crashing because I had no animal to jump to and I had no room on my phone to steer properly. I would like to see something like a virtual left and right joystick, or a rework so that instead of holding to stay on (which I understand, you are made to HOLD onto the animal), a tap based system would be a good solution I think. Start the game with a start button, tap to let go, tap to lasso. This would enable the player to move their steering finger freely without worry of accidentally letting go of the animal. Just my opinion though. Despite that I really enjoy the game so far",
        "I bought the mission mule, and it gave me nothing. I even got a confirmation email from Google play. I thought it was just because he's a mule, and I am in the savannah, but I still had to watch a video to get missions. So 1 star. Will rate 5 if I get my unlimited missions  EDIT: The team at yodo1 got back to me in 24 hours, and helped me understand what was up with the mission mule.  Amazing game. Everyone I tell about it, gets addicted to it.",
        "I played the game for a while, and it's pretty good. I only have one issue with the game, and that is the turning. I'd prefer a slider for turning insted of turning based off of how much you slid your thumb. If you do implement that make it an option don't take out what's already there. I'll give it a 4/5. I would give it a 4.5/5, but can't.",
        "This game was played by my sister, than I wanted to play it as soon as I saw it, cause of its amazing graphics. Now that I'm playing it, I just had to rate it. But I had to wait but I never ever preset the never show me again because I knew I was going to rate it some day. And I guess that was today. Love you created a of rodeo staped! And the people who play it too!!❤",
        "Great game, good fun. Please move the pay to continue button from where you hold your finger because I hit it every single time I die so I lose all my money. Also the screen doesnt slide fast enough so sometimes you cannot escape rocks.",
        "Love this game It's very Addicting. I don't want to say to much because I'm still trying to figure it out. **update**  I understand how to play it better now. I want you to know I don't really play much In the way of games anymore but a friend showed me this game and now I'm addicted to it. Also wanted to mention that I'm 49 years old so in saying that this game is for the young and old alike."

        "I have downloaded and uninstalled it and did the same process over again and I still can't play it. It keeps telling me that it needs an active internet connection to play. Well, I can play my other internet based mobile games and I am writing this review from the same mobile device and everything else that requires internet is working so it is a fault in the game itself. It's a shame because I really wanted to play this but now I am going to uninstall it and not bother with it again because it is frustrating me. If the issue gets fixed somehow then I may think about playing it.",
        "So I'm changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it's a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I'd rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!",
        "This game is fun but I don't know if it's a bug or they're doing it on purpose but it seems like you can never win the extra challenges they do to win prizes.  I have watched the game say I lost when there's no way the computer opponent could have gotten enough points to be me. I messaged the game creators about it and never got a response. I'm about to uninstall this game.",
        "GAME CODE reveals ROLLS ARE NOT RANDOM - they're pulled from a table of predertirmined outcomes, designed to MILK YOU FOR MONEY at a set rate, based on PvP, reg. Game, Event, Boss, etc.  Just like slot machines & video poker (which i programme).  You must 'assemble' high scoring games, like a puzzle, with majority of yahtzees sitting after 4 or 8 rolls (1 or 7 bonus 'dice'(money) spent)... Like a choose your own adventure book that can cost Hundreds of Dollars.",
        "I love this game but lately it's been frustrating as nothing is loading or working. It won't update anything when I open the app and I've gone as far as deleting and really downloading but it is still giving me issues. I am am very dissapointed as over the last few weeks it has kicked me out of a ton of games for being \"inactive\" when in all reality the games weren't loading and for almost a week the entire app wasn't loading any information.",
        "I'll give this game more than one star once the showdowns are less about the computer clearing and more about real challenge.  Once you start a showdown the computer conveniently never gets a bad roll.  Which wouldn't be a big deal except you have to wait to challenge them again unless you want to pay for extra dice which is used to unlock everything else.  Kinda cheap."

        "Its a fun game, really, however in my opinion its too easy. I got 150 First try and 346  my second. and maybe consider adding things to unlock like different balls or hoops. other than that its a fun game to kill time",
        "The first time I played I easily got over 800, now I swear the game upped it's difficulty like crazy, I can't get past the 200s. Not sure if it's a bug, an Easter egg feature or what, or if it's because I completed challenges but I don't appreciate the inconsistency especially when playing against friends and I don't feel evenly matched :(",
        "So many words but after u got all the  things there is nothing to do bar from play on it but it a  really good game love it soooooo much",
        "I like the game and the idea of it, but the only problem I have with it, its the ads. Dear God there is a lot of ads, even when I'm in the middle of a game, an ad pops up from the bottom. Just try to lower the amount of ads especially on the challenges, I hate to be asked and forced to watch an ad everytime I fail a challenge or complete it",
        "I absolutely love the game the only.problem I'm having is when I'm playing I keep knocking the ad advert at the bottom where your thumb goes to move the net and keeps ending game and making me.lose cause of that will change rating if gets sorted",
        "Its hard to get perfects and if trying to watch ads sometimes it doesn't work"

        "I wish I could give this game 10 stars. It's amazing all around.  It's adorable and fun. The graphics are amazing too without any glitches so far. Haven't noticed any bugs either. The developer's done amazing. It does get repetitive after a while but so far by the time it happens something new unlocks so it's still fun. Can't wait to see what else you guys do to improve the game play since everything else has been flawless so far. Great job, keep up the great work!",
        "This game is super cute! I love my lil ninja friend! Lol. Nice story, and plenty to do to keep you busy. Will def take time to master, but it def has the potential to keep you interested in playing. Even got my wife playing it, and she usually only keeps games for a day or 2, cuz she gets bored with them. I think she'll play this one a little longer than most of the other games she's tried. I'm really happy i found this game!!",
        "This one is probably my favourite, with minecraft and clash of clans. If you don't have this Virtual Friend game, then it is you who is missing out. Install and enjoy. There's nothing bad about this game, and if Naturalmotion do want me to suggest an add-on, then maybe enable me to link the game with a new device. I was LVL 52 once but I lost it. Now I'm level 17. Hope you liked the suggestion. :)",
        "I love this game, it's simple and sweet. However, there was a middle row in the item-picking menu in which I had invested many coins into to help me level up faster. Today, when I logged in, the row simply disappeared without a trace. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the backgrounding of my app, but nothing seemed to fix it. Now I only have the Training row and the Fun stuff row. It took me quite a while to get those coins and I'd really appreciate it if you brought the row back or gave me a solution to get it back. If it helps, you should also know that the 'I' on every icon which used to let you see how an item was used has also vanished. Please fix this, thank you.",
        "You should add a dog and a cat wearing ninja suit they can be like the chicken and the squirrel the dog can run around you and bark and find bones and sell them for coins and the cat can find fish and sell it for coins. It just sounds like a good idea  the dog should be a husky or a smaller dog like a beagle so it is small like the other animals and it can sleep with the ninja the cat can just be a cat please look into this *^* looking forward to this",
        "This is a great game that I've played off and on over the years. I just redownloaded it, and it'd still fun to play. My only gripe is that there's no place to save your progress. Cloud, Facebook, etc. I hate having to start from level 1 every time I have to wipe/switch phones. Even an account that saves your data would be great. Fix this and it'll be 5 stars all the way for me."

        "Well, I loved the looks of it. Seemed really fun so I downloaded it. Then I spent 30 min downloading the patches, to find out at the very end I didnt have enough space on my phone. Uninstalled as much as I could, and still didn't have enough space... Could have said in details of the game how much space it REALLY takes up... Would have been really nice to know.  -a not so happy consumer",
        "So, far really love to play. I only just started though. The controls are hard but that's probably because I'm playing on a tablet and I got small hands. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to continue playing this. For some reason it makes my tablet terrifyingly hot to the point I'm concerned. I'll hold on to the app for now in case it gets better in the future.",
        "An amazing mmo that really does a great job of handling farming, the game play although has an auto feature still utilizes the controls. The depth of all the items and armor and weapons is awesome. I've been really happy playing this game. The clans are great. The 30 vs 30 opensiege is a nice feature. This game is super fun even for the people that want to play for free. Netmarble does a great job with daily rewards, login bonuses, and events that all allow for players to get great items for free!! Best game I've played in a long while. Only thing is constant crashes and bad story line. The game keeps me turning it back on and I haven't went one day without logging in.",
        "Addicting game with auto-questing and battling. You can choose to do it manually, which I do for boss fights. I don't have to buy anything from the shop, in fact, you get free gear every day! The graphics are amazing for a mobile game with it being an MMO. I have a Note 8, so it does run really well. I play with my monitor using SideSync for full screen awesomeness. There is a lot to do for all types of players, being in a guild doing dungeons reminds me of the old-school MMORPGs of sieging and doing weekly raids."

        "Loved it at first. Even paid to remove ads. But the land only expands so far and after that it just gets boring. There should be more \"daily jobs\" to make it more interesting. I find that I've got over 5 max level plots for everything and must delete and start over just to have fun.",
        "You couldn't stuff more ads into this game if u wanted to. I'm okay with ads to do double seeds or speed up harvesting. But there shouldn't be random ads that pop up while your playing normally so you accidently click on it and it takes you to the play store. STOP being so greedy.",
        "I love the game but now the ads aren't working to double harvest or seeds or add extra orders. It's the first time I have ever asked to make the ads work lol but I will happily watch them if I can. I'm clicking to watch and nothing happens. Restarting the app doesn't help.",
        "I really like this game. That being said I've encountered an impassable, constant issue. Whenever I merge crops, the image of the previous one remains and covers up my screen. I will re-review once this is fixed. It only started once I hit level 31, so I've been playing for a while with no issues.",
        "The amount of ads is just ridiculous. Banner ads, ads for stupidly short boosts, AND ads that just pop up and force you to sit through them is far too much. Like, I get it, you need to make money somehow on a free game, but there's a limit. Touch control is just a bit wonky, not enough to really bother me. Overall the game is fun but the ads annoy me too much to keep playing it."

        "I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.",
        "If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.",
        "It's good at first but you'll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.",
        "Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I'm not spoiling it, but I will tell you it's a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don't know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.",
        "Both my husband and I have this game.  I opted to pay for the no ads though, he did not.  DO NOT do this!  He is able to get \"continues\" for watching adds and can keep climbing up the levels.  I cannot since I purchased no adds.  I get to continue once and that's all since I have stopped ads from allowing me to get the extra chances.  I wish I would have known this beforehand. Otherwise, this game is seriously fun and addicting.",
        "Very addictive game. Fun, easy to play, and colourful.  The speeding up button takes too long to appear. You shoot the ball then you just sit and wait.   The \"continue\" option appears but most of the time nothing happens when I touch it. It doesn't respond or go to an ad, it just runs out of time then I have to restart. I don't know why it doesn't work.  Points to get different coloured balls isn't any fun. I'd rather be able to buy bonuses of some kind like extra balls for a one-off, special balls, or spend those points to continue a game I just lost.   Altogether it's fun but a big time suck and doesn't really get more interesting as you go."

        "So, this is an awesome, addictive and fun, satisfying game to play and it is really good if you want to become a nail artist. I would of gave it five stars but it is a bit unreal like you can just rub the nail varnish everywhere but it only appears on the nail but that can stop you from being annoyed because it is not as hard as it is in real life and one of my designs didn't go into my album because the game just got stuck and randomly stopped by its self and it went back to my home screen. Also there is too many ads. I am not interested! And you can't cross them off unless you download the app! What point is that?! And I cannot move and make the stickers bigger on match this so I can't complete it. Help! Sort this out!",
        "I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn't get me board everytime i have different desins to do.",
        "A really nice game which also got me hooked up! Nevertheles, it frequently and automatically shuts down, deleting what was there.....this really broke my litlle sister's heart, even mine. For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....",
        "Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!",
        "Cute Its a very nice game. The best thing I liked in this game is that everything is already unlocked, we don't need to spend real money or even coins in the game. It has so many options for colours, designs and stickers. But it also has too many adds. On the whole I liked it very much",
        "I  am finally at the final last level! Before I thought it was boring but after I reached some levels farther I thought it was awesome! And it is the best game ever! YEAH!!!!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💙💙💚💚💛💛💜💜💗💗❤❤ AND when I was playing my 1st game all things were opened but when I played in my small sister's tab all, things were closed! I got everything for free!!

Too bad, no PLAYERS = poor ratings & no data for them to sell. More interested in videos than PLAYERS. Had been great game, no more. Only good...great graphics.",

I did like it at first till i caught on to this little act and was very discouraged. Come on Developers what the hell!!!!",
        "I love it its addictive but they need to add more ways to get gold like from completing levels, feind of fortune, missions, and crates. I hope you add this because I don't have a Google play card so I can't buy any gild and am stuck on 9 gold for spending it all in the beginning so please add this I hate not getting to buy costumes for feinds and not get to buy feinds.",
        "Great game to pass the time but you shouldn't have to lose all your streaks over one loss. Streak loss should go down gradually as it does when earning streaks. From 3 to 2 to 2 to 2 to 1 with each loss. Excellent graphics. Interesting and entertaining. Recommended to family and friends.",
        "It's an amazing game, I have only had for a day and am already hooked. My mom actually played it and loved it as well. Definitely recommend it to people from any ages. I could play it all day. But it is snowing hard core right now soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo......................................................

        "I really like (love) this game, but 7 energy per level (out of 20 total) means I play 2 levels and then close the game. Sorry Tapps, wish I could like MORE and play MORE but you literally aren't letting me. Make level energy 3*-5* and I will give a 5 star rating. Till then, I'll stare at this app and click around to others that actually give me play time.",
        "Good game but when I've finished a container a player that has not won a bid still ends up profiting when he  or her anit bidded and I need I need a hundred grand to open miami what happens when I do and ain't got money to bid. And I've watched x amount of videos to the end to get a gold bar and it's not give me one and says you have to watch the full video sort it out",
        "To make it more realistic and to be similar to the tv show.. rather than who else made profit etc..maybe a preview page showing what was in the missed sheds and the  value.. eg one page showing all the items and their value so that you can say l was smart to not buy that one or l should have bid higher..",
        "Good game and very addictive. Got to level 27 and thats it! I read other comments that say they have dallas, mine does not show anything after level 27, only coming soon. Oh and there sometimes is a glitch with the money sound after you clear a level and cash in items or take to store.",
        "I dont like having to wait to play. I always have to wait for the lightning bolts but I suppose gotta make money somehow. I just feel you should be able to do more sales then 3 at a time without having to pay or make the add give you enough to play at least one more sale, not be short 2. Other than that great game. Love it.",
        "The update has not gone out to everyone so there's still time to fix it. 2 units per level? No big items and outrageous bids? A big let down from previous levels."

Making one mistake at lvl 190+ and then having to go back to zero was so frustrating it was the main reason i uninstalled.  Terrible shame honestly, the game could have been really fun and is an original idea",

        "Great game, great time burner. Absolute !@#$ with the choice of skins for your balls, it doesn't let you view them and clicking on it instantly buys it. I've been lucky with the two I've bought but still an awful design."

After I was finally able to reach the settings, I tried to LOG IN EXISTING ACCOUNT and it said that I need to become &gt;&gt; LEVEL 8 &lt;&lt; to unlock this feature. I could never imagine a game doing that. This is absolutely insane. Reach level 8 to a new account in order to log in to my old existing account. And why do I have to play with a new account in the first place? Why not the usual log in screen that every game has!!!",
        "The game is fine but people leave the game in between match or before match.  Its irritating  coz we lose without any reason.  The punishment  for this behavior  is so less.  Just 5 credit points.  Which is just too dumb.  The developers should punish them more or else its too frustrating  and people  will quit and choose other games similar to this",
        "I would give 5 star but now i only give 1 start because today i just format my handphone when i install back my mobile legend and play all the tutorials, it tell me need to reach level 8 then can connect back my account!! If i got a account, why should i waste a lot of time to leveling?? Please ASAP to fix the problem",
        "Same problem. Bad server. High ping. Lag lag everywhere. Bad teammates (afk). Why focus on fixing and then you will have no complaining players. And fix the lvl 8 restrictions. My account missed many free chest, gold chest, and the oddete jigsaw. Pls rework it. Many players will quit because you are forcing them to play and you are wasting are time that can be used for rank games. Fix it.",
        "lag lag lag.. fix lag problem.. other game rarely lag at important time yet this game multiple time.. even so all the fans ml still love this game... just lag will make stress and not fun to play.. i pay a lot of money to play fine skin and hero but its all no fun anymore due to lag non stop .. well sure the latest phone can play without problem.. but what about the low one.. cant even move properly making the player like suicide and more afk..",
        "The game is good, but for the linking account part is ridiculous. I don't understand why must be level 8 then can logon to existing account. It is wasting our precious time just to play so many useless matches until level 8 to change back to your exiating account. Please i would you suggest to change your system of changing of existing account. Thanks"

        "Sometimes I would give it a five star other times 4 star. Good number of challenge keys per visit to none challenge sites. As few as two visits needed for one visit to challenge site in final level of challenge (requiring 25keys). Love the two modes for cards of fate. No time limit but fewer tries works great if you write down what you find. It surprisingly has improved my timed play of this mini game. There are getting to be too many items and NO search functions to facilitate where to find a particular item, what collection items belong to if someone wants it and you don't want to send it anonymously (case if you send a requested item) and don't send it from the gift bar. One of the better hide and find games.",
        "I changed my previous rating. There are so many glitches, especially with new events  and support doesn't respond to requests. I haven't gotten totem bonuses for three days and new event is nearly impossible at times to find bunnies and objects. This used to be my \"go to\" stress reliever but now it just creates more stress.",
        "Instead of relaxing me this game stresses the hell out of me. New bunny location is extremely hard to find the 🐇. And the time limit is too short. I know im wasting my time writing this cause I've seen a lot people complaining about it and nothing is been done. Will be unistalling if it doesn't gets fix. Good day",
        "Money sucking game!  You can only play once a day for about 5 mins. without making purchases. I dumped 50.00 into this for extra rubies and it only provided a couple hrs of play. Fun, but it's a rip off and no way to play more than a few mins each day. Bad design, not enough incentives to get good game play...just a $$ pit here.",
        "The main complaint is that some tasks have insanely short timers, like for the new event where you have to find optionnal stuff that's really well hidden as well as the usual pack of items that usually takes the whole timer to find. Great game, bases itself too much on money dropping."

        "Got too allgegro madness. And got stuck with the no face cards. 14 cards is alot to get. In fairway blast the card suits stick until a new none face card comes up, or reshuffles them. I find with this game they dont stick when the next card is turned over. So your run ends. And the run cards you ave accumulated as returned back to one agan.",
        "It's a fun game!! can keep you very entertained only thing that sucks is if you have it on PC or iOS there are way more features and it's way better than the Android version!!😢 So the side note is for the developers at Big Fish Games....... So I think we've all waited way too long it's time to step it up and come out with a greater Android version at least make it as good as the iOS version!!!!!?????",
        "People will tell you that it's good for your brain or that it's fun, but that really isn't true, especially since it won't even allow you to turn off hints. Immediately after you make a move, you can't even think for yourself and try it alone. It's annoying. Don't get it. Go to a different solitary game.",
        "I love this game. I only had one issue , and it was a small one. The fixed it in 24 hours an compensated me extra. I'm happy I wrote this after having the game for a few weeks. I truly can give this 5 stars cause I played it for weeks and have come across the different scenarios in the game. Thank you for your awesome customer service and great game!!!!",
        "I love solitaire games, but this game is impossible. The first rounds will be easy, and then you're hit with ridiculous difficulty and straight up unwinnable games, that is, unless you spend money to get power ups that shouldn't even be necessary. 100% pay to win game. Which I find very sketchy. I'll never download anything from these developers ever again.",
        "PLEASE change where the 5 extra card for 2000 bucks is! I love this game but when you're short on money and you accidentally press it.... aaaaarggh. I'm pretty sure others don't like where it is either. Could be a perfect game. And I spend hours a day on it as I'm bedbound. Please..."

        "I loved the original. I've gotta say though, the part with the wizard dying and the endless mode game over scene is kinda sad. Also i found a glitch, if you go to tournament mode and select an icon you haven't unlocked yet and then go to the main menu. You can go back into tournament mode and you'll have the icon even though you didn't unlock it.",
        "So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn't find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren't extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don't know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I'm not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.",
        "Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it's not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I've survived 24 nights but I don't even have the achievements for\"survive 5 nights\". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don't because some of the zombie achievements I'm not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I'm currently at 59. GG!",
        "Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh",
        "I love the game but its frustrating when you have all 8 Spartans and the sword guys get in the way so maybe an extras set of controls to control where your men start or something. Also for me the screen keeps jumping I try to look at enemy and I catch a glimpse but then it jumps to my side then back again and again and again please fix this.",
        "I wish there were more commands. Like maybe you could command the miners to garrison while the rest of the troops guard. Also, redesign the swordwrath helmet. It looks like someone spray painted their hair gold and then glued jewels on it. I also wish there could be more types of zombies. The idea of endless is cool but please add the zombies to the campaign."

However, after the first ten levels it becomes an infuriating cacophony of balancing your bridge on rocks and mountains without anchor points and hanging your bridge from hot air balloons. Levels become so frustratingly impossible that you are forced to watch the videos for hints to get enough stars to progress.",

It may have adds but they are expected in a free to play mobile app. The adds are easily controlled and aren't annoying at all as they can be easily closed and come in moderation. The gameplay is smooth, the graphics are cool and it's very fun and addicting. Perfect to pass time. The developers done a great job, hope for me great games made big these guys.",

        "Addicting game. But not giving my hints I win for 3 levels! Unbelievable! Plus, didn't give me credit for a hint package I bought! I have followed all the instructions and still no hints... They just take your money.. won't give hints when compete a level..hmm have uninstalled and reinstalled it and still no hints... Awful",
        "Is a highly addictive game with very difficult puzzles at certain points.  I think they should be using this application in schools to teach kids how to spell and also critical thinking in puzzle solving which doesn't seem to go on nowadays. I have young nieces and nephews and it seems like schools just want to dump information into the child's head make sure they pass standardized tests and kick them out but they're not actually learning they are just memorizing. So Kudos and my hat's off to the developers of wordbrain",
        "Overall good. But it is now broken at level 14 on the Whale pack. Uninstalling. Not going to faff about with the \"support team\" if the game can't cope with the basics and accept its own answers!! (As confirmed with use of hints!)",
        "Every single level a wrong scramble challenge shows up and I have to restart the game over and over. Fun but having to keep restarting the game on every level is very annoying! Please fix it I really enjoy it.",
        "Fun, but every time I run out of time, after that level, it just freezes and I have to back out and go back in. Frustrating. But decent time killer ...especially with that issue",
        "Need to improve watching video to get extra hints because a lot of times it doesn't work ."

But.. it has so much adds. Excluding the get for free things. Still, five stars! Highly recomended.  Thank you.",
        "It's the best game I have ever played..... Nothing is locked except a few....... And you can mostly buy things..... There are different shops like one for parties one for free style one for gowns..... There are two or three makeup shops there is a hair salon a jewellery shop..... I think every one should try this game at least for once.......and this is the best game of the coco games so I think try it for once......",
        "Its an suberp game and i like to play it but one thing should be improved that whenever there is a sale the time limit of it should be increased the reason is that maybe some one will be playing the contest and the sale advertise will come but they cant go and when they come to that store the sale is finished. but its really nice game and girls would love it but they show so much ads.this should be improved.rest its a lovely game and organizations of the game are awesome",
        "It was pretty awesome.. Cocoplay I just love ur games but I've one problem, that good dresses r ALWAYS unlocked or maybe 3/4 of good dresses r unlocked. All right I accept it's no big deal but ADDS!! They drive me crazy, siriusly(I really mean it to be \"sirius\"ly) it does. Pls remove so many adds. I m really tired. I m writting a long review so that you can understand more, n help me out.N I hope you do fix it soon. Thank u very much, n hope you keep making brilliant games like this!!",
        "Great game! I think it's stupid that everyone is pitching fits because of ads. It takes time and money to develop these games so either buy it or quit bitching. But overall I enjoy the game, I find it relaxing and it allows for unlimited creativity. I would like more clothes, accessories  and make up added. One fun thing to add to the game would be hats. Thanks.",
        "There is one problem  problem one make everything free cause I can pick anything when I don't have enough money OK OK!   And also liked this game!  But just what I said make all the items free!"

        "This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!",
        "Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don't like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option",
        "Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it's good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can't take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren't recognised either. I'd enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.",

        "Amazing game. Me and my friend spend hours on it. I get to shows him my mods. He has none though we both have completed the levels. The game NEVER AND I REPEAT NEVER gets boring. Definitely better than the angry birds series must download. The only problome is the metal flap things don't work correctly. They just float in midair.Apart from that  Please make a new selection of levels. My life depends on it!!!!",
        "The game and level desgins promote and foster a great degree of creastive thinking. With very unique mechanics and obstacles that actually require thought and consideration when building. It has great art, along with many bonus levels and content. Fun game overall but level experiences do wildly vary sometimes. From simple to extremely  difficult, sometimes you win by mer luck and not strategy. Along with all that I don't know if anyone else experienced this but the levers on lvl6 were buggy and never worked. All in all good game to play.",
        "FIX THE ROAD TO EL PORKADO I swear this is frustrating to the point of unplayable. No, those levels ARE unplayable. They cannot be done with this platform glitch at all. Also, sometimes in sandbox mode when I click the tick it disappears when it hits the ground. Occasional and not as game breaking or frustrating as the moving platforms not working but still",
        "I don't  understand why people complain about ads and call Rovio money hungry. If may be a \"free\" game but really nothing is completely free. Developers deserve to get paid. It costs to have a game. Free games have ads just like TV. And you don't have to make the in-app purchase. GO buy a game.",
        "I would give it a higher rating, but on those levels like 6-18. The button activated doors and platforms don't work right and they glitch out. I've been able to get through a few levels without the doors but on 6-18 you can't complete the level without this door working. Please get this fixed",
        "Very disappointed that I've had no response to my email and that there is no sign of a fix to the bug with El Porkado, rendering the levels uncompletable. Wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have some of my actual money!"

        "Good I hope they fixed the bug where you double buy a car and it gives you the same car but still takes your money. But its still a great game. Ohh! And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.",
        "Good, but has some bugs I'm sorry if I'm being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall",
        "It's good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn't too much skill involved but it's a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I've lost countless games because it doesn't stop or doesn't back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!",
        "Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it's a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can't go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I'm out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!",
        "Shalom there, The game is awesome. I liked it very much and hoping that in the future they will be more cars to be added. I really hope that \"military helicopter\" can shoot something, it is funny...so idle. Last thing, a HOVERCRAFT can go \"river mode\" ! Wrecked... because of...water. Hope you'll add the \" police boats \" in next update. Overall, abundant of thanks and good luck.",
        "I LOVE THIS GAME. It just need's some work to do. Like, you guys need to fix the glitch of the lines by the road. And you need to fix when we explode the oil truck and fall on the ground and you disapear. And can u guys please add some new prizes like to change the color of ur car. And when I have 100 dollars u can spend it on colors  theirs a button to choose what prize you want. Like say I get the color blue for a red car. And I like the red car so I go to the prize machins and choose to buy a color than I have the button to change the color of ur car. That will make the game a lot better. And I'm sure when u do it there will be more downloads."

I want to stop deforestation and you need to , too! Hope this helped to put a stop to deforestation and to download this game  Bye😀",

If you like this, dont whine just pay the piper or play something else.  Develepers have to eat, ya know???  If you want a free alternative, (or if you are curious about how this stuff works) i suggest looking into the open processing language.  You can learn to make your own cool stuff like this by finding a couple of algorithms online   Also, if you have a good graphics card in your pc/mac and you are interested in this stuff  check out touch designer.  You can make some really amazing realtime art  But seriously, support these developers if you like the program.  Its that simple.  99 cents is not much money!!  Ok luvya byebye",

Then it plays loud ads.",

This completely ruins all the hard work I did getting my board state the way it was, and makes it impossible to recover. I'm playing up to the 16K range, and it has these issues usually after I've gotten the 4K blocks. 2/6/2018",

I would assume that they have been \"hacked\" somehow to display these fake scores.  The developer should cap the high score at the number that is literally the highest possible score (based on the size of the board)"

I like this game because you can do roleplay and I'm a girl and there is girl skins which is amazing but can you start with a girl skin and a boy skin to be fair with the girls  Pls do these. Love your company :-) but can you add a roleplay mode that would be great DO MORE:-) but now on my new tablet it won't let me play it please fix that and reply",
        "Good. However, the apple versioned platform overwhelms us by many advantages: They can earn coins and cash quicker n easier. They get options on what currency they use to purchase things. They get to higher leagues easier. Their weapon description overpasses ours as ours literally gives us damage and capacity whereas theirs comes with fire rate, trait etc.",
        "I love this game but I have a couple of requests 1st. Could you add u YouTuber skin back like boy,girl,animal then YouTuber 2nd. Could you add a button that you can press that alows you to make your own custom paint job for any vehicle that would be amazing 3rd. Can you make and road that ends come back into the city at the other side example the road behind the hospital 4th. Could add like 5 houses around the city that you can go into 5th. More vehicles   If you agree with what I have sead in this comment like so the developer can see!",
        "I love this game. But for the next update, u should give each skin there own special ability. Like the flash and hulk skins. Give the flash super speed, give hulk super strength and etc. So that everyone can get a different type of advantage. Plz make this happen next update also make a goku skin. So u can turn super saiyan. And have other transformation. So can u plz have every skin to have different abilities that match the skin",
        "I have been playing the game for 6 or 5 years and it has been the best game i have played. So, i  think you have to make this game better in the next update.Here r my suggestions 1 make the graphics better. 2 day and night shift. 3police attacks bandit in adventure mode.4 add a clan.  I hope u will add these in the next update.Also too many players that hacked their health so plz fix it.Thx",
        "This Game Is Awesome Ilove It Somuch I could Play it With My friends Keep It Up I think That You Should Add some New Weapons Like Lightsaber And You Should Make The People Drive Cars .Why  Peoples Does Not Drive Car?. Well But thats not good make the people drive thanks Keep It Up."

        "This is not another Clash of Clans clone, but definitely pushes the boundaries of the clan genre. Good graphics, fun gameplay, and balanced in terms of units vs. defences for your island. While diamonds can be purchased by real-world money, the game doesn't trap you into needing them. The weekly mini-game missions help keep things fresh and assist in moving your base up the tech tree if you're patient. SuperCell is continually expanding the game to keep it interesting. Definitely worth a download!",
        "Very addictive and always checking on my base, upgrades etc. Strategic game play, however too much pressure to buy diamonds as it takes FOREVER! !! for some things to upgrade. Seriously. ..2 days for an upgrade??? Only other issue is the limited time \"special abilities\"...they're fun but it makes it far too easy for someone to raid your base and take all resources needed to get the upgrades. Lots of fun and love the graphics",
        "I have played this game since it has come out and I have seen all of the changes and they have shaped that game for better over the years the game has been out it has improved and is one of my best games I have ever played. But the down side is that it is really hard to get resources at first but then before you know it you are full and you have nothing to do about it. Also when getting the heros they should make that base a bit easier because the lower level people can't attack till the have a lot better troops.",
        "Great game, but too slow. While I love the lack of pay to win, I'd wish for a way to speed up resource gathering: I've cleared out every similar level player in my area, and spend days waiting for RSS to build up so I can upgrade. Which is necessary before I can access a larger zone. No point buying speedup gems, as I've never anything to use them on!",
        "It's ok as a game but it gets boring. Also to get anywhere in the game takes a long time. I will be removing the app....Too long winded, can be boring and whatever defence you put up you still lose loads of resources if you know the tricks. Other games are much better and give more of a fair chance"

They have done many great things, but the support more on non existent except for those who put thousands into the game.  I've dropped about $600 and the ignore my mails, msging via messenger.  Fun game, support is AWFUL",

I'll give more stars when this issue is fixed... until then if you don't wanna lose your money die to crashes and glitches DO NOT INSTALL!   Update , I wish I could give negative Stars,  it is continuously CRASHING if my troops die due to FAILURE which is caused by the developers faulty upkeep this time, I'll quit and never play another game made by this company again!  SIMPLY FIX THE ISSUES ON YOUR GAME OR REDUND OUR MONEY, YA CROOKS!!!!!!😠😠😠😠😡",
        "Game was great. But now has to many glitches. Hopefully you don't have a problem because the support team is non existent. They never get back to you when you email them. I personally have list alot of troops because of glitches. 1 month ago I would have said download this game but I wouldn't now untill they fix the glitches.",

It does take a long time but to me that is part of it. It makes you slow down and enjoy simple fun. Too be honest all of us need to slow down and enjoy life around us. I play it on my breaks at work. The way you play this game allows for  short or long periods of play . Also it's quite fun seeing the little guy demolish tiles. It truly is an awesome game. I have recommended it to family and friends.",
        "I deleted all of my games except for Diggy's Adventure. This is my favorite game. I am going to play this game until me and Diggy win, and then I'm going to play it again from scratch. Google should make a whole lot of games like this. They are way better than match 3 puzzle games. I love cats I wish they could make a kitty's Adventures game like Diggy's Adventure.",

        "Was fun but now it constantly crashes and no response from support team. New update and game locks up and causes several other apps to crash and i can only fix it by shutting my phone off and then rebooting.",
        "So much fun! The puzzles are quite simple to figure out but not too easy and borning. It is great to play at break time and not too demanding on time. You can play without being bombarded without pop ups to buy things. Its a fun adventure and kind of tricky..........I gave it 5 stars!",
        "I accidentally turned on my Facebook while playing the game when I turn my Facebook back off every time I would go to the game the game will not let me play unless I go to my Facebook so I deleted the game and then reinstall the game now it does not go to Facebook anymore now I can play the game without worrying about being bothered by Facebook anymore. So I am back to Loving this Game..."

This gqme has been removed and i have reported it to the video standards board that apply ratings on these games. Not sure how these things are even possible?",

        "Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.",
        "There's always a bug when there's about to be substitution of players causing the players in possession of the ball to run like headless chicken. Pls fix that. Add SULLEY MUNTARI of Deportivo La Coruna to the game pls. 'Need FTS18 with embedded dream league soccer ffs! Seems many players who have their current teams in the game are missing. Lawrence Ati of Sochaux in Ligue 1, Joe Dodoo, and many more. A quick update with massive changes will be great 'cause the game currently sucks!!!",
        "Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don't get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a \"Create a Player\" option under 'My Club' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It'd be so nice if you add that.",
        "Look what I experienced. Dls needs development. The commentry needs more reasonableness and intelligence. The behaviour of each player, at least the famous ones should be unique. Controls need more improvement. Add real team logos for the opponent teams. Update players team data according to the recent transfers. And one more issue, while playing local multiplayer we need an extra device to connect two phones. This is a bad experience. If we can connect with each other simply by connecting wifi and hotspot of the two phones respectively, it would be great and simple.",
        "It is a brilliant game absolutely loved it. But it cud add something first can it have every player's data like if i bought neymar then can it in records give his number of goals, assists, appearances and second after every player's stats that his pitch map how many interception he did and etc not just motm bur every player",
        "I will love it if i can send players on loan and be paid some coins instead of directly selling them off. Also switching players for a few or no coins will be great. Since players like pogba likes changing his hairstyles, it will also be great to effect some changes in some players hairstyle. More leagues are needed, if possible, German,  Chinese, Nigerian and south African league. Lastly, commentators find it difficult to call the name of a created player, work on these and this game will be perfect.  Thanks"

        "I paid to remove ads, my SD card froze hours later so I had to redownload the game and start over. Restored purchases and got my 2x money back but I'm still forced to watch ads. Very unhappy with that and the fact that there is no cloud storage so I was forced to restart entire game. Fix this and give me back my no ads",
        "Tried playing, but you want permissions you don't need and the self advertising of your other products is complete garbage. Oh not to mention the buttons don't work correctly because of where you register the button pushes on a pixel 2. Also you don't respect the Android device flow, back keys should dismiss your stupid pop up ads not close the game",
        "Wow i worded the question horribly the first time around but easily enough understood im sure. Youre not going to make clear whether or not you can waste coins on turret upgrades despite them capping after a certain level. For this I've deducted stars across the board. Glad i didnt spend more money than i did.",
        "Having a lot of fun, but I'm wondering if the footage from your ads (having 10+ moons, 4 of the same turret, etc.) are true or not. So far I've got all the blues to level 20 and a couple reds to level 10, but the damage output seems to be weak. I'll keep upgrading though and see where it goes",
        "Can't disable or lower sound in game. Seems like such a basic mechanism to be missing. Overall feels incomplete, with an unbalanced economy based on advertisements with no real progression coming from play time. Decent concept, poorly executed."

This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can't without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.",
        "Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that's excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.",
        "Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?",
        "It would br better if you could exchange coins for diamonds, not just diamonds for coins. I also have a screen shot which shows that I should be the 1 place, yet another car which was behind me and crossed the line 1 sec later got the first place :/",
        "So many ad's, there back to back ad's. When I am finally able to select a race, guess what...another ad pops up and takes me to the play store to download it. I go back to the game and I gotta start all over again from the first screen. Ad's ad's ad's I was only able to play on the first day I downloaded it, after that..... Ad's ad's ad's                    \"AD'S!!!\".... But i did like the game when I played it",
        ",, xNice we can hack this game   How means we should have to do 1 racing and select the best car and you can't buy it  but you can get more money    How means we should have to click money button and click free money and you select how much you want...........  😎😎😎  But you should on WiFi and mobile data.....   Then how much you want select and click OK   That's all lol....    It will work...    Please like......"

I basically watch each time a purchase is made to see the stars before moving on.  Also agree the game was easier but now is much harder and takes longer to open treasure chest.",
        "Can't create your own tanks,  things just get placed there and you can't move them. The game itself is okay,  but if you take more than two seconds to find a move you want to do,  it starts flashing a move hint,  and not the best move either.  Nothing different to make this game stand out from most match three games.",
        "Only played until level 8. It's an okay game but you can't really decorate your reef. You buy items and they plop down but you can't move them, so they stay where they fell. Not impressed. Used to play Fishdom and it was SO much better. The graphics were better and you could really decorate your tanks by moving items to where you wanted them not where they plopped down. You could also rename your fish. This game is like expecting Oreos and getting generic, chocolate sandwich cookies. Just a cheap imitation. Uninstalling",
        "I would give it a 5 IF it had some instructions.  How do you choose a picture for the character frame?  I choose a house for my tank and it didn't show up.  I checked out all of the icons and couldn't find any help.  I really don't want to delete game but I would like some help, and I see that other players would too.  Thanks.",
        "The game is listed as Everyone, but it is likely up to age 10. Helping fish friends? No, even less than 10. Dont understand why the game occupies 123 Mb of space, that is over the average.",
        "Cute,fun ,but you can't even design your own tank. It would be a much better game if some things were changed in favor of your players. Please let us design our on tank.I"

Sure you get daily rewards and everything, but that still doesn't compare to the lack of coins you get. For example I recently reached lvl 11, and when I go into lobbies with people with high tier amor and weapons. I find It hard to get kills now. I really hope you guys can fix this in the further future",

Its more a little more calm battle than Pixel Gun because most things happen instanly in Pixel Gun but i have a few problems: If you built alot of things into your map it takes FOREVER to just load it up Next, Some gamemodes like deathmatch and Capture point isn,t popular.

The battleships and details are amazing and even better when you're in battle. To all future fleet commanders download and enjoy plus I've been playing this for over a year or so now and it still is my go to game. So if you're new to Rpg try this one. All hands to battle station's.",
        "Movga not answer requests, game very expensive if you want to play and on the top of this you could not trust developers  because you are charged for items you did not get,graphic effects your eyes  and if you're longer playing you could asleep. All the time game crashes and stalls, Samsung galaxy S7 was locked several times. Game is developed for crazy profit  and normally you should pay to have fun  otherwise some one will but not you.",
        "The game seems to go through faze's some times good some times just ok. If you only speak english it can be very taxing, not to friendly at times. Has a very clicky higher archery . If you fall out with them you can have wasted all the money you put into the game.",
        "Game would be better if was based on skills rather than how much money you can spend on it. They should remove prosperity as it is abused before legion battles or regional battles. The players with the deepest pockets win no skills required... I love the game but the model is wrong.",
        "Great game. Kills time and unfortunately my battery too. Would be good to have a facility to tell you your battery strength (may be next to the clock?). One of the better RPG I have played and updates aren't obtrusive.",
        "The translator needs fixing,  it's ok but could be a lot better,diamonds keep vanishing and there are other issues in game I don't like, it seems some legiins have preferential treatment regarding tasks and rewards. Other issues with the chat keyboard freezing or not working properly."

        "It's a nice game and cute character it's similar to talking Angela but I think it's better bc items are not expensive like in talking Angela ...the only prbm is the make-up section idk if it's closed or  it's reachable at a certain level.",

        "Greetings Making Fun,  Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love this game. It's entertaining, challenging and addictive. The storyline is engrossing and the graphics are spectacular as well. You can easily tell how addictive a game is by the amount of time you spend playing it at a stretch. Let me just say that I've been playing this game ever since I installed it. Whenever I sit down with my device, I start playing it and I keep on playing for at least two hours before I divert my attention to other matters. It's a really lovely and delightful game. Making Fun seems like the most suitable title of the developers because they've made something that is really a lot of fun. Well done. I highly recommend this game. DOWNLOAD IT TODAY.",
        "Awesome game. Good graphics, great sound and music, intricate leveling up system and character build, easy controls, variety in enemies, lots of replay value, lots of gear to find, and doesn't take much data space. Reminds me of a Diablo type game. The developer's really do deserve a lot of praise for creating such a quality game and not making it a p2w. This is an example of doing it right. I can tell that a lot of thought and care was put into it. Absolutely brilliant. I can't praise enough. A rare gem on the play store, and completely free. Just awesome. 6 out of 5 rating. Thank you so much for such a great game.:) Edit: Thanks for the update. You guys rock.",
        "Good looking game plays very smoothly. Fun to play and not too hard or too easy. Nice little details like the way your hero talks and has other party members. These things help make the single player game seem less lonely. I don't know if I am going to hit a pay wall or loose interest. The story is engaging enough. I just don't give out 5 star reviews.",
        "tap to,act design makesit a little  to easy though. Literally haven't died yet and im on evel 15. And the level by level format isn't great. Would love an open world feature. Ability to use a Bluetooth game controller would be a plus too. BUT..... For a phone game its pretty good. Definitely very fast paced.",
        "The gameplay is the best ive seen for an android RPG Diablo type game. Slick graphics, awesome sound track and effects, no slowdown and you can play offline!! Absolutely love the game. Only down side is the worry of repetitivness of the game but i guess only time will tell",
        "Incredible game. Very intuitive and unique with the swipe to cast system. The graphics are quite nice and the amount of memory the game uses is very acceptable for the quality you get. Music is very relaxing and well done. Level and NPC design are great, really feel like I'm playing an old school medieval RPG. Absolutely 0 need to buy gems, the game gives them to you for just killing normal monsters. My only gripe would be to maybe add a fourth class? If not more in future updates. Otherwise, fantastic game, well put together, well written story, great opening scene and whoever did that voice over should be looking to do more! Thank you for making a true RPG for true RPG fans, keep it up!"

    "description" : "Eternium is an amazingly fun and beautifully crafted Action RPG, reminiscent of the great classics.Eternium stands out from other mobile Action RPGs by its effortless “tap to move” and innovative “swipe to cast” controls, and its player-friendly “no paywalls, never pay to win” philosophy.With the exception of a couple of online-only features, the game can also be played offline after the content download completes.Drawing signs to cast spells is easy and rewarding. The tap-to-move control is more natural and relaxing than thumbsticks, and it’s also truer to the vintage point-and-click Action RPG experience.The game can be really played for free, as more than 90% of our players do. Purchases are completely optional. Gems, the game’s main currency, can be collected from enemies and quests. There is no limiting stamina or energy. The best things in the game are obtained by playing, not paying.Eternium has been launched in 2014, and is actively being improved by the original development team. Through years of polishing, and feedback from millions of players, the quality of the game has steadily increased, making it now one of the highest rated games on all app stores.As of fall 2017, major new features are in advanced stages of development, including real-time multiplayer, town portal, and a fourth world.Enjoy the visceral satisfaction of responsive, fast-paced combat, with spectacular special effects, pleasing sounds, rewarding damage numbers, all set against immersive backdrops and atmospheric, inspiring music scores.Play as a Mage, Warrior or Bounty Hunter, wielding a sword, axe, staff or gun. Level up to learn new abilities and increase your attributes.Battle skeletons, zombies, automatons, aliens, demons, dragons and many other creatures, across three beautifully hand-crafted worlds, or in endless generated levels.Venture into dark caves and dungeons, explore forests, villages and graveyards, lay siege to demon controlled castles, brave snowy mountain peaks, travel to the moon to slay strange creatures among craters and canyons, and beyond, to the deserts, pyramids and jungles of the red planet.Open treasure chests to loot gold, gemstones and battle gear. Equip shiny breastplates, menacing helmets and hoods, spiked shoulder pads, mysterious cloaks or capes. Protect yourself with a shield, or choose to wield two weapons as a warrior.Rescue your tank, healer and ranger companions who will join you in battle. Use their abilities together with yours to create rewarding and powerful tactical combos.Experience a refreshing storyline, filled with interplanetary intrigue and seasoned with funny characters. Hunt your arch-enemy, Ragadam, across the worlds, while trying to uncover and undo his twisted plans.Progress from common to rare, epic and legendary gear. Find gemstones that fit in your armor’s sockets. Craft socketed rings and amulets, and fuse three of them into a higher quality one.Unleash awesome offensive abilities, such as Whirlwind, Shockwave, Arc Lightning or Blizzard, control the enemy crowd with Frost Nova, Vortex, Silence, or sneak and assassinate with Smokescreen, Traps and Snipe.Each hero class has access to about 20 abilities (skills or spells), and each of your three companions has four more.

        "Awesome game! Love the art, love the music, love the style, and the gameplay is actually challenging enough to hold my attention but not enough to be irritating. Perfect difficulty. Not to mention the colorblind mode actually works. I know this is receiving a lot of criticism, but I love the option you guys gave with ads and how well you executed it, that was a very nice touch. You really outdid yourselves with this one!",
        "This title should be moved in the puzzle category in my opinion! Charming story with beautiful low-polygon graphics... Etc! Nevertheless, the game is very short to complete... If, you are not interested in completing the game achievements! There are not enough worlds and levels (right now) and I expect new ones in future updates... Eh! I would certainly convince more mobile gamers to purchase the full game (with unlimited lives and no ads) at 3.99$ CDN. Regardless, I purchased the full version of this game to support one of my favourite Canadian gaming app developer on the Google Play store... 👍😉",
        "A very decent small game. I don't know what other people are complaining about but you can play the game without paying. The music is nice the graphics is nice it's easy to play. I hope there more levels in the future as this is such a fun game. Very nice one from the team at noodlecake Studios. Kudos my n*****",
        "Amazing...simple and superb theme... The music the game play and the concept everything different  from usual boring games .......I give 100/100.......the team who made this game having a  good potential to bring something new..I excepting more games from this crew..best of luck and all my wishes to gys",

        "This game is a lot of fun get to customize some great cars . A lot of my favorites and i was surprised to see some cool muscle cars . Very unique collection of cars. This is actually better than their console games. Well recent carbon and most wanted are amazing. The newest are hot garbage. This one is fun.reallywish there was free roam or a sand box room where you can admire and test drive  what you have grinded out so many hours to get. Only bad thing. Also the boxes are too expensive leaving having to grind way too much just for absolutely anything. By the time you get anything good this game servers will be empty.",
        "Thank you for making this awesome game, I love it! I've not had this much fun playing a Need For Speed game in years.. Update 2.9.1 is fantastic. Although after updating, I'm having trouble connecting to the game servers... :/ Hope it gets sorted soon! nevertheless, I look forward to future updates. ;)",
        "Pretty good this is the best racing game that i have played in 2 and a half years Assult 8 Aborne would have probably been better but 4 freaking GB'S THAT'S A RIP OFF YAY I AM TALKING TO YOU ASSULT 8 AIRBORNE.",
        "Great game. But like the guy below  me said it sucks that if you really want to keep progressing you have to spend money...just about to delete it if this update doesn't give me a reason to keep playing",
        "Really fun game. Races are short but that's good because there's a ton to do. There are a few issues though. AI has the advantage every time you bump into each other. They'll wreck you and act like nothing happened to them. Physics doesn't apply to them. Cops only tar Iget the player and can never be wrecked. I've actually used nitro to go from 180 to 220 and the cop stayed with me, uh how? There are also a few areas in the race where your car will slightly turn without your input possibly killing your drift by hitting a wall. Overall though fun to play.",
        "I honestly was surprised . This game is a lot of fun. I was thinking the graphics were gonna suck and there would be a crapy story line , I was wrong graphics are great and the story line is even better."

        "This game is great! Though there are things I would change about the new race mode and some things in arcade mode. For example, instead of having to pay a dollar USD to cut the rope tire, why not pay a thousand coins to get rid of it for the next 5 or 10 times it needs to show up, and have us pay the dollar to get rid of it for good. And in arcade, if you accidentally missed your reward,why not have it double the next reward rather then keep the amount the same all the time, otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing besides those two things, I love it ^^",
        "The climbing game is the only thing I hate, it's such BS. My knife will slide and hit a branch after it went into the wood. That's not supposed to happen. But overall great game.",
        "Not perfect but it's really good, hate the tires though, not willing to pay any amount of money to remove them. It would be better if after 1-5 thousand score on race, the tire would be removed or maybe throw a knife 10 times through the tire and it would be gone. Kinda silly to pay to  remove something that would make for much better gameplay if the player could play the game and earn it gone. (Mostly doing this for the 500 coins but this is an honest review)",
        "Great visuals, smooth physics, and addicting Gameplay. Great game, my only thing I'd change would be the end-game knives, past 10k all the knives kinda suck, and have awful 'flipability', making it pointless to save up for anything above 10-15k. If you added a better variety of knives into the game this would be a 5 star.",
        "Its a good game. It can be frustrating though at times when the knife lands perfect but it doesnt count it. And at times the flip and fall are not accurate. But overall i really good game",
        "You can thank Rusty Cage on YouTube. Also it shuts off ever few minutes and I don't know why"

        "Removed ads but now during the game, collecting power ups doesn't actually give me a power up where as my rivals do and they all get ahead with their attacks. Needs to be seriously fixed.  Not fixed. Jus getting annoying now",
        "My game crashed like 4 matches in. It just happened once to me, but online gaming that crashes in a game like this can be a real kill joy. Overall I think it's a great game and I enjoy playing. Obviously, we can all do without the crashes.",
        "One of the few titles that gives me hope for the mobile gaming sector & perfectly suitable for minors as well! Between all the classics (for example Golden Axe) and this game, Sega made a great appearance in mobile gaming. If they keep launching highlights like this, they will soon be light-years ahead of other mobile game designers. Animations and graphics are extraordinary fluent and good (application is only about 360 megs big; I have seen gigabyte size applications with lower graphics quality). The controls and on-screen buttons work well with almost no delay. In the lower tiers there are not many different tracks available yet, but those I unlocked are well designed, taking a few minutes for a single run. Some obstacles are a bit hard to distinguish at first, and it would be helpful to have a database where you could look up track obstacles & traps (skills) with a picture and a short description. No matter if you play a single race for a few minutes or keep going a while the game is nicely motivating, and it seems as if there were other modes to come in the future as well. Races can turn almost within every second, some of the nasty traps, will make you curse other contesters now and then, but in most cases I did not have the feeling that there were many unfair pay2win advantages we all know only too well from many mobile games (allthough it is quite strange that winning against opponents with more trophies happens rarely and feels as if players with more trophies received more suitable items/protection to have an easier time and don't loose! Also some races feel \"stranger\" than others, especially when the google play service delays or disrupts connection/device performance during race set-up!!! Similiar google play service disruptions made me loose to possebility to double 1st rank rewards mysteriously often!!!). If you are looking for a cute & fast arcade style game and have those 360 megabytes of space available, I can highly recommend to give this one a try!!",
        "WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT I WAS ABOUT TO WIN A RACE UNTIL MY SCREEN TURNED INTO POWERUPS AND THEN KICKED ME OUT OF MY GAME...WHAT THE HELL",
        "Wish it did not always have to b on WiFi to play",
        "Quite an amazing game. The graphics the pretty stellars. I would highly suggest it. :3"

For instance i saw a Scar laying down on the gorund in Military base and when i tried to pick it up it said \"item doesn't exist\". Fix this please, otherwise, a decent game.",
        "Controls are terrible. When aiming directly at a player between the crosshairs. Bullets still miss. Terrible game if you're reading this go download rules of survival. That's what I did. Also sometimes during the middle of a game a loading icon will appear. You won't be able to move or shoot your weapon. You'll pretty much die",
        "I love this game free fire and this game are my favorite mobile games so far but there should be some changes like you should be able to aim with an iron sight. And the aiming could be better and what I mean by that is aiming is already hard on mobile so I just think stability should be really good without any attachments or like the aiming system on free fire battleground. The graphics are not the best I've seen really just up the graphics a bit and add the ability to aim with a iron sight. Other than those things I love how exciting the game is as well as how close it is to pubg.",

        "Good game, but $3.79 a month to remove ads? Most games have a one time payment to remove ads and it's usually less than that. Only $13 a month for World of Warcraft. There's SLIGHTLY better value for your dollar there.",

That would be SO cool. If you add that, I will love this game 100 times more!!! :D keep it up devs! Love this game!!!!",

        "It's a good cover-based shooter, with some pretty creative characters and a good pace for quick battles. The unlock system is more than fair, with the ability to save currencies for that one big purchase. I enjoy the ability to play at my own pace without sacrificing my life to the game (cough*Kabam*cough) and I'm having a lot of fun. I've noticed that PVP tends to favor Savage, when he activates Spray and Pray once, half the opposing team dies. Twice, and the round is over. Otherwise a very well done and enjoyable game.",
        "Fun but not a fan of all the nickel and dimes approach.  Parts are way to expensive.  Also chests are very pricey as well. I think that players should level and unlock new skills without having to pay money.  Aside from the micro transactions the can ntrols are smooth. Its like having a mobile gears of war. actions are her gameplay this s great duck and cover fun.",
        "This is a fun game and really good Gears clone. The only thing is your level counts in PVP, with buying buffs makes a difference, not skill. It's very pay to win and paying should have been for cosmetics. Thus why I gave them 4 stars. Still a fun game, but don't do the PVP without spending a lot",
        "You can have fun without spending a dime. That being said, that's the kind of game I wouldn't mind giving a bit of money in the future, because of the developers' creativity and work put into the game. Yes, it does become grindy after a while, but the solid gameplay and high amount of content available offline make up for it.",
        "Awesome game absolutely loving it. Keep the daily events coming - without them there wouldn't be enough incentive to play every day and there wouldn't be enough stamina. My main recommendation is consider introducing upgrading equipment e.g. 10 bronze fuel cells give you 1 silver fuel cell. Also consider lowering the cost of stamina refill to say maybe 20 gold. Cheers",
        "I really enjoy the action this game brings along with good looks and simple controls. Too many times development teams get caught up in the visuals or complex control schemes and forget about what gamers really love and that's not having a complex control panel with nice smooth transition from level to level. Thank you for making this game a joy to play every time I turn it on."

        "I like this new update. Hanks now have His own happy meter like Tom and Angela. Nice. Also this is just my suggestion. Can you guys also make My Talking Ben and My Talking Ginger. Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that's it. You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It's not fair. Lastly good job guys.",

I also did like that u got stickers for taking pics. I did end up having to uninstall the game as it took up to much storage space D: Overall I did really enjoy the game yay =D",

        "Overall, the game is pretty cool. But, I feel much more can be added though. Great game. Just more needs to be added. It's a great app I wish the devs could make like, Sandbox modes where you can build your own... Em... Coasters? I dunno. You had to verify them first. Annnd in order to verify them you had to complete them yourself. Then you could publish them. And maybe a two player mode? Not sure how that's gonna work out. That's all that could be added. Most of all. 3 and a half out of 5 stars.",
        "The only way to play online is Facebook and Google play! First, you can make a 3rd option for an in-game name, like in Clash Of Clans,  and make the Google play account optional if you don't want to download Google play (not meaning that Google play is bad). Many people can not even think of any name that is not already taken in Google play (including me). It still is a good game,just it needs some more work.",
        "Don't get me wrong, it's amazing and seems to be fun, but there's one thing that ruins it all. Whenever I open the game, everything shifts to the right quite a bit, so I can't see about one fifth of the screen, which doesn't allow me to use the button control setup, and some other things. Would love to see this get fixed, as the game has some nice potential.",
        "Love this game for the cool clip art graphics with all the chaos. Relly funny when they crash. Lol i just dont like the constant ads gou have to watcg when ever you have to open a prize chest and when you win. I mean you win and then you gotta watch a clip for 30 secs, then it feels like you lose. Lol",
        "As much as I want to love this game, its also quite cheap. Every single race, the same \"real\" players are always there regardless of time of day. They follow the same route and incredibly make no mistakes at all! Meanwhile, I'm getting stuck on every edge, my wheel gets stuck in the ground and every single gate smashes only me. Amazing!! Its a super fun game but don't think for a second that it plays fair.",
        "Its a fun game where you actually get rewarded for watching ads. Multiplayer is a little laggy but its a fun game over all. Only thing i would like to see is the aftermath after your character either dies or falls out of the vehicle (level automatically resets after about a second after you die). Maybe even move around like you can in happy wheels, even if its just in single player mode. But overall a good game."

You can use it while travelling,working.. simply earning points by watching advertisements,videos!",
        "Not the master. But I had got with the achievement \"thaught the teacher\". After defeating hermit now I am used to magic. Only in few minutes I can earn money and upgrade\u200b my gear. Such a wonderful game it is. Even if the meter hangs to impossible I can beat the competitors. Very nice game used to play it often. At lesiure time I think spending\u200b in it is the best. As you can earn  daimonds  by just watching the ads.",
        "Great game, my only problem is that it took a long time grinding for the money you need to buy items. It took me about 5 hours of grinding just to upgrade each weapon/armor, 6 hours to buy new ones. Still a great game, loved the way it's in shadows, making it harder to tell who you are.",
        "I love this game. I've never been good at fighting games like Tekken or soul Calibur but this game is a very simple take on the genre. I love how very martial arts based this game is and the hit boxes on the characters are quite accurate and simple to understand as well as the moves. Being a martial artsist my self this game has given me an outlet to mentally practice distance management, fake outs and strategy as well as practicing to be like water. The famous Bruce Lee saying. Love this game. Also the rank up system and the grinding isn't too over bearing or tedious and makes it fun through and through.",
        "Game is awesome. But for past 2 days whenever i open the game, it closes after intro showing that unfortunately SF 2 has stopped. Pls do something as i dont want to uninstall it. Also I hv sent feedbacks 2 to 3 times but no reply or fixation. Do something about it.",
        "Let me just say I don't mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high"

        "Really fun.  But crashes constantly on my Galaxy S5.  Then I have to force stop the app, and restart my phone to get it working, for about 5 minutes....  All have to do to avoid ads is not restart until the respawn timer clears, so they aren't that bad, and it's really cheap to turn the ads off.  I would happily do so, it the app would run for more than 5 minutes.  If it wasn't for the crashing, I would rate it 4 stars at least.",
        "Love playing this game...very addictive! I would rate it 5* if there was a reason for why you level up and why you keep spinning for little lightening bolts when you do level up  as once you have bought the small amount on offer they are no longer needed. Add more things to buy and give the game a reason for levelling up 🤘🏼",
        "Smooth game. Plenty of fire ball options and endless level options but after every death you have to watch  15 second ad. EVERY DEATH. Which just spoils the experience and all. I understand ads but like after 3 deaths that's fine. But after every death and some are unskippable. So download of you have patience. It's worth it of you have time to spend",
        "One of the most glitchy apps. The ads don't bother me, if you hate the ads so much pay the money to get rid of them. But this game constantly crashes and freezes. And half the time you will click to change your ball or rings and it won't load or do anything. This game is full of glitches. Would be an amazing game if this was attended to",
        "A wonderful aesthetically pleasing game.  Get as far as you can, with as many points as you can while unlocking different fireballs and portals. I would love to see how this game evolves in the future and i have not seen as many ad's as people claim so perhaps that issue has been resolved? Working perfectly on S8+",
        "Overall, the game's alright... except for the constant crashing and ads. Thankfully, ads only seem to happen when you press the restart button before the revival timer runs out, so that's a nice loophole. My only real problem is it crashing on my S5 every few minutes. Fix that and i'll give this a 4-star."

No matter how many times I click it while the red dot is still on the brain. If I press it 10 times then the screen that tells me I've failed comes up 10 times. Driving me insane.",

        "Some glitch happened last time i opened this game, suddenly the game reset my progress. After closing the game and remove it from ram cache and restart it again the game run normal. The graphic is good, but the gameplay is so-so.  The \"artificial\" rarity is the thing i hate, the higher your level there is more kind of resource available, when you need some of the resource suddenly the minigame that award that resource is so rare",
        "Produce gold, get storage full, can't do anything with it. Look around play same kind of mini games to get more gold. Look around more, find/achieve some parts to make upgrades finally. Well, whole point is produce gold but you don't use them much often so they are just waiting to collect. Very pointless game.",

        "Awsome, this game reminds me of the TV series Gold Rush, it wood be really cool if you could mine by yourself in 1st person and drive different machinery, i really like this game a lot because it has all the potential stuff of a mine and to put all this in a game, it is awsome to play and also really fun.

Update few days later...   Suddenly the game keeps crashing randomly...   Tried it for days....   Can hardly survive a single level now...    Very sad....   The game itself is still excellent....   Maybe a later update brings a fix..................",
        "Fun game, my daughter enjoys playing. ..easy, yet challenging at the same time.  One irritating issue...every time there's an update, or just opening the app, turns on the game's notifications..and have to turn it off constantly. ..otherwise it would be a rare 5 star rating from me.",
        "This is by far one of the best games I have played like this all year. Very addicting, easy, but challenging enough to keep you wanting to come back play some more. Haven't found something I don't like about this game just yet😁",
        "The game isn't letting go of the balls. When I let it go, it switches to the other available ball. I may spend 10 minutes trying to shoot a ball. Very annoying & irritating, but I like everything else!",
        "Like with all other games this game is rigged, once you get to a certain level you are set up to fail unless you buy coins. I don't play games so I can go broke on coins, I don't like this.",
        "PLEASE HELP - game keeps freezing on level 137 no matter how many time I try or restart. I was hoping update would fix it but still doesnt work. Thanks!"

        "Pretty good. It's just like an older version of Pocket Edition. But some \"Minecraft Games\" try to go for originality. This is too similar to the original. The textures are just from another existing Minecraft pack. The only original thing I've noticed is the music. Update wise, i'd suggest adding redstone capabilities or something. Overall, if you're looking for \"free Minecraft\", i'd highly suggest downloading this.",
