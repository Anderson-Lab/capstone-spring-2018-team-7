        "Bright, colorful, addictive game play. Adorably happy graphics. Love \"Mr. Encouragement\", who exclaims \"sweet!\", & \"delicious!\" in his baritone voice. The music isn't my favorite, I find it somewhat creepy. Greatful for the music mute button.  Thank you Development Crew for a fantastic, free app which I have been playing for years! One suggestion: make it clear $3 gets you one-time access to your piggy bank only. ThanksüòÑ",
        "good way to teach us to be patient should we prefer to play freely.   Occasionally error.  KING, to make this game more enjoyable, .wld you pls kindly give us PIGGY BANK freely so we can still collect and use our gold? .pls give brief explanation on new things we're abt to encounter, e.g: HOW TO PLAY, the use of NEW THINGS.  thanks KING, jia you",
        "I just completed all 3185 rounds... took nearly 2 years to do so. A couple of suggestions...  1. Some big reward must be given to the one who completes all the rounds... an uphill task. 2. All these years I played the spin wheel every day ... but not even once the jackpot was opened... it simply shows the malintentions of the programmers who programmed it as such. 3. Boosters must be given more often.",
        "I love this game but level 3166 is impossible! Once you take out one licorice another drops....you need to rethink that level, because it's a level that will make people stop playing.... doesn't matter what boosters you use the licorice keeps dropping and you can NEVER clear all the jelly!",
        "entertains well. but plz try to improve the swiping feature ncz when we want to play the first or second episode ,have to swipe all over down n got fed up with that, its taking too much time to do so. its really urgent to improve that thing.",
        "Very disappointed in this app over the last several months.  Every time I go into app to play game I get kicked out.  It is not always immediate which is very frustrating because I will loose lives etc UN-necessarily."

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pok√©mon and I intend to play Pok√©mon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "It runs quite smooth and gives me an extra reason to get out and exercise. My only beaf now is that it is impossible to acquire any of the legendaries. If you live in a small rural town you will never have the numbers to take on anything beyond 3 star in raids. Everything else is awesome though.",
        "I am currently on vacation and this app has given me more points of interest than using Google Maps alone!!  Every single pokestop is something interesting...  I don't know why I didn't think to use it for this sooner.  I've seen more in this city today than I have the 3 days I've been here!"

Wasted 3 years of time and data on this worthless app.... recommend not installing or uninstalling it... customer service sucks",
        "Ive played this game a long time. New update and instead of making the game better you screw your customers. I lost all my boosters and you expect me to continue? If nothing else its a matter of principle. You punish me by taking everything ive bought and earned, ill punish you by never giving you another dime and i will let everyone i know who plays or asks about any of your games ro stay away.",
        "So frustrated with all the candy crush games. I periodically get angry enough to quit for awhile,  but end up back. Why am I upset? I was just in the middle of a rare winning streak and had earned a number of special candies to start games with. I was up to 2 hour on the fish, multi color candy, and the juicy jawbreaker, with 3 hours of life. Suddenly,  i still had the life but all other rewards disappeared. This is far from the first time. I am tired of it. I am removing the king games and I am not coming back this time. I get glitches happen but I have never had any  Indication  that anyone gives a damn. No one makes anything right or even says,  sorry. I'm ok with a game having issues but I am not ok with being treated less than.",
        "In places with bad connection the facebook popup bug is also annoying and causes you to have to restart, losing lives and the streak. And having to click different buttons to confirm to end a game is stupid design.",
        "Would love to give a better rating, but after the most recent update the game has very bad lag, worse than the usual lag it's always had. Updating this. Was hoping update today would fix the lag. It didn't. Also, adding 2 extra steps in order to replay a stage sucks. You know the old saying; if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
        "EDIT: Update on 3/22/18 fixed NOTHING! New levels still locked as well! Worst update in candy crush history. Riddled with bugs. It didn't add new levels like it should have. Unlimited boosters don't appear on level when they should. And boosters are no longer allowed on lower levels. I'm at level 2100 something. I should be able to use boosters when ever I want! And I should be able to have unlimited boosters appear on all levels, not just when they feel like it. Fix and I will give more stars."

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "It's a good time passer.  Beware of guild system, it has major flaws. If a guild leader doesn't log on in a while, The guild gets given to another.  When it happened to me it picked the newest, least trusted official, rather than the one who had been there since day 1 or one of the two who actually donate resources to the guild. So we easily lost months of work.",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "There is certainly alot to do, but is there really much to DO do? I've just been continually tapping red dots and getting free prizes, which (although nice) doesn't feel like I'm especially earning anything, you know?  Feels like a game that will keep you occupied for maybe months, but a year after you delete it will you really REMEMBER it? Probably not.",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend."

        "Great fun game. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because you go through your money pretty quick buying boosts to win levels to then upgrade your garden. I like the game a lot. Also I think that at the end of your board if you have undetonated items they should detonate at the end of that level. I've lost too many levels because of not getting one item that was next to something that was undetonated.",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "Much has improved since my original review (see below). There are special events going on quite often to help with earning coins and powerups, and the levels don't seem to be as tedious. Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

        "Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I'll be playing this for a long time! I'm working on the living room right now, getting close to level 800! Thank you Playrix!",
        "Its a mind blowing game i cant help but to play this game my day seems not complete if i cant play the game specially when i cant pass the next level and the hardest part is the hard level the time are very fast when i am playing.i really love it and the freebies i can get everyday to boost my game.thank you creators and the makers the graphics and the animation is very realistic.",
        "This is really exciting BUT the levels get way too hard!!! I want a game that you don't have to replay a level more than a couple times! That's when I stop playing. It's a game...it's supposed to be fun not rocket science!! It should relax you but when you're played a level 6 or 7 times and you get down to needing1move to win... yet again... you get stressed!! And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun! I like a challenge but this is ridiculous!!!",
        "Just gave it 2 stars from 3 stars, everytime i use the kite booster it doesn't work and wastes it by flying away. Continued is my previous feedback. Love the game but it is ridiculous how we need stars to start a new day etc. It is difficult to get stars anyway. The lives go out fast because levels are hard. It take 900 coins just for 5 extra turns to finish the level but you get 45 or 50 coins only per level. You need to change this. Make it on the same level, give us atleast 1000 coins per level and let the level have enough stars per task rather than 1 star per level and requirement is 2 stars per task. Something to look into.",
        "Game is awesome... sometimes it takes days to get past one level which is dumb.... wish I could move ahead in the game faster... would make it more enjoyable.",
        "Getting green pieces gets extremely redundant. After 30 levels it's still the goal. Levels are near impossible unless you get lucky and things line up perfectly."

IGG only wants pay to play players with the upgrades and fixes they have put in this game. The game is fun and would have more people keep playing but once you play for a while and see it takes an ungodly amount of time to do anything in this game people quit. IGG really needs to look at this an make the game more enjoyable for all!",
        "Love this game some people p2p but you dont have to. To level up does not take long and its easy step by step. Also if you you run into events you are not sure of how to do most pros help out . I also love the fact you can send items you need to other like food.",
        "This is a pretty fun game as long as you don't care that IGG doesn't care. I've enjoyed the people I've met (And they're really the only reason I keep playing).  Unless you spend an ungodly amount of money it takes forever to be able to participate with the big guys (and theres ALOT of them. ) Plus there are many glitches that IGG won't ever own up to or reimburse you for. Itsnlike a vending machine play, and pay money at your own risk cuz if you lose, man you REALLY lose.",
        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "This game needs balance. Seems like all one does is hide behind shields and gather resources and hope higher might players harvest you for your resources. There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players",
        "Pretty good. 4 stars because I never liked the time it takes to do stuff. I know it is profit making, but I gave 4 stars because it is manageable and they do have lots of free instant completes. This is waaaaaaaaaaay better than clash of clans... JS."

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I absolutely adore this app for it's witty, adorable characters and simple yet infinite concepts. I'm addicted! I have one issue, though. The limits on the barn and silo, frankly suck. I have eleven duct tapes but no screws so I had to pay diamonds I didn't want to spend so I could have a little flexiblility! Please fix this.",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Love this game. My mom and I play it 24/7. It's addicting. Annnd it's a great time killer. Just like everyone else there are things that I would suggest to improve the game. Like for example the time frame for waiting on items. Crazyyyy long. Like the fish nets are like 14hrs! Could drop all the high times to half. That would be cool. But of course if you guys did that then it would be super easy to level up. And you guys would loose out on money cause there are some impatience people out there that just go ahead and buy diamonds and such. Anywho. Love the game. Please consider some of these people's suggestions. Thank you. #HayDayFan"

Curious to see if they manage to respond properly this time",
        "I have been playing this for 1.5 years. I love everything about this game. They always have fun events - usually 2-3 events occur at the same time. You can play them all or pick the ones you like best. As a f2p the game presents many opportunities to acquire in game money (especially during the events) - hoard it for energy refreshes. You'll find yourself in very few dry spells needing in game money and energy.",
        "I love this game! I play at every opportunity I get. Thanks for helping me set up the game on my tablet. I have however, run into another issue I hope you can help me resolve. I have a three star awakened dark pixie, when I tried to evolved her into a three star I tried to use other pixies and they only leveled up her skills, so I used two other monsters to evolve her. This happened again when I tried to evolve her into a four star. Please help!",
        "If your into gathering  monsters to strengthen and fight aswell as evolve then this game is for you. It's very fair and rewarding depending on your efforts. Further expansions for this would see the current fans gain more pleasure out of it and it's already a great game. Liking they added 2 new monsters but seeing that as a regular thing and still keeping current top summons valid would be incredible. Speedy gameplay and no issues for me. Username : violentmaw",
        "Been playing this game for years. Really enjoyed for the first few years. But while years of time past, the rune drop rate and 5* monster summoning rate still remained very low. Its very sad and depressing. Now i just login to settle my guild wars then log off.",
        "Been playing this game every day and it's extremely addicting. Gameplay and graphics are wonderful, support is great, etc. However, it seems to have really become a pay to win game. You'd think that with all the mystical scrolls, summoning stones, attribute scrolls and crystal summonings I've been summoning, I'd at least get a natural 4 star character but i can't even get that. I get garbage every single time. Its frustrating when you put so much time into the game and get nothing in return."

        "I am playing this game in a long time. but i have found some issue.. many time i am not get shield & someone attacked my village. How to upgrade my village. Pls tell me Moon active team & also upgrade spin 50 to 60 & also redused village manufacturar cost... Thank You.",
        "Game was running successfully but now game has stopped working in my phone all of a sudden, I have uninstalled the game and again installed but not working. My mobile handset is Motorola g5 plus and android version 7. Please help me out to resolve the issue asap.",
        "I actually liked this game but recently very glitchy/buggy. I get attacked by the same person twice within less than a min of each, same with raids. I earn for attack/raid master and the counter doesn't update. Freezes in the middle of spins. Don't earn coins for watching videos sometimes. This is even after the most recent update",
        "its a nice game, but please rate the places lil bit low, it's hard to earn money, and when we save it for a place to buy, a raid takes place... increase the spin no. also atleast from 50 tp 60... it was fun at first.. but due to all this it's becoming boring.",
        "I'm honestly speechless at how simplistic this game is, but it so fun! It's so simple to play, everything about this game is just AWESOME! It's super addicting, a great time killer, eveeything is just great about this. I don't usually rate games but this one made me rate it, keep up the good work!"

For example i just been upgraded to th10, i dont have infernos , i dont have 3rd xbow and im getting maxed out th11 bases to raid in crystal league. Similarly maxed th11 players are raiding my base sucking all my loots with all maxed troops , lvl 50 king/queen and lvl 20 warden...This is because i dont invest money in this game.",

After Builder Hall 8 update whenever I click by boat to go Builder Base the game shuts. I am not able to upgrade my Builder hall. SUPERCELL you are super we know plz fix this issue and let me know. Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "HI SUPERCELL . some players ruined the clan because of Clan Games. Why? They will join ur clan and check if we already achieve the reward like book. They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",
        "Super game my favourite game really nice guys download it .I have A small request if we have got any bonus in war or Multiple battles it automatically goes in Clan Castle ,and when we want withdraw it give whole treasure comes out. So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.",
        "A nice game. I will always be in search of games. My Friend recommend that this is nice game. I installed it. He said that join in my clan. I joined in his clan. Now I am playing this game wonderfully. Thank you super cell and coc. But only the problem is maintainance of server.  It says try again later.  That's why I have rated it 4‚òÖ.

Makes us feel like it's only about the money... it should be fun and enjoyable but that's hard when everything takes so much and so long.... Make the money worth spending.",
        "This game has been glitching for the past 20 hours. can't log in. have reinstalled multiple tjmes. my army will probably have been wiped out by someone who has spent 120,000 dollars on his account (yes there are people who have spent that amount and that's what you're up against) glitch laden game. admins don't give a damn. I will get a standard response to this... if any. Don't download. don't play. don't waste your time and money.",
        "It's a good game but the issue is that much higher level players can attack you regularly. And this sets you back on your development. Level 5 players should not be being attacked by level 20 players. You rebuild an army using resources needed to grow only to have a higher level player destroy it again and again before you can even rebuild completely. My army took a day to rebuild and before I could yluse it it was destroyed again. And more resources are wasted. It is a distressing pattern that has put me off the game.",
        "I love how the game is. Our kingdom 489 have the peace treaty. We dun attack others tagged clan bases. We let them grow. But I currently now facing a problem whereby I can't upload my picture profile. It sucks. Help me and you get ur five stars rating. Get back to me asap. I've been trying for abt a month and nothing change",
        "This game changed my life and how I live... Up until now every so called \"strategy game\" has been full of nothing but disappointment but then I came across king of Avalon and I was astonished that such a game existed. The graphics are breath taking and the community is truly like your in another world... 5 stars!!!",
        "You will have my 5stars back if you just remove that K.E. in the gold event!!! Or maybe just make it 1 day only!!!  It sucks that all my troops were killed because of that. At least maybe if someone attack a city, not all troops should be lose half of them maybe. How can i gather  resources to heal them if only few left and takes millions or thousands resources to use for healing. Un installed!!! It sucks really!!!"

        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info.",
        "The game is a lot of fun if you are willing to put A LOT of time into grinding things out. They have made huge changes for just quality of life things, but they have kept the core game the same. Grind, grind, grind, grind, and grind some more. You can get everything in the game just by playing it. No need to pay anything. However it would be a lot easier if you could spend 1000$ on the game every couple weeks lol."

        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",

        "Love it.  I kept seeing ads for it and thought it was just another crappy rip off game, but I figured I'd give it a shot, and I'm so glad I did. Game play is fun, there aren't ads every 30 seconds, the app runs smooth, and the artistry that went into designing this game and the characters in it is absolutely flawless. Can't complain at all. Great game, I do recommend to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games.  10/10!",
        "Awesome game. Sadly motivated by profit grabbing providers. The cost to buy extra lives is astronomical. The only way to buy on a more viable basis was via the piggybank and guess what. They removed it. When I questioned this I got standard fob off bull. I questioned that and guess what no reply. A shame, it is a great addictive game. Just don't get tempted to get you wallet out..........",
        "Zainy!  I can understand the addictivity of it, however, just as I was getting into each level, surprise!, is was completed! This spoilt a bit of the fun for me.  The catchy music, oddly I never got tired of hearing... Great game!!!  This review is after my first experience of the game which I played upto level 20 before stopping.",
        "Sounds boring but I'm loving it! Sucks you right in. Starting to get a little complex (actually using some real brain power) but still very much doable and no charges as of yet and I'm up to level 10 atm. I am no gamer by any means but I'm really enjoying this.",
        "After my anti-matter laboratory had a slight malfunction and destroyed half the houses in my town I discovered that I had a lot of time on my hands. So I discovered Toon Blast. Been busy ever since! Thanks guys",
        "Awesome game! Thanks to the developers for not only making this fun, but doing it in a dignified way (i.e., no annoying ads). I love this game! It's fun, addictive, and challenging enough that it's still entertaining 500 levels in! Love it, can't say enough good things about it."

        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15",
        "I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my \"family\"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we're like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I'm from Michigan,we're both married ,but there's nothing I wouldn't do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!! Lifelong friends/family!!! üíú",
        "This game is great and will make you feel tho go all out. It challenges you in a healthy way and keeps you on your toes. Join a guild, trust me. You can do a lot by yourself but joining a guild in this game is actually fun. I haven't experienced anything toxic, yet. I've been playing for about a week and it's really great"

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. üòÅ It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "Think you should be. Given a legendary atrandom at start a,nd a random rare in chest would be cool was expecting that..but no just normal cards.hope I get  cool legendary one day.like. the chest idea hope you bring in armour card add on.like spear guy could have ice spear or flames.plus that's cool extract cards to collect to make your cards even better and unique. Thank you my supercell friend.this game oh almost,st forgot.bbbbbbbeest 2 v 2 game on mobile,!!!!!",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of thoseüòñ",
        "This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own üí∞. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game."

        "I really love this game, i've been playing it for nerely 5 years now and although it can be hard to progress without paying money it is possible. I am free to play which can make it hard but for the people that are not willing to pay money igg is there for you, every week i can earn up to 1500 gems which is probably the reason i have yet to quit. Other than that the leveling and many heros makea the game that much better.",
        "I up my rating to 4. After playing 5 years, this game is really fun to play. I cannot give 5 star as i still having issues with the gem price too crazy expensive. Hope igg can revise gem price back, so many player can support this game, not the rich guy only. I believe you guys has realise many p2p player already quit, so better to revise the germ price again. Overall, i love this game^^",
        "Decided to edit my review to clear things up for people that says this is a money making scheme etc. To the people that say that, do u understand that this game is Free? The devs spend a ton of money making a game enjoyable for people, adding new content such as, new heroes, new events, new upgrading features etc. It's only normal to lock some heroes behind a paid service, and the heroes behind the pay wall isn't even game changing or op. U don't have to spend a cent on this game to make progress. Rolling heroes takes time but it's so rewarding when u get that one hero u were looking for. This is a great game and if u complain about ingame purchases for a game so well maintained then rather go play another free game full of bugs and zero updates.",
        "Holy cow, sitting at 100k might but leveling goes so slow now. Please do something, and new quary is really annoying and sitting in the way.  Edit: everytime I open the game through notification is doesn't load the game.",
        "I hate it. It's always connected to those fake link downloads ugh and if i donwload this game and run it for 30 seconds, the link will open BUT NO it's a lie. This game just wants to be seen as a game with millions of downloads and I HATE IT."

And if you want to join the game now, you are too late because small/new cities can't stand out you have to keep hiding in your shield all the time, where is the fun in that? Unless you spend 100s of dollars on the game you cab achieve nothing. Also now your personal achievement will only be granted only if all the clan wins a battle which is not always easy. If you can't attack you can do nothing and it takes ages (weeks or a month) to build an army to compete. A game that consume money and is no longer fun is a fail game. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!",

Can this problem be solved or should I deinstall all king games I have? I have no problem with games from other developers, so this is on you, not on me.",
        "Have played this game virtually since it first started it's a great game but why do we haveto buy the gold bars we have earned throughout the games I have never spent a cent buying anything! Shouldn't most of the gold bars be awarded to us for being loyal gamers ‚ò∫",

        "I enjoy the game BUT.... I payed ¬£2.99 to open the piggy bank to collect my gold bars and when I tried to collect them again, I have a pop up telling me that I have to pay another ¬£2.99 AGAIN to collect the 50 gold bars I have earned from completing each level! Nothing states that these are one off payments and that you have to pay everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars. I never normally spend money on games and I most certainly will not waste any money on this game again! What an absolute rip off. When a gamer clicks on the piggy bank, I think that the notification should state that you have to pay the ridiculous amount of ¬£2.99 everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars.",

        "Been playing since goblins vs gnomes (2014) and still play today. Not a diehard player, but as my buddy put it, \"hearthstone is the best toilet game ever\". It's pretty simple and easy to learn. Newer and f2p players have a bit of a rough go, but you can easily keep pace in this game for less than $100 a year.",
        "It's a fun game for a while before you will get frustating. Too much depending on luck no matter how good your deck is if you couldnt get the card to do your combo its useless againt an opponant that have better draw than you.  Also if you are free to play you have to be petient to get ass kick for a while till you have luck enough to get some useful legend card.",
        "I love card games and this got some awesome elements. However... The randomness and luck in this game is pure bs. You can be in a winning position and still lose because of 1 in a 10000000 chance of the oponent getting lucky. Even when I win I feel bad from winning because I know the oponet was unlucky.... It is very rare I get a game where I think. This game was awesome because we both did our best.",
        "I never even got to play. I have now tried to install 3x. The first two times the app became unresponsive. The third it caused my phone to crash and reboot. I have a pixel which should be perfectly capable of running it. If not then don't offer it for this device. First blizzard product that's ever pissed me off.",
        "Great game! Love all the really cool animations! I do have a problem that since I installed the game, my store has been closed üòê I am installing it on PC right now to see if I can get to the store there. Game play is awesome though!",
        "Really fun game. 3 stars cause it closes very easily. If I get a phone call even when I dont answer the game closes.even on wifi it closes. Then it takes too long to reload causing me to lose a turn. This is the worst in arena because losing one turn will kill you and it becomes a waste of gold. Please do whatever you can to solve this problem."

        "I was expecting this to come out soon, after all another build a medieval city clone. Nothing original about it. I play it only because of GOT theme. How to keep people playing? -Don't make the screen so congested. -Make stuff like buying a second builder permanent, not for 2 days.  -Basically don't make it P2W. If you don't get what I mean look up how EA messed up with Starwars Battlefront 2",
        "Alliances are complicated but use the chat feature and folk will tell you or PM you. It does take up a bit of time..IF YOU LET IT, but overall, not a bad game. Loads to do...follow what tyrion tells you. Wish I could find particular resources for crafting or I'm never gonna have a level 10 helmet haha. Have fun...don't let it rule your life",
        "12 days is an unacceptable amount of time to respond to a paying customer's problem. Is this the only way to get attention of WB? I have submitted ticket 5 times with no answer!",
        "Unless you completely have no life and plan to spend every waking second playing this i do not suggest it. I downloaded it to have to kill time but unless you spend plenty of money on it and are willing to dedicate majority of your day, you will probably be bullied and attacked by the ones who have no life and spend tons of money on it.",
        "Real truth! This game is built on your discourage to upgrade without buying. You can increase your castle but you have to spend real money all the time. Their rewards vs investment is 10% for you. You will spend your whole credit on this and still not be eligeable for the iron Throne. This is WB best scammed game out there! Things you 400 of to upgrade, only come as 6 units or less a month which pushes you to buy 100$ packages to upgrade. WB is laughting at you!",
        "Too expensive. The in-app purchases cost about 5-100 ‚Ç¨. Those players who pay that on a regular basis dominate and win the game. Those players who don't are currently about 50 times smaller. It is like fighting off tanks and stealth bombers with flintstone and spears. You will lose."

Now it seems that they limit the amount of points you can get at the end for the moves you have left. The only time you see points is the total at the very end. Seems like they're screwing the people who want to get 3 stars on the levels...",

        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget.",
        "I wish rating took into account the design assignment. People design completely different styles than the description and as long as they design in black and white or a neutral palette it will win votes over a design that is actually following the instructions. Contemporary design beats Mediterranean or Eclectic every time. There's no point in even entering those contests because people who do a contemporary design will cancel your design out."

The AI will always take advantage of beating you with moves that will take what you need 98% of the time. Moves that no one can see but magically the AI knows what to choose to beat you. I love strategy games, but cheating is not a fun for anyone. The AI compition is not a compition. It's a slaghter waste of time until you get lucky or they give it too you. No strategy there. Just piss you off cheating AI. Being the top of Candy Crush and Candy crush soda. And yes also Jelly. It is ridiculous sometimes to waste my time with this one. If the AI opponents played at the highest level of what to use, then I wouldn't mind getting beaten. But when you watch the AI make the dumbest move to get what it needed, tells you that the AI sees the whole board. Even what is hidden. Give up or beat yourself up on this one. I seem to love the Gluten of punishment, lol.",

I'm playin a level w/ the Monklings, like 124/6 if u watch closely if u catch a long, 6,7,8, row on Monklings KING WILL NOT ALLOW U TO HAVE THE WHOLE row. Watch the number counter not the monklings going under the rope & u will see the counter not go pass a certain number! THE SAME NUMBER continues like 6 will stay 6 4x's! That way u don't beat the level & u have to buy a booster, KING Co are CHEATS!",

        "I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won't give up.. And I'm not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won't put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I'll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.",
        "Warning careful with this game!  It's ok....hard to win anything. I 've spent quite a bit of money in this game. In the last week ALOT!!!! Both my Husband and I play I explained I could no longer seem to win anything . My Husband played on my device and his own, same room same exact bet. He spent a big sum, my device lost he could not win anything at all but he win 6 billion on his device. We had club members play exact game we was exact same bet, they won big my device won NOTHING AT all. Seems odd. Be Very Careful with this game. I do not believe something is right. After spending a VERY VERY LARGE SUM you would think a person could win a good sized jackpot. NOPE. I will not buy anymore.",
        "This game is very well choreographed. I like the theme music it plays . I like the fact that it give lots of hi winnings. The backgrounds are nicely colored. Very  adictive games. My favorite\"ZEUS SLOTS\". Not fair, I'm not getting some of my winnings. I will take off a star for that. But I still love this game. Although I have been playing this game for a while, and it has improved alot. Now my favorite games are HERCULES, THE MUMMY, and the DIAMONDS SLOTS, and the FRUIT SLOTS. Now I LOVE this game. Some of the game slots needs to up beat the music. Some games are slow, sleepy music. I have always loved this game. Its a lot of fun. It keeps me motivated. My newest favorite game yet is\" WILD STARS\"  . However, \"ZEUS\" I feel that it need to update its amount of pay. And add different characters and music. Love the actionüòÑ. This is always an exciting game.üòâAh, always an awesome game.üòÜThis is a wonderful game to play when your on vacation. Just awesome. I love this game, exciting wins. This will always be my favorite game.",
        "Enjoyable game, lots of freebies.  I now need to change up my review.i had made a purchase in the game during a \"Spin and Win\" promotion, that purchase stated that I would receive 10m chips for every 2k league points, at end of promotion, I did not receive any of my chips as promised per promotion advertising. I followed the process of getting in touch with Huuuge Casino and was told once that someone would be in touch with me, as of this listing I still have not heard back from anyone.",
        "So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.",
        "I have always been a loyal player at huuuge casino and can safely conclude I will continue for a long long long time. Why I said this? Simple - huuuge casino has such a wide varieties of games to satify all sorts of players. Huuuge from my experience not only practise fair play policy but also quite generous in giving free chips.  My plea to the great support team - please do the needfull to bring back Merlin Casino, Melbourne Casino and Singapore Casino. Texas hold'em held there were really superb and loved by many players. I don't understand why they vanished after maintenance works were completed.  My many thanks to the support team - you guys are good! Keep up the good work and CHEERS to all of you."

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",
        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money.",
        "The game is great but customer service is non- existent. I bought the 30 day gem special that was supposed to come with an egg and fountain. Got the gems (so far)but not the extra items. Tried contacting customer support several times but following their M.O., they never respond."

That means you can progress through it without even spending a dime. Its a simple game with decent graphics to play at leisure and has become my current pass time.  Update 3/22/18  I decreased my rating to three stars (from 5) until the developer can correct the latest flop from most recent update. Flop regards being able to log in but paralyzed from any action that requires an in game pop up. I including the \"Help\" module which is used to contact dev with. If no improvement after a week, I will delete game and draw stars to 0.",
        "I've always loved this game, but my tickets go ignored for days. Latest update has handicapped me completely in that I cannot click on anything or log off 1 world to log onto my other world. The game is starting to suffer because of bad customer service. Reduced my rating to 1 star until they get their act together. To think I've actually spent real money on this game and can't get a timely answer."

Which is fine I just have to wait. But now my issue is that the actual levels for the wedding event, and the normal quest, it kicks me out of the app and it does thatt every time. Please fix this issue. Maybe then Ill give it five stars.",
        "Great addictive game! Starts out cute and innocent. Recently found out through a spoiler thread that it does take a darker turn in Ch 15. The U.S. servers are currently only on Ch 12. Still a great addicting game that many players start out thinking \"Awesome! A great game that I don't I can have the option to play for free!\" Soon they cave when that ONE outfit comes along that they HAVE TO HAVE lol.",
        "I love this game! It's really good for creative people who like to design their own outfits. I just downloaded on my new phone and started over (I don't have Facebook to link my progress with). Please make it available to link with Google play so I don't always lose progress!   Also, since downloading again, I found that some of the names are different... I was very confused, since the voice over still says the old names. I like Yoko way better than Bobo!!",
        "I loved this game, and am V8. So its not like I am against paying. I am against the ranking event especially since you devs LIED TO YOUR PLAYERS and said we wont be getting one again. We will not pay 100s for a non guarenteed reward. It would be more HONEST, if you set up the suits as 300 USD each recharge.  If you are smart at all, devs you should understand that business ethics is just as important as profit and will benefit everyone in the long run.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events."

        "Highly addictive. Great fun. Only downside Is, when you get to higher levels, upgrading buildings takes way too long. I'm talking days! Makes you forget about the game sometimes as you can't do anything else untill it's complete. I refuse micro-transactions so this game now only gets visited once every couple of days. It's a shame really as it's great fun to start with.",
        "Provided the developers with evidence of rampant racism, homophobia and misogyny present in the game. They have so far neglected to take any action against the perpetrators. Unacceptable.  Edit: I have already provided screen shots to you via the Help & Support board, you haven't yet taken action. Please do so immediately.",
        "I really enjoyed this game for a while. But anytime theres any sort of update the app wont load up. And it just so happens that whenever this occurs it's during a kill event. I cant explain how stressful this game can become if you actually commit to playing it",
        "This game is not made for people who do not spend money. The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",
        "This garbage is nothing like ads show. It's a pay to win mmo that brings nothing new to the table. You can always tell a game will be garbage when their ads are fake. Uninstalled!",
        "Unless you are willing to line their pockets with cash your wasting your time on the game.  You'll never catch up to those who have been playing the game a long time without money.  Parents beware."

I can't leave message with development so this is the best I can do about that. But I love the game and this wouldn't change my activity amount at all. Keep up the great work development and look forward to new games in the future.",
        "Best game i played ever. But new update have some bugs like if we going to play with friends it take too much time for loading nd mostly notification pop up that there is an error your coins refunded in your account. Kindly resolve this issue. Except this best game üëç",
        "So I have no idea why I am always at a club disadvantage. My driver is level 5 and always vs a person with level 7 or 8. Why do I never go against level 3 drivers. Always vs higher clubs! ALL THE TIME! you might as well give them the win. Losing me as a customer because there is something very lopsided.",
        "The mechanics of the game are fun, but once you move up a rank or two winning is tough. That is an issue because gold (needed to upgrade) is earned thru even payout bets and very little gold is generated naturally. If you can't keep a high win % you either can't play or need to spend $$$. It's hard to win often when most games come down to closest to the pin shootouts.",
        "Constantly glitching now. Will select an opponent but pictures continually scroll and game never starts. Have to shut game down and start back up for the game to begin. On the verge of uninstalling. Will select opponent and never start game and I end up losing money. Forever downloading, takes forever. I always loved 30 seconds when I start the game up if it doesn't start up by then I just shut it down. Beginning to be very disappointed"

        "I like it.   The fish are friendly and encouraging.  I use the game to help me keep calm and relax.  Please consider allowing us to select another of one of the earlier aquariums when we get to the point where we are waiting for new aquariums to be developed and have finished everything.  I'd like a place to put new fish and decorations, but none of the old fish want to be sold.  They are still my favorite friends.  The game uses a lot of memory, and I had to uninstall it from my tablet because it kept making it crash.  Works on my phone, but it's still a lot of memory.",
        "Love this game!! I love the challenge with completing levels. There's days I can't get enough of this game. I play every day. I love decorating my tanks. I love when I get infinite time, but It would be nice if we had control over when to use it or the time would stop and be saved for when we return. Sometimes 6 hours is impossible to sit there and just play. One thing that would be nice is if we didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life to renew and could have more friends to  receive more lives and got to use the diamonds we earned amd not be stored in a bank to buy. Other than that I cant complainüòâ best game out there and I highly recommend it to all ages.",
        "It's a great game. I play it with my daughter on our freetime it's quite addictive. Its great that you get rewards if you have to watch the movies. The only thing i would change is the reloding of the lives. Half an hour for one life is too long. Every so often you get a few free hours, but you need to have free time to play.I love the fact that we can play using my phone sideways (landscape ) as I have a problem with my wrist. I highly recommend it!",
        "Fishdom is a fun game.  The puzzles are challenging. I would love to see a change to the gifts we can give our neighbors . Such as, the lightening, or fireworks, or an ornament for their aquarium. I would also like to see the diamonds we earn to be available, not stuck in a bank, to be paid for.  Limits could be put on it, of course, but the free one here and there only help once in any puzzle sequence.   Overall, though, its a nice game.",
        "I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one's tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don't earn anything for more decorations and it doesn't get dirty and the fish don't get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.",
        "Got a new tablet for Xmas.   Had game on sd card. Wouldn't transfer to new tablet.  Was on level 105.  Have to start all over again! TORTURE lol. Other games I would just stop but not this one.  I love It!  EDIT...STILL LOVE THIS GAME.  Highly reccommend it!  Some levels are SO difficult but still loving this game Oct 9/17.  DEC 2017.  Still adore this game.  Now my husband plays too.  Best game EVER!"

        "The puzzles are interesting, the animations are generally enjoyable. It quickly becomes a grind, though, where you aren't enjoying the gameplay, you're just trying to get past the timewasters of the daily challenge, or fighting the arbitrary points of the arena. The clan battles and Mighty Eagle challenge are the best parts, but you can't play them all the time. You have to grind away in the Arena.",
        "I just purchased a new phone. And being I'm using the same e-mail address i would have thought it would have started me at the same level I had been on prior to the new phone. Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download.",
        "I really think the tower is rigged. 1 in 4 chance of getting the pig but it seems to happen ALL the time. Cant get past the 6th or 7th floor. However if you spend lots o money to buy gems I guess it can be done. Not for me I am out.",
        "He game starts out with tutorials, but they act like you've never played angry birds before. Theres a world map which is cool, but its not needed and is just boring. The worst part about this game is that you can only lose 5 times a day. I just want to play the game like how the original game played!"

        "Excellent card game.  However as soon as you get passed reasonably priced starter packs you cannot play the game and why not?  Because you play two games then you need to spend huge amounts of money so you can play two more rounds.  Then you need good cards and guess what you have to buy them through a lottery system like gambling highly addictive but after maybe thousands of dollars you get the card you want guess what you need to evolve your card and guess what you need to buy your reagents big dough yet again.  Then when you have spent all your hard earned cash you need to buy special weapons to give yourself a good boost to your cards.  Do you get where this game and a right game it is too. It relies on you getting addicted so you spend all your time and resources on an endless quest for something you will never have uninstalled buy buy.",
        "Amazing game, honestly, top 3 mobile game I've ever played, found an amazing guild and it's loads of fun. No paywall is the crowning achievement in my opinion. One thing, cause I don't know where customer support is, I started a Path of Champion level, and  on the first wave the game crashed and when I logged back on I had no key and didn't have a chance to beat the level",
        "Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition",
        "Great games. Controls suck.  You want to scroll and click a card instead (i know how to swipe) turns are fast paced..sometimes too fast. And as a starter...some of the turn challenges seem a bit unrealistic with the characters provided. Almost like they want to have you spend money off rip. Good game overall....but some things should definitely need work.",
        "It's a lot other games of this type. I haven't been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you're looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn't find any more connections, that would be great!"

        "This game is pretty good and nintendo/IS takes in community feedback. This is probably one the most generous of any gacha game out right one and there have been some powerful units given to us for free. Content is 99% free to play friendly with only 1 or so events that were very difficult for f2p. While its not a true fire emblem game, it is still pretty good for a mobile game.  P.S. there are some 5 star units that shouldn't be there. They are only there to gimp you out of another unit.",
        "If you ever were interested in the Fire Emblem series then this is defenitely a good place to start off. It's simplistic enough for new players yet at the same time it offers a lot of possibilities on how to build your units. It's fun to collect Heroes in this game and it's fun working on them to make their stats and strategy better. Each Hero has a fun personality and each one of them is well drawn by talented artists.  A fun strategy game that also can get really challenging in some of the harder quests.",
        "Great game. I've never played Fire Emblem before, so this app is a great way to see what the games are like and all about. I like all of the cool characters and all the details each one has. If you like RPGs or want to try one out, this one may be a good one to give a shot at. You don't need money to play either. You might just want to get yourself into the FE games series after playing this. ;)",
        "Been having this app for a year now and yet I haven't thought its a waste of space at all! It's extremely addicting and makes you want to play more. Its also nice how the creators interact with the community alot and listen to our feedback. Its also nice to have a game that's constantly worked on and it just keeps improving. The art and the voice acting it also a big pro for this game. It really does capture the characters personality,even if it is a few words. The art is simply amazing. I appreciate the artists for thier hard work. Would definitely recommend it if you like RPG games.",
        "Turn based strategy rpg. If you've never played a Fire Emblem, time to remedy that. Fantastic depth and graphics for a free game. This feels like a full blown complete Nintendo title I'd expect to see for $30 for Gameboy brand new. At the price of nothing, everyone should try it.",
        "This is a work in progress. I am a huge fan of Fire Emblem, Sacred Stones and I really wanted to love this right out of the gate.  It has made a good start.  All maps are a set size, something like 6x8, with two teams of 4.  No terrain bonuses, no special conversation where one of your characters can convince one of them to join you, ALL attacks result in hits of a predetermined amount, no crits/no misses, no permadeath.  Voiced characters are a nice plus from the old GBA days. This is as close to a real Fire Emblem game as a mobile, free to play will get, and the devs keep changing up stuff to keep it interesting. Great game!"

        "What have you done?!! This was a great game with a few annoying adverts, now it's just one long advert interspersed with occasional races. I have no real issue with adverts but when they stick on the screen and hide the X until way after the timer ends that's just offensive. And seriously - ¬£8.99 PER MONTH to clear ads? (Yes I know you get extras) - come on that's taking the ****",
        "Really fun casual game. Adverts are present but not too intrusive. Allowed to watch adverts in exchange for upgrades or items.   My only criticism is that it takes a while to get used to the different menu items as there's no instructions and the \"see as far as you can go\" sections are really expensive to unlock.",
        "I've been crazy about this game, but the new update is terrible because of the crashes and bugs. In the middle of race my touch screen doesn't work, the pedals either. Please, for god sake,fix this annoying problem, i can't play any more.thanks a bunch",
        "Fix the damn gas pedal. The reason why I lose half my races cause the gas pedal just magical doesn't want to read my finger but the brake sure does work just fine. Keep shoving ads down my throat and it'll be all 1 star.",
        "Money greedy game. You will end up watching ads every minute. You will be forced to watch half a minute irrelevent ads every minute. It's like these guys built the best game to annoy people with ads. Good luck. Played several levels just to get annoyed and uninstall."

        "I'm not a downloading games on my phone or tablet kind of person but I saw this game and decided to try it out. I loved it and played it all the time but then one day it suddenly stoped working when I was doing so well. I couldn't open the game anymore I tried many things and didn't work. I started a new game all from the beginning I had 55 cash in my town and all randomly it showed I had like 20. This game just wants you to keep making purchases. If you don't it will block you out.",
        "I love this game. I dont play a lot of games. Township just keeps getting better. Some things are a minor downfall to this game, like how you can usually get great items from the store, untill you need a product or item for a task or event item. Then unless you have the township cash to hire the dealer then its hard to get things done in time. Plus in order to complete some tasks, you have to sell everything in your barn to complete the task. You should be able to just harvest than sell without it subtracting it back from your task. But either than that its an awesome game...",
        "Something different and fun. I usually don't play these type games, but I love TOWNSHIP! Still having so much  fun with every level. AMAZING FUN! WOW! The HALLOWEEN decorations were so cute, I can't wait for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Loved the Cranberries. I'm enjoying Township more and more with each level. Year of the Rooster.  Greetings we're all gussied up for the holidays. It's Easter season 2018 still playing.",
        "Loved this game but I can't seem to get on the game now. I wait for a long time for it to start and have to sometimes uninstall and reinstall and wait for it to start again.  If It I do make it on I can't help other players by going to there town. I paid money on this game and play faithfully everyday. I'm feeling some kind of way about this. Please fix this.  Update: The bugs are fixed..Thank you",
        "It is fast pace and complex good for ny age,but it with it ads and constant up daes it is hard on your device. It can be played with out any cost, if one has the time and the patients. Other wise it can be costly.  If it a child playing it I would highly recommend supervision,not because of any other reason other than updates and complex issues.  But it is a thnking ame that is fun.",
        "This is one unique blend of many things made into a game that makes me feel obligated to keep coming back and keeping everything running in the game. It doesn't feel like this when I played HayDay. One highlight I have to mention, game cash (township cash) is generously given away in many form! No more worry of being unable to achieve this and that due to no cash available..."

        "Do not spend any money on this game. This used to be one of the best slot games until the developers got greedy. Payouts are small and events are nearly impossible. They try to make it all sound good but it's not. They also changed the customer service on here where it's hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!",
        "What the hell kind of question is that?  \"Is it beautiful\".... meaning the game! HOW NOT PERTAINING TO ANY GAMES!  Anyway,  this game is hands down the best Slot game EVER!  Have played slots in and out of casino's for over 20 years and this is the one to play! A huge variety of Casino games,  easy to maneuver and a lot of really nice people.",
        "I used to love this game but something they did changed it. Winning is nearly impossible even if you are a paying customer. I know it is a game of luck but when you purchase 85 silver tickets you should be able to complete puzzles when you only need 1 piece for each of them. Make winning a little easier and people will be happy to spend money.  I think the game is broken. I was just playing in a room on Billionaire with a person who was playing on Huge Casino. I know it's the same developer but I don't think that is supposed to happen. I know the person was playing Huge Casino because it was my husband playing it. May want to look into it.",
        "Customer relations are horrible even non existent. If you spend money you will lose far more than you win, in their eyes you will spend even more. If you send a message they will hide behind a canned \"industry standard\" response. This is not a free standing casino there are no freebies and you can't collect any winnings. Yet they have their games dialed in so you lose in hopes you will spend money. Horrible company.",
        "I just started this account in hopes of recovering my lost one. If it goes smoothly, I am happy with the app to date. The slots don't pay as much as they used to, a little tite , otherwise a fun app. The events they choose for you to play, daily, do steal a lot of chips. If u want to remain in a successful club, you must do them, is the main downfall. I would recommend it to my friends.",
        "This is an interesting game. After I played it for awhile it became very boring. Haven't gotten a big or any good win for the past 70 million. I guess if you buy chips you might win more often. It doesn't give you all the bonuses, and it takes gifts and doesn't give them to the gamers you gave it to. So all in all it's just okay. I've never been able to get anywhere with their support team as they added to my reply. I'd give it a one star but if you buy chips it might be better."

        "I am ABSOLUTELY LOVING THE NEW GAMES!!! The free coins are very generous, but my only pet peeve is that I cannot seem to keep them very long. They go as fast as I win them! Also, the club coins could be a little higher. I send gifts to both friends and club members daily, but they're not enough to truly help anyone to continue to play.  But besides that, I just love DoubleU casino. I've been a member since practically the beginning and I will remain a faithful user! ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ",
        "This game is the biggest ripoff I have spent 100s of dollars of real money for nothing lost it all. Never get a Jackpot. A huge scam all they want is your money. No fun playing when you lose all the time really sucks would not recommend to anyone. I know you can't allways win but once in a while would be nice. Thanks for nothing Double U Casino.  Nicky",

        "great game! auto play is helpful for players who do not have a lot of free time in the real world. eats up battery like a fat kid at a buffet.   not worth downgrading a star but I noticed there is no audio mute option, just turn down volume bar as far to the left. So when you start the game app the first time, the intro audio blasts in your face! after you log into your account, game play is silent.",
        "It's been ok so far, I personally don't enjoy the auto feature but I get why it's there... I'm a busy person I have other stuff to do while I really want to game. Of course, the pay2play option is there otherwise you grind like ALL mmorpgs. Which I don't see the problem with... it's a free game ppl and a pretty decent one at that.",
        "Not only is it laggy, now after loading and installing the recent update, I can't even log in. After log in screen and after it checks for any update, it logs me out to main menu! This is ridiculous! After spending real money with this game you deny me access? So!ution required please asap.",
        "After update, not able to log in. Game crashes all before loging in. Either you fix it today, either i will demand for money return. I have payed money, not to be unable to log in. Do it today, or return money payed.  Since you have not attempted to fix the issue, i demand full refund for the purchases i made. Expect refund and reply! You HAVE to give any reply.",
        ".... Like the 100 or more people before me after the March 14th update I'm no longer able to log in for some unknown reason.. No info on the netmarble site about this issue which is odd.. I actually liked this game but this is really nad customer support.. Well time for a new time sink I guess..",
        "Game is a decent time waster. It's true that it is tedious if you're not willing to blow an inhuman amount of money. The recent update is causing the login screen to be unresponsive to my touch, and I cannot log on. Not terrible otherwise.. Samsung galaxy s8 active."

        "I like the game its fun and engaging but the premium choices cost a lot of diamonds and you don't get a lot opportunity to earn them. 12- 18 diamonds for more then a couple  choices in a story to make interesting choices that wouldmake the storys better but you only earn 1 diamond a chapter witch you have to wait an hour or more to unlock or buy keys.  So you pretty much have to spend real money for this game to really enjoy it. Ill be deleting this app not worth my time.",
        "While the game is enjoyable and the stories are intriguing, it is way too expensive to make certain choices. There is absolutely no need for choices to cost 20 or 25 diamonds when you only get 1 diamond for each chapter completed.  This game is in no way good enough to warrant spending real money on it, especially considering the ridiculously high prices of making certain choices which would require making a purchase in every single chapter.",
        "The game is great. Great graphics, nice music, perfectly cued entrees  for new characters, amazing story line.... But they don't give you enough keys or diamonds. I mean, y s its understandable that the chapters are long but 2hrs for a recharge on keys? Really? Either make the waiting time shorter, give us more, or both. Now as for the diamonds, they give you 25 of them. But each special choices is always way to much. And you never really know when your going to need them for something serious. With that said either give us more keys, lower the cost of the choice, or give us more diamonds per chapter. Not like 2 but 5 or more.",
        "It's a brilliant app, though sometimes I wish there wasn't as many gem choices. I fully considered buying gems until I realised how quickly they'd be used.   My favourite story was It Lives In The Woods, though most of the choices are gem choices. The story itself is fantastic, and I love the diversity of characters.   I had a problem with a story playing up and after a chat with the team was told to restart it. I didn't mind but I didn't get any keys to compensate what I'd already spent (I don't buy them I just wait for then to recharge, but it did mean I had to respend keys on one story because of a issue out of my control)   Overall its a great app and highly playable without spending.",
        "Diamond choices come up way too often for how much they cost and how little you get. The keys have an unreasonably long cooldown to get them. Options like watching ads to get diamonds would be a great option, especially seeings how you have that option in HSS and HU:RS. All that aside its a good game. Lots of the stories are enjoyable and its visually pleasing.",
        "Great graphics and great stories. Right now they have like 30 \"books\", so there are lots of options. I've been playing since 2016 and the app just keeps getting better. Can get a little pricey for the preminum choices, but otherwise it's a fantastic app; very additive and entertaining"

        "S***s, everybody having multiple account - if the admins ensure there is no cheating. yes, its a awesome game to play on and game got stuck on 11% after the update.. and still not working",
        "it could be a good game if you didn't have to spend cash for shields and teleports. They should be available in the alliance store . thats why the servers die. People get tired of rebuilding every time they sign on",
        "Lot of Server issues these days. Game servers are down for 30 Hours in last 4 Days. Many friends lost their Accounts and suffered Huge loss. But support team doesn't helps when you have lost everything. They ask for screenshot....hahaha!!!",
        "I just updated the game which fixes some minor bugs. But, Game stuck at 11% before updating & also after updating & it's become HABIT for me to see the Gameloft's March of empires: war of lord games SERVER PROBLEM. I am a Android mobile user, so, there must be a option of graphic quality change just to make sure that game runs smoothly, because I spend many months to grow & if big guys using PC version attacks, then I can't do anything because my game just freezes, lags & don't respond for some time. But the game is over for me as I loss so much. So, Gameloft launch a LITE VERSION FOR ANDROID USERS or there are huge chances of players who will leavethis game & already many left this game, as you can see the are many dead castles in each realm.",
        "Please upgrade to more realistic graphics and gameplay like Age of empires 3. Think more innovative like Fort camps to protect capitals and much more is needed in regard to spies, make it more difficult to spy and gather info. Also the defenses should be given more importance cause some guys from all realms have huge armies and it's easy for them to break into castles, I prefer more options when it comes to defenses. You guys are doing great but more options the better."

        "EA please keep improving, i already in love playing this game until i realized that i had to spend a lot amount of money to upgrade my team and collecting great cards.. actually im not feeling good at this because i'm not a rich guy that could paid all those packs with very high price.. im saying this to represent all f2p players out there, although im not so f2p at all. i only spent a dollar to buy that eoe pass and nothing again until now. so please, give a chance for f2p player to keep playing this game with no jealousy with those high overall p2p players.. thanks",
        "Be careful on this game, its possible to spend real money and get absolutely nothing in return! For example I bought a Saint Patrick pack, 1000 gems a pack and got 10 lucky leafs, I could use the lucky to buy another pack, which I got a lucky leafs from, so I spent 10 lucky leafs got 1 lucky leaf that I couldnt use  unless I brought more! Literally got nothing for my money. This is EAs way of mugging people.",
        "Please add more sounds effect on this game, and fix the sfx that already on this app. I hope you add full match online like the other game (90 minutes) so we just not attack but defends too. Replay button must be great, and i have idea that you guys add event like \"best goal of the week\" or so, from that replay, we can save, and send to you, and you can choose who will win it. I think it will make people playing this game. Commentator should be great too if you add full match versus online. I love this game, please read it. Egy Maulana V plays for Lechia Gda≈Ñsk now. Add it! Add to all of your fifa games. That replay button should be great",
        "I just saved up all my team hero points, watched a heap of ads so I could build up stamina so I could do my best to try to get Man√© in team heroes. About half way through collecting my hero rewards, the rewards pages started to go blank, and the last 25 packs I opened were empty. Is there any way to correct this?",
        "The game is good but it could be better. Elite players are too expensive  so it's hard to upgrade team. Informs and special cards are all untradable so unless you get lucky in events you won't get a chance to play with them. The new layout is better though. Unless you have plenty of time or money don't expect to progress in this game all that quickly. Mobile games should not be as grindy as console games.",
        "What's wrong with this game. I was playing Vs mode and was in world class level and got more then 600000 fans.and now I saw I'm in pro level.how it could be automaticy.fix it pls what the hell is going on.i make my progress playing v hard and all gone with in movement.even I did not play and lose."

So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning. And didn't really recovered my previous game. Love everything except for this.  P.S. i did the troubleshooting in the forum but nothing really helps.",
        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much",
        "I've always been a fan of The Sims since it first came out on the PC and now this version is WAY BETTER than their other App game! I LOVE IT! It's so much fun and I can't wait to see what more is in store! UPDATE: After playing longer and being able to have a baby with my spouse, I found that our kids are labeled son and daughter under his family tree, but as father and niece under mine. That makes no sense! What's going on?!",
        "One of the best mobile games I have played. Not forced to buy anything with real money to keep playing, the cupcakes are great, I love everything. Right now, this is funner than Sims 4! My only complaint is that you can't change the story with another sim. I would love if once a story is complete, you could choose to pick another one. After all, relationships change over time in real life. Love this game!",
        "Sims is finally here on Mobile! I like how the Sims can complete events while you're not in the App. My only concerns are the limitations. It seems like with a lot of the actions my Sim is talking to herself or interacting with herself especially during the Hot Tub events. It would be nice to have them be able to interact with other Sims even while at work or at another event especially if rust are already friends or lovers with the other Sims! Also I think the careers and hobbies should have more variety. I also would like to be able to purchase a pool and build a patio.",
        "Great Game! Really captures that what made SIMS fun and for mobile on the go at that! Graphics are reasonable considering it is new. When building houses the only drawback is you cant construct walls within a room, you have to work with box rooms. As well as you cant make like a out door patio without it being in a room enclosure.  All in all though I do highly recommend this game to you if youve enjoyed SIMS games in the past. Loads to do,events and updates to keep you busy for awhile."

        "There is an abusive player on battlefield 62 and the developers have not been very responsive.  If you want to play a game where a player repeatedly tells others to kill themselves, douse themselves in gasoline, threatens people, makes sexual assault jokes and literally tells players with cancer he hopes they lose their battle and just harrasses players to make them quit and even says that is what he is doing then this is the game for you.  Edit:The developers reply shows another issue with the game.  If they read the part where I said the developers have not been very responsive they would realize I did contact GM support about this issue.  They just have not done anything.  Nothing has been done even though multiple players have contacted them.  This is why they have 1 star review.",
        "Was really looking forward to playing this game and it does have potential, but it's so frustrating with bugs that makes it so disappointing. Sort the bugs out and you'd have a great game.",
        "It's a good game overall. The in game support is minimal to non existent. Your better off asking players for support. Its a good team building game. Like every other game like this it's pay to win but with strategy and a good team you can still have fun. Again it's a good game. I just hope they sell to a smarter company with better skills in game development and customer service (because without customers, you don't have a game) and then this would be an even better game. Give it a shot just get a good active team and don't expect help from customer service. Be careful buying packs and if you do screenshot EVERYTHING. Hope this helps",
        "If army men strike stuck to there rules, and didn't allow people making death threats, abusive language, to play, it would be better, I would not let anyone under 21 play this game as the explicit content in chat would lead to children learning much foul language and receiving death and rape threats.  Ask anyone in bf 62",
        "So many glitches to what could be a great game....slow on fixes....no lvl buffer so watch out for maxed out players who love hitting low players...be sure not to come to bf74 as it has been held hostage by a single player called Welpia and his corps ROK.....YOU WILL BE MISERABLE.....numerous unanswered complaints to customer support by numerous players....numerous players. May rage quit on this bf....attempts to get cs to act have failed....other wise a great game with great potential so long as you dont get stuck in a bf with one who calls himself Welpia or any corsps. Named ROK or Kor",
        "This should be called Army Men Drama Field... This Game is a Joke along with the consultants you have a better chance of getting struck by lightning than getting a hold of anyone. And it's like being in pre school you can get banned for saying a bad word ü§£ i wouldnt waste my money or time on this game"

ALSO worth mentioning that a year of playing an i cannot reach max rank on 4 star. Dont mention the 5 star champions. It will take you prob 4 to 5 months of everyday grinding to fully rank a 5 star or even obtain a new one. All the steam aside.  A great game addicting to the  higher levels as you progress",
        "The game is very uncreative. Many of the characters have same moves even when they have different powers... I advice to increase some moves of the players which should be according to their powers otherwise good game.  And also the drop rate is bad, upto this point I have opened about 60 premium crystals and haven't got a single 3 star hero or higher.  .",
        "Pretty repetitive. swipe back, swipe forward, tap tap tap, hold, repeat. controls are rather monotone which I'll slighlty overlook because of the nature of the game but I see a lot of champions have the exact same moveset. also the drop rates are pretty bad. And on arenas, the opponents bcome a lot more powerful than my own. Other than that, good time killer",
        "If you want to invest a ridiculous amount of time to save shards you collect in game to supposedly increase your chances for too quality cards then get yourself either duplicates of what you already have or rubbish class characters in general. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS GAME!",
        "I am addicted to this game. this game is awesome. But the people working in kabam are not good. They have blocked me from sending any messages. First of all I thought it was due to some bugs then I wrote a complaint to kabam. Lately they replied that        I have violated the rules. But I didn't do anything. If I really did anything wrong then they have to send me the proof. with out any proof and information they blocked me. You guys blocked me fine now send me the proof. Prove me that you really know your job. My name in the game is snsnns211187. Send me the proof. With out any proof you should not block me."

        "Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don't decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don't mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don't actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.",
        "8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don't win any games until those coins are over and I'm only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don't know why this is happening but it sucks because it's putting me off the game.. it's like 8 ball is making sure I'm losing hence the rate 3",
        "Great 8 ball pool game. Plays great and looks great. 1 slight issue tho. Im from Ireland but i seem to be playing people from India and surrounding countries.   The Irish and Indian flag are kind of similar so im guessing thats where the issue is coming from.  I cant seem to edit my location either.

I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "The game is very good. But that spin wheel is not fair at all. I've been playing this game for 6 years now (I know there used to be 1 coin reward there) and I've never got anything more than 2500 coin reward. My point is if you are keeping other rewards on that wheel atleast give equal probabilities for each reward. If not, just remove those big rewards and replace them with small ones but atleast with same probability for each of them. Hope you will do something. (P.S. i know it's a lucrative strategy developers play so that players will stick to the game. But you know just trying.‚úåÔ∏è)"

        "WARNING: IF YOU DO NOT CORRECTLY SELECT POWERS BEFORE APPROVING, YOU LOSE THE POWER(S) YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED! ALSO, DO NOT USE YOUR CRYSTAL SKULLS TO POWER UP, USE THEM TO EVOLVE! If you like One Piece, you'll like this game. The One Piece story line is faithfully adapted to the plot of the game (not exact, but great for a game story line). The characters are great. If you are patient and power up your characters, you don't have to pay to play. Basically no advertisement,  except for self promotion of the game.",
        "Whether you are a fan of One Piece of not, this is an awesome game. Lots of fun, great and faithful art, and a rich combat. Best of all, they practically cram gems down your throat so you never feel forced to actually have to buy any.  An update to this is that I have been playing this game for years, so it is nice to see them keeping it fresh and fun. Still love this game. And as always, anni is the planni for my fellow Redditors.",
        "This game is so fun collecting all the characters and trying to evolve them. Over the years I've had multiple phones so the only downside is the saving of data I wish it would just be connected to your account like most other games in case you lose or break your phone. Rather than having to start over is they can fix that issue this game is one of the best on the app store.",
        "I have always loved onepeice and liked brave frontier very much so it's the best of both world's if you have ever beenm waiting for a one piece rpg then this is it. And grinding for items could of not been anymore fun than this. Still having fun with this game. And it's still getting better and better. Thank you for a perfect one-piece game. Also I normally hate grinding for items but when you live one piece like I do then it's doesn't matter. They also update the game with new content making it even better. 2018 and the game is still going strong.",
        "Good for a One Piece fan! The many aspects of the game makes it interesting. There can be a bit of a learning curve for new players, but the slight challenge is what makes it fun. The updates and changes keep the game from becoming dull as well. Btw I have fun playing even as a free player because they are pretty generous with the game currency. You just need patience as with any game you play for free.",
        "Game is fun overall. But get ready to grind after a week or so. Gems comes pretty easy overtime. But the prize in the store is a bit pricy especially when you are never guarantee the characters you want in the draw. So if you are not in a hurry. Save up your gems until they have a event with a guarantee 10th draw or something that has a character you want. Other than that, this game is great time killer and I love playing this game while waiting on the animation renew."

        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "Love the concept of the game but the moment you start reaching higher castle lvl  that's when you realize that if you don't pay you will be on a long journey, ie.. PvP are out of the question everyone has minimum of 5 epic items, arena you will have to settle for 5th or less place due to power lvl difference. I am about 141000 fighting 190000 or 90000, which is not fair for those of low power or advantage to those of high.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",
        "I loved this game very much, I had a lot of really nice things and invested nearly $60 dollars into making my guys 5 stars and diamonds and other level up promos... I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine.."

        "This game is very hanging my mobile another games are good  speed but this game is  no speed  improve this game",
        "Dear team, It's really a awesome game ever. I'm playing it since 2 years. Very addictive. But i request you to all, when we start a TEAM RACE many players join clans for playing team race n take efforts in team race for getting better reward but many of them team leaders kick players just before ending the team race n players won't receieve any reward for it. It was happened with me 2 times. So please do any update for those players who take much efforts in team war and then also they get nothing. Thanks",
        "This game used to be 5 star. They've changed it where all team events are gem sucks. You have no chance of winning without using a considerable amount of gems. They've taken away most in game free ways to get gems, and to buy them is not worth it, they're very over priced. It's not a team event, it's a paid for event. If they change it and make it more fair for everyone I'll make a new rating.",
        "It's a nice game with so many awesome monsters. I like it and it's my favourite game in this category. My suggestion is that if you can include an option to cancel ongoing breeding by giving gold or gems or without anything, it would have been better. The game has events that comes very frequently, it helps so much in getting new monsters and or progressing in the game.",
        "The game is awesome! The game play, the monsters, and also the actual fighting and graphics. This is one of my most rated games and my most played; I couldn't go a day without it. It's competition is so good online with people and in dungeons and the map, also team wars are fun with your friends. Get this game you'll never regret it.",
        "DO NOT PAY FOR ANYTHING IN THIS GAME. Recently my account was reset due to the game posting the wrong price of gems. I have lost everything even the things I paid full price for. I have been robbed of gems, cells, gold, food and my time. If you do play the game, don't spend actual money because they can take it all away. BE CAREFUL"

The controls are great and graphics a+. (they also keep adding new fun stuff that makes the game fun to play for even experienced players) great game üòÄ",

I can't build most of what I'm able because I'm still trying to gather from the first levels.  I die instantly at every aggressive player I encounter.  Maybe there is a trick to finding my stuff that I don't know.",

If you can't restore your progress and continue playing without restoring, then all your progress is lost!",

It gives you money and helps us in-game. Please add faster energy recharge and unlimited ads. Because taking away ads is a little much..",

Who the hell cares about a dog when you can't even keep a jacket for more than a trip to a location... Update has lost my account again and do you know... I think that I have had enough. I'll come back if you do ever finally release it which I don't think you will until you stop wasting time on pointless additions and concentrate on the core gameplay.sort yourselves out, I am going to find another game.",

I've been a loyal player from the very beginning and that's their response. I'll post a message on Facebook everyday and see how many people keep playing your game or even start playing it. lol. isn't it funny how they only have gameplay graphics and controls that you can see the rating for and not how happy users are. download war z law of survival. that game is much better and the developers actually listen to the people playing."

I'll give 5 stars if 5 theres improvement. Thanks!",

The only reason this game has so many player is the game size & device compatibility. If your phone is capable of playing \"the famous 3v3 moba\", you'd better play that game",
        "This game is so cool. Only noob will say it hard to play or hard getting hero/skin. Maintain the gameplay and everything will be alright. Sometimes we win and sometime we won't. Only the graphics need to be improve. Come on! It's 2018 already! Make a tournament cause i wanna join!!. (Give me free skin. I give u  5 stars bitchhhhhhhh)",

        "I love this game, I've been playing this for over a year and I still play it daily! All the skins and heroes skills are amazing. But please don't  let me team up with low level players it's affecting my game and stats when I'm trying my best to carry they would just afk which can be frustrating. But overall it's a good game",
        "I hv been playing this game for two years alll good perfect game perfect graphics..bt there should be some changes for the afk players... strict steps should be taken towards for these afk players not bye lowering credit score by banning from game for a period of time so that they won't be spoiling game any further"

    "descriptionHTML" : "Join your friends in a brand new 5v5 MOBA showdown against real human opponents, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang! Choose your  favorite heroes and build the perfect team with your comrades-in-arms! 10-second matchmaking, 10-minute battles. Laning, jungling, tower rushing, team battles, all the fun of PC MOBAs and action games in the palm of your hand! Feed your eSports spirit!<br><br>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, 2017&#x2019;s brand new mobile eSports masterpiece. Shatter your opponents with the touch of your finger and claim the crown of strongest Challenger!<br><br>Your phone thirsts for battle!<br><br><b>Features:</b> <br><br><b>1. Classic MOBA Maps, 5v5 Battles</b> <br>Real-time 5v5 battles against real opponents. Fight over 3 lanes to take the enemy&#x2019;s tower. 4 jungle areas. 18 defense towers. 2 Wild Bosses. Complete reproductions of classic MOBA maps. Full-on 5v5, Human vs. Human battles. A triumphant return to genuine MOBA gameplay.<br><br><b>2. Win with Teamwork &amp; Strategy</b> <br>Block damage, control the enemy, and heal teammates! Choose from Tanks, Mages, Marksmen, Assassins, Supports, etc. to anchor your team or be match MVP! New heroes are constantly being released!<br><br><b>3. Fair Fights, Carry Your Team to Victory</b> <br>Just like classic MOBAs, there is no hero training or paying for stats. Winners and losers are decided based on skill and ability on this fair and balanced platform for competitive gaming. Play to Win, not Pay to Win.<br><br><b>4. Simple Controls, Easy to Master</b> <br>With a virtual joystick on the left and skill buttons on the right, 2 fingers are all you need to become a master! Autolock and target sifting allow you to last hit to your heart&#x2019;s content. Never miss! And a convenient tap-to-equip system lets you focus on the thrill of battle!<br><br><b>5. 10 Second Matchmaking, 10 Minute Matches</b> <br>Matchmaking only takes 10 seconds, and battles last 10 minutes, glossing over the quiet early-game leveling up and jumping right into intense battles. Less boring waiting and repetitive farming, and more thrilling action and fist-pumping victories. At any place, at any moment, just pick up your phone, fire up the game, and immerse yourself in heart-pounding MOBA competition.<br><br><b>6. Smart Offline AI Assistance</b> <br>In most MOBAs, a dropped connection means hanging your team out to dry, but with Mobile Legends: Bang Bang&#x2019;s powerful reconnection system, if you get dropped, you can be back in the battle in seconds. And while you&#x2019;re offline, your character will be controlled by our AI system to avoid a 5-on-4 situation.<br><br>PLEASE NOTE!

AND THEN WHEN THE NEW UPDATE COMES OUT.... I LOSE IT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can you PLEASE give me the stuff back.",

I don't know if I were think too much but I feel like Everytime I level up, the weapon that I use before was unexpectedly weaker.Lucky chest seem to drop only coins and crysrals(sometimes I got free spin). And some modes, weapons and armor balance is not really that balance (example:last match I used smart bullet bazooka to kill people using 4 rockets to kill them. But he killed me with only 2 rockets of smart bullet bazooka...... How is that even balance?!). I hope you fix this soon. Because I love to play game.",

Although you have many in app purchases available you can play without spending any real money and be competitive. The developers award you with more than enough items on a daily basis. It's definitely a must have for fans of this game type.",
        "I'm sure this is a fun game, however I do not see the reason why it needs to have permission to manage my phone calls or know my location if I never plan to use any online abilities. That is just too much access to my phone. I did not even get a chance to play the game because it wanted that access on start up; it will not allow you to play the game without give permission.",
        "It's a great strategic game. PvP is more event driven rather than a free for all.Great value for the money you spend whether it's a little or a lot...and the purchases give a little free to your team. Lots of ways to win free stuff and points you can spend on items needed in alliance store and keep up with your wallet warrior team mate. One downside is the support..they can be a little sliw in response time to problems. But they don't just ignore you either.",
        "Why does this app request access to make calls/read sms/messages? Un-installed right away.  Edit: That's not how it works. Just because you say \"your phone is safe\" doesn't make it safe. You're still getting the permission from un-educated users that you can read their messages. That's very shady.",

I lost 50% of my troops in my main castle which went missing, lost 1 m of power, my farms was plundered and troops in my farms was massacred. Reported the issue but they ROK did not bother to give me a courtesy reply so if you decide to play but sure the system does not steal your time and effort playing the game.

You lose coins fast like the real slots, unfortunately. I just start playing the game for the first time and I'm already out of coins. I believe they start you off with a low amount because I'm already out of coins in 30mins of play. The games and the graphics are fun though, which makes it attractive to play. My only complaint is paying for those coins..",
        "The variety of games are great, and I would enjoy playing them if I didn't lose all my money within 30sec... It's totally ridiculous to only get $800 every couple of hrs when the cost to spin one time is $250! Also, the big spin wheel sucks too... Instead of the normal $800, I get close to $2000. Big woop. Give more $ or make the spins less!",
        "If you like slots this app is great. Gives free chips/credits every 4 hours but for more free chips you have to go on the HOF Facebook page in order to participate in their daily contests plus click on links to collect more free chips. Sometimes I collect chips for a few days without playing in order to save up a larger bank so when I do play Im able to raise my bet & win more. But if u bet too much per spin (based on ur total chip bank) you will loose 99% of the time.  Wish I cd Win more contests!",
        "Short reviews are tough as any gambling game if ya win it's fun & great. If you lose it sucks! Cash purchases of chips & extras disappear super fast! The 3 hr wait to collect a few coins is very long. Then the SPIN has not given me a BIG pay out ever & I've been at x 2.0 forever. I hope you listen to your patrons & investigate & consider meeting our concerns at least some of the way. We know you make TONS money also! Consider smaller costs on packages if your not going to ever let us win! Tyvm"

Many videos crash the game, which means you lose the treat you would otherwise earn by watching those ads. Other crashing problems as well.",
        "For not getting even the first event bird out of 3 in alien excavation after opening so many premium eggs reaching (*4) of the premium eggs. I blame - chimera and rovio. Either the makers of the game are idiots or the game is stupid and seriously 2000 per month for an imaginary egg everyday that cannot guarantee a 4 or 5 star bird. Yeah, the makers of the game really are idiots.",
        "the game is really fun and humorous. I love the clan feature- found a great clan to be part of. there are glitches that rovio needs to iron out that affect play. I am hoping this new big update helps fix all that. the changes look to be really good. excited to see what they've done.",
        "I did not expect to enjoy this nearly as much as I have. The frequent events are nice and having a guild just makes them better. I don't feel compelled to be social be because there is no chat, just playing the game. It is a wonderful balance.",
        "Love the game. The game play is great. Only down side is that I feel that the game cheats against me sometimes by adding enemies. Only happened about 3 times now. ***edit*** I have since realized there are certain pigs that do add more pigs when hit. The game doesn't cheat. I'm extremely happy with the game play and ability to build a great team without paying a whole bunch of money. You just need patients and good planning.",
        "Decent game, lots of fun to keep you coming back. I would of rated a 4 star game but every time I need to watch a video the game stops working, stopping me from getting a free premium egg or opening chests!"

Ill update as I see other menus broken.",

I always get thee same armament with only one star!  and some items are soo expensive that the money you pay is not worthy for the br you get and in return you'll get low br and also low money not worthy.. If they make this game less expensive maybe I'll give it a four stars... But no! not this time",

Funny how I pay money and now I have Chinese characters all over the damn game...  THIS is absolutely a pay to play game...except when you pay...the game apparently stops working....",

        "Don't spend a dime if you play this game.  Rates on character drops are rigged.  As you go up in rank they manipulate drop rates as they believe people who invest so much time will pay money to try and get better rather than quit.  This is a major issue.  You cannot do any real events without banner cards and the developers know this.  Again they manipulate rates based on account rank so as you go up in rank your chances go way way down.",
        "Updates keep getting stuck with the ver 3.8.1. Since it was released. Download 269 out of 269 but nothing happens after that, and a message of \"connection error\" keeps appearing. Have passed the daily log in bonus, and will probably lose the consecutive login bonuses as a result. Didn't create transfer code or link to fb account yet so may risk of losing account if I reinstall. Please fix this asap.",
        "This game is awesome however, today I was updating my app and I can't log in. It updated and say open than the app continues to try and update and wont. I can't even transfers it. I tried with internet and my data. I have more than enough storage but now all my time and effort has been wasted. And I feel \"great\"",
        "Tried transferring to new device, now the damn game won't download beyond the title screen and I've tried everything to get it to work. A pity too. I liked the game but I can't play it. All that time spent on my old phone, just gone.",
        "As promised I upped my 3 star to a 4 star because SSJ4 Gogeta is complete now. However it really kills the joy of the game to have to gather 5 of the same SSR to awaken all the way especially when I used some of them for super attack power increases. Find another way to fully unlock characters through the potential grid(maybe a tournament item) and you'll pull me back from Pokemon Duel.",
        "This gacha game involves summoning characters through a \"loot box\" system.  Most games now show rates so you know what you are getting in to.  For this game, however, it do not show the rates on this english version.  For now, just keep this in mind if you decide to spend money on this game.  Until this issue is fixed and until Google Play policies are updated to reflect showing rates in \"loot box\" based games, my review will remain as 1-star"

Apparently according to IA it wasn't my day. Like I said before, game is pre programmed. Dev's do nothing about the gameplay, they rather concentrate on silly add ons which can make them money. Big boooooooooo for dev's.",
        "In overall it's a good game but needs some changes.  The match engine is not so good .  Like promotion to next division , also should be a relegated team from that division to a lower division.  Prices are outstanding. Tokens are a problem.  But i insist AGAƒ∞N that SYSTEM Dƒ∞Vƒ∞Sƒ∞ON needs a new update or review. PUT AT LEAST A TEAM THAT SHOULD GET RELEGATED TO A LOWER Dƒ∞Vƒ∞Sƒ∞ON.  The idea that you have to change the whole team every season is also not a good thing. Some little changes are needed to make this game a wonderful game.",
        "I think it is the BEST FOOTBALL MANAGING game i have ever played.  But you should make some changes,like as tikitaka,counter attack,long ball  ext. These will be helpful for us.we need more tactis. Thank yiu for your wonderful game.",
        "I am playing the game for 1year now and I think you have to increase the percentage of the players when they rest for 3hrs... I think 6% is not enough specially when we have 2 games per day (league and cup or champions league), because after the game, they still have to have two training sessions and they get too tired, with no time to recover at least 50 of condition for the next match, so from ther we have no manage well by leadind \"easy sesseions\" and player do not develop as they should. For me the time of recovery is fine, but the points conceived are to low... at least 10% in each 3hrs. Hope you get my point. The app is üëå I love it",
        "Worst game ever every update just gives more problems and the current problems we message these idiots about are never resolved...infact they don't even reply.. they are only about the money now.. ive gave 6 years to these losers and this is how I am repaid.. disgusting is an understatement.. avoid games made by these rude ignoramuses at all costs",
        "I think u guys should find a way for us(we the managers) to get tokens easier . I don't understand why winning the league or champions league only gets you money but no tokens . it really sucks"

        "Repetitive game that requires a lot of thinking. Quite addictive as I've been playing for nearly year and half now. I didn't spend a penny on game but quite a lot of time. Its very difficult to be very good without spending real cash but it's possible. You can watch adverts for coins, so be patient and play. The more you play the more you get. You don't need top characters to have great team - you can create great team with average characters if you focus on weapons. Get yourself into a good team, hit faction's minimums and you'll become great.",
        "There are good and bad aspects of this game, but the pros out weigh the cons. You can absolutely level up incredibly high without spending a single penny on this game. You just need patience. One of the funniest aspects of this game is its long term playability. There is always something to do every day and in the long run it all adds up to your benefit.  My only complaint is the pop up windows when you first get on. They show you you've been raided...then you have the notification that you have to check that gives you the same info. If the pop up already gives me the info, why do I still have notifications?",
        "Rubbish repetitive game. After spending ten's of thousands pointlessly I can tell you honestly... don't waste your time or money. It's a very addictive cash cow and just a very smart way to take your money and keep you hooked. Scopely has repeatedly lied and will continue to do so. You have been warned",
        "Ive been playing this for 2 years, love it but support is well below standard. I have a problem just now where it crashes every 5 mins and support do nothing. Its become unplayable. Avoid if you have a samsung device",
        "The game has slowly been turning more p2w than ever before. Before 6 stars had come into play, you could easily get any 5 stars. Even some p2w toons were able to be accessed later on in some events. With 6 stars, this really isn't the case. This has also caused the Road to Survival community to become more toxic and started making the game unfair/not fun for other players.",
        "I like the strategy involved in playing the game. The only thing I think I would change is when you kill an enemy and he comes back to life,  they should come back as a zombie. .not keep all their ability before death. .otherwise it keeps you interested."

Because we have to waiting for it to be downloaded before can play again. Can we choose to update whenever we want?  Anyway, this is a really nice game and I've been playing it for a long time. Keep up the good work!",
        "I love the game. There's nothing wrong with it because I feel like it's the old game that I grew up with. But what I hate is that the prices for packs, lp, sp and simoleons went high. The prices before was okay but now I don't think I will spend anymore for packs that give only like 5vip points. Such a fun game but aimes for large microtransactions.",
        "I really enjoy this game, and love developing my Sim's homes and the world. Unfortunately, my game won't open. It hasn't for about a month now, even after this new update. It shows me the loading screen for five minutes, then crashes. It would be wonderful if there could be a fix for this.",
        "Love love love it! This game is actually better than The Sims Mobile... 2 problems,, 1st. The Modern houses with second floor, so expensiveüò≠! 2nd. The time it sometimes takes ages just for one activity!üòê but hey, everything else.. TOTALY AWSOME! üòç thanks so much for creating this game. Cuz its so hard to download the sims 4 in a Mobile. üíï",
        "This is actually cool and I really love this game. However, the expiration of most of the quest that i'm having are only 2 days to finish. I think it's unfair, and the materials needed are too expensive. Sims are busy on finishing tasks so they won't be able to go to work and earn. So I'm not totally enjoying the game.",
        "When you get an event sometimes it only lasts for like 2 days which really isn't enough because some actions take 1 day. Please extend event times and don't give like 5 events at the same time. Also you should be able to log in other ways apart from Facebook because lots of people don't have Facebook. Please make other ways for us to login  so we can get more neighbours."

        "I am only giving ABF a 3 right now. I have played ABF since the beginning of it's time. I feel as if the coin rewards are very slim in the higher leagues. I am a Diamond Star 4 and I feel as if the higher the level the higher the reward but, the rewards are all the same. When you work your way up you want to feel rewarded! If coin rewards increase in the higher levels so will my rating!!!!!",
        "I would give it 5 stars, but they've changed a few things. It's now more difficult to earn coins for power-ups. So in order to win the tournaments, they've put people in the position of having to make purchases more often. Needless to say, I don't play as often anymore. I've also noticed that several of my friends don't play anymore either. Too bad, the game used to be a lot more fun.",
        "Been playing this game for years. Loved it in the beginning.  Seems the lower I rate the game as they try to make easier for people that are not good.  the birds I throw are nearly useless a lot of times compared to playing the same game for a star 2 player I know. And now the game is crashing constantly. Wish I could sell the nearly 100,000 bird coins I have. Seems I won't need them.",
        "Ok so when there is an issue that needs addressed, sometimes it take a couple of days for the tech people to get to it. But overall the game is awesome! This is the only game that I still play every day from the time I got a smart phone, which has been several years!",
        "I love playing angry birds friends. I'm an adult woman and have played since they came out with the game. Scoring in first place many times. Recently there seems to be too much graphics and sometimes using plays from other games or other angry birds games. If people are submitting what they have thought out, please make sure it stays within original angry birds friends game. Some levels are too far out there.",
        "I loved this game to keep in touch with a few friends but please take those stupid Dignity ads off... They do not close and always end up missing up my game. I have to close the game out and start all over. Loosing many power ups and coins in this tedius game making it more frustrating than fun."

Would keep people playing more and they would have more purchases! That's how I'd rack in the bucks if it were my app!",
        "2ND UPDATE: 3/21/18- Thank you for adding new bathrooms and bathroom rugs! Thank you also for giving new, unique furniture on 5th or 7th consecutive days. Great job, and ty for  listening to players and making more  levels and changes and continued updating!  UPDATE: 2/2018 Please make more optional designs to find at neighbors' homes. I've been searching, and I can't find any more. Especially for the bathroom, and for the garden/flowers. That is one of the best features of the game. ty!         Thank you for the new update and new expansion!  Cant wait to achieve the new rooms. Best game!  Much better than \"Scapes\" Games. I like the way you can travel to neighbors to get new interior design fashions! A new idea that is brilliant. I am spoiled now! LoL Thank you and please keep up the hard work!",
        "Good game. Fun so far. I enjoy renovating the first room and the master bedroom.  So far I have only one complaint. Why can't I get the master bedroom? While I'm all for being generous, generosity has its limits and it is MY house. It might seem small to some but it does irritate me as I do love the story as one of the best bits. I'm not the only one who doesn't like her just claiming for herself. It comes across as rather arrogant and presumptuous of her. An idea might be to give me the master bedroom and then give her another where you can design it more to her tastes as a decorator.  Apart from that story issue just keep on going.",
        "Getting a little frustrated with this. I play on both my phone and tablet. When I try to play on my phone it asks me to update to synchronize my progress yet there are no updates available.  I have switched off and on and even uninstalled and reinstalled.  Very annoying that I cannot now play on my phone.  Just reinstalled this and it is working great now. Thank you for sorting. 5 stars all round.",
        "I am obsessed with this game! Love that you can easily make friends with other real players and use their furniture! Mixed levels of difficulty which means you never get stuck on a board for an annoying amount of time. Only thing is that when choosing your furniture, you have to click the picture a bunch of times before it let's you preview it.",
        "I like this game but it's frustrating how it's hard to get stars and then they want you to waste them on things like giving the cat a bath... I want to decorate the house not do all the silly side things."

Unfortunately, i have one issue i can't access the chat room, no messages, cant access mh own profile. It keeps saying network error even though i am currently playing the game smoothly. If you can fix this i would gladly appreciate",

The shop is sucks. Too much chines character. I dont know my goal at all. Etc.. So many issue for this game needs lot's of improvement.",

Not the first time I have ran into this problem.  Please help me fix this.  I have cleared the game data uninstalled and all that nonsense.",

I have been trying to reach AoC support for almost a week about recovering my account.

        "This slot app is one of th best. Many fun and and friendly people. The staff  are helpful  if you have any questions. I really enjoying playing most of the slots. Some of my favorites are in the  classic section. I have been playing for several years. Today I am upset because of deleted chips, went from 1.2m won 690k but they did a minus instead of add. Grrrrrr  üòä Today my chips are multiplied, I'm doing great. It's a fun game.",
        "The thrill of the game I once loved is gone. Games just eats chips so you can purchase more and then eats them too! Games have low wins and keeps your play money low also. I only have it because of my BF Friends and I have money invested in it. BF don't seem to care that the luster is gone from a lot of their players or even care to bring it back!  üòïüòïüòïüòï Still hoping for the best though!",

        "I'm addicted to Big Fish and I keep  coming back for more!  No matter how many other casinos I've tried, Big Fish is right up there at the top!!!  The graphics are good,  the bonuses are good and the tier rewards are the best!!  The social aspects are really good plus you get rewards for/and from friends.  The only thing I would change is the ability to give gold.",
        "BIG FISH CASINO IS NOTHING BUT A GREEDY RIGGED SCAM COMPANY THAT PREYS ON PEOPLE. THEY TRY TO GET PEOPLE HOOKED SO THEY CAN SPEND THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY. BFC ONLY CARES ABOUT TAKING MONEY FROM PEOPLE WHILE RIGGING THE SYSTEM AMONGST OTHER UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR. GOOGLE PLAY SHOULD BAN THIS SCAM APP."

I would have been excited about the upcoming birthday event if I could access my game. Fix soon or I will delete this and all other zynga games I funnel my hard working money into",
        "Great game, love achieving all the quests, also love the show animals, I wish I could do more than one with a partner though. I wish that during an update that it wouldn't stop the game for the players, showing grassy area with no coins or keys and level 1, so I could continue to play. But I know I just have to leave it for a while and wait till the update is finished, which is hard because it is so addictive. Some people need to remember though that this is a free game.",
        "Liked this game until now. I recieved some keys from the game. I used them then they said they had had some technical difficulties and some players should not have received them then promptly took my remaining keys off me!  This was they're mistake not mine. I find this churlish and ridiculous. It's put me right off the game!",
        "Since Jan this game has gone to hell in a hand basket. Every update I have to fight to get stuff back they y'all took from my game. This game use to be fun, now I don't care if I play it or not. Y'all only care a out the people who spend money on your game, not the loyal ones that's been playing since it went mobile. I'm very disappointed!!",
        "I just started playing this game and was really liking it. In one day I made it to level 15 and had made a purchase using real money. The app froze and I tried everything is fix it but it erased my whole farm and made me start over. I am soooooo mad!!!! And I'm mad I spent money and lost everything. Really not impressed at all",
        "When I first got it it worked fine. (Yesterday). Now every time I get on it'll load but will freeze and not let me do ANYTHING AT ALL. I've tried everything from closing the app to restarting my phone. Please fix it because I really like the game."

        "Not a bad game but it's typical like some other games. It starts off with the levels being super easy, letting you build your confidence to get you thinking you're really good.  Now I understand the higher the levels the more difficulty there is but not to the point where they make it almost impossible trying to get you to buy more chances. Another words they're trying to get you to pay to win and advance not necessarily on skill level. Very sneaky. Uninstalling. It's fun for a while but overall I do not recommend.",

Still having the problem of when having to reinstall I lose all my lives and charms. Love the game but hate ,owing all my lives and charms",

        "The update took me from level 400 back to level 1 very upset be first I wasn't getting my daily play rewards so I figured like everything else it may need to update and the update blow my whole progress. I'm so pissed is there a way to fix this?",
        "I actually enjoyed the game and would give it four or five stars except 200 coins and multiple items were taking away simply because I got logged out if Facebook. Also several levels were lost.... This I understand, glitches happen. What I don't understand and don't accept is the lack of response from the developer. I've sent several emails and have yet to get a non automated response.",

        "Overall game is very good n addictive, been playing the game for awhile now. 1 major issue of the game is bugs that cause the game to lag esspecially after every game update. Reali hope Pocket Gems will look into this matter seriously and build a better game foundation. I will review my ratings when the game is more stable.",
        "LOVE THIS GAME!! unlike other timed games you don't have to wait around.  When things are upgrading you can literally spend hours if you want just attacking other bases and breeding dragons.  Graphics are amazing and this is one game that constantly has me coming back.",
        "Wonderful game, all these pay to win comments are slightly misleading. There are several power ups and time reducers that come fairly easy if you participate in events. Which, the events are almost always going on so you don't get bored!  Only problem I have is that the app keeps uninstalling itself from my phone. Not sure if it's the app's fault or my phone, but it doesn't happen to any other app on my phone...",
        "PG needs to fix a lot of stuff. They never listen to the community and with the Atlas update has destroyed many alliances by creating a class divide between teams of all ranks. Huge let down and am afraid of the future of the game when game design decisions like this are allowed to occur.",
        "Fun until you have to wait a day to do something. How can you play a game if the game won't let you play, but by good it takes up space. So you want me to have a game taking up space in my phone but I'm can't play the game. So it is literally a waste of space.. developers are stupid and selfish."

Big advantage.. And you dont HAVE to go platinum to enjoy this game, but I am considering it ! GREAT JOB !!",

        "I really hated this game at first, when i was trying it on a friend's phone. It has really grown on me since then, i love it. I've been playing it for years now and still love it; the graphics are amazing, the game play is smooth, my clan is great, there's always new stuff to do or new bots/weapons to acquire. Yes, there are some people playing that kinda ruin a battle for your team but Hey, it's just a game and you still get points if you lose. Do your best and have fun.",
        "Great start! No glitches. Performs smoothly! One of the best games on Android!! Must download Belive me I have never spent a single penny of \"real\" money and the game has never been unfair to me. Its really very good game. They found a sweet spot to balance both paid and free players. You just need to go on playing. I got the costliest robot of the market for free. Keep playing you'll eventually be strong enough and then you'll never stop to play.",
        "After being so long on the game I can see that the development team behind this game is pretty committed. I can see they really put effort into debugging, improving and renewing some elements of the game, I've decided to increase the star counts for War Robots (This is the original one). It's one heck of a game for mobile device I can tell you that. As for attaining the \"best robots\" or the \"best weapons\" in the game, it's hard but it's not impossible.  Just take part in the festive events... and you don't neccessarily need the \"best bots\" to annihilate your opponents...",
        "This game is very much Pay to Win. So expect some people to crush you.  All the \"gambling\" games are fixed to make sure you get the lowest possible reward. Don't waste your gold gambling. All that said this game is worth 5 stars just for the gameplay. The graphics are amazing and the game is fun even when you end up against someone spending hundreds of real dollars on robots and gear. Be patient. You may not always win or do well but in time you can give all but the most hardcore spenders a run for their money (all pun intended)",
        "It will be cool if we can upgrade not  just one robot but all!! And pls double the gold I rlly need it right now for just 1 orkan And also why is it so hard to get a weapons like with puzzle logo on it it's like 10,000 can you imagine that! If I made the game I would do just 6,000 or 5,000! One more make a single player like player vs AI and it will say easy medium hard",
        "Fun for a little bit of time killing. I really enjoyed the gameplay and Graphics. However don't bother playing this game unless you are going to spend money on it. You quickly realize that everything you need to buy to upgrade your robot cost money or some other in-game currency that you have to spend money in order to get"

EDIT: still no real task force improvements, why it doesn't open straight onto you TF or why I have to go through several buttons to see people starts is stupid. sorting this out make my review 5*",
        "This is not another Clash of Clans clone, but definitely pushes the boundaries of the clan genre. Good graphics, fun gameplay, and balanced in terms of units vs. defences for your island. While diamonds can be purchased by real-world money, the game doesn't trap you into needing them. The weekly mini-game missions help keep things fresh and assist in moving your base up the tech tree if you're patient. SuperCell is continually expanding the game to keep it interesting. Definitely worth a download!",
        "Very addictive and always checking on my base, upgrades etc. Strategic game play, however too much pressure to buy diamonds as it takes FOREVER! !! for some things to upgrade. Seriously. ..2 days for an upgrade??? Only other issue is the limited time \"special abilities\"...they're fun but it makes it far too easy for someone to raid your base and take all resources needed to get the upgrades. Lots of fun and love the graphics",
        "The graphics are amazing for this type of game. And I think that's why so many people love it. The only thing I wish that their could be is offline play. Just block the chats and player raids and only allow campaign attacks and their would be many more players able to play... Bcs sometimes I don't have data or wifi where I am and it's a pain bcs I love Supercell games. And ik why there isn't offline play, bcs the other players that attack you. But their must be some way around that like maybe a whole offline mode. Well if u read this ty and it's a great game keep up the amazing work you do providing us with amazing games...  ~Bladez",
        "I have played this game since it has come out and I have seen all of the changes and they have shaped that game for better over the years the game has been out it has improved and is one of my best games I have ever played. But the down side is that it is really hard to get resources at first but then before you know it you are full and you have nothing to do about it. Also when getting the heros they should make that base a bit easier because the lower level people can't attack till the have a lot better troops.",
        "Great game, but too slow. While I love the lack of pay to win, I'd wish for a way to speed up resource gathering: I've cleared out every similar level player in my area, and spend days waiting for RSS to build up so I can upgrade. Which is necessary before I can access a larger zone. No point buying speedup gems, as I've never anything to use them on!"

        "All in all a fun game which u dont have to pay for.. on lvl 104 now and still enjoying the game and actually progressing too.. thumbs up from me! Update: dropped down to 3* after update. Totally been made to p2w now by adding stupid fusion medals.. was a hrund before but now almost unplayable.. greed have ruined the game for me and will probably uninstall.. many others also when u go in chat room.. not good epic summoners, not good at all.. good game ruined again :(",
        "Latest update with fusion medals ruined the game. Got stuck like many other players. Fusing was hard enough without them (ie collecting 4 same 4 star heroes plus 4 same 3 star, PLUS random 4 star heroes... Ridiculous) to get 5 star one, now you stuck waiting to lvl up your current ones to pass stage boss and MAYBE get fusion medals... Ruined very good game.",
        "What the hell are you people thinking,.  Fusion Medals are the most ridiculous thing to add to the game.   It was bad enough the game cost so much to play, but then you really screw us over good with Fusion medals.   Crooks,. You guys should be in jail. Class action law suit.  Horrible,.   Don't play this game, waste of your time and big money.",
        "They absolutely ruined this game with the last 2 updates! Be prepared to spend a fortune to be competitive! They took away the best parts of the Game! Added another item you need to make heroes that are very difficult to get! Then they reduced the number of dark soul you get when disassembling heroes! I'm a paying customer, don't mind supporting development but not when you feel taken advantage of! Don't recommend this game! Very Very Greedy company! Planners should Be Fired!",
        "New updates have killed game experience.  Now not only do you have to wait to gain xp for adventure levels,  you are now limited on fusing characters.  Lack of ability to gain fusion medals limits game play. Very few other actions log in and play 10 minutes a day and then nothing to do for another whole day.  No ability to move at your own pace.  Everything is limited.  To those that can endure slow pace only way to gain in game is slowly over time with daily log ins."

This is actually better than their console games. Well recent carbon and most wanted are amazing. The newest are hot garbage. This one is fun.reallywish there was free roam or a sand box room where you can admire and test drive  what you have grinded out so many hours to get. Only bad thing. Also the boxes are too expensive leaving having to grind way too much just for absolutely anything. By the time you get anything good this game servers will be empty.",
        "Thank you for making this awesome game, I love it! I've not had this much fun playing a Need For Speed game in years.. Update 2.9.1 is fantastic. Although after updating, I'm having trouble connecting to the game servers... :/ Hope it gets sorted soon! nevertheless, I look forward to future updates. ;)",
        "It's a great game, graphics are ok, smooth playing. But. There are some ideeas that may do something different. Think about a chat room, or a place where players can do some trades. Think about adding the possibility for players to get vip points for watching videos, or maybe one day..open world gameplay. And there could be a lot more features. Thumbs up if you agree.",
        "All round best racing game I have played so far! That said, the game becomes very difficult as one goes above REP 60. It becomes very time consuming to proceed in the game without spending actual money. Useful stuff becomes harder to obtain via docks and via older races, which is frustrating.",
        "The gameplay/races r so short. It takes less than a minute to finish it. And the police cars than u see in the gameplay don't even do anything they just keep going on on there own, sometimes getting to finish line before u. So basically this would be a perfect game for a three year old but incredibly boring for anyone over the age of 7",
        "The game is pretty good, being a free mobile game, it is not trying to hide it's PTW features, but you can do mostly everything without having to spend a penny. One suggestion I think needs to be put in place is a confirmation window when you go to skip a level, because I was doing the speedhunter event for the Mazda MX-5, and accidentally hit the skip race button and lost a lot of gold, maybe not letting me even get the upgraded car now."

        "I love this game. Its very addicting and fun, but I find that there are barely any female dragons. This upsets me very much and I would like for this to change. The only females I see are the dragons with names like  motherly dragon, belle dragon, viktoria dragons, and sleeping beauty dragons. There are also descriptions like \"add some girly pink to your collections with the gummy dragon\"(which is also coincidently a girl). Then I see cool legendary dragons, but OH plot twist they're all boys. This is a very fun game no doubt on that, but please, stop with the sexism and make cool female dragons. Thank you.",
        "Still Having Lot's of Fun! Cool to mix different dragons just to see what u get!  I just opened my 6th island, When I first started playing this game I think there were only 3 or 4 islands & maybe about 300 to 400 dragons. I'm having trouble keeping them long enough to get the next island!üòâüòÑüòÅ!!",
        "Game would be great except for the fact that you can't do certain things without bugging people on Facebook for help. I just want to play the game. I can't level my dragons past 10 without building a special building which you build without gems or bugging people. No way to get gems other than extremely slowly by completing achievements which take days to complete and give 1-3 gems. Supposedly you can watch videos for gems but there is absolutely no place on the game that allows this. If your friends on Facebook don't play this game they can't help you and you are screwed if you truly want to enjoy the game. You can't win battles with level 10 dragons. You can't breed more than one dragon at a time without gems. You can't expand past 2 islands without gems. If you get the required gems to level your dragons past 10, then there is another super expensive building to level them past 15, and get, guess what, you need gems for that too. Other games allow in game friends which this one doesn't and that is frankly ridiculous as it's a \"social\" game. Other games allow other ways to obtain gems like watching videos or trying other games which this one doesn't. There isn't enough time to complete special events for special limited dragons unless you can get gems. Overall, the game would be fantastic if gems were easier to come by and you could make in game friends instead of having to rely on Facebook friends!",
        "Just a few gripes. 1st of all I LOVE DRAGON CITY. Been playing for years. About your survey, I would never. You ask for too many permissions. Tree of life....when I get a Dragon here comes the same Dragon adding up for hatching. Like why? 815+ dragons are more than enough. Why do u keep adding, adding, adding. We could NEVER get all of them as it is. Why more? Love me some Dragon City like a said in the beginning.",
        "The game is amazing, addicting and a lot of fun just to collect and level up dragons. The events that are constantly coming on always make you feel like you have something to do. However when of the events are very unbalanced and, if you are against one of these people, not very fun. The heroic races are a great way to compete with other players to add a powerful dragon to your collection but some people take the fun out of it by spending 100's of gems to ensure that they come first. The ability to use gems during these races should be removed as it is highly unbalanced, or at least add another way of collecting the heroic dragons without having to compete with people who pay to win.",
        "THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! I totally recommend it to EVERYONE who loves addictive games and dragons. I find myself constantly playing this game all the time! I honestly feel like I can't say how much I LOVE this game with words. Again, this is the best game a player can have. Just one thing, I wish there were more ways to get gems instead of just buying 'cause I can't buy anything. So please make gems more easier to get. Also please make the islands worth less gems.üòä"

        "First off to all those saying too many ads, there aren't any ads. What you're seeing is game packs that can be purchased to help you advance within the game. I love the game. Everythingis great. I just wish they would give everyone time to adjust to previous items before creating something new. And also the pricingis too high. $20-$50 is fine but $99 is way too much.",
        "This game has become a cash cow for the developers at MZ. New features are added making the game more complex and diverse weekly. Costing players money. While old features players are familiar with and depend on break down  After contacting MZ you get a nice form letter stating thank you for bringing it to there attention but they hope you understand these things take time to fix.",
        "This game should be awesome, but the updates just come too fast now. I bought 2 packs this week and still got zeroed as soon as i dropped shield. By the time you spend 2 days clicking upgrades, someone is stronger than you and just waiting for you to try to use your new stuff.",
        "This game was fun about two years ago before MZ started trying to milk players each month for money.  If you buy a package from them,  which ranges from $14.99 to $399.99, make sure you get what you pay for. ..many times you don't get everything they promise; especially with the BOGO packages.   MZ will do little if anything to correct the matter.  Also, even after you spend tons of money, if you wait long enough they will give you the same stuff for free to all players.   My advice...find another game to play. ..something more fun and worthwhile. ..and not sponsored by MZ.",
        "If you want to be at top of this game then be prepared to spend more than the price of a top end BMW in one year. I am not kidding. MZ releases major game changing upgrades every day for several $99.99 packs. Then you get tge worst customer support in the industry. Terrible software quality control and business practices that mirror drug cartels.",
        "Mz took a once decent game and ruined it.  The weekly changes are senseless change is to be gradual.  Im finally walking away.  Im done with ur bots, done with admin accts and done with daily chances.  More and more people have quit and droves more will follow.  Choke on the money u got from all  of the foolish people who actually paid.  You deserve none of it"

        "This game is perfect for those who played any moba style game. 2 buddies of mine play this the same we used to back in the first 2 years of league of legends. Short games, almost no existence of any real \"pay to win\". No heavy dedication required to get started. Great for the casual and hardcore gamer. Not for those who haven't even seen a moba style game before. Just needs more items to buy in game, but can't expect perfection from the start. Overall 4.7 from me",
        "Cool game very fun few negative though. Snowballing is way to easy one death and you basically lose lane. The controls need to be better they need a target lock mode. Its hard to keep on your target even with hero icons on. Being able to only use the jungle talent if you have a jungling item on sucks. its so hard to comeback if any bit behind as i said snowballing is to large.",
        "If you love League of Legends are definitely going to like and enjoy playing this game. One of the best games out there. You don't need to spend any money to be one of the best players it's all about skill and having a good team structure it's nothing about spending hundreds of dollars of real cash to get the best items because there are no best items! You do not have to pay to play this game and be the best!",
        "The connection and reconnecting sucks, I always end up idle or AFK because apparently my connection sucks but it's perfectly fine. Reconnecting takes forever and by the time it's done the game is already over and I'm reported for AFK when it's not even my fault the game's connection sucks.   Other than that the game is fun to play and a good time consumer but they need to work on better connection. I kept on getting warnings for my AFK when the game kept on glitching and it affected my phone so I had to restart the whole thing.",
        "Way better than Mobile Legends. I use to be  Mobile Legends Die-Hard All the way but this is the best MOBA out there. I have no idea why this does not have 50+million downloads. ? Do Not Judge By Front cover. PLAY THIS AND SEE WHEN YOU REACH RANKED MATCHES MY FELLOW MOBA PLAYERS.",
        "Played both the international version (arena of valor) and the Chinese version (honor of kings). It is the better mobile moba in the market with great control and smooth gameplay. Having DC heros in the roster is a big plus.   Downside is the lack of content compared to the Chinese version. Sure it's a fairly new game, but if this game wants to be as successful as honor of kings it need a lot more content to keep players engaged. More meaningful events (not the crappy one that give you 5 gold for winning matches), way better skins (seriously check out the skins in honor of kings, so much better) thats actually appealing to people. And please let people unlock arcana pages with gems instead of paying real money."

They should be more life like. Add more games to play at the Miraggio casino.  Add more cash outfits not as many kstar outfits.",
        "LOVE this game and have done for such a long time as I'm a huge KK fan. My only issue is, that it's pay to play for sure.  It's hard to make money and gain k stars. Everything is OVER PRICED. Even to just furnish your home. I hope kim and Glu reconsider this as not everyone has money to splash on what you need to progress more quickly.",
        "I've spent probably thousands on this game because I liked it, but I'm having serious problems. Back on March 13Th I bought yet another hundred dollar kstar pack that did not go through. I was able to confirm the order and they \"added it to my account\". The problem is I still haven't gotten it. And I've sent screenshots showing I have not gotten it. I've purchased several other packs of various prices and I've received them all, but I've still, to this day, not received the hundred dollar one. I keep getting bounced around and told \"just do a hard reset\" which I've already done several times as well as turning off my phone and everything. That doesn't explain why I've gotten the other purchases but not this one. On top of that, the \"help\" I've been getting has been taking longer and longer to even respond, each time though I'm getting the same unhelpful answers.  If it was five dollars I would have just forgotten it, but I'm being screwed out of 100 dollars with no answers. I'm extremely disappointed.  Buyers beware.",
        "Pretty cool game. I did buy the small star pack and it never showed up. Kinda lame. If someone could look into it that'd be great. I would just like to receive the stars. Not a refund. Please and thank you",
        "I've read some of the comments and it seems this game is a rip off. You purchase things that you don't get then you report it and all they say is, it was put on your account when clearly its not there.. They have no problems taking the money from your account in seconds when you push confirm.. A friend got me playing this game, actually she stopped playing because she purchased something that she never got.. So yeah a total rip off.."

Would be really nice to have a banking inductor a stock market where you could trade financial products like other cities bonds or debt. Financing during the game can be a big problem so having a financial hub from where you could trade and borrow would be really useful. Thank you for developing this amazing game.",
        "This game is crazy and awesome at the same time. My population has been awesome. Just 2 months and it was from 0 - 92 000+! The crazy part is when I see a blue hospital sign, the people dont even tell good reasons. ALL THEY DO IS SAY, Sometimes I go to the clinic just to read MAGAZINES! My citizens are so crazy JUST BEACAUSE IN ONE HECTARE, I AM A GOOD MAYOR!",
        "Too much waiting for things to get made and produced. The storage and items for upgrades FAR too difficult to get. 42 items to raise storage by 5 items. And it can take weeks to find all the items. When you go to global storage and find an item that you really need, by the time that you get there, it's already sold! üò† Also, it takes 3 different items, and you have 3 of one item and 24 of another. Really? Also, it should be that you get needed items more often, randomly rather than at specific times. Other than that, a good game.",
        "Like the competition challenges it holds your attention. the time frames of production are a little long however the markets move products fast. I also like the club wars and the mayors challenges. My dislike is there are not enough thought bubbles in the fact that you only get two the rewards should be more frequently.",
        "The new arenas for war are terrible... There is a massive lag time... I can't even get to the war after rebuilding until the game thinks for approximately 45 seconds... By the time I actually get one shot off it's a minute and a half... Then I'm almost dead and you come back with I'm sorry we're experiencing connectivity issues get it fixed please!"

You can only get so far, then you a required to spend actual cash to continue playing. If you want to max out your base you better have DEEP pockets.

I started back and spent  littke money cause I missed my alliance people I started to consider family after almost a year of play.

If you don't have the money, then starting out new, you'll be at a stand still around HQ level 20 & commander level 50, with only increasing power by researching, training more troops, & building traps for your wall. This game has been slowing down a lot lately though, not sure if it's the game or my phone causing it.",

But you cant get triangle unless circle is moved first. And mission failed because you didnt get diamonds in order. This is repeats over and over again. This is impossible to solve. I even had to deal with triangle being right down at the bottom. And all other diamonds at the top. I failed of cause. I am giving my view because I fed up with this stupid idea.",
        "I really love this game. But expeditions are more fun then the game itself. I really wish we could actually finish the expeditions instead , of not getting to finish the story behind them. Also during the expeditions to buy things are way to expensive because the amount of maic it takes to remove one item. Pls address these issuea. Really hope to see some expeditions we can really have fun and finish with.",
        "I love the expedition part but not enough time to complete them. Also i cut one tree down and have to wait an hour to cut another. Its takes to much magic to clear paths.Its hard to build the bridges and stuff because of this. Other then that i have no problem with it.",
        "Love the different puzzle styles that go along with the basic mahjong matching game. It gives an extra challenge to completing each game. Sadly I have only gotten to 250 levels after a year or 2 of playing because the puzzles are constantly rigged to lose. I am not a cash player as I have more important living expenses to spend money on so buying power ups and such are not an option for me. Would be great if there weren't so many losing games one after the other. I'm referring to the ones where you get to the last couple of tiles and the gems needed are at the very bottom so you are made to match the 4th set of gems when you are supposed to match the 3rd set first. I get multiple games where the matching tiles are stacked on top of each other so it requires a shuffle to win. As I said I am not and refuse to cash shop on a game that is not worth spending money as it is not a necessity so it would be nice to be able to progress without 10-15 losing games in a row. The spinning wheel doesn't always have ads available and I rarely get power ups from it. I mainly get paws.",
        "Game updated now havent a clue what i need on level 421 and objects i need are blank boxes can play game but dont know what i need if any one can tell me object amount and what levels they are on it would be a help. Also have uninstalled game a installed it again but still dosnt help."

        "I really enjoy this game has been the only game that has kept my attention for more than a week. Working on week 3 now, most of the game is free but if you want to grow your port quickly than you will need to play into the game. The game really starts to slow down after level 50, I'm up in the high 60 levels now. I do really enjoy all the quests and they do add bonus quests from time to time to help build up your port.",
        "A fun, easy-going game. No crazy-pace required and easy to advance.  The amount of unique ships is crazy, I think only fan of nautical history would really enjoy this aspect. The list of active ships should be available from your town, instead of only from map view. Other than that, it's quite enj9yable and not a complete time-sucker like many 9ther games. Well done.",
        "I just started the game a couple of days ago, but I'm already hooked.  Like most games, you kind of learn as you move along, but a little more guiding would be very helpful. Thanks for making a fun game! I am having a problem getting past the loading screen though. I tried clearing cache, forced stop, delete files, even uninstalling and reinstalling again.",
        "Easy to learn with loads of variables to keep it interesting. Graphics are stellar. As with most 'free' games, there are lots of incentives for you to get out your wallet; if you're as unwilling to do so as I am, you'll have to be patient. Can't fault the developers. Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat.",
        "If you want a game you can tap on a few things then come back a few hours later, this is it. Not any real goals though so after a while you do feel what's the point but the graphics are good and the events are good too but it needs better goals to help you achieve something. I just do what I want for now. Still play it though",
        "I don't mind spending money on micro transactions if I like the game, and I do like this game.  But the jems in this game are outrageous, if you wanted to buy jems to buy one ship it would cost you $10-$20, depending on the ship.  Because of this, this developer won't be getting any more than the $4 I've spent on it unless they lower their prices."

The rewards for victory are so small it's almost impossible to upgrade your base unless of course you pay for a shield,but even that's a scam cause with a shield you can't atracvk enemy bases.  Everything is basically pay to upgrade or spend forever trying to save up and even then. Bottom line ftx games are a scam. A shame too I really liked the game at first. But once you start buying stuff for it, it keeps you in a position where you have to keep on paying to have a chance.",
        "Many time bought gold as soon you'll purchase gold the same time upgrades of building will increase by 20 bar of gold... I check twice before purchase was 100 bar for upgrade building as soon as I purchased went to 150 bar of gold ... the same building to upgrade... and rewards are like nothing ... used to loved it a lot but now seems to less liking it because of this..anyways game is awesome but need to invest a bit if you need survive out there in cartel",
        "Great fun",
        "Waste of time and money. You watch adds for a speed up, nothing happen, you install other apps for gold, nothing happen, you submit a report to customer service,nothing happen, they send back problem solved and they didn't do anything about. I bought gold for the app from one of their sponsors, nothing happen. I report it , a girl named Daria sent me back a email and said problem solved, guess what...NOTHING HAPPENED",
        "Total rip off dont waste your time or money. Ever since update..its horrible. The developers will swipe your gold away (basically your money) and give an excuse that your bank or Google issued a refund. After showing and providing evidence that your never received a refund...they do nothing about it! Straight run around. And good luck talking to support..generic responses like the one they give on here.",
        "This was the best Game i ve ever played but every new update creates alot trouble and tension of users. Forta spoiled the games fun. Now they want people to spemd money on scorpion. When they make them. They will introduce a sicario for that too... really dissapointed with tge way you people robbing money ftx."

        "Love the game but I think the bonus levels to unlock gold crops should be heaps cheaper to play. Some of them are hard and you run out of money to keep trying them as they cost as much as a normal level to play.",
        "It looks good and the gameplay is fun. Unfortunately that fun only lasts so long before the game devolves into micro transaction hell. Each round gets so expensive that I can only play one or two unless I were to buy coin packs. These guys should be ashamed.",
        "Really fun game but costs too many credits to play and the extra five cards and wild are over priced considering the cost of credits per game round. Could be better if these issues get resolved I would edit my review to five stars all around.",
        "It is a fun game. BUT, the levels cost so many coins that it's very slow. Unless you plan to pay real money or can win every level 1st try, expect to play maybe 1 game an hour."

        "So much development has went into this game, the reason why I like it is because of the consistent updates and new stuff. It's hard to find games now with nothing new to bring to the table. It makes you want to invest into this game. Not to mention how generous they can be with the free gifts and whatnot. Keep it up Netmarble!",

        "This game is awesome. Love playing it everyday and everytime. But  recently I have a problem with the game crashing almost all the time. Please help me fix this problem.  I also want to ask when will you give Odin a uniform? A better skillset, a heal, and a piercing ability for him to shine again as a god. Looking forward to it Netmarble.",
        "There are some incredibly predatory practices with the in app purchases.  For example, if you buy the new Emma Frost pack, you won't get her work fully leveled gear, and that isn't made clear on the purchase screen.  You will need to buy the package at least once, and possible multiple times over to actually advance her.",
        "Give credit to where credit is due. You guys are taking a step into the right direction. It is a small step, but still, it shows us that you listen. So please listen to us more. The game needs improvements on existing game modes that is becoming stale and boring and repetitive. Most players are also waiting for new game modes. This new update, Version 3.9, is like sending a message to your players that you are listening to them, and that is a good thing.",
        "This game was good. The past 6 months have just been a display of how game companies do not care for user experience but rather their pockets. Cash grab all the way. This game had potential to be the greatest, but a pure let down for the entire community."

        "Wow! Just WOW! I had been very skeptical about downloading this huge gigabyte and pay-to-win game, BUT after finally \"trying it out to see\" I am now hooked and now a believer of all of the hype! I have gotten pretty far so far and have a pretty decent crew and I have not had to pay a red cent at all. The grinding in this game is actually fun and I do not mind watching an ad or two for fuel. Simple concept, EXCELLENT execution!",
        "Wow, I'm extremely impressed. The gameplay is very fluid (as it runs on a 60fps on my s9+) lagging and unrealism is unheard of. Also, the soundtrack throughout the games retains just as much excitement as you'll feel beginning the game, viewing car selecting and racing. A must have game for car/racing/gaming enthusiast's. Very additcting.",
        "Ok, my game is back but I'm missing a lamborghini 700-4 that was decked out completely with fusion parts maxed out and stage 6 nitrous and tires. So, you owe me a what, 4 start or 5 star car decked as my car was you took from me. I bought crates with money real money for that car. So I want the closest thing to my car the same as it was. Thank u",
        "I used to love this game. But now all it has become is an ATM for the developer. Every good car in the game must be bought. Winning special events costs money. In game rewards have become useless. There are plenty of other racing games out there that won't require you to refinance your house to play. If I could give it zero stars I would.",
        "Sound could use tweaking, I've driven some of the t1 and t2 cars and they do not sound like that. The grind is real in this game but the developer adds events on a frequent basis to over shadow this. Which would be great if the events didn't expect you to either have the devils luck with silver key crates or a never ending supply of cash.   Over all, great game. I still enjoy playing it even when I hit a \"pay wall\" and that says something about the game. I've only put $5 into this game (bought a $4.99 special pack) and I've still made it pretty far.",
        "This is by far the greatest racing game I've played on a mobile device! The graphics are amazing, the controls are solid, and it keeps me coming back for more. The only issue I've found with it so far is the live races. Its sometimes hard to find a race and the races themselves seem unfair at times. Other than that, its a great game! Highly recommended!"

        "I love to play hold em, but it's just to hard to round up the posse for poker night due to simply getting older. Life takes everyone n different directions. Not too mention, having kids and getting married, doing the family thing. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love living the family life with my wife and kids but I will always miss poker night with the fellas. Now that I have stumbled upon WSOP I have been able to invite all of the fellas to join and we can all play together still once again. THANK U!!!!",
        "Seen to many players leave because of this. Players with over a billion in chips. Goes to a small table with players having 30k or 40k. Goes all in every hand and kills the table. Players ask him why he does it and not play bigger tables. His answer because game allows me to and I can knock out player after player. Regulate players if they have X amount of chips play on bigger tables. Let the smaller players gain chips and enjoy the game.",
        "It appears that I have reached a certain point where my free play is being met with bot resistance. I've gained over ten million in one day and lost it all and more in suck outs. This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you'd have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun",
        "Win a bit and loose everything in a few hands...  Once you win a good hand, leave the table.  Dealer will not give a a chance.  After this review, I received an e-mail from the designer assuring me, that game is fair.  I have been losing several hands with pocket KK, QQ, JJ, and so for.  So I stand with my original review.   Win on a good hand and leave game.  Or else you will lose it ALL!",
        "This is a good game , only prob I have is there seems to some hackers/botting which makes it a little hard to play. Now as far as some people's comments even if the  people with a billion chips come to smaller tables , if you all knew how to play you wouldn't have to worry about them taking your chips. Trust me the majority of them started out at low tables also having to have to fight the ones with more money. I have been playing this game for a few years and love it.  Like I said only problem I have is to many bots/hackers.",
        "It would be better if they offered more free chips. Rather than bombarding us Every time we log in with there outrageous prices. Also a flush draw Every other hand and usually someone hits. Barely won a hand since the negative review also. Complete B.S game. I agree with all negative reviews here. 4.5 rating? Haha, most reviews are negative.  Done and done."

        "Love this little game! I wish we had five life's, Three just gets me started. But overall, it's a great game. Getting like Candy Crush the higher the level the more impossible it gets to finish. Please don't make it so hard to win. I keep having to use coins to buy lives. Can never build up enough to amount to anything. Also you can give cash on the scratch off card. PLEASE !!!",
        "Very hard and not as fun as the other games but  because you cannot even solved one level in a 3 lives. My friends do not want to play when I showed them how it is being played. I've noticed that the first part of level 3 is more fun now than before. But still the 2nd and 3rd level is very hard. I admire those who completed the whole cities. They must be geniuses in algorithms in solving the 9 moves in one level. The most amazing part of this game are the graphics.  Awesome really awesome.  Very well done. Still playing this game but also still cannot convince my friends to get out of CC and other games. Will keep on trying though.",
        "This game is set up to STEAL a certain number of lives before you can win a level. Some levels, like Venice, level 79 may never be won. I have bought extra lives twice, extra moves twice, I REFUSE to make anymore purchases. If this was a truly user friendly game, it would BANK any extra moves, lighting, and other bonuses you've earned but did not use. But no, it throws them out. STEALS what you have earned. BANK it for me, I earned it, I should get to keep it. I'm done with this game.",
        "I am glad for the staff at big fish they did a wonderful job getting me back play after all my levels where lost.. They found them all and it made me happy that i can play where i was.. I can not play to often sometimes and had taken me a long time but look forward to every new city i get to open a new and all the challenges i get to participate in.  Thank you all for this game",
        "Fantastic game!  I love the graphics and interesting bits of trivia shared every time a landmark is built.  I also like the extra daily challenges and the special events that open up every so often.  Gummy Drop is challenging but can be played without needing to make any in-app purchases.  One con: the game starts you with three lives (lives replenish after 20 minutes), but in order to permanently increase your lives to five, you must pay $10.",
        "Surprisingly fun! I was setting the ads for this game everywhere but thought they were really unappealing. Work on your ads a little to emphasize the fun prizes for completing levels, the enjoyable hunt for tour letters in old levels, the history of the buildings you save! So many great things happening in this game."

        "The only problem I have with this game is that, if you have brought everything out of each of your stores and still have coins available WHY CAN'T WE USE OUR LEFT OVER COINS AND BUYS SPOONS? Cause you can't do nothing with left over coins in each state. Other than that, it keeps me ready for any challenge.",
        "I absolutely loved it compared to the other games because it's absolutely free with literally thousands of levels and different menus (so you don't get bored)... It's a great balanced of easy and challenging (but still achieveable without spending a single cent)... My only complaint is that every now and then it hangs (but that's quite rare)... Great job!",
        "The game is fun when it works. Every time I unlock a new restaurant or a new region or bonus level or ANYTHING it won't download. I get a \"connection error\", and the only way to get past it is to delete the game, re-download EVERYTHING (which clocks in at over 100mb) and try again. Update 3/15: I emailed the devs over a month ago and have yet to get even an automated response.",
        "After all changes in Dublin its n impossible to win levels without purchasing spoons and boosts. It was a great game but it slowly got ruined by the greedy developres i guess. Well..guess what! I am not spending a dime on it and I will just stop play it.",
        "This game is fun, but it would be much better if they make it so that you can watch video ads so that you can get more spoons, boots, and lives. You can only watch a video once or twice for a life. I definitely won't spend my actual money to play this game. It's not a home counsel game.  Also, this game gets difficult quickly. I'm in the Paris level and barely making it through. I like to play this game for fun and to pass time. But the difficulty increases makes it not as fun.",
        "I love this game but the fact that you can't use coins to buy spoons really annoys me. I wish they at least had an option to convert coins to different currency so that you can buy stuff in the next locations. What are you meant to do with your coins after you've finished the city?? It's such a waste."

        "The app is really good. It's addictive. But, I really feel they should give out cash or diamonds more easily. If we could earn diamonds or cash for watching a video then it would be great. Cause it takes time for the looks to get voted and until then we cannot play and wait for the diamonds. It's kinda sad. Hope they'll look into this.",
        "Really enjoy this game but its very hard to do well unless you pay real money to buy extras! There should be more benefits without paying for them and each comoleted challenge should provide more money and diamonds than it currently does! And it should be easier to move up levels- I've played for months now and still only at level 5! People will just get bored of playing",
        "So this game Is fun and addicting BUT it favors those with money to spend. I understand that the creators of the app want money from it but at least make it fair for the players when it comes to voting on outfits and such l. The hair accessories in this game cost $10 which is 1 accessory for 3 -5 hairstyles. That's a rip off.",
        "A very addicting, interesting game. The graphics are very real and there are hundreds of styles and brands to choose from. One problem is, it is very hard to budget your money. You get diamonds and tickets every day, which helps, but it is still hard to keep a good income. Otherwise, Covet Fashion is a great game, and I would definitely recommend it.",
        "So the new GM for Covet has blatantly admitted that they are pandering to LCV/new players now. I have spent THOUSANDS on this game to get myself to hcv in 11mos and now I'm being screwed over for it? What kind of business favors new customers over established ones that spend the most money? These are the same players that have openly admitted to voting against us!",
        "Love this game. Only thing I don't like is that when you buy something it only gives you one item. In the Design game it gives you several when you purchase an item. I find it hard to play this game bc I run out of money and diamonds too quick. If that aspect changed I would give it 5‚òÜ"

        "I love this game up until it asked me for a loan for one of the characters for 250 gems that i purchased. I contact Tech support and nothing is being done. After this last update I lost slot. It started off awesome but once I started investing money in the game it's like it just took my money by taking the gifts and coins.  Such a waste of time and money when no corrections are made.  Trying to give the developer a chance to redeem themselves from this error.",
        "I like the idea of changing prices and finding new recipes. I want the barista to automatically start the machines if there isn't one already there. i want to be able to hire another barista. I want to put my menu on the other wall. I want smaller windows. There's basically a lot of things i feel limited on and i still haven't figured out if i can change the color on wallpaper or not.",
        "I watched the 4 adverts and got a no diamonds for the doing so. I also watched the the add to pick a bonus prize, never got a that either. I used to play this game a lot and I've noticed the prices of everything have went up and including the spices. You no longer have the option to buy the cheaper furniture forcing you to spend more so customers come in to the Cafe. Very greedy and game makers. Sort these issues and give me the diamonds I'm owed or take away the ads.",
        "I'm used to like this game very much, addicting and lovely although it is so p2w. After certain update my game will start to reverse progress itself when one message pop out and state \"profile change, please restart\". Recently this problem occur very frequent and its so unbearable and irritating when what u done it just become undone, ALWAYS.  Im so fed up with this and quit for few days, wish developer can fix or lessen this issues or i will just uninstall it one day, thanks for reading.",
        "In the world of cafe games this one is a gem that stands out like a diamond in the rough. Fun and easy to play, it's set at a relaxing pace with you learning new recipes and chatting with your customers. Who are all really interesting people with unique storylines....I think one of them is trying to steal the Mona Lisa,lol.",
        "Fix the controls! Atleast have an option to enable and disable the editing of the layout or location of the items in-game. Such a pain that God-forbid you touched an item for a half a second too long it will prompt you to move, delete or put that item in storage."

I hope the developers will include edit mode in the next update so that the players can rearrange their city..Also, I hope they will also include a 360 rotation of the city and add factories that can also create materials needed in the game like the railroad materials and steels. I am looking forward with this updates!!",
        "Great, but really needs \"sell all\" function for dealing with store house and \"pecial buildings\" components.This is a really quality game, looks amazing, works well and has good timed construction projects. However, as others mention it takes SOOOOOOO long to accrue the assets for construction and the mega bucks for expansion. You have to be VERY patient if you are not willing to part with actual cash. An idea might be to offer a conversion of coins to megabuck, maybe get 1 buck in excahge for eg 5,000,000 coins?",
        "I love this game. Just like other reviews say, it is addicting and because there are constant tasks to complete. Plus!..unlike other games, there is no way you ruin out of coins/money. The cities bring in alot. I can't agree with one reviewer that megabucks are hard not come by.  I began with 25 I believe (now at 32) and some of the tasks to complete give megabucks without spending actual money to even purchase some.  All in all, try this game and you won't run bored of it.",
        "Good game but......after a day into it you make no coin. After every level upgrade it pushes the (buy) equipment option. Not to mention every time you level up. You got to.exit out 15 boxes.before you can continue. Good game but, it's a failure on the free to play aspect.  My rating is fair and final. It's a (ok)  game but many better ones out thwre",
        "The new update is great! Really appreciate the chat system. But it could be better... maybe add some functionality to the capital buildings and states.... maybe bonuses to taxes nd pop, loans, and coop science and military missions. The prices of capital building materials is ridiculous. Fixing these will make the state system look more complete.",
        "Been playing for more than 3 years, i lost count. But this is a wonderful game which encourages teamwork and neighbor support. There are barely any paywalls in this game and  if you have hundreds of facebook friends who have this game you can easily get the materials you need to expand your city. No limits so far. I give ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖs"

        "The best casino App I have played yet. You get to choose avatar and  have them choose which casino on the famous Last Vegas strip. Well you earn more casinos as you level up. And the balloon pop is fun too! And I won alot of money on the community bonus round. Where the people playing next  to you win during the bonus!",
        "Was good at first but, at a certain point the game is rigged worse than real slots in Vegas. Good rewards and all but, issue I have is I play a certain slot game longer than people who join later and they win large amounts immediately whereas about 90% of the time I lose chips more than win....I even switch up my bets and have bought chips thinking this would get the game to allow wins and nothing. Wanted to get enough V coins for Cirque but rather just pay full price at this point.",
        "I'm 6 levels shy of level 2000 and I just wanted to know if the daily reward and the hourly rewards will ever go up??? That'll be a great opportunity for players who reach a certain level in the game to collect a higher amount of money!!!   Also, how about EVERY weekend you'll do a DOUBLE YOUR MONEY when buying money!!!  That why you'll be making more money and customers can and will be very satisfied ever weekend...   P.S. THANKS FOR THE AWESOME GAME üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç",
        "It's cool, but one of the gimmicks is that you can play with other players, the problem is there is absolutely no way to play with your friends, you can only see the progress / help / be helped by complete strangers. Even if you invite a friend through fb... nothing. Not worth downloading until they update it.",
        "21 million in coin, the new game popup hi low comes on. I play, I go back to my game all coins gone. The Emerald 7 kept playing while i was gone evidently. But how does 21 million disappear with a bet of 300k in less than 5 minutes. This is second time I have tried this game. It just wants you to buy coin, jokers.",
        "If you have any problems with your chips, dont expect them to help in any way. I was losing chips after bonus game on cleopatra. They pretty much said its my fault."

        "This game has been great to me forever, and I never had a complaint but this recent update has driven me here. The trophy cap is a real kick in the nuts and ruins the game for casual gamers like me. You now HAVE to advance through the games prestige system and keep resetting all your work just to help out a gang. And if you are in a strict gang like I am, they require 100 trophies a day. If I keep advancing, I won't be able to keep up with that. This is all a money grab by zepto now. They want you to have to pay to keep your machines strong so you can compete.",
        "I love this game. I have been playing it for a very long time. I play it every single day. I like the new updates however it seems you are getting away from the original game and focusing more on ultimate machines. Increasing the prestige levels was awesome but you need to also add additional upgrades with them as well. I have over 100 paw upgrades that are completely useless to me at the moment.",
        "Look this was a great game, worthy of it's previous accolades. Sadly since then it's been progressively ruined by an ever more aggressively enforced attempt to move to a pay to win model. Previously you could achieve anything in the game with a bit of hard work, then they tweaked it and you could achieve anything with a bit of hard work and team work. Sadly though what's happened is soft paywalls have been introduced, things you can't outright buy, but will only manage with financial outlay and change after change is being introduced with new soft paywalls and new ways to try and cash grab. The game is on a steady but rapid downward decline and to any new players I would avoid picking it up and investing your time in it now.",
        "Update: Now it won't even open. Once you find out your progression is rigged, the fun wears off. You will have a win streak going, them \"mysteriously\" a machine will show up with just the right set up to beat yours. Then once you finally get the right configuration to beat that one (however long that takes) another machine with the perfect set up to beat yours shows up again preventing you from progressing. Over and over and over....",
        "Great game, easy to play and a good time waster. One thing I would like to see in a future update  is a scroll bar for the parts in your garage. It would make it a lot easier than swiping through them, especially for those who have a lot of spare parts like myself. Other than that, awesome game.",
        "This game sucks. First it is really hard to get good equipment. Then it is also very laggy. Everytime im playing the game it freezes right when im doing something. (Mainly when im customizing my car). Think about it when you are getting ths game to take up storage. If you'll excuse me now I've got a game to delete."

Or when you jump off a train and there is one of those things you have to roll under but you have no time so the police catches you. Or maybe I am not good with those things. Yeah, probably just I am not good at this game.",

Can't that be possible at least for a week if one on it to her their records it shud be like that for the rest of the week. Most importantly  subway surfers consume too much data. But wen updating every month and for that reason I humbly demand that this game company provide physical cash reward for those who are consistent for us to tell others who are asking us who subway surfers help. If we tell them benefits we derive I bet u more people who are lover of games will wanna be part of subway. Trust  me....  Tnx in anticipation",

        "Very pricy game with limited game play. You will spend a lot of money to advance. There is no other reasonable way to play. Too many moderators/players( they play for free) who steal/destroy resources causing you to spend even more money. The game is a money pit. Stay away.",

While it's a P2W game, I assure you it is fun and addicting for just casual play. Lots of contents in the game to keep you playing.  Finally, DEAR DEVELOPERS kindly reduce the stamina consumption and the number of soul stones needed for raising stars. This helps us, casual players, a lot."

I think people forget that your \"FREE\" games have to make money some how to pay developers, animators, IT support and more. Either they have dozens of ads everyday (DK has a few but not dozens) or premium paid content.",
        "Most addictive game! Playing it since it 1st started. Love the new mystery event it's so adorable except your missing one vital character!!  I think there's a couple points to improve on... the send home button in the characters actions list I think should be up the top and smaller instead of scrolling down for it cos I use it often. 2nd all of the sounds in my game are very poor, it's nearly always silent and music is always late. Haven't heard the high 5 sound in ages üòî please fix the sound!",
        "The game is fun and all, but do you think you guys could get this game optimized for the Lenovo tablets? I had to get a new tablet since previous one broke. Now the game keeps closing out on me when I'm trying to do something. Think you guys can fix this somehow?  I'd appreciate it if you do. Thanks in advance.",
        "This game has given me nothing but problems. Every update has to have a glitch. First there was a problem when ever I tried to open a chest. Then an update came and After that update now the consetion stands close out the game anytime I want to view. Now with winnie the poo update the whole dam game is slow. Seriously thinking of quiting. It doesn't matter every update has a glitch. Can't u guys fix it? Or is just me?",
        "This is a fun game. Graphics are so very Disney.  I have a question.. WHAT is the reason for the guests to have a character over their head? That is quite distracting..especially when I don't know what their purpose is.  Also..I wish their leveling up and their quests weren't so long..I only get to play about 5 minutes. But I do love the game",
        "This game is amazing! I love it so much! It just reminds me of my childhood, and of all of the TV shows I used to watch. I have only 1 problem with this game, it does not count time when you go out of the game or close your phone. It might just be me, but if it wasn't for the bad saving, I would have given this game 5 stars, since it deserves it, or even more."

Put real investment properties that generate different amounts of income such as restaurants, casinos, beachside properties etc. Add more equipment and even vehicles like Hummer, armoured truck to boost your attack and defense",

        "I have played this game for years now. Great new levels, still challenging, and fun ways to earn power-ups without having to make a purchase! Loved it until it quit working on my phone. Doesn't even crash anymore, just quits mid-play and I lose whatever progress I'd made. I play when I can on my tablet, but it's just not the same. I don't know why it won't work on my phone without spontaneously closing! 5 stars if it did...",
        "I love, love  this game is difficult to play, but to my opinion is the best game on line ihave been playing for 2 years and my goal is to beat it . you get rewards. I spend money but with the rewards you get something back  ,also I just started another game with is similar like pandapop and iam a also give it 5 stars . even that iam a grandmother of 72 years old. I still popping. !!",
        "A wonderful game to have very fun and exciting install right away you won't regret it. I've reached level 1049. It is super exciting to me learning how to Ricochet the balls off the walls. The projection of the angle need it. This is my all-time favorite and I highly recommend it to my friends and family. Plus, the little bit of flaws and the enemies within the game, will have you taking a break and coming back for more. Just know that I've deleted this game twice but always came back to it because this game , is fun and challenging .  If you don't like a challenge you won't like this game .  Just so you know , it does not require internet, to be able to play this game like others. Technicians please put out more games that don't need the Internet to play. This game is one of them. Just know that option is super helpful. We need more games able to be played without internet intervention. Ty taking time to read this. Have fun a Poppin. LOL",
        "Not bad, not great. Randomly stops in the middle of play and you lose a life. Also takes a long time to load and to move to the next level. Okay for free, but if I paid for it I would be asking four a refund.  Update: I've contacted the developers multiple times. They keep sending the same canned response.  Game crashes frequently. Frustrating when you are just about to finish a level. Uninstalling.",
        "I use to give this a 5 star rating until I lost all of my panda belt progress when I updated, 5 days ago. I sent a report to you and got a message that said there was a problem with the update. I'm still waiting for an answer on when this will be fixed. I refuse to play any levels or specisls, like badboon lair until I can receive the panda belt credits. If I don't receive the panda belt credits or if I am not credited for the points that I lost I will uninstall this game!!!!!",
        "I loved this game and have played it for a few years now. I would have given it 5 stars, but for the last few months, it just closes on me mid play and I lose on my progress, as well as any items and special powers that I used to advance in a level. Very frustrating to lose items and have to start all over on the level."

        "Sometimes I would give it a five star other times 4 star. Good number of challenge keys per visit to none challenge sites. As few as two visits needed for one visit to challenge site in final level of challenge (requiring 25keys). Love the two modes for cards of fate. No time limit but fewer tries works great if you write down what you find. It surprisingly has improved my timed play of this mini game. There are getting to be too many items and NO search functions to facilitate where to find a particular item, what collection items belong to if someone wants it and you don't want to send it anonymously (case if you send a requested item) and don't send it from the gift bar. One of the better hide and find games.",
        "I changed my previous rating. There are so many glitches, especially with new events  and support doesn't respond to requests. I haven't gotten totem bonuses for three days and new event is nearly impossible at times to find bunnies and objects. This used to be my \"go to\" stress reliever but now it just creates more stress.",
        "Instead of relaxing me this game stresses the hell out of me. New bunny location is extremely hard to find the üêá. And the time limit is too short. I know im wasting my time writing this cause I've seen a lot people complaining about it and nothing is been done. Will be unistalling if it doesn't gets fix. Good day",
        "The main complaint is that some tasks have insanely short timers, like for the new event where you have to find optionnal stuff that's really well hidden as well as the usual pack of items that usually takes the whole timer to find. Great game, bases itself too much on money dropping.",
        "The only thing I don't like about the game is that by the time you search a couple of places (depending on ur level) is how long you have to wait to get enough energy up to search again. Depending on what you want to search it can take up to an hour or more to get the requirements. Other than that I really like the game."

        "I love playing this game. It is now my favorite phone game of all times. I have seen other reviews about waiting for energy takes too long. It does take a long time but to me that is part of it. It makes you slow down and enjoy simple fun. Too be honest all of us need to slow down and enjoy life around us. I play it on my breaks at work. The way you play this game allows for  short or long periods of play . Also it's quite fun seeing the little guy demolish tiles. It truly is an awesome game. I have recommended it to family and friends.",
        "I deleted all of my games except for Diggy's Adventure. This is my favorite game. I am going to play this game until me and Diggy win, and then I'm going to play it again from scratch. Google should make a whole lot of games like this. They are way better than match 3 puzzle games. I love cats I wish they could make a kitty's Adventures game like Diggy's Adventure.",
        "I've played this game for almost 2 years and have not once had a problem and have spent a lot of money. For some reason it's now crashing every few mins. I don't lose progress or anything but it's getting frustrating to have to keep restarting. I've even updated the app on my Android. Please help? It's my favorite app and I just want to dig!",
        "I really like this game but... It has been glitching A LOT for me lately. While I am playing it will freeze my phone. If I walk away for just a few seconds it freezes. My favorite glitch is after I watch a video for energy and before I use it the game kicks me out. Upon my return the energy is gone and I can't get energy for 2 more hours. üòê",
        "Very addictive game but you spend more time waiting for energy than playing. When you have unavoidable tiles of over 400 points it doesn't take long to lose all your stored energy. I thought games were for playing, not waiting around. It's play for 5 minutes wait for an hour. It's a shame because some of the puzzles are quite good.",
        "I love this game. It's super addicting and best paft..you don't HAVE to spend money on diamonds or add ons to actually play. I really get bored of games when all they want is more of your hard earned money. So keep up the great work."

        "I've love playing this game since I began. The main issue I have is that when you buy a new device to play on, none of your progress is saved and you have to starts back at the very beginning. I had more than 80% of the venues open, over 1.2M coins,  and nearly 100 gems. I bought a new phone and nothing was saved. That sucks! Can someone respond, find a way to save your progress so if you switch devices to play on,  you won't lose what you've gained and maybe return my earnings!",
        "This game is good and addicting it just sucks with the fact you need to use gems from everything. I wish it was more things to use just money for. I have all this money and run through gems quick and it takes too long to obtain so I end up not playing for a while. A good way of doing this is through earnings that you collect from your restaurant. You can receive 1 gem",
        "The game is awesome, as for the loyal players like myself your game isn't fair with the diamonds on the casino spin üò¢ I play everyday at least 8hr or more and only receive 15 gems every two days or so. Please try to rectify the situation I have never received double or triple diamonds on a spin and I've been playing for a year or so. Why?????",
        "UPDATE 4 the NEW BUILDINGS PLSSSsss? TY... Cant Wait. Hope its coming real real soon and REALLY hope theres MORE to come after. U HAVE A WINNER GAME HERE. i bought ALOT of games, & this one is on the top 5 list. Keep up the great work guys/gals. Awaiting the new buildings. lol.    :-)   TY",
        "Game is very fun and addictive. But you shouldn't have to spend few hundred dollars to play through the game and play all of the restaurants. Yes you can earn gems for free but would take an insane amount of time with each restaurant requiring more and more for each upgrade as you go on.",
        "Please improve the casino...it's kinda a bit unfair because no matter what I've spent, I don't seem to get a lot of diamonds... considering that the places require diamonds to upgrade...so in order for the game not to be so stressful, you should really improve the casino."

        "This is great! The best romance game I've come across. Only thing is maybe more female love interests and definitely have a system that gives you like 5 hearts a day? Just to get those back because I haven't played the game in a week and a half because of no hearts.",
        "Hearts are too expensive and the hearts needed for some choices are way too high. Daily loggin rewards don't have a good enough chance to get them either. Stories are great and I enjoy them very much. Would recommend for others even those who don't want to spend the money. I myself haven't paid a cent because of the high prices.",
        "I really enjoyed reading different stories. Loving this apps.Just please add more tickets... and also it takes forever to waitq for the next season or episodes..it spoils my excitement.. please don't make us wait .. your stories are all really good..just make it more fast in adding new season or episode please please please",
        "I've been playing the game for a really long time now since I was 13 or 14 and am now 17 turning 18 this year and I'm sooooo happy with how it's grown but the one issue I have is the hearts thing. I can't pay the specific amount to get a whole stash of heart and it really bugs me because I love the options that you give us but I don't have hearts...can you please look into it and come up withe something ?",
        "This game is addicting and is very fun I think you will love it.I did so try it out and see what happens.The one I loved the most was gangster love ash so I advise you to try that one out if you want.Also with the gangster love series try out chance he's fun"

It would help us be less grindy. It would help with collection and able to get legendary easier plus monthly revenue. I would love that. Compare to MFF which is a lot more hectic, you guys a bit more generous. Just please don't put any paywall characters. Hated that.",
        "Fun game but currency is insanely expensive. I don't mind spending money but this game is ridiculous. So instead of me spending a little I spend nothing. I guess my wallet thanks you. It's also so hard to level people up... They keep introducing new characters I have to level up to keep up with alliance missions. Those are fun but I want to level up my other characters too!",
        "It was a great game until they introduced Deathstroke. Now you either need to have him(I do but it takes the fun away) or have people specifically to counter him. They made him way OP and arnt nerfing him anytime soon. So if your just starting you will want to spend money to counter death stroke.",
        "PVP is broken - Lowboy tactic and forcing you to use the back of your bench (or hurt your alliance) ruin most PVP days.  It's a known issue that they wont fix or failed to fix.  Devs gear game towards whales completely and tailor all modes assuming you have every toon maxed out at all times.  They try to change or fix the game but always somehow make it worse.",
        "PVP is now worse than ever! \"We've reworked it so you earn more points\" NO! We now earn less points because it's impossible to beat higher rated teams and still have full team remaining which means less points and why is every one of my battles only 3-6 points? This clearly isn't the same as others given their points haul. Fix the stuff that doesn't work and leave the stuff that does!",
        "Agreed that DS needs reworking but not frm one of the best to the weakest. Developers, do you even play your own game?? Wasted my $$ & time invested in him. I don't even have lobo if you think I use the 'lowbo' combination in pvp"

        "New Review because of update: ¬∞ I really love this game. I'm hooked. Relaxing yet stimulating. Some levels are easy as cutting through soft butter with lots of delightful bombs and others take several tries to master and need that one devise a strategy and some others are much up to luck. I love that variation: relaxing and stimulating and sometimes a bit frustrating. ¬∞ I had finished all the levels of version 2 and then waited for an update which came with new levels and I finished them also about 4 weeks ago. I've opened the game every day since to see if yet an other update came, and yes, yesterday it did and have already finished all levels (that says more about my fanaticism than it says about the difficulty of the game). ¬∞ I appreciate the tournament (I topped the monthly yesterday but had dropped 3 steps while I was sleeping and have clawed my way back to the top this evening, but I guess I'll be back down tomorrow. But it's fun! And I got generous daily prizes. ¬∞ And I love the new version that even though I again have finished all levels, I can just go on playing thanks to the Level Tower (even if it at 46 repeated a previous level). ¬∞ Lovely graphics, good game sound.",

App should provide ways to earn more tix, either thru a daily spin or higher rewards. *(since app developer replied to this review, I changed my review to 4 stars)",
        "The game itself is very fun.  However, if you run out of tickets, it is way too difficult to earn more.  Apparently, they made it easier to earn tickets but after playing many other games, the update isn't enough.  To continue playing, you must buy tickets.  I may have to delete the game which is a shame because it really is a fun game.    3/18/18... They tell you to play lower cost games to get more rewards but it doesn't.  It just takes you a bit longer to go through your tickets but you don't win anything.  Time to delete.  Graphics were great and games were fun but without tickets you can't play.",
        "Really liked this game. Now i cant play it because its near impossible to get more tickets. I cant complete daily tasks as I have no tickets and ive got to wait ages to get daily tickets. Even then there gone within 5-10minutes and cant get no more until following day. Games dont pay out enough either when you win",
        "It's been nice...I'm happy to share: they heard us. We can earn power now, the games are fun, excellent pace. Thank you \"Dataverse\", I appreciate your changes üíØ ‚ò†‚ò†‚ò†‚ò†‚ò† UPDATE: n again 1/11. again: I ventured and came back. I can buy credit in January. Cuz we HAVE to have boosts to play long. Here I go !Update. I like a lot. Spent 20 but you simply can't spend enough.  must buy boosts too. Boosts get stuck",
        "I really like this Bingo  game.  A few upgrades and it will  be better than all the other Bingo games.  I love the amount of tickets it gives you to play.  I love the extra stuff you can earn and not have to pay for.  A couple of things that would  make this game better would be all 4 cards on one screen in tablet mode, the power ups being applied automatically  and being able to daub that last number that's  called cause usually that's the one needed for Bingo.  Otherwise its great.  I hope  you find this useful.  I understand  if you can't  fix all three of these but the first 2 are more important  than the last and i understand  there can only be a certain amount of bingos i guess.  Thank you.  Real close to being a 5 but those 3 issues really hold me back as I'm  sure it does others as well."

        "Cars could look better and authentic during the race. They look like miniature toy cars. Not even look like the real car. You should patch the game after some time, after you have the revenue. Cars not even look like they \"look\" in the real life. The gameplay is alright so far, might become enjoyable for a longer gameplay.   Just started, but I wasn't suggested to invite my friends to play. Correct it also for making the community larger. Where is the option to play with my friends? Also, any crew creator option? So far , 4/5. Started yesterday",
        "I normally hate card base games, but I saw the preview as an ad on another game. So I thought it looked good enough to try it out. This game is HELL A LOT BETTER than the preview suggested. It does have pacts of cards to buy with real money, yet at the same time you earn gold coins to buy same packs. You can easily save the gold coins to buy these packs. LOVE THIS GAME",
        "Its still crashing very frequently.  When are your going to fix thisüò° its has been over a month. Its starting to have server errors now it is getting too unstable can your fix this!!! its not adding my trophies. how can i have 0 trophies won for 1 week straight. pls fix this.",
        "Hi... The game keeps crashing down after the recent update.. Can't even write to the support team about it, it crashes just seconds after I start the game.. Help!",
        "I liked the game but the reason its a 4 is because on the 0 to 150 races i have a car that its high is 157 mph but it just randomly stops at 134 and says dnf my car is way faster plz fix the Chevrolet Impala 1967 and my Chevrolet Camero 1970 can make it to 145 mph on a mile drag but cant make it to 130 mph on a 0 to 150 race, thats bs plz fix these cars' top speeds plz. They r broken",
        "Great game, constantly playing, was crashing this morning but fixed now so up to 5 stars.  Would like more ways to make money once the campaign is 100% complete, maybe more, or replayable campaigns, or new game modes all together, but still great fun."

        "I find it a little tricky to navigate sometimes, since it makes my on-screen navigation bar disappear. I like it but maybe I would like it more if there was a back arrow? Also the ads are pretty annoying. They randomly pop up, they're always a video, and there's not really any insentive to watch them. But all-in-all, it's a good game. It's pretty entertaining, it isn't very time consuming, and I'd say it's at least worth a try. Thanks for reading",
        "Really disappointed. I played the party game to win the St Patrick's badge. I came 2nd place when it finished and ift said I had won a badge but it doesn't appear in my badge collection. Then I notice that the party game has been extended by another 24 hrs. Now I'm 96th place. That's not fair. I won that badge fair and square can you give it to me, please?",
        "I love this game, but the ads are over the top. Can I pay to make them g away again? I don't know what happened, but I had a paid version with no ads before? I played a few games but the abundance of ads made this a stresser instead of stress relief. üòü",
        "I love the game but HATE the way advertisements are difficult to dismiss. You are forced to view the same annoying ads (mostly for silly bubble popping games)... and sometimes the cancel \"x\" button is so small it won't close the ad when clicked multiple times. I've been playing this game over 2 years and just had to CLOSE the app because I couldn't dismiss an advertisement.",
        "I haven't been able to change my profile picture since December. I keep getting an error. I thought the most recent update would fix it, but still am not able.",
        "My wife and I both bought power ups yesterday March 17. Big sale right?  I had 20 something already and only ended up with 133 after buying 180. My wife bought \"180\"  twice thinking she may have made a mistake the first time and only ended up with about 300 total. She already had quite a few to begin with. Ripoff!"

        "I hate to say it but what I thought at first was a cool extra is now ruining the game. It's no longer competitive on skill, it's just about how much you are willing to pay to get upgrades which negates any skill involved. It's just a money grab. If you don't pay and upgrade you lose!  Simple as that. So if you want a game with skill this is no longer it. If you want a game to empty your wallet to feed your ego then this is the game for you!",
        "Super glitchy!!! Love this game but I'm getting crazy annoyed!! Lost my lucky spins used one and it took 4 off me!!! The game has done this multiple times!! It needs to bed fixed, remove all the bloody adds.",
        "Could you guys maybe cool it with the damn ads? I can't even navigate the menus now without a 60% chance of getting a 15 second video about some crappy game with \"war\", \"clash\" or \"clans\" in the title...  Other than that, the gameplay itself is ok. Aside from maybe the lowered necessity for Tetrises because of power-ups or the annoying-ass \"some pieces are affected by gravity, but we won't point it which ones until you cause them to drop by attempting to set up your next move\" mechanic.  Seriously though, those ads after EVERY GAME NOW are cancer on toast. Knock it off.",
        "To many cheaters on the tournaments and no way to report them. Doesn't even make sense why they would cheat, it's obvious when you can watch the games. Spoils it so much for others",

        "I used to play this game and it never gave me the option of saving before and it still doesn't. That was over a year ago. I love this game but when I had to get a new phone I had to start all over, so I didn't play for a long time. I just recently redownloaded it and it still doesn't have a save option. When are you going to change that? I play one of your other games and it has a save option. When are you going to give this game a save option because I have mentioned it before and nothing has changed. I want to keep playing but I would also like a Google play save option in case I have to get a new device.",
        "This is a great app. It has great graphics and doesnt make up anything from the actual show like other games do. My little sister is just crazy for this game. She even pursuaded her friends to get this game! Amazing game, no flaws. Definetly worth 5 stars!",
        "I like this game. But there's a bug. When I try to watch a video to play a mini game for free, the video freezes but the pop up ads don't freeze.... It doesn't make sense.  Why add pop up ads when we're already watching them for the free mini games.  At first I couldnt put this game down, I became addicted, but since the bug started to happen, I started to lose interest.",
        "I'm not sure what happened but my game reset. What also stinks is my game used to be glitchy when I'd leave the game a day later and come on, not even two seconds passed in the game. If highly suggest to stay on online mode since that seems like the only mode that keeps time",
        "This is bullcrap! This is the second time this game has all of a sudden stopped working and I cannot get back in to play. I am soo disappointed that you keep letting this happen!! I seriously could use some HELP!!! Please FIX this issuse immediately!!! I want to continue to play MLP... :'(",
        "I will give this game 5 stars if u can get some help.  When ever I try to open my inbox to look at my shards or collect the hearts I have been sent,  my game just crashes. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game,  playing offline,  clearing the cache data and almost everything else I can think of. Also when I try doing anything with twilight I can't do any tasks, plus I can't find twiligr either.  Please help me. I love this game. But I may stop because it keeps crashing"

Nothing at all.  I Folloewd all of the list the developer told me to do now I lost my game all everything I have done the loss of alot of real money an still have got refund or info how to. I loved this game. Now not at all we hold our end of the contact why are you allowed to break the agreement. Its now 2016 an I still no help",

I will update my review with 5 stars when the game us updated again to the way it was.",

They sent me an email today for me to uninstall the game and reinstall it and that they said should fix the issues. Well it started my game back at the beginning and the is no way for me to retrieve my last games progress which was pretty far along. This use to be one of my favorite games but on Android it still is fun but to many bugs and like I said CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS"

        "I absolutely love the story line and I've spent more on the game than I'd like to admit. But spending money doesn't really get you much farther because the energy goes so quickly. I think you would get far better reviews and more happy customers if you got rid of the energy system and upped the ads for more revenue from that standpoint. Then you could keep the micro transactions for the secret scenes. This way you'd still be making money,  but your customer retention would go up. I have so many ideas that would help this app out and I'd love to share them as I love this story. If you are interested in what I have to say please reply",
        "I love the game. Wish we didnt have to pay for every secret scene and had a little bit more energies before having to wait for more or buy some. Would be great if we had more options for free energy. Love the story and characters. Hurry with season two already!!!  Im anxious to see further stories on ryan and the character Lol ‚ù§.",
        "It's really a good game. It's awesome! But that energies are my main problem! Don't you think that...... only 300 energies that means only 30 lines are not enough and too little for a day..!?..!???!.. and 10 energies per line isn't too much!!??! Please make it down to 5 energies for each lines...and only for dialogues.. And if you give 500 or 100 energies (if 1 line cost 5 energies then there will be only 100 or 200 lines. Not much for a whole day!!!!!) and take 10 hours to get free energies again then the game will be perfect!! Everyone can't buy energies (including me)! You know! Please consider this case sympathetically.!.!..  I beg you.....!....",
        "Lovely story line... love story that keeps you coming back everyday.... at times we are urged to buy energies.. however the energy provided gives sufficient dosage of the story each day... sad that it's going to get to the end...  And i wish I could go back and re read certain moments which is not possible.... apart from it.. this is amazing...",
        "Great storylines!!! Great graphics!  However the energy to even do one chapter is way too low!!!  There should be more choices in filling up the energy.  Let your veiwers choose to watch more ad's or something similar to games where each day you can have one chapter and keep the secret moments as a paid option.  I myself would  have more of my friends play,share and even buy if the cost wasn't $100+ for ten chapters!  Oh and FYI check your editing just a few hiccups in a few clips.   Huge fan on the writer/authors...  Very steamy!! Sincerely JR",
        "This game is misleading. You can only play the \"secret scenes\" if you pay, but the wording makes it sound like your choice so you keep playing in hopes you can see one. And the secret scenes I assume are the ones which actually push the relationship forward. The game staggers and is deeply misleading."

Even with the dark matter bonuses and increased infectivity from your bacteria slots it takes too many attacks and nanos. The game desprately needs a way to penetrate shields, or reduce shield strength.",

I have over 100x the required about of bacteria to destroy a planet but it still says i can only take out 99.48%.  I have currently 75.528 oo bacteria and the planet Esloytis says it requires 47.310 nn bacteria to complete, but im at 99.7%. The numbers being dealt with are literally astronomical and unfathomable as a human, but following the progression of the game so far it would seem i have fathoms more bacteria than should be required.",

        "This has a lot of potential. Connection issues are horrendous after this last update. Also, add a help section that explains what everything means. Lots of stats, numbers, ratings, etc. that we have to figure out on our own. Another thing, stopped receiving notifications after updating to Oreo.",
        "Overall it's pretty fun and addicting.  My only real issue came up with today's update. My 40-rated team got matched to play against a 60-rated team in my first Challenge game. wut",
        "The game was great until the update. Took my team from a 43 to a 41. Put alot of time into it, hope this gets worked out. They also nerfed training. Don't even bother wasting 15 coins on an extra session.",
        "Update: ***500 coins for ~350k in game cash isnt even 1 rookie signing.... you can get 3 star players for that kind of coin. **** the latest updates have added cool new features like the coach analysis, fewer bugs and more consistency. The coach analysis function could be cool but every description is \"this player is making great progress, keep pushing him!\" Even for aging players who are getting worse as the seasons progress. It does however project where the player could trend stats wise.  Still no goalie stats. Still no trade options (not sure how that would wotk) but they added refunds to contracts you release from your roster which depend on the player and their contract value,  time remaining etc...  Would be cool to also be able to make in game adjustments, like if your star goalie is letting goal after goal slip through swapping goal tenders would be nice otherwise there doesn't really seem to be a point in having 2 goalies even on the roster.  Overall it's a Fun game with a LOT of potential, if you're a fan of hockey you should definitely give this a try. Would like to see some of these things as the game develops",
        "Please fix how it automatically signs a new player if you don't renew a contract.. the purpose is to dump cap space and it signs some random player and then won't let me release him.  Also STOP changing my line ups. At any point any time ever. There's no need to change it or else you night as well play the game for me. I spend alot of time re doing them and then next thing I know every thing is changed. Not sure why or what causes it buy it is annoying as hell",
        "Overall it is a decent game. However finding an opponent for the games especially the rank games sucks. Either you get another player who is far superior to you or another who is far below your level. It needs to be more equal to be fun."

        "Not worth it. The stories are TERRIFIC.  problem is you can only have 1 ticket per hour. If you wait 2 hours for 2 tickets your still going to get 1. The only way u could have more than 2 is if u purchase . So for that reason I'm installing sorry I can't wait that Long and sometimes I'm barely active and can only read 1 chapter is just not my thing.",
        "It's alright. The stories are super good. But the GEMS üíé are sooooo bad!!! You get 20 or something to start with and you can't do anything exciting without having Gems. So I'm gonna uninstall because im sick of waiting for gems. If you didn't have the whole gem problem then this game would be amazing. PLEASE SORT IT OUTTTT!!! {then it would be 5 stars easily!}",
        "This is a great game. But everytime I try to open the game it crashes. Not to mention I just bought lots of tickets to read the chapters and now I can't use them because the game keeps crashing. Either fix this or give me my money back.",
        "To make your own choices.... You need gems!   Well too bad there's no way to get more free gems.  You get 1 gem for reading a chapter.  But that's not near enough to actually make the choices you want.  If that was fixed and you could get more free gems,  game would be more awesome",
        "The stories can get a bit addicting. However, the tickets you need to read them are ridiculous. I can go to sleep, wake up, and only have one ticket. It says you can speed up to get another ticket by watching adds. That's OK. But I've watched so many adds and haven't received even one ticket for them. Honestly debating on deleting it. Seems like a big waste to have to wait so long. Especially when you like to read the stories. There's a couple apps that are better. And you can get further with. It seems the only way to actually enjoy this app the way I want to is to spend money to buy tickets. Why spend money when I can just open a book?"

The only thing that would make it better is if they actually gave out gems. This is their 1 downfall - not receiving any gems at all. Therefore, you are forced to either buy them or select the choice you didn't really want in order to get the free choice. This, of course, changes your storyline. However, you can see at the end of each episode the percentage of your choices compared with other users and its normally in the 90 percentile. Still this is a wonderful game that I would highly recommend.",

        "I love this game. It's very dynamic and the gameplay is good too. The only problem I have is every single time I do PvP... It pairs me with an opponent far greater than what I can hope to beat. Sure, that's great for improving, but it disheartens me and makes me feel like a horrible player when I can't even beat ONE PvP opponent, ever, while playing the game. I would suggest to the devs that the matching system be a little more flexible when pairing. Give us a matching system that will actually give us lesser prepared players too so we can have the fun of winning, as well. Also, I am disconnected every single time I do PvP battles and bounties. Quite unstable, unfortunately.",
        "Amazing shooter game, awesome hero collecting game, great multiplayer game. Definitely suggest that you at least try it out. But one thing you should look out for, it's pretty easy to sink between 5 and 20 dollars a week into this. Sometimes even 40 to 60. But, it's pretty free-to-play friendly if you can't afford to buy some gold.",
        "I really like the game. It's fun and has enough activities and quests to keep you occupied for a while. My only complaint is how they match people up for the PVP missions. Sometimes you get matched up with people with far higher power and Team level menu which makes it nearly impossible to win. other than that I really enjoy the game",
        "Super fun game. I haven't got bored of the game because there's always events going on which is good. One of the better if not the best shooting game I've played. I think there is a slight glitch when using Steele. Sometimes after I activate his open fire skill he doesn't shoot when I press the shoot button.",
        "Latest update definitely made the game harder. I used to run 4 gauntlet levels with little issue but now I can't get through 1 without losing people. Resurrected characters are completely unwelcome and unfair in pvp when you tell on kills for money. Probably going to uninstall, you're welcome for the money Hothead",
        "Starts off ok but then the pay walls creep in and you are constantly bombarded with prompts to spend money. The PVP is absolutely pointless, highest power rating wins every time without exception so you know if you've won or lost as soon as it picks an opponent. Needs a lot of work before I'd consider dropping any real money on it."

        "I wasnt sure about this series at first, but it's really grown on me. The unique art style, interesting characters and immersive world make this an incredible game, especially considering it's a free mobile app! I would definitely love to see more sims like this in the future, (especially with the bad boy type). Seeing it transfer to desktop would be awesome! Overall, everything about this game is wonderful but, like everyone else says, the amount of energy given for free isn't enough! I think it would be wise to either lower the cost of energy actions take, give more free energy out, or split the story into parts in which 1 part can be played for free each day. Other than that it's a great sim!",
        "My absolute favorite of all of the Is it Love games. Colin is an amazing character with an equally amazing backstory, and the way he connects with the MC is just incredible. The twists and turns in each chapter leave me craving more of the story. The energy they give you is somewhat lacking, but I'm used to it by now. Highly reccomend!",
        "Really don't like how the guy treats the girl, what a scumbag! Plus I've been playing for over a week and the plot is unbelievably slow, the energy doesn't last long enough. There are much better otome style games out there.",
        "Well the energy situation is beyond annoying. You only get very little for free and the prices for the energy and just WAY too expensive. I do like the story a lot though and will probably take 8 years to complete the story so I don't have to pay 50 bucks",
        "OK, so I absolutely agree with everyone that the energy you get for free is nowhere near enough & packages are too expensive for what you get. I know, I've bought many. This story particular started bad, but now that I'm at the end, I'm hooked. Please continue to update. I have lots of bought energy going to waste!!",
        "I don't really like the concept of earning energy every 24 hours. But I've got to say every time i see that message when my energy runs out. It leaves me on a cliffhanger and it keeps me in the story. Even if the energy wasn't there i would still play the game to my hearts content! Overall AMAZING story and characters!!"

It was getting tiresome going down to mine, a cave somewhere in the middle to find to restart a mission, then back to the top to smelt/craft. Then you have the auto mining platforms that are movable but one wrong touch and it resets.   Graphics were great.  There are other game like this, that don't spam ads during nongame play, that are equal or better",

Weapon upgrades now stupid requirements - latest needs more obsidian than I've mined in over a year.... Get a grip on reality people!",

        "I've liked this game for years. Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you're still coasting or you're in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You've had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven't fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!",
        "The best racing game ever, I've played this game along time ago. the first version it has 4/5 cars it was so fuuun.That was 5 years ago now I want to play it again.I feel the nostalgia ooohh the good old days.Now I'm going to install the game.U guys change my life Thank u guys soo much guys. I hope my tears will help u guys. :)",
        "Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it's just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............",
        "For this game to be so simple compared to todays games and grafics, I love it. I spend hours sometimes playing this.  Not to mention they keep upgrading and making it beter and better, keep it up fellas....i havent experienced any of the problems mentioned withthe updates others have but until then great game",
        "Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!",
        "Its a very good game without any tension of wining any difficult task...I like it very much and its not much addicting I have played many games but its very different. controls are also good but this game needs some practice . I am enjoying this game because the tasks are not very difficult but at the same time not very easy its a perfect game and the main character of the game is very funny he always sleeps in the vehicle.....so finally.... I like this game very much"

It's very faulty when it comes to accounts. three times already my account has been locked due to getting new phone or accidentally trying to connect it to my Facebook. I lost over 9 weeks of hard work and dedication to this game and I refuse to attempt it a Fourth time. Uninstalling.",

And then there is that glitch that happens a lot of times when you try to start a race and it uses your fuel but never starts, and that happens consistently. Please consider fixing the problems.",
        "I first got this game because it seemed interesting and whatnot, but I then completed the tutorial and went on to race other people but when I pressed the race button, I lost 20 energy but I didn't go on to race anyone or do anything else really. I then pressed to race button again and again and nothing happened other than me losing all of my energy. I don't know why this happened but I'd like compensation, thank you.",

It makes me think that you're not receiving enough money from your offers. Oh, and by the way, your offers are terrible. Nobody is going to buy things fairly priced. We want bargains, and less advertising."

        "Fun, easy to play, complex to reach higher levels, this game has, so far, been great. No microtransactions (thus far) to continue playing, which is a huge plus. A few have stated a couple of bugs, which I agree with, adding only one other comment; I do wish their was an offline option for at least some gameplay. Online still necessary for a lot, but offline to run some dungeons. This could, in theory, help with some server space, as well.",
        "This game is one of the best game I ever played in mobile. I love the graphic which is cute and there is so many content, so it's not boring. And another positive side, you can get the special currency easily in the game. It's not a p2w games ^^ but the sign board was one of the best micro transaction I've ever seen. Try it and you'll see.. it's a lot of fun ^^",
        "I've been looking for a game like this for ages! I was a fan of Runestone Keeper and wanted something similar for my phone. These guys knocked it out of the park. I rarely spend money on phone games, but these guys deserve every penny and accolade coming their way. Fun and  simple, yet brilliant in execution and design. Tons of content already, and I can't wait to see what's next. Keep up the great work!",
        "This game is so much fun! My only complaint is that the gear is gone when done with the maze, so you start it over. As well as \"learning new titles\". It gets kinda old having to start that over every time you beat a full maze. But that aside, this game is definitely addictive! Keep up the great work!",
        "Your game is amazing. You guys are amazing. After everything you went through, you deserve these stars at the very least. Your game isn't pay to win, it's just a grand experience and I love it.  One of the BEST games on the market easily.  Keep up the good work, you're all doing fantastic.  Respect",
        "I've been playing like nine months and it's very addictive you really grow and have many choices. It's truly free to play and gems are everywhere. Buying a signboard for real money is the best bang for your buck and a lizard if you feel like buying something else.  Totally recommend it. I only hate getting creator gumball is so expensive other than that it's a great game. It's a game that goes as fast or as slow as you feel like playing."

I am enjoying this relaxing, mind game however, I had to reset my phone and all my progress was lost...not cool! I've contacted the developers / company twice with no fix offered yet.üòîüòï Hoping to get an accommodation and a way to avoid this issue in the future!",
        "This is a pretty awesome app which makes our mind to formulate words with the given letters. But many a times we come across words for which we are unaware of the meaning. If you guys can create a small block on the screen which displays the meaning of the last word created/accepted. Then this app will become an ultimate learning app or say vocabulary building app as well. Hoping to see the enhancement is sometime near future.",
        "If I could give zero stars I would. This game was great to pass time and a good game for a brain teaser. But recently bought a new phone and even though I signed into Facebook it did not save me levels coins or anything else that I worked so hard to get. It reset me back to the beginning. So never buy a new phone if you don't want to start over.",
        "I really enjoy playing. Addictive even my husband downloaded!  My only frustration is that myself an him paid for no ads however he seems to get perks such as extra random coins an i dont! Why?? The game is good but doesnt feel consistent for all.",
        "The advertisement I saw for this game, WASNT EVEN THIS GAME. I downloaded it expecting a different time of word game, looked like a whole bunch of Scrabble word tiles lined up and you'd choose words. This game is nothing like that. Its ok, but very misleading advertisement and disappointed in that.",
        "It's fun and cute. I like that it gets harder as you progress. Edit: March 17th, 2018. There was an ad after you completed a level and that was fine. That's how it was last night and usually the ads were quick. Now there is an add at the very bottom of your game which really makes it difficult to concentrate and you accidentally click it every time you shuffle your letters. This was 5 stars, but now it's going to have to be 3. That, to me, is very annoying and eventually I'll stop playing altogether as a result."

I love playing this game it has some of the most fantantic story lines and great graphics.  Again I would like to thank all the staff at My Tona makers of Seekers Notes and especially Amy Smith for all her help. Trina   P.S. I would like for the makers of the game to make the COINS available towards the purchase of RUBIES - either at the bank or in TRADE at one of the shops, I have $2,509,310.00 at this time and still accumulating, I never use that much at the shops.",

Challenging enough to keep me interested it can be a little frustrating that is not as generous as it could be with producing items needed but it's not so slow to produce as to put me off. Love the challenges and find the interaction with friends is simple. After the most recent update I noted a lot of complaints but these all seem to have been addressed by the developers.",

I played 5 games bought credits and I didn't win nothing. I been playing everyday and bought credits no winning. What's up? We are not winning real money so it should at least let you have some fun. If you are buying credits.",
        "I'd give 5 stars but the 'free coins on us' links continuously says that I've already collected them although I haven't.  Otherwise,  this is one of the most fun slot games I play.  The refill of free points every 15 minutes are great and I enjoy the challenge of doubling them, tripling them and so on.  Thanks for the fantastic game but please fix the 'free coins on us' broken links.",
        "Need to hit more takes a long time to build back up when your low on points. I love this game but can't play when your down low on points. I'ts one of my favorite games. Now it won't let me log in and I love this game. Please help me to get on so I can play and get my points.",
        "Had given it 5 stars previously still love the game but in diamond storm every time I win a jackpot the prize value just about goes down to half. Have sent a message but never got a reply as to why. I feel ripped off",
        "It doesnt eork.  Constantly jams up. Whenever you tap the rewards collect button it resets.  Uninstalling etc has achieved nothing.  It did work very well for a month or 2 then all downhill",
        "The games are great. The winnings are deplorable!!! Really hard to win and keep up a bank balance. The game is for us to buy $'s. I have done and they disappear way too quickly. I'm thinking of deleting it altogether"

In particular the boomerangs because there are almost no chances to avoid a hit. In unequal battles the inferior just got an extra disadvantage --&gt; no David vs goliath anymore possible. It sucks",
        "This is the worst chapter or update in  the game.. when I saw notification of the update I was very excited but when I opened this game the main quest was insane difficulty so I started side quest which was easy difficulty, but it was not for me it was easy for the enemy.. I played that more than 10 times but I didn't win 2 rounds so I just came here and wrote this review... And if you think I'm a noob.. then yes I am but only in this chapter not in previous ones..",
        "At first look it didn't mesmerise me, but after 2-3 matches I feel in love with it! It is awesome and has tons of weapons and other stuffs. The multiplayer option is also great and chest opening is such a treat. One worry is that the weapon below the primary weapon is still locked (why I don't know), otherwise the game is superb. Graphics are top notch and fighting doesn't come more realistic than that!",
        "I have been playing SF3 for quite a long time til now and I just got a problem with one side mission. It was the \"Head hit only\" with an Accused. I play as the judge and all. However, when I hit him like a combos of headhits, it didnt hurt him at all. It is like he became invincible. Anyway, I love everything of SF3. The storyline, gameplay, graphic and so on, they are all great. And I hope you would fix that one single problem of mine along with others who have the problem of crashing as I had read the comments. That is all for me. Keep up the good work, Nekki.",
        "After the latest update, in side quest - wasteland I won twice both the times the game hung up but when the opponent wins it moves through to next easily. I can attach the screen shot of wanted.. kindly fix this it's frustrating  Now for the third time this has happened gonna uninstall the game bye",
        "The 1st Main Mission of chapter 4 hot stucked. I deafeated my opponent and it has stocked at that point. Closed the game and started again, the the mission is in same position. Again I played that mission and after defeating the game stucked again. The same thing happened 5 times in a row. Very much Dissapointed."

        "Amazing idle game best I've found great balance with coins and earning gems without \"pay to play for the gems\", a couple suggestions are to make perfect clone scrolls more available in the store and add a page to the store one to buy stuff with gems and one with coins, maybe adjust the casino a little so it doesn't land on the same items everytime, add some more characters like movie stars and music artists such as Slash, Toby Keith, Little Wayne, Gene Simmons, Ozzy, ect. Only issue i have with the game is trouble connecting to google play games and a force closing issue that hopefully gets fixed soon.",
        "Things in this game constantly change every week something else gets nerfed or taken away. Constant server problems where you can't log in for hours and when you can log in the game constantly hangs up and freezes with lag. Also for those that buy iap beware cause they also make changes to their game to be able to squeeze you for more and more money.  This company is a greedy leech. I Have made many attempts to contact your company and you refuse to reply.  Your company are money hungry scammers. I demand a valid working number and address to your company so I can get your company CEO on the phone",
        "I have purchased an item but got an invalid recipient error. But the money was charged to my account.  Have emailed them and try to communicate to them through the feedback button, but gotten no reply from the team.  Not worth the money and time.",
        "Great use of famous people, especially \"Social Pres\"... he looks like an idiot in real life, and you guys have certainly captured that quality. Good difficulty in the various modes of play, looking forward to more. Keep up the good work.",
        "pay 2 win at it's best. stay away from this. it's not that this game asks for money but the amount they ask for it's absolutely stunning. 10$ for 1000 diamonds and u buy a scroll for 1200 and u get a stupid blue hero. a blue. for 1200 diamonds. lol.",
        "Great game to spend hours playing. I love the character's, and the gameplay. Yes, you may need to spend a few dollars to advance far in The game, but it's so worth it. Only thing I dislike is having to wait on timed missions. Only thing I'd add is when you spin the wheel at the casino,  wish there were better outcome odds. Tired of always getting gold."

        "This game is good and the story was interesting. The reason why i give three stars is because the magic challenges sometimes need to consume lots coins or lunes. And everytime there is new event which need to collect bonbon... It is teally hard to collect it and instead we need to buy... i know this game is free for both pay to play and free to play... but all i see is pay to play since the bonbons need to buy and sometimes events that come back by popular demand also consume lots of money.... I actually liked this game but since you made this game really.... i had to give only 3 stars since the game had to use mk ey A LOT....",
        "Rather then an actual chapter as in some other games, game play is only a page in a normal book if you are lucky. I love the story lines but I would actually love to read the story and not be teased with a tiny blurb of the chapter instead. Maybe if the chapters were longer and worth buying tickets for I would actually spend more money on this game bc it's very cute.   Trying to play threw the stories are so annoying! You need sooooooooo many story tickets! The chapters should be longer per ticket.. it takes like 15 tickets to get threw a chapter! The only good part is u get 5 a day unless u buy more.... please make the chapter length longer per a ticket :( I'd like to actually read a story..",
        "I loved it , it is so addicting and the characters are gorgeous, but it is way too short. I find myself paying fake money from the game to buy tickets just to know what happens next! You might actually fall in love with the characters! That's how amazing it is!",
        "This is my favorite app and has been for almost a year. The only problem now is the adds they can get very frustrating and angering. I do put a lot of money into this game and wish you would consider taking away the adds per player after they put so much money into the game.",
        "I adore this game, I've almost had it for a year now. I chose Klaus and I am head over heels in love with him. I enjoy playing a little bit of his story everyday. The artwork is just beautiful as is the story. It's well written and interesting. However, there's one thing that really upsets me and that's the in game currency,  coins. They're incredibly difficult to acquire. Yes, there's the \"free coins\" but unless you want to spend actual money(which you're trying to avoid obv). The free options that take the least amount of time only give you 7 or 9 coins so good luck with that. Honestly, this game would truly be a 5 star gem if that was fixed. At least bump it up from 7 to 100 and make the offers that cost money actually work. I just did one(it was for a 1$ basically) and didn't get it. Otherwise, thanks for an absolute gem of a game c:",
        "This used to be my favorite Solmare game, but the pop-up ads have ruined it. They can pop open at anytime, playing loud music and ruining the experience. When they pop up, I usually just end up closing the app, no matter what I was in the middle of because they are so annoying. I will probably end up uninstalling this app because of them.  If this was not an issue, it would be a 5 STAR game."

        "I enjoy this lifetime favorite with people worldwide, and Uno Dare is my most favorite mode. I understand it will be discontinued in June and I wish it wasn't so.    ...Hey Uno & Friends, could you please not ask me to rate an app I've already rated??? I was asked to read it again and then I came back to find I had made that specific request not to ask me to re-rate something. Your app needs to be reprogrammed so it knows if someone has rated it or not. (sigh)",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",

Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "LOVE! Please DO NOT end the game! This app is perfect all the way around. Best card game app ever. SOOO many people are gonna be upset if you take it down, so leave it up! These uno players are ready to rock this app! You will never not have people playing. It would be kind of cool if you could create your own avatar though.. & pick outfits and such. Not necessary, but a fun little quirk (:",
        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it."

Every time I've had an opponent drop out, it takes a few seconds to notify me they left the game. Every day a new reason to NOT pay a cent for this fraud. I play out of sheer boredom.",
        "Players with higher ranks should not be able to play  against players that are lower rank with less experience. Plus the ring challenge if you don't reach  the 30000 you should get the amount that it stops on, instead of 1000 points.",
        "Want to love this game, but it just constantly cheats!! It would be more enjoyable if you could have so many free plays per log in to just enjoy some play, like other games do. Instead you run out of gems right away after being cheated out of one or two games, which really stinks!!  I'm not paying through the nose just to enjoy playing a game. You are too greedy and a big fat CHEAT King and it has really disappointed me, because the game would be great fun if I could actually play it!!!",
        "Uninstalling...too many hiccups! Costs too much too play a simple game of cards. This game is all about making a lot of money for 'King' corporation. Can't really say anything nice about this game. Pretty much agree with the reviews. (didn't even have installed for 24 hrs.)",
        "I agree with the cheating and everything everyone else is talking about, but I also have a problem with the automatic card shuffle in the middle of your turn. Wait for the players turn to end, then shuffle.  I have lost several games because of this.  I now have a 3 lose rule because of the way this game messes with you and then I'm out and won't play for days or weeks, because I refuse to pay for a game that cheats."

After players matching ,game is hacked/stopped by several times.Only way to win that kind of match,any of one player has to quit or network issues.Its waste of time,also harm for devices (battery drainage,high heating). So,admin plz look after these prob.Why it's hanging or hacking.",
        "As football based game it is superb, in terms of gameplay, graphics etc. But the biggest idiotic part of this game is that if freezes like magic. The whole game main screen becomes unresponsive and stays like that no matters the game is restarted or the damn phone is. Get this thing sorted out Miniclip. You have a reputation to maintain or not?",
        "Could you please enable the user to save his progress in a Gmail account??  So that, when you lost or change your phone, you can recover the level and progress you had before instead of restarting from the beginning!!!!!!!!!!!!   If you could allow more media for sharing the game, it would be better, Facebook is not the only social media!!   And sometimes, it bugs!! Sometimes, the game is very slow and causes you to lose. Indeed, you shoot but the ball goes after many seconds even though the connexion is good!! Consequently you loose against a weak player, And this makes very angry!!!   Should those problems fixed, I will rate 5 stars.",
        "I think this game is a really fun addicting game. The main reason why I got it was because of 8 ball pool. That game is also very fun. The only thing I don't like about football strike is that when I get on sometimes it won't let me click the spinner. So it's like my phone froze. But my phone didn't freeze. It's just the app. So can you guys please fix this.",
        "At first I was skeptical about this game. I had downloaded it and went without playing for a couple of weeks. Then,one day I just happen to open the app and play. Best move I ever made for an app! This game is just flat out addicting, fun and challenging.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much fun it is and that there is, most of the time, something new.  Chalkenign friends and new people always makes for a challenging and fun time waster. Even if I don't have the time to play, I still make time!! Haha",
        "There is a bug in your game I went first of my league, supposingly I am entitled to 350 cash, but it wasn't there.  How could you make it so unfair for someone. Why bother having a prizes if not given to the right person."

        "So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game",
        "A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job 'fun games for free' üëèüëåüñí‚ò∫",
        "Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you're having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.",
        "I've been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn't force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game's development! :)",
        "Pretty cool app. I'd like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it's pretty cool so far.",
        "This is the most addictive flight simulator I have ever played. The game is fairly easy to progress through without having to spend any money. If I had to find one fault it would be that you can't reverse when on a runway which means some times you have no option but to crash your plane as there is very little room to turn around."

Ok so they put up power ups that I don't have and want me to buy them.Here's the kicker, if I don't buy them it stays up the whole game and doesn't let me use the ones I have!!!!! Ahhh greed! What a joke. Absolutely unfair. I've never seen anything like it. So so sad. And now since the new update it takes way too long to level up!! They just more greedy with each update. Again, so, so sad.",

        "I really love the concept of completing puzzles, different quests and special side games. The graphics are great as well. I don't, however, like that you're almost forced to pay for tickets or you can play MAYBE one game a day. Needless to say, I'm not spending money to boost up my tickets.",
        "Game freezes and I always lose my tokens. Not fun. I dont play for days to save just to play 2 stupid games",
        "I like this game better than any other bingo app I've tried and I've tried a lot. However the French accent in Paris is pretty bad.",
        "If you are not on a super high speed connection, or buy $100's in power ups or tickets dont plan on getting too far on this gamw.... it lags and doesnt let u bingo if you haven't purchased from the app!!!"

EDIT: This game is a perfect example of how not to screw up a top notch game. Used to love it to death before the update, now every aspect of the game has been worsened; Auctions, Gameplay, Teams. Just name a feature and you can be sure that it's been screwed up. Just hope they resolve this the next year. Will just uninstall till the new yearly reset.",

        "I can't see myself EVER giving EA mobile games anything but a 1 star rating, the game is geared to cheat unless you're spending actual $ on paccs & players. How many times can an event rob you of stamina to only rob you again by redundantly giving you the same fucc'n collectables over & over & over again!!! By the time you actually complete the set either the seasons over, or there's better players @ the position that you'll probably never end up getting either... Unless you spend some cash. EA succs man, SINCERELY!!!",

This is so very very bad news with you EA. If you still use this rule, i think... this game can be game over forever. You should back this rule like before. if you can't, everymonts, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, this rating of Nbalivemobile always down, decrease, and fall, hopefully you can understand if you feel this game very important for you! Trust me!. Thank you. Tru",
        "EA, the game is official and is above average as far as graphics, gameplay go etc. etc. but food for thought and I think it'll be a gamechanger really...it'll take the game to new heights on a consumer level. It's the only thing missing aka Commentators/commentary as part of the in-game gameplay and the rest will speak for itself. üî¶"

You have to back out and start all over only to have it freeze again. Will probably delete it as it's now useless to try to play.",

        "I don't mind ads, but one after every round is excessive, especially when you can't skip them. Perhaps consider only ads you can't skip when requested, like for bonuses and prizes. I've quickly come to love this game, but I also love plenty of games who get by on much less frequent and interfering advertising. . You're generic response doesn't address anything I said except the target word \"ads.\" I'm talking about ads you can't skip after many levels.  Save the unskippable ads for when we choose to watch them.",

        "Between every level guess what? Ads, ads and more adds . I hate it! I understand that ads will help you as developer somewhat but how it will help you if we , users going to instantly uninstall your app and rate it low? Maybe it is time for a different aproach since it is abosolutely anoying that level of ads?"

However, since the new update, when I play on my phone I'm not able to send emails and I have to click on the village button every time I change villages before I can do anything with that village.

He uses all abilities with 0 cool down time, he keeps getting armor, shield, and healing... making winning impossible, unless you are +20 levels higher than him.",
        "It's a fun, easy, addictive game. My ONLY complaint is that even when you buy a card, you don't get to CHOOSE which Character you are getting. If I'm paying $100 for something, I better get to PICK what I'm getting - this game doesn't let you do that.  I also think it takes WAY TOO LONG to evolve Characters, and overall the add-ons are FAR TOO EXPENSIVE for what you are getting, but you don't HAVE TO spend money if you don't want to.",
        "The game is a great game, I love how they added characters from all eras, it sorta reminds me of turtles in time. The only huge downfall of this game is that it's pretty much a pay to play game smh. I've never seen a game that is so money hungry in my life. The $10 monthly subscription  is absurd, the SFX ingame dont work and for 5 bucks more you can play Elder scrolls online that has a ton of content compare to this game.",
        "Subscription should come with better benefits. $10 a month...6 months worth I could've bought an xbox game. Ya know. Pizza re-gen should be a bit quicker. Some people like to grind. And the pizza limitation kills the grind. Good graphics tho, and great characters. But waaaay to hard to acquire the turtles. Big let down on that aspect",
        "Great game just wished Very amazing game especially if you are a turtles fan.. lots of choices with characters.. you can definitely get stronger without having to pay.. you just need to put in the time , and do  do daily event's.. i wish some characters were easier to get;))",
        "After a long battle with the worst customer service i have ever dealt with i will regrettably no longer be playing this game. The game itself is pretty solid but is a money sink. If you need help from the company you may as well quit. The game is a solid 4/5 but the company's attitude and considering you being disposable sadly makes them a 1/10"

You receive 200k coins which is basically a spin and you will not win. All free coins from ads will not produce any wins. Please tell me there is not a different payout percentage off the ad coins. But you're making real money from us watching  the ad. Mmmmmmmm....",

We used to be able to purchase potions in guild shop for reasonable  amount but that has changed because the game administration wants more money. This makes me sad because many long time players are leaving  the game. New players will never know just how fun this game once was. :-(",

I have never felt betrayed by a game developer prior to this, but Playmage introduced me to the feeling, and it's a strong hatred. I will never deal with them again. Avoid.",

If you have patience and don't mind not leveling to fast, or just taking your time in general this game is for you. Lots to do.

You can literally go with a 1 man team or a 5 man team based on materials u have to equip them with to make sure they can last in battle. Have fun and good luck all...

Also, the filters for games have been generalized so I can no longer narrow down to the game type I want. That one is not even a bug just an awful bewildering design change.",

So please fix the problem.  Thanks",

        "More and more focus on pay to win and the 4th weapon, the distance weapon makes it too complex and disturbing. In particular the boomerangs because there are almost no chances to avoid a hit. In unequal battles the inferior just got an extra disadvantage --&gt; no David vs goliath anymore possible. It sucks",
        "This is the worst chapter or update in  the game.. when I saw notification of the update I was very excited but when I opened this game the main quest was insane difficulty so I started side quest which was easy difficulty, but it was not for me it was easy for the enemy.. I played that more than 10 times but I didn't win 2 rounds so I just came here and wrote this review... And if you think I'm a noob.. then yes I am but only in this chapter not in previous ones..",
        "At first look it didn't mesmerise me, but after 2-3 matches I feel in love with it! It is awesome and has tons of weapons and other stuffs. The multiplayer option is also great and chest opening is such a treat. One worry is that the weapon below the primary weapon is still locked (why I don't know), otherwise the game is superb. Graphics are top notch and fighting doesn't come more realistic than that!",
        "I have been playing SF3 for quite a long time til now and I just got a problem with one side mission. It was the \"Head hit only\" with an Accused. I play as the judge and all. However, when I hit him like a combos of headhits, it didnt hurt him at all. It is like he became invincible. Anyway, I love everything of SF3. The storyline, gameplay, graphic and so on, they are all great. And I hope you would fix that one single problem of mine along with others who have the problem of crashing as I had read the comments. That is all for me. Keep up the good work, Nekki.",
        "After the latest update, in side quest - wasteland I won twice both the times the game hung up but when the opponent wins it moves through to next easily. I can attach the screen shot of wanted.. kindly fix this it's frustrating  Now for the third time this has happened gonna uninstall the game bye",
        "The 1st Main Mission of chapter 4 hot stucked. I deafeated my opponent and it has stocked at that point. Closed the game and started again, the the mission is in same position. Again I played that mission and after defeating the game stucked again. The same thing happened 5 times in a row. Very much Dissapointed."

        "Awesome game, awesome graphics and gameplay! Controls I rated four stars due to sluggish firing it seems....or...it could be my device too. Im not exactly sure. Also, not a deal breaker, could we shut off the verbal commentary during battle and keep the sound effects? That'd be awesome. Great game all around though.",
        "When I first started playing this game a while ago it was great. Alot of fun. But after every update it gets less enjoyable. Originally gave it 5 stars but I honestly can't agree to that any more. Especially with the tokens and duplicate planes. I have no reason to spend any money, the tokens are useless and after 18 duplicate planes I just won't buy crates. Not worth it.",
        "Game is a POS. They used to work pretty well then they started upgrading everything and now it doesn't work hardly at all. Massive disconnects tons of unplayable lag. So far the only thing I found that works well in this game is the buy me button.. they don't seem to have a problem with that part of the game it works very well the rest of the game sucks.!",
        "I like this game, its the best WW2 Airfight game. I play many WW2 Airfight game in android, but this is the best one. Good Job War Wings. Can you make more than 4 vs 4 or 8 vs 8 in big map or something more than 4 vs 4? It will be look like war games not PVP, just advice. Keep the good work.",
        "The game is great but the enemy planes should have a health bar or something like that. You could also introduce clouds where there is almost no visibility and some power ups based on experience pts of a plane.. But still a really nice game"

        "Fun, easy to play, complex to reach higher levels, this game has, so far, been great. No microtransactions (thus far) to continue playing, which is a huge plus. A few have stated a couple of bugs, which I agree with, adding only one other comment; I do wish their was an offline option for at least some gameplay. Online still necessary for a lot, but offline to run some dungeons. This could, in theory, help with some server space, as well.",
        "This game is one of the best game I ever played in mobile. I love the graphic which is cute and there is so many content, so it's not boring. And another positive side, you can get the special currency easily in the game. It's not a p2w games ^^ but the sign board was one of the best micro transaction I've ever seen. Try it and you'll see.. it's a lot of fun ^^",
        "I've been looking for a game like this for ages! I was a fan of Runestone Keeper and wanted something similar for my phone. These guys knocked it out of the park. I rarely spend money on phone games, but these guys deserve every penny and accolade coming their way. Fun and  simple, yet brilliant in execution and design. Tons of content already, and I can't wait to see what's next. Keep up the great work!",
        "This game is so much fun! My only complaint is that the gear is gone when done with the maze, so you start it over. As well as \"learning new titles\". It gets kinda old having to start that over every time you beat a full maze. But that aside, this game is definitely addictive! Keep up the great work!",
        "Your game is amazing. You guys are amazing. After everything you went through, you deserve these stars at the very least. Your game isn't pay to win, it's just a grand experience and I love it.  One of the BEST games on the market easily.  Keep up the good work, you're all doing fantastic.  Respect",
        "I've been playing like nine months and it's very addictive you really grow and have many choices. It's truly free to play and gems are everywhere. Buying a signboard for real money is the best bang for your buck and a lizard if you feel like buying something else.  Totally recommend it. I only hate getting creator gumball is so expensive other than that it's a great game. It's a game that goes as fast or as slow as you feel like playing."

Awesome. :P Net connectivity is as good that when other apps show good connection under high speed wifi, ot shows no connectivity. Lol",
        "Freakking great. Best chess app EVER!!!!. I have the free one and it can teach you tactics, help you in situations and if you dont want that no need to do it. You can even costumize your wallpaper or theme. Skill ratings 100-2600 playing real people. Or you can play a computer, 400-1200 or 1400 i think. Great app, get it you wont regret it.",
        "I think this app is horrible simply.. I'm a diamond member, but I don't think i will be for much longer. There's other chess sites that don't disconnect and lag so much. Main dislikes is the constant disconnection, no order at all in the videos section. Tactics, lessons and drills bugs and crashes when turning the mobile or screen goes off. Specially drills bugs and just repeats the same one over and over when you finished instead of going to the next one. Also, app was unhappy I was logged in on my turned off computer.. come on..",
        "I cannot respond to chats. The support team promises they will fix the issue, but it's only lies so that I can give the app a decent rating. Now my custom board, pieces, and background settings get reset every 2 days. Frustrating app.",
        "The last update sucks! Premove is not at all intuitive. It now just shows the block which we want to move the pawn and doesn't move the pawn itself like before. The toast message that showed 'challenge rejected' was better than the current one. Dislike it!!",
        "I have no connection issues but some times game discontinues with showing no n/w.pls solve otherwise good game Finally uninstalled... Worst team."

        "I have loved Hot Wheels for years and this is a good game. Fun and challenging. However I have been a bit frustrated because sometimes I just explode for touching a wall like on level 6. Awesomeüòí Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don't reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie's handling. You killed it, literally. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.",
        "The game is good. There are problems though. D-muscle is absolutely useless. It's the worst car in the muscle set and has no business being the fourth car in that set. The final upgrades for the fourth car on all sets are far too expensive. It requires an insane amount of grinding to unlock the last cars. The prices of supercharged upgrades are all over the place. Why do all of Haulinator's cost 100 coins while Dune It Up's cost 1000-2000?",
        "Good graphics. If you fail and do exact same again you may pass level if you level up car, you end up failing sooner and have to slow down but after trying 7 r 8 times gets annoying and the level up car is worse than your basic car. Too frustrating so deleting",
        "Game would be good if the dev's took time to work out the huge amount of bugs. Everytime I run this, I get 3 races deep then everything stops responding. Running it on Samsung Galaxy S9+ with perfect cell service. All the buttons click but do nothing. Uninstalled.",
        "Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I've never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.",
        "My 2 almost 3 year old and I really like this game. It's pretty fun BUT it seems to freeze up after a few races and I have to shut the game off and restart it to play more. This obviously frustrates little man and I'm sure I'm not the only one this has happened to. Other than that, we think it's a great game."

Lots of stats, numbers, ratings, etc. that we have to figure out on our own. Another thing, stopped receiving notifications after updating to Oreo.",
        "Overall it's pretty fun and addicting.  My only real issue came up with today's update. My 40-rated team got matched to play against a 60-rated team in my first Challenge game. wut",
        "The game was great until the update. Took my team from a 43 to a 41. Put alot of time into it, hope this gets worked out. They also nerfed training. Don't even bother wasting 15 coins on an extra session.",
        "Update: ***500 coins for ~350k in game cash isnt even 1 rookie signing.... you can get 3 star players for that kind of coin. **** the latest updates have added cool new features like the coach analysis, fewer bugs and more consistency. The coach analysis function could be cool but every description is \"this player is making great progress, keep pushing him!\" Even for aging players who are getting worse as the seasons progress. It does however project where the player could trend stats wise.  Still no goalie stats. Still no trade options (not sure how that would wotk) but they added refunds to contracts you release from your roster which depend on the player and their contract value,  time remaining etc...  Would be cool to also be able to make in game adjustments, like if your star goalie is letting goal after goal slip through swapping goal tenders would be nice otherwise there doesn't really seem to be a point in having 2 goalies even on the roster.  Overall it's a Fun game with a LOT of potential, if you're a fan of hockey you should definitely give this a try. Would like to see some of these things as the game develops",
        "Please fix how it automatically signs a new player if you don't renew a contract.. the purpose is to dump cap space and it signs some random player and then won't let me release him.  Also STOP changing my line ups. At any point any time ever. There's no need to change it or else you night as well play the game for me. I spend alot of time re doing them and then next thing I know every thing is changed. Not sure why or what causes it buy it is annoying as hell",
        "Overall it is a decent game. However finding an opponent for the games especially the rank games sucks. Either you get another player who is far superior to you or another who is far below your level. It needs to be more equal to be fun."

        "I liked the game so much. No! I love it, but it's just that I'm now on level 65 but I'm stucked since I only have few gems left and I needed to extend the time, and buy some customers which I find amazing just to save your energy and the stage but I also find it hard since I have already completed 3 stars from lower levels and why is it that I can't play the levels I have already completed? I would really suggest that lower levels would still be played just to be able to collect gems. I hope you can fix this issue though. I'm so loving this game and I'm getting addicted to it. I got stucked on level 65 on my two days of playing. Thank you",
        "Moving on is hard on some levels because they are specifically designed for you to use gems and they are hard to come by. However, If you are patient enough you can eventually earn them. I enjoy that you don't have to drag the items to the customers. It's definitely an enjoyable and challenging game. I'm currently at a \"coming soon\" stage where I can no longer move ahead. I've been waiting a long time and do not want to wait forever. Please do an update soon!!!",
        "I love this game! So few games actually suck me in, but this game had me addicted right away. I play on my phone and laptop. Yes I have two different games at different levels lol. I love how upgrades are so easy and it isn't impossible to upgrade or move on. It gets challenging as you go up levels but it's so fun.",
        "Great game but some levels really hard I cant pasd this one level im on for days maybe update make it easier pass level I'm on I just did update...I hope so... love game anyways great game to.. identical cooking joy to map was a great game to but also hard get passed certain levels that game to n I can try play fast with my hands to still cant pass to not playing  cooking joy anymore going stick with this one see if game gets easier to",
        "It's fun till you run out of energy. They get you too rate the game right away while you are having fun with free lives. Give you enough lives to rate it good then the lives end and you have to watch a min advert or 30 mins for one life Regen. OR PAY. They just want your money at that point. So sad.",
        "Brilliant little time waster of a game.. yet.. once you start getting to the higher levels.. the less chance of earning gems and i aint noway paying for them.. last time I stupidly paid for gems on cooking fever..and got my account hacked into! Big lesson learnt! I do still play this alot tho so overall, definitely a good game. üëç"

        "This game is so old school and gta 5 is so much better than this game but it is still worth playing. It has a lot of cheats and hacks but it is still very good. It plays up very x1000000 rare. This game is very fun and if you have seen my comment please download this game immediately because it's extremely fun and it is very easy to collect money ps its okay to play offline and if you have seen my comment i recommend you to download this game immediately and have a great time",
        "I loved this game wh3n I was young and this brings back the best memories of my child hood haha.. the controls are kinda lumpy when steering a vehicle. But all other movements are pretty good. Butt,if you happen to have a Xbox one s controller it works perfect on my galaxy s8 plus. Thanks for porting this game to android and giving the option to max the graphics out. Looks very good! Loving the portal game feel too haha!",
        "Just started, i am playing with an Xbox One controller and everything works perfect.  The only problem is you are stuck with the original controls and cant change the buttons functions.  I wish i could use the triggers for gas and braking for driving the cars like in GTA's 4 and 5.  Other than that everything is good.  A classic game, that runs smoothly, and is a great time nostalgia trip.   This one works so well that i am definitley buying the other ports as soon as i am done with this one.",
        "Game could be grate Game looks awesome but the controls don't work right. Walking and running is not fluid. It's stop and go. While driving it is very hard to steer while pressing the gas pedal. I have Max Payne and the controls in that are great what happened with GTA San Andreas. Please fix. Also could you make it so I can move the game to my SD Card. I am using a Samsung galaxy tab 4.",
        "Guys help please! i gave the game 5 stars because i like it so much. But there's a probleme that im facing now when changed devices i had all my data saved on a samsung alpha device, now i reinstalled the game on my new samsung s6 edge and i loged in, and there was no cloud save. Please help me find a way to fix this! Thank you"

When swiping it doesn't always read the swipe and kick it for a try through ball. When shooting the swipe isn't constant, I can swipe as fast as i can and it goes 54mph. Either give us an analog to move the player so the screen is just used for swiping or better your current way so it doesn't glitch or give issue. Atm the game isn't going to be played much more because it gets frustrating when it isn't working right.",

The competitive mode is also messed up as the opponent gets scores near impossible",

Because of slow loading it will kill your battery life fast as well. Please help to fix the problem and I will re-rate again. Thanks",
        "Even with a perfect LTE speed game struggled with downloading hunts. The game forces you to do certain hunts before you can go back to the ones you like and want to finish. Not too mention every other minute it forces you to watch an ad or tries to get you to buy something from them. I will be deleting this app once i finish posting this comment.",

        "The game currently wont open, when it does its constantly crashing and force stopping. I have the silver subscription ($1.00/weekly) and im unable to take advantage of the content im paying for  want a refund. The upgrades and new equipment are too expensive, the gear and parts are also too expensive and hard to come by especially for the spearfishing which is the best part of the game.. You certainly can't get very far without spending some real money. You can be killed by animals when the come from behind so you with your limited turning capability you have no chance to defend yourself. A lot of problems.",
        "During cts theres moments get sudden lag and it throws off the shooting causing to miss when i know aiming right. It never had these lag bits before."

        "At first I didn't think it wasn't going to be that good, usually because phone games usually get a bit boring after a while. This game actually keeps me entertained and the cookies themselves are just amazing. I suggest anyone who hasn't yet to give this game a try :)",
        "It's fun, but I can't play it once I get to the mist part in section 1-2, the game freezes but the music keeps playing... If the devs make an update that fixes this, I'll play, but until then, since I can't play it properly, it's off my phone. Sorry devs, it's amazing but I can't play it right now",
        "The characters look amazing! I haven't got any legendaries yet. Very fun and challenging! One complaint is that in breakout mode, you have to start roght from the beginning. Regardless, it's great!!",
        "Can you pls put in a feature to migrate the data from Line Cookie Run? Line Cookie Run is closing down soon but I have so much memories collecting my cookies and treasures and I already had so much! To lose everything is making me a little heartbroken :'(",
        "Amazing game I love it so addicting...... I played every day all day that's how addicting it is no we got something to do in the game there's 70 different types of things you can do there always doing something on the game whether it's racing competing challenging amazin",
        "I'm a bit reluctant at first trying this new CookieRun from the previous LINE version, but I regret it, I should have play this sooner. Everything is so addicting with new system and better music and graphics as well, awesome!"

It would be nice if the writing matched the excellent quality of artwork on the game.",

The graphics are amazing no flaws there and as a new player right now the newcomer rewards are so helpful.",
        "Customer service is a joke. The game is pretty simple to play, once you get the hang of it. But don't join the game until they bring out a new server, impossible to complete with long time playing players unless you're willing to spend a hell of a lot of money to catch up. Current two servers I play on are pretty dead due to this.",

        "Sorry to say, but in terms of balance it is the worst game I have played so far. This game is the most unbalanced game, even for beginners. Currently I have 4 heroes and the funny part is that all four are weak against defense, such as a cannon, a rail gun, 2 stars for the full upgrade. Even high level players can attack on beginners. Defence is too much high for the attacking players, against 2 heros unit and I've noticed that lower level players can not overcome my defence while high-level players pass easily. This game is good and entertaining, there is not much flaw in this game, but this game is very unbalanced and unfair. Many players have complained about this.",

I was able to get everything in the game without spending money up until now. Now I have spend money in order to get the more interesting content. Sadly, this app will be deleted. I am not giving Nintendo even more of my money, it is not a real Animal Crossing game to waste money on.",
        "I love playing this game, but now I can't get into the game, all I get is support error 802-9016. Don't try and tell me to move closer to the WiFi source, because I put my phone on the WiFi router and got the same thing. My wife, who is sitting next to me, gets into the game just fine. I uninstalled that game, same thing... I would love to get back into this game, and will change my first reassuring back to a 5, but until then... Yeah... Please help....",
        "First-time reviewer and life-long Animal Crossing player. This game combines everything good about the game series like fishing, but catching, gardening, decorating, and more. Therea is always an event going on to keep me playing multiple times a day. The team behind this game actually listen to what people say and fix it and add ease of play features! People saying this is pay to play are full of it. I have well over 600 leaf tickets from just playing the game... you just have to put in the time and complete challenges.",
        "I love the happy music and the relaxed vibe I get while playing this game. Easy enough for young children to learn to play, but not so infantile that an adult can't enjoy it instead. The garbled chipmunk-speak language of the animal friends is hilarious! Level progression seems fair and regular. Pay-to-play options are not necessary to have a good game experience.",
        "I would give this 5/5 across the board, as I have been playing since the November release and enjoyed every moment. Every update has made the game better, as the team listens and integrates whatever they can to make it better.  Microtransactions are ignorable, and they give leaf tickets hand over fist, besides the customizables for the campsite (foreground, midground, background) which are expensive.  Hopefully future updates brings better options.",
        "Just like the actual Animal Crossing games, but with even MORE to do! The only difference is you're a camp owner instead of a town mayor. Oh, and the fact that's it's a FREE app!   Seriously, this is a real deal AC game all squeezed into a free app. It's perfection all around if you like games like AC. They did such an amazing job on it."

        "Not really an action game app. If you like Mafia Wars than this is perfect for you.   UPDATE: Downtown Wars is by far not a bad game. The question is it a game for you. The animation is very limited so if you enjoy action then this is not a game for you. The best way to describe what I noticed after playing game for nearly a week, that it is a long level up game of tag. The comment board is one of the best aspects because you can communicate with the community most important you gang/mob members which helps for team building.",
        "Very interesting and a nice game to pass time, love the BGM! Really like the changeable tags, it's so convenient to change it according to our mood/status and the profile erase option without losing the mob WOW! A really big thumps up to that! It also kinda reminds me of Mob Wars and Extreme Mob Wars etc which got me feeling nostalgic because I was really into it but, DTM tops it all! ;) Forgot to mention this, we can put space in our name! That's so convenient! Cool!",
        "I think Elites should be boosted atleast 100 Points - 20 billion then 1000 Points - 40 Billion is 10x the work for 2x the reward.  A huge change could be game breaking but raising it to 80 Billion would give new players a chance against older players that give their minis huge collects every tourney.",
        "Very good game but it could be better. Like when uv got multiple invites u should be able to accept them all in one instead of one at a time. But that's my only gripe. Apart from that it's a brilliant game much better than the dead imobsters. 1 more thing where can we find the boss iron fist who's attacked me a couple of times but I can't find him to attack him back. How can you recover ur account when uv forgot Google account details.",
        "For me with all the rejuvenation down time, I get bored. But when the favors work,  it becomes a really fun game to keep your mind busy.  But by having multiple games like this it's Kool to toggle  between them. The graphics are great.   My Love for this game comes from the interactive game plot. You have to build networks with fellow gamers to rank.  And likewise building enemies.",
        "Great game. I have played this game for years. It just continues to get better.  Recently in last 24 hours my phone crashed and I got it back up and running. But only when I open this game. Does it say UNABLE TO REACH SERVER. I don't know what's wrong. It won't let me open game at all. Plz fix for me"

        "I really love this game, you get rewarded for prioritizing property and it's very satisfying to finish the level with a perfect score when you time everything just right. The diamonds are a little bit too rare to get and since half the updates are priced with diamonds the end result is each location doesn't get 100% upgraded, witch is a little bit frustrating. I love that when you revisit a level it's slightly different, makes it much more interesting. It's a lovely little game, kudos to the developers and designers!",
        "1. This should have an UNLIMITED LIVES option. The stages per level are unenjoyably difficult enough --why do you have to limit the player's chance to try and be better?? Some levels are impossible for human fingers already.  2. You should lessen the required number of diamonds as value of items to upgrade!!! A player only gets 9 diamonds per level achieved. 10 gems per upgrade is ok, but 50??? FIX THIS ASAP or people will be deleting this app.",
        "I love it cuz it's the best but some of the costumers are feisty. The old lady takes three the man and boy takes two things. The young lady is fine. She takes 1 stuff. The little girl I hate her. She rides her scooter in the shop when she know full well she post to ride her scooter outside. But everything else is okay.",
        "I always love supermarket mania. I played supermarket mania 1 and 2 and expect great things for this. But, no, this game infuriates me. The pace is really slow and the customer stream is to long. More over, it use diamonds for essential upgrades like cashier (why should i upgrade cashier??) and cart. Grinding diamonds is a pain in the ass. I think the developer only think of making money than make this game enjoyable to it's player.",
        "I like this game but it needs to give better options earn Crystal's and it should not cost you as many if any at all to move to next level. I play a lot of games and don't mind spending a few dollars but now I'm turned off from it. Yall need to do better. I Won't suggest it to any of my friends for that reason alone.",
        "I really have fun with this game. I also like how you can earn the crystals through playing, not absolutely having to pay. One thing that would be nice was to have the option to fast forward especially with times when you're just waiting for customers or the elderly ladies to finish shopping. Also an endless challenging round would be awesome. Thanks =)"

        "Enjoyed the game. Very fun and im actually spending which is rare for me.   I dont like the orb prices go up with each new arena. I wont be spending now im in in arena 4 those prices are just not worth it. Id also like the ability to save a few different decks. And make gold earning a bit easier its not balanced. Im in arena 4 and been saving gold for over a week not spending on anything opening orbs. And i still cant upgrade any of my cards.   Tbh as much as i enjoy the game. If i cant upgrade without spendig then ill wind up uninstalling eventually",
        "Love it! Very interesting and fun to play, but i have a suggestion. You should add some spells (Poison, Heal...). They don't have to be overpowered, just for slightly more fun gameplay! Also they should be regular cards (Heroes). And one more thing: bring some advatage to players that don't start first in the match, because it's easier to win when you are playing first.",
        "Very unique and fun strategy game. Easy to understand from the first game. Very forgiving to newcomers but if you want to get good, it takes planning and learning. Fun to pick up and play throughout the day. My only problem is that if you sit and play for more than a few minutes, you'll waste alot of orbs winning games. You can spend gems to free up slots, but I'd rather just not receive orbs until I have a free slot. Good game.",
        "I wish that your global rank was more intuitive and less complicated to acquire. Also on the achievement's it says that I can't get the last 2 stars on the found heroes however I have all that I can get. I also wish there was a pm option as the leader of a clan I want to give constructive criticism but not call them out in the chat.. other than that it fully deserved the 5 star.. thanks for makeing this and keep smashing!!üòã",
        "The game itself its good, but lack of fun. To upgrade cards you need money which is hard to get in the game and from the clan. In free chest and common orbs you never get any rare cards and money is too less. Would be fun if the cards could be developed faster and if they would have a counter attack possibility when you upgrade it to certain level. You could implement a coop when each plyer choose 2 cards from deck or something similar. In addition I would change which player starts, should be based on the deck strenght. I would also implement the position of the cards on the field and which card is in front and which card in the back, by that you need to start a bit more strategic. Hope that something happens with the gameplay soon, before more players leave. Good luck",
        "Love the game. Really fun to play and balanced so even non paying players can do well. One complaint I have is the new addition of zombie has a bug, when hitting a buffed opponent the poison touch doesnt replace the buff. Please fix this issue."

        "Great game!!! Still some bug's. You have to log out and log back in to collect the 5 hour daily rewards. Sometimes you can't post in the chat rooms. It will say invalid character. A lot of lag at times when you use the power and impact gauge. There needs to be more options to customize character's and or add more. I also believe the daily 5 hour rewards need to change instead of the same rewards everyday. It is a fun game, and highly addictive. Great graphics, which still could be improved on, looking at newer golf games coming out.",
        "Great game.  Only problem is the huge 10 second warning that covers your shot.   Also the game meter jumps.  So I get penalties for taking longer than 10 seconds when I let the control bar reset.",
        "Almost great. The UI is a crowded mess. Too much nonsense. The equipment tabs are broken due to bugs(I downloaded on several devices) making it impossible to accurately navigate between items, and the putting is rigged(obvious padding) resulting in missed shots that shouldn't happen. Besides these glaring flaws there is great potential here.",
        "A great game easy to play and progress.  Only issue is i can't work out how to change my country from the usa to aus. Sick to death of my putts begging taken off me because you have ridiculously stupid gamer play.  If I putt a ball in real life and it hits the edge of a cup it goes in 90 pc of the time.  If I putt one to the lip of the cup in real life it goes ohm.  But bout your retarded physics.  They stop the ball on the edge or knock it away from the hole. What a load of bulls$/^. Fix this and I may consider upping the rating",
        "I really like this game other than the BIRDS IN THE BACKGROUND!!! Shut them up PLEASE!!! It's very annoying and makes me not want to play this game I have to play it with the volume turned down so I don't have to hear the freaking BIRDS!",
        "Fine before the update. Now it glitches and freezes. Cannot finish a round. Power bar no longer smooth. Not enjoyable to play. I wanted to quit in the middle of the round. Very disappointed in latest update. I hope this is fixed soon. This was my favorite game on mobile device ever and I want to go babe to playing it!"

        "I do miss the old LOA - Fire Raider style of art and play, just came back after maybe a year or so and it was gone! But, Paradise seems pretty cool so far, only thing I'm not a big fan of is how everything deals with irl money while in the 'old' one you could build up gems or materials for certain things like VIP levels; also I heard about rewards being given to old players like me? That's pretty cool, will have to check that out... But yea, so far I like the game, miss the old style but it's still good to me, will update this later on when I play more.",
        "Gave you people an opportunity to fix the stupid chibi icon characters. The latest update didn't fix that so uninstalled.  Also do not reply with a generic response cause you can kiss my ass",
        "Only challenging for nonpaying playing. Not a big fan of pay to win games. But LoA is always addicting and just makes you want to spend your money. Not suitable if you're addicted to that overall. More nonpaying support would be reasonable for them to at least be able to compete.",
        "Latest updates just added more to this already enjoyable game.  However I wouldn't encourage new players to spend any money on the game as the benefits are nonexistant for what you pay. Which means a limited lifespan for the game if no one is paying.  Still a good game to enjoy on a mobile device.",

It's not my network so don't say it's my network.. I tried restarting the game that only makes it worst I really want to play this game."

No explanations on some features, you have to figure it out by trial and error wasting resources. I'm at castle level 15, dragon level makes no difference so far only troop level does. Events are useless because the top spenders take everything before you can even find the location. Misleading descriptions in-game costing you resources.

Also I'm the new update it asked if I wanted to reload an old profile and I've lost all the galactic and colossal cards I've earned. Any chance I can get my old account back?",
        "It is a very fun game I just don't like how I am pitted against someone ranked higher then me when I play multiplayer. I played 10 straight multiplayer games and I lost every single one because I was fighting a player ranked higher then me. At least let me lose to someone who is ranked tha same as me. Also improve tha game's matchmaking skills",
        "A very buggy pay to win game. This game should be called \"Plant VS Zombies - GREED\". Multiplay is rigged, so cards will come out in favour who pays more. So, to publisher is not enough income of adds on game worth of 2$, but have in-game purchace worth of HUNDRED of dollars. Really? On a casual kid's game? Greed to infinity and beyond.",
        "Greedy game, break the game rules just to forces me watch ads? Your today's puzzle (22nd Feb 2018) have like 3 ways to do it, but 2 of them didnt make the HUNT zombie to HUNT for the second time, FIX IT",
        "Great Game and concept and all... But the multiplayer is so offballanced. I'm only like level 3 and yet I keep getting people who are at least level 80. Also the new zombie hero (Huge-Giganticus) needs to be nerfed as soon as possible. Lastly, whoever makes the daily challenges needs to stop, they are practically impossible to beat and the reward isn't that great.",
        "Good game, but I'm stuck in the title screen for a week. I tried reinstalling over and over but doesn't work. Moreover, players who had issues about the internet connectivity problems of while they're watching an ad and letting your opponent to win in multiplayer. Not only that but the Super Block Meter is keeping a lot buggy. Fix these problems now."

I understand it will be discontinued in June and I wish it wasn't so.    ...Hey Uno & Friends, could you please not ask me to rate an app I've already rated??? I was asked to read it again and then I came back to find I had made that specific request not to ask me to re-rate something. Your app needs to be reprogrammed so it knows if someone has rated it or not. (sigh)",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",

These uno players are ready to rock this app! You will never not have people playing. It would be kind of cool if you could create your own avatar though.. & pick outfits and such. Not necessary, but a fun little quirk (:",

I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it."

I actually have some decent ideas for this game that could put it over the top. If the app developers actually read this review then you should contact me. I have ideas that would make this game have an even broader spectrum in the marketplace, reaching not only sports nuts like myself, but gamers in general.",
        "I like the plays, plus you can put it on auto and watch it if you get tired. Just one problem. Your Dev people need to look into this: I thought if the spinner landed in the bright green, your play would go the yards it was supposed to. If it landed in the dark green, your play would gain a few more yards. Now the bad stuff. If the spinner landed in the bright red, your play and your opponent's play would fail and if it landed in the dark red, the ball was either fumbled or intercepted, depending upon the play. That's what happens to me, but not to my opponent. Many times when the spinner goes to the red, between the 40 yard line and the goal line, he will spin, and the spinner landed in the red. He will get a touchdown. His play was supposed to fail.",
        "I love this game alot but it's getting annoying now. I had to restart bc I lost my other game but my team is about 80points good. I just lost to a team that has 40. I find that sad. My team is way better. Not the first time bc I've lost to a 40,46,50,63,75. Please make it harder for teams that are low beat a time higher then them. Make it more challenging for teams that are lower",
        "I like the game overall but the clock management is really bad. Like 40 seconds for a play? At least add timeouts or make the plays not waste so much time. Also yall should add playoffs for the season, not jus win win win and win. It should be more competitive in the season mode and not just winning cause it gets boring. That's what I suggest but overall the game is good . Pls reply and make a huge update . :)",
        "Are you kidding me. Blitz doesnt help against the run. It absolutly does. And you are seriously telling me that i cant make 10 passing plays in a row. I absolutly can in real life. So unrealistic.",
        "Other than you can't see a lot of the plays it's a really good game. But one thing .you guys should put more indept into the game by letting us see more plays .instead of only the plays that counts. I myself want to see indept plays. But other than that. It a great game"
