        "Wow! Great job on this mobile port. In addition it's also free. Download it! This might be the best mobile game I have ever played, with the best looking graphics. It's absolutely insane that this will run on my phone, but I'm not sure if I can run it on my computer. This is impressive and super fun. The controls are fine, but take some getting used to. If you added Bluetooth controller support, I would buy a controller just to play this. Good job guys  :)",
        "The gameplay is so great so far! There are stil a lot of bugs though, like mic doesn't work sometimes, aim and reloaded ui is gone, and I don't know if it's my phone but when I use 8x scope, the frame rate drops; like a lot. Hopefully the game will get fixed, and get optimized for low spec phones on a further update, oh and also a suggestion make the hud mini map a little bit big and also make the map itself hd. Anyway you guys still did a great job and thank you for this! :)",
        "I think this game is really good compared to the Xbox and PC versions of the game. It also adds a few other options for the game that aren't on the PC/Xbox version such as distance from your marker, dotted line to your marker, and it tells you how many poeple are in the plane. The aim assist really helps balance out the phone controls to keep gun fights running smooth and everything works really well. There is the occasional lag spike and stuff but the game works really well for my 2 year old Samsung  tablet.  10 out of 10 would recommend.",
        "Umm i loved this game on my pc but on mobile I belive there are some serious optimisation needed I am using a Samsung j7 prime and it can't run this game on low too. Means are you guys serious? You wrote that it works on Redmi 4a having a much less specs as compered to j7 I know its a samsung phone but we can expect a smooth experience at low setting I will change my rating once I get a smooth experience. Hope you fix it soon",
        "Nvrmind I'm starting to understand this game. It's not bad but could be a lot better. Still say u should get to keep wat u find. Unlocking is kool but should be only for better than basic gear. Just my opinion. Guns and melee weapons it's understandable to have to find them over again each game but the clothing I just don't understand y I gotta be naked unless I unlock crates to get clothes. Weird really.",
        "It is a super good game. Probably the best from all other battleground games, even fortnite. You guys should put a game mode where teams of 4 can conqure land on the map. And once a person dies they cant respond. Put checkpoints all across the map to be able to claim a section of the map. The only way to win is by eliminating every enemy or taking all the land. This mode will change the game play of pubg and will be another unique thing compared to fortnite. It is also something new and very interesting. Please take this into consideration."

        "Could be better. I dont like the fact that anyone can just waltz up to you and come in your house. There should be a setting that allows you to keep your house and sims private from other people. Also its a bit weird that if you tap on any sim without talking to them, they come into your house and do whatever they like without permission, even if you have a bad relationship with them. And it would also be nice if doors could be locked.",
        "It's fun so far! Can't wait to play more and see what else is in store! P.S. the sims, I wish they would not go off on their own and make doubles. Like if you want to make it a real life interaction type style, you should probably fix it to where the actions are more real and not computerized. I would like the option to do more with my kid sims, like more clothes options.  I also dont like the fact that when your sim retires, yoy no longer have control over them. Yhat jind of sucks. Alot...but Keep up the good work. Thanks!",
        "After playing for three days, this doesn't feel like a Sims game, some actions and interactions with objects are meanless, why do I need to use the toilet? One of the key factors of the Sims is to fill their needs, what are the needs of these Sims? It doesn't care at all if I decide to not pursuing one of the stories with friends, hobbies or career. And where are their feelings? Their aspirations? If I follow two romantic stories,  those Sims don't seem to be jealous even if I'm dating them in the same room! This is a game for the money,  not to play a simulation.",
        "PLEASE  HELP!!!!! So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning. And didn't really recovered my previous game. Love everything except for this.  P.S. i did the troubleshooting in the forum but nothing really helps.",
        "Edit: I just had my latest infant boy \"evolve\". My question is, why did you all give me a caucasian kid when my family is black? My other 2 kids are black too! I don't mind (since he's here lol) but this is odd.     I love this game! Already have 2 kiddos and a big house!",
        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much"

        "I think that this game is amazing and soo fun and adicting but the only problem that I would have rated it 4 stars is that this game only works with internet connection which saddens me because this game is my absolute fav. game I have played and I always want to play it. Keep up the amazing(A+) effort!",
        "The game is really addictive and fun. One of the best idles i've played. Good graphics and simple to play. The only problem is the poor performance. I don't know if the problem is my cellphone, but i think the game could use a little bit of an optimization.",
        "Sent email to devs over a week ago asking a question. No reply. Disappointing. Also the fact that there are no videos so unable to use the spinning wheel. Otherwise a mostly good game.",
        "Google keeps crashing. Even if you press stop it still pops ups every 10 seconds and the game takes ages to load and prestidge using an S7. Will increase stars if fixed as a good game otherwise.",
        "Lo      What the hell are you doing today and then I have to play a lot to do with the son I will call u in the garage for parkour now I'm a little Italy for you and I will call u after shcool you have a good night sleep oh I thought it would be fun with the kids and I will end you will be able to get a email from the other day but I didn't know if it would help me to get",
        "Fun game can you make things less expencive though i know it is ment to cost allot but it takes a while to get money i love the graphics and the controles my rating is a big fat five well done and keep updating us on new things!#LOVEGAME"

Not sure why that happen. Also don't like how you have a truck and the grass and or sand will slow you down. Also wish there were more color options for your vehicles. Other than that its a fun and addicting game.",

Not cool at all. Once or twice is whatever, but its happened at least a dozen times. Please fix this!!  Just dropped my rating again because its getting worse! Idk if its people cheating or what but this is ruining the game! The race rankings are a complete lottery, doesn't matter what place you come in because its gonna change... For the worse. Had it with this.",
        "Well it's ok but you are always underpowered I literally but the next 2!! Cars and I couldn't even get in 2nd place it's ridiculous I mean come on and I wasn't even up against real people it was bots. And the ramps using nitro on them is a deathtrap and the driving is Soo weird.",

        "What have you done?!! This was a great game with a few annoying adverts, now it's just one long advert interspersed with occasional races. I have no real issue with adverts but when they stick on the screen and hide the X until way after the timer ends that's just offensive. And seriously - £8.99 PER MONTH to clear ads? (Yes I know you get extras) - come on that's taking the ****",
        "Really fun casual game. Adverts are present but not too intrusive. Allowed to watch adverts in exchange for upgrades or items.   My only criticism is that it takes a while to get used to the different menu items as there's no instructions and the \"see as far as you can go\" sections are really expensive to unlock.",
        "Fix the damn gas pedal. The reason why I lose half my races cause the gas pedal just magical doesn't want to read my finger but the brake sure does work just fine. Keep shoving ads down my throat and it'll be all 1 star.",
        "Money greedy game. You will end up watching ads every minute. You will be forced to watch half a minute irrelevent ads every minute. It's like these guys built the best game to annoy people with ads. Good luck. Played several levels just to get annoyed and uninstall.",
        "I've been playing this game for a long time and love it. The only annoying Thing is that in some challenges. Even if I come first or second. It deduct point and I didn't even loose. Which is starting to become very annoying"

        "I absolutely love this game. I make it a point to not spend money on mobile games cus they typically turn out to be a cash trap, but this was just like buying a regular video game. No adds, and even before buying the full game it doesn't shove \"buy our product\" notifications down your throat. Nintendo has always had good games and I have no doubts that I will keep playing this every day.",
        "Awesome update! Make the game worth again, when it seems Nintendo had abandoned Super Mario Run, they back and release more content for the half of the price. This is the kind of update I was waiting for, once I didn't paid the game yet, I think this could be a great time to purchase. Probably in the future they will release more content, but the price will back to 9.99, so the best time to purchase is now! Great job Nintendo, I love your games since my childhood.",
        "Was pretty short to begin with but Nintendo has supported this game well, adding additional content, even a new mode. The simplified game mechanics to fit Mario gaming on a phone work great and feel natural. The story with it's additional challenges to open new courses are fun, toad run is addictive, the remix 10 is somewhat redundant content wise but also good. I'd rather pay $10 up front than have in-game purchases, the reception to this game indicates that I'm very much in the minority on that. Great game, very fun for a quick session of Mario.",
        "Awesome and all, but you only get 4 levels for free. To go to world 2, WHY IN THE UNIVERSAL WORLD RIGHT HERE IN A CITY (lol😀) DO YOU HAVE TO BUY WORLD 2, 3, 4, 5, AND 6? TALK ABOUT A RIPOFF! 😞 (Warning to Nintendo: If you dont fix this soon, I'm deleting. Sorry!)",
        "Favorite game. It has a one time cost for full version and not a monthly fee or several different things you have to buy to enjoy it. I like the updates with the remix, and the star courses. I didnt like that there was so little to do before I bought it. I got bored quick. But was surprised by the cost, and love it after buying it. I do wish we could see our friends land and share things we don't need and give rally tickets to others.",
        "This is just proof Nintendo can make amazing games no matter the platform. All the bad reviews are people's mad you gotta pay for the game. Lol wut? It's a great time killer made  by the best gaming company in the world and you're mad it's not free? Funny. There's no IAP.  It's not pay to win. But it is the most fun 5$ will ever buy you."

        "Fun game. I would like to see an update that includes sounds effects, music etc. I would also like to see different characters to choose from and/or customization of the character(s). Overall, good job.(Edit**) Great job on the addition of new content with the last update, however with this latest update the game will glitch. The glitch makes the ball not land and resets the game to the pitching of the ball.",
        "I liked the game before. I did pay to remove ads. The game was simple and fun. However the current update has the game broken. The ability to get new characters is a nice addition but the game at higher levels is unplayable. The game keeps resetting because the ball is hit so hard and high it goes out of the playable area even if you hit it \"perfect\" once this issue is fixed I will adjust my review",
        "Fun off the bat... But then it slows down to a brutal snails pace. It's a great concept, it just needs a lot more updates!  *Slow claps* great work on the \"updates\". I shouldn't have updates in parenthesis.. The characters are cool, leveling is also a cool touch, and a whopping 7 new bats? Killing it!..? But come on, way to go extreme overboard on the speed! All the other bad reviews cover it better. I just wanted to also sarcastically congratulate your update.",
        "pretty good game, glad they're updating it and adding in more bats. I play it when I'm waiting at the airport. the new update sped things up, made it really buggy. resets your hits at 44000 M and isn't really playable at this point, hopefully it's fixed soon",
        "Latest update totally destroyed the game. Even using the basic bat hitting it perfectly straight it takes the ball 2 seconds to fly 100,000 meters and then the game resets back to swing again. Without even getting to actually make any currency for upgrades",
        "UPDATE: Every time I hit, the game resets it's self. I hit the ball the meters get up above 80k and then the screen goes black and then I'm back at the plate.   Any upgrades coming soon? I have all the bats and am over 30,000 meters. Need some more upgrades."

Because when I click the restart button then click the screen I would always end up behind the starting point even though I didn't move yet I die immediately why is that? pls fix it, everyone who played this game of yours would appreciate that.☺️😉 (btw I kept on dying on the first part of the game because of that so....I deleted the game!😀).",
        "Just extremely broken, can't even play the game without the ball not touching the first platform and falling off the map or the game's score just going up while nothing is happening. The game is too hectic and the gravity is too much compared to the last update. It's a really good idea but I hope this isn't just a quick grab for cash.",
        "Having to restart the app every time you want to play instead of being able to hit RESTART sucks.  The app won't let you restart a game without a glitched ball each time.  Also, the speed of the ball is ridiculously inconsistent.  Sometimes you get games that are at a reasonable speed and other times it seems like the ball speed has increased an unreasonable amount to play.  Why even bother trying to load the game each time anymore?",
        "The game is extremely broken. I can't start a game without falling off the map, and there are times when I don't even play it's a blank screen and my points meter goes up. It's a very broken game I'm thoroughly disappointed.",
        "it is extremely broken. after the first death, it starts you out right in front of the start platform and you cant play it again unless you completely close the app. its a shame that they dont even test the game before they launch it and that google play cant prevent it from launching in the first place. great game, but extremely broken.",
        "Poor quality game that wasn't tested before release! After your first death you can't land on the platform upon restarting and immediately die, the only way to have another go is to completely close the app first."

If the removal of the blocks topples the tower  or the hexagon gains momentum and rolls off the screen, then it&#x2019;s game over and you have to start all over again. <br> <br>Challenging, emotive and blissfully simple to play. Six! will have you hooked on getting as far down the tower as possible. In keeping with Gram Games&#x2019; hits, playing this game is simple and fun, but claiming a spot on the leaderboard and bettering your friends is challenging and rewarding.<br><br>Key Features<br>&#x25CF;    Easy to learn and fun to master gameplay<br>&#x25CF;    Challenge your friend&#x2019;s high scores, challenge the world.<br>&#x25CF;    Fun and engaging graphics.<br>&#x25CF;    Engaging and addictive.<br>&#x25CF;    Play for a few minutes or hours at a time.",

I hope you make the main menu button apear immediately or allow you to click your back button to go to the menu of the game but other than that AMAZING game!",

Game play is fun, there aren't ads every 30 seconds, the app runs smooth, and the artistry that went into designing this game and the characters in it is absolutely flawless. Can't complain at all. Great game, I do recommend to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games.  10/10!",
        "Awesome game. Sadly motivated by profit grabbing providers. The cost to buy extra lives is astronomical. The only way to buy on a more viable basis was via the piggybank and guess what. They removed it. When I questioned this I got standard fob off bull. I questioned that and guess what no reply. A shame, it is a great addictive game. Just don't get tempted to get you wallet out..........",
        "Zainy!  I can understand the addictivity of it, however, just as I was getting into each level, surprise!, is was completed! This spoilt a bit of the fun for me.  The catchy music, oddly I never got tired of hearing... Great game!!!  This review is after my first experience of the game which I played upto level 20 before stopping.",
        "Sounds boring but I'm loving it! Sucks you right in. Starting to get a little complex (actually using some real brain power) but still very much doable and no charges as of yet and I'm up to level 10 atm. I am no gamer by any means but I'm really enjoying this.",

I therefore uninstall, only to find myself in no time at all missing the game...the challenge & reinstalling the app.  👍👍👍  Good job to the developers.",
        "I don't like that strong competitive advantages are behind pay walls. These advantages make PVP almost unplayable because of how unfair it is for those who haven't paid real world money for them. Also, one of my fully upgraded non-starter ships was completely reset.",
        "Great game. Would have given it 5 stars but a recent update has made the commercials play at max volume. I play the game in silent mode, in bed, while wife is asleep. Sudden barrage of loud commercials has ruined the experience. It has actually resulted in me playing less and therefore has had me watch less commercials. Go figure.",

It's a game...it's supposed to be fun not rocket science!! It should relax you but when you're played a level 6 or 7 times and you get down to needing1move to win... yet again... you get stressed!! And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun! I like a challenge but this is ridiculous!!!",
        "I enjoy this game more and more each day.  Is there a possibility to reduce the memory mb? It really takes a lot of storage and slow down my tablet. Thanks",
        "Getting green pieces gets extremely redundant. After 30 levels it's still the goal. Levels are near impossible unless you get lucky and things line up perfectly.",
        "Its a mind blowing game i cant help but to play this game my day seems not complete if i cant play the game specially when i cant pass the next level and the hardest part is the hard level the time are very fast when i am playing.i really love it and the freebies i can get everyday to boost my game.thank you creators and the makers the graphics and the animation is very realistic.",
        "I like this game but would like to be able to acquire more stars per level.",
        "This is a great game except the play money you get in the game is not enough.  You spend 900 if you close to winning and you want to extend your moves.  When you win you get anywhere from 50 to 100 play money.  So you have to spend your real money to get your play money.  If you have money to spend then enjoy the game."

        "I love the game and then when i saw that there was 3D projects i was so excited but they did not meet my expectations the controls were a little hard and the graphics were a little shady. Also there is a lot of adds i don't mind some adds but there's just so much so it would be nice if you cut down on the adds. Over all i really like the game i love that i don't need Wi-Fi to play this.",

        "Simply love it, if i may make a suggestion... how about providing an option to hide the finished works from the first tab? That way one would not have a lot of scrolling to do find a new piece to start. :) keep up the good work! 👍",
        "This game is AWESOME!!! and Everytime the game updates their app it adds more exciting options to playing the game such as creating your own pictures from your picture gallery folders or other of your downloaded photos from your picture galleries or saved photos. It's so much fun. I also find it to be a Great stress reliever for me. ThaNkS, pixel art app. I love this game, I find time each day to play... Very Relaxing 🤗🤗😀😀😉😉.",
        "Absolutely love this. The only issue I have is when I am working on a puzzle on my galaxy tab A 10.1 it blinks off if it's tilted a little the wrong way. It especially doesn't like it when it's laid down on a flat surface. I love that it's mostly free for Android users and the 3D puzzles are fun too.",
        "Great way to relax or calm down. Lots of choices without having to earn game coin to buy more that only disappoint. Mix of both easy and challenging. One thing would improve over all play and that would be an easy way to locate any missed cells at the end of a puzzle. Having to scroll through some of those detailed ones to find one or two blanks can be a real headache! Other than than i think this is the best color game I have tried! Keep up the great work!!"

Can't that be possible at least for a week if one on it to her their records it shud be like that for the rest of the week. Most importantly  subway surfers consume too much data. But wen updating every month and for that reason I humbly demand that this game company provide physical cash reward for those who are consistent for us to tell others who are asking us who subway surfers help. If we tell them benefits we derive I bet u more people who are lover of games will wanna be part of subway. Trust  me....  Tnx in anticipation",

Get this fixed please.  EDIT: contacted the devs and they were great. Fixed my problem and I still managed to play a bit on the event. If anybody else has this problem, please contact the dev team they will gladly help you. Happy mining. Cheers"

I wish therr was a way to go back and do the tutorial again and I accidently pressed during the first one and missed how to land. Lots of trial and error on that one. Also would be nice to know how the scoring exactly works.",
        "It's getting frustrating.. I'm into level 14, have up graded skills and equipment but yet still can't manage to get a bronz let alone a silver or gold in the very first jump in the game. Along with finishing a constant 16th about 95% of the time make me think it's rigged. What's up with that??",
        "Fantastic concept and artwork and potentially amazing game ruined by a half arsed tutorial and lack of information, pure laziness.  The fun of the game turns to frustration as you get good distance and terrible scores, but why? You assume landings but the game gives you no information on correct technique. Also same for takeoff and mid air lift.   Come on devs its lazy and ruining a game with huge potential. Uninstalled...",
        "By level 4 no matter what score i get the bots always get about 15 higher. 1 game i would get 130 and the bots would get 145. Then when i get 160 they still get 175 showing this is rigged. That makes it so annoying with a lack of help from the developers make it annoying otherwise would b 5 stars if these issues were fixed",
        "The game has a great Idea to it, but it really needs so tweaking in the physics deparment of the game, on certain Stages I go further with a Bad Jump then a Excellent one, and the wind doesnt really play that much of an effect in the game. But overall great and fun game, amd very addictive.",
        "This game is actually very good, I play a lot of mobile games as its normally all I have time for and this is challenging and fun, the career mode is good and also like the upgrades..  I will definitely be keeping this one on my phone for a while because it is a really cool game. If you don't like ads then click you back button to get rid of it from time wasting or spend the buck to lose them forever.. Well done on a cool game, make some more like it!!"

        "Awesome Game!! Really I like this game. I dont even have words to describe it. Totally Fantastic... Whatever you say, this is totally cool. But I have a request...please add a column of legendary bikes. Like there is Common, Rares, Epics, and Specials , there should be a column of legendary. Waiting eagerly for the next update. Thanks a lot of making this fabulous game. And I would also like to appreciate the colours and graphics of this game. Thanks to the team for making this game. I advice this game to those who are looking for cool new games. Please install it and have FUN!!!! Dont just look at the pics, install and you'll be amazed.",
        "Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death",
        "Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won't register your flips. These aren't huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.",
        "Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I'll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.",
        "Way much room to improve                                 So first you could get more bikes in there and add more levels and make the resolution better like 1080 or something add more achievements and more of those levels that you get when you are just playing that game outside of the levels. But other wise great stuff great stuff keep it up. Also some missions are impossible, unless as someone else's comment said you play 16 hours a day",
        "This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can't seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn't be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it's not something you have to add, it's just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven't seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it's an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘"

They offer 2 packs for 5 and 20 then except for rare sales which offer 49 and 79 dollar packs everything is 100 dollars google should step in and pull this game off the google play market for a square enix licensed product they have enough backing to have actual microtransactions not be a game exclusive to rich people who use 100 dollar bills as toilet paper...",
        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15",
        "I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my \"family\"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we're like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I'm from Michigan,we're both married ,but there's nothing I wouldn't do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!!

        "Just downloaded this app.  So far a very well executed app with excellent layout and controls/easy and fluid to use.  Much better than other Sodoku b/c no ads during actual game play!  The only \"con\" is that I cant put graphics behind gameboard. Only suggestion: Would like to see options for backgrounds like in Solitaire. This would truely make it a 5 star game!   Ps. I was not paid/reimbursed or otherwise incentivised for this review in any way.",
        "I'm addicted to this game especially the daily challenge boards. Pros: pencil feature, all instances of the number Are highlighted when you fill in a cell. Con: the timer starts when board opens, would like it to start after filling in 1st cell. As others have said the ads are right below the numbers, too easy to tap when your on a roll.",
        "I like this app, but it feels like it could be more educational. I get stuck on the expert puzzles and often have to use the hints, the way the hints just tell you the number in a selected square doesn't help me work out what I'm missing. If the hint could show me how I could reveal another number would be more helpful to me. Otherwise top notch app",
        "It's a pretty decent sudoku implementation, far better than a lot of the other ones out there I should say. The only issues I have are firstly I do find the \"penciled\" numbers to be a little on the small side (on a 5.5\" screen). I'd also say that for those of us that don't find the \"expert\" setting particularly difficult (without meaning to sound arrogant), it would be good to have a step above that. And finally a Google Play leaderboard would be a nice addition. None of these are massive problems, it's a good app as I said.",
        "Great app. I can do Sudoku on the app with the 'write' facility for numerical notes and I like how it removes them automatically as you fill in other areas. But I still find it very difficult to do paper Sudokus because I can't fill in the right answers without loads of workings out on the more challenging puzzles. The app makes this aspect easy.",
        "I would greatly prefer to start by touching a number rather than touching a cell.  I have to hunt for a cell with the number I am working with, touch that to show where all instances of that number are, then touch each cell and the number to place either the number or a note that this might be the number.  If I could select the number first, I would only have to touch each cell to place that number, then turn on \"note mode\" and touch each cell for a note.  Only half the taps per game, saving both time and the muscles in my arthritic hands!"

        "The game is simply awesome in a word. The mesmerizing music combined with excellent commentary makes me nostalgic to the time when FT first released Score World Goals. Playing the game is a very smooth experience, in addition to the pleasure from the quality of the graphics. There are some minor problems in gameplay, but these don't matter that much as the game excels with the idea, execution and result. And of course, it is a game where losing creates no frustration. Thanks to FT for providing us this masterpiece.",
        "Love the reduced tackling. It feels more like a high pressing Premier league match now and actually gives you a chance to stop the better teams. With the slower tackling, one missed time tackle deep in your opponents half can result in  them getting the ball all the way to your penalty box and scoring. All the while your players just hover around doing nothing. Keep the reduced tackle time!",
        "I do not like the new update where tackling recharge has been reduced. I think what it was on before was a lot better and made the game a lot more strategic as you had to time your tackles perfectly. I think reduced recharge should be something you can win in the boxes or buy with the money or gems. Another good idea could be to give the team that's just scored 20 seconds of quicker tackling on the back of the goal they have just scored. Please put it back to the normal tackling rate! I am addicted 😂😁",
        "Honestly so angry, you go on a small losing streak and end up not being able to play a game due to not having enough nomey, so I spend £10 of in app purchases thinking it will sort me out, lose once and again I can't afford to play. Don't download money snatching pile of tosh",
        "Pathetic gameplay, it has so many issues that haven't been solved with the updates. First the game lags so much, then you cant even string 2 passes together when the opponent team tackles you off the ball. Ths happens in all difficulties. Can't attack, can't defend. Player updates cost too much. Fix all of this in the next update.",
        "The fast rechargeable tackles should be removed.  The game is no fun now. Earlier I had to time my tackle perfectly so that I don't give away second balls. And same with the attack. I tried to get tackled in an area where I can win second ball. But now this fast tackle recharge has just ruined the game."

        "The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn't make it better at controlling. I don't know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌",
        "this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It's so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It's just so addicting and I can't get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the 'play online' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊",
        "This is better than the browser version for multiple reasons. 1) It doesn't lag as much. I played a few rounds a noticed a little bit of lag, but it's better than the browser version.  2) You can play against AI if you don't want to play against people. I like this because I actually had a chance to win and was able to kill some. 3) You can create your own custom skin, which is awesome. All of this is free as well. I love this version of Slither.io.",
        "So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I'll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It's in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I've ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍",
        "Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃",
        "The controlls are pretty bad considering how simple they are.  The lag is unbearable. Fix those and you've got a 5star game all day. Simple fun pick up and put down time killer. In fact the lag is such an issue however, the game is getting uninstalled. You can't play a reaction based game when the lag has you 6 seconds behind whats going on."

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",
        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished.

All these years I played the spin wheel every day ... but not even once the jackpot was opened... it simply shows the malintentions of the programmers who programmed it as such. 3. Boosters must be given more often.",

One suggestion: make it clear $3 gets you one-time access to your piggy bank only. Thanks😄",

        "I like it.   The fish are friendly and encouraging.  I use the game to help me keep calm and relax.  Please consider allowing us to select another of one of the earlier aquariums when we get to the point where we are waiting for new aquariums to be developed and have finished everything.  I'd like a place to put new fish and decorations, but none of the old fish want to be sold.  They are still my favorite friends.  The game uses a lot of memory, and I had to uninstall it from my tablet because it kept making it crash.  Works on my phone, but it's still a lot of memory.",
        "Love this game!! I love the challenge with completing levels. There's days I can't get enough of this game. I play every day. I love decorating my tanks. I love when I get infinite time, but It would be nice if we had control over when to use it or the time would stop and be saved for when we return. Sometimes 6 hours is impossible to sit there and just play. One thing that would be nice is if we didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life to renew and could have more friends to  receive more lives and got to use the diamonds we earned amd not be stored in a bank to buy. Other than that I cant complain😉 best game out there and I highly recommend it to all ages.",
        "It's a great game. I play it with my daughter on our freetime it's quite addictive. Its great that you get rewards if you have to watch the movies. The only thing i would change is the reloding of the lives. Half an hour for one life is too long. Every so often you get a few free hours, but you need to have free time to play.I love the fact that we can play using my phone sideways (landscape ) as I have a problem with my wrist. I highly recommend it!",
        "Fishdom is a fun game.  The puzzles are challenging. I would love to see a change to the gifts we can give our neighbors . Such as, the lightening, or fireworks, or an ornament for their aquarium. I would also like to see the diamonds we earn to be available, not stuck in a bank, to be paid for.  Limits could be put on it, of course, but the free one here and there only help once in any puzzle sequence.   Overall, though, its a nice game.",
        "I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one's tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don't earn anything for more decorations and it doesn't get dirty and the fish don't get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.",
        "Got a new tablet for Xmas.   Had game on sd card. Wouldn't transfer to new tablet.  Was on level 105.  Have to start all over again! TORTURE lol. Other games I would just stop but not this one.  I love It!  EDIT...STILL LOVE THIS GAME.  Highly reccommend it!  Some levels are SO difficult but still loving this game Oct 9/17.  DEC 2017.  Still adore this game.  Now my husband plays too.  Best game EVER!"

        "More ads= more money, less stars= less money so you choose. Anyway the game's good everything is cool but.. if u think u have seen an app with more adds then you know nothing download any voodoo game.. Literally after every single game over u get ads so it doesnt really matter if u tap the revive button (yeah u should u get ads regardless)",
        "Honestly, it's a really good game that mangages to pass as challenging, entertaining, addictive, and time-consuming (in my opintion) all at the same time. But, there are WAY to many ads. The game itself is great but all the ads and interuptions completely takes away from the main purpose of the game; having fun. That's pretty much the only aspect of the game that I highly suggest improving at the moment.",
        "I think the ads are fine. It acts as a breather whenever i lost a run. The gameplay is addictive and all. but.... BUGS! i hate it when i pass through 3 or more layers. And still died by stepping on dangerous tile instead of breaking it. Just had a 11k run today and died because of a stupid bug",
        "Honestly i love this game its a great way to kill time. And there's a lot of reviews on here saying how theres too many ads. Heres the simple solution to that. Don't like ads? Turn off your wifi. Ads can't play without internet.",
        "Reformat your ads. If you're gonna have one play after you lose do it exactly when you lose, not after yu've had a chance to start the next wave. Otherwise watching an ad to revive seems really dumb",
        "It's a good game that is challenging to start,  but adds nothing to keep it challenging. It just changes colors. It would be nice to have a timer,  or a high score, or something to aim to beat. Or maybe even that once you hit a section of a tear it falls away and you have to keep moving (challenge mode). I still play it,  I like it. Just wish there was something to keep it challenging."

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Love this game. My mom and I play it 24/7. It's addicting. Annnd it's a great time killer. Just like everyone else there are things that I would suggest to improve the game. Like for example the time frame for waiting on items. Crazyyyy long. Like the fish nets are like 14hrs! Could drop all the high times to half. That would be cool. But of course if you guys did that then it would be super easy to level up. And you guys would loose out on money cause there are some impatience people out there that just go ahead and buy diamonds and such. Anywho. Love the game. Please consider some of these people's suggestions. Thank you. #HayDayFan",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "Good game. I initially wrote a one star review because this game was very dependant on microtransactions but it's actually pretty fun if you have the patience. Right off the bat you have to wait upwards to 30 minutes or an hour for basic production and warming but as you grow your farm it gets easier to deal with. This definitely isn't a game you can play for, like, an hour, consecutively, which kinda sucks but it's great for the 10-20 minites you pop in now and then."

        "Its a super fun game and I liked it. But for some reason every 5 seconds an internet browser would pop up saying I had a virus on my phone. Checked my phone but nothing. It never did this with any other app even before downloading this. Only ever happened when playing the game.",
        "I actually like the game, but I got all the guys in 3 days.... Now what? There are no upgrades or any other options to use the money on. Also the same thing is happening as others said, where the browser keeps popping up saying there is a virus. Pretty annoying",
        "Fun game, very entertaining. Ads pop up too often, it opens my browser saying i have a virus. I cant avoid it and it happens very often. Im only keeping the app bc i hope the next update fixes this issue. Other than the stupid pop up its a great game and i enjoy it. Please fix it so i dont have to uninstall.",
        "I wanted to enjoy this game. The advertisements randomly open chrome browser windows with a fake virus scan saying \"your device is infected.\" Its ironic in that the software that you're prompted to download is terrible adware that an actual scanner might flag.  It's quite persistent too, happening only after I installed this. 30 second video ads midgsme and adbars that just so happen to pop up and hover where you have to click in-game.",
        "I love the game as a whole, and I just barely redownloaded it and it saved my progress, but I can't even get through one whole throw without it opening up chrome with a fake survey or whatever. I'm not joking, it's really bad. That's why I can't give this a good rating. I understand the need for ads in a free game, but for whatever reason, mine is nothing but ads.",
        "I did not play this game for a long time. I download it and I only played it for maybe 2 hours. I tried to play, but when I  was in the middle of the game and it froze and sent me back to my home screen. The controls I like. This is not the greatest game I have seen, but It's ok😐😐😞😞"

But good game I would try it. One question for RobTop games, though, what is with the \"buy full version\" how is there a full version. Reply to me robtop. I need to know. Not sure about it but worth a try and see if you like it. # Amsam production review.",
        "This game is fun and great but there are too many advertisements and always make me feel annoyed by that. Please fix this and I will rate 4 or if it is better,5.  it was 2015 when i said this. now it is 2018. NO CHANGE. all the ads were still there!!!!! so everytime i want to try again, AN AD WILL POP UP AND BRING ME TO THE PLAY STORE AGAIN.",
        "Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it's fun because it's challenging and there's super fun things in GD except hacking because that's no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I'm super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂",
        "Well, I admit, I'm addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn't be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can't Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍",
        "The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won't annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie",
        "It's a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it's super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star."

        "Great fun game. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because you go through your money pretty quick buying boosts to win levels to then upgrade your garden. I like the game a lot. Also I think that at the end of your board if you have undetonated items they should detonate at the end of that level. I've lost too many levels because of not getting one item that was next to something that was undetonated.",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "Much has improved since my original review (see below). There are special events going on quite often to help with earning coins and powerups, and the levels don't seem to be as tedious. Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

Now it seems that they limit the amount of points you can get at the end for the moves you have left. The only time you see points is the total at the very end. Seems like they're screwing the people who want to get 3 stars on the levels...",

        "I don't write reviews on games , but this one is impressive. Once I tweaked the settings the graphics became amazing, love that there is NO wait time for upgrades ! You buy it, you own it . Big advantage.. And you dont HAVE to go platinum to enjoy this game, but I am considering it ! GREAT JOB !!",
        "It has a good game play as well as millions of adds which eventually ruines the game. You have to watch an add after every single mission and before starting a new mission to gain energy. So basically the energy bar is just a little trick played on us for watching advertisement. I will not recommend this game only because of the adds, otherwise it's really a good game.",
        "Do not buy Premium. You see all the locked features saying exclusive to Premium. You drop $70 for Premium only to find out the best features are still locked because now there is Premium Plus for ANOTHER $150. You are not told other than here by me that what you get when you buy Premium is a Premium-lite. You hear about Premium Plus for the first time after you have bought Premium (lite)",
        "I do liken the game. Here are my pros and cons. Great graphics, wide variety of levels, and ease of controls.  Weapons are too expensive, the game stays one step ahead of you as far as when it offers you deals on weapons. You will either not have the points or coins to purchase and then when you do it offers one level too high at your point in the game to purchase.",
        "Nice game. So far I've noticed only critical hits count. Taking out a knee or a shot to the gonads usually fails. Upgrades are like any other game, spend money to get the good stuff. Hopefully it doesn't get to the point I can't unlock the items to keep playing.",
        "Sinse last update when playing when get killed it will show score screen but spawning back to game locks up and won't play just have to watch myself lose or stop and start over losing my life??????? Please fix...... Would like to know when you are going to fix can't win for losing life and diamonds and not even getting to play!!!!!!!!!! Don't know what you have done to the game getting where it is no fun getting killed before you even get respawned"

        "Oh my gosh. This game is one of the best. It literally like a normal school. You jave schedules. You can do ballet class, hip hop class, latina class and finally jazz class. You can go to diffrent places to get outfit,makeup and hair done. They actually give you a report card with all your classsess and grade. You can peform in front of an audience and you can battle people at the battle arena. Finally my favorite part of this game BOY DRAMA AND GIRL DRAMA it's amazing. DOWNLOAD THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!",
        "I love the quality of the game. Great time killer.Brings out my inner Ballerina lol. Easy, Fun.Game The only thing so far i dont like is wadrobe. For example If your swiching btwn classess its hard to complety take off i.e jacket, tights or pants from previous classes. If u pick certain outfits there stuck on you. Please fix. Other then that good game.",
        "I'm not much of a dance gamer but I love simulation games. This one in particular is very innovative with their design and gameplay. I was skeptical of how I was going to like it at first but it proved me wrong and I immediately took to it. The controls are easy to learn and I don't even mind all of the ads. Honestly, a really great game.",
        "I love this game! It is really fun and if you like dancing then this is the one for you! Personally I like gymnastics more but that's because I've come a long way in it. The only thing that you could change is the amount of ads are! There are so many of them! But over all this game is great! 😉😉",
        "Honestly, one of the best games that I ever played. Dont care much for the ads. Just turn off your data and none of the ads will come out😉 But just like what the other reviewers are saying, the option to choose and take off certain clothes are limited. But other than that, great game.",
        "This game is actually good. The biggest downside is that there's A LOT OF ADVERTISEMENT to watch during playing. I know this is a free game, but c'mon! Waiting and watching minutes of the advertisement is longer than playing the game itself. Not to mention the conversation between characters in the game also took too long to wait and there's some things need to use real money before it can be explored.  This kind of game supposed to be fun and gives the cha cha feeling, but instead I get frustrated of waiting for the advertisement to finish before I can continue playing.  Out of all that, this game is great."

        "Ads after ever single try, even if you only play for 5 seconds before you die. If you're trying to complete a challenge, every couple tries it will reset to free play mode and you have to go intentionally kill yourself which sometimes takes way too long. Then if you don't tap the challenge button exactly right, you have to free play again. Then every time you get back into the challenge screen, you have to scroll all the way through every one you've completed. The game would be fun if it wasn't so infuriating.",
        "I paid the 2 odd dollars to remove the ads since i really enjoyed the game. If you are thinking about doing the same DON'T. Paying the money removes ZERO ads. It simply allows you to skip most of them after 5 to 10 seconds rather than watching the whole 20 to 30 second ad. They still pop up just as often and are just as annoying. Personally I would wait for another developer to make a good clone of the game, shouldn't take long it's a simple engine.",
        "What I couldn't even get taken to dinner before being forcibly bent over with ads? I mean with in 45 seconds; I downloaded, opened, played 2 games, and BAM! There it is. What, you couldn't even butter a brotha up? Hell I'd even been fine being lathered up with 10 minutes. Soo ok, I bite, i watch the ad. Attempt number 3 is going well l, bam I die. Tap to continue, well there's a 5 second cool down for revive I didn't notice at first. So I think to myself \"well that's probably what I watched the ad for.\" Wait the cool down, tap to continue. So I tapped, and BAM! ANOTHER AD. Hmm welp you wanted a rating and here it is. Give me about 5 minutes of gameplay before two back to back ads and I might consider having the game installed longer.",
        "DO NOT PAY TO GET RID OF ADS!! IT'S A SCAM...IVE PAID AND IT DID NOT WORK. EMAILED THEM TWICE NOW OVER A MONTH. NO RESPONSE AFTER THOSE ATTEMPTS. Great game but deliver to customers when they give you money VOODOO. And a simple email would be nice jeez",
        "If you're a sucker like me then you paid the $2 something to remove the ads. Doesn't work, obviously a scam. Helpful Hint: If you play with data and Wi-Fi off the ads actually disappear regardless of whether you paid to have them gone or not. Although this shouldn't have to be necessary it's the only way you're gonna enjoy this game as there is and ad Every. Single. Time. You. Die.",
        "Paid to have add removed, no add were removed! Reading though the comments it's seems like I'm not the only one who feels this way. Bit of a shame as I wanted to like this game but it makes it impossible to tolerate for more than a couple of goes as the add pop up every time still!!"

        "The game itself is really fun, but it's horribly unoptimized and crashes frequently. 90% of the time when playing I would hit frequent lag spikes that makes the game practically impossible to play. Whenever I try to watch an ad, the game crashes and the random pop up ads have like a 20% chance to crash the game.",
        "The game overall is awesome, though there are some things that need some work.   To give an example I personally find it very annoying when the screen zooms in when you get a combo. Like it is now it's very hard to manouvre around incoming cops as you only have a split second to react. Maybe something like a copcar indicator would be in place as well.  For the rest I find the game great and super fun to play, although I'd hope to see newer, cooler and more expensive cars. The ones that are available right now are quite easy to get and don't need much grinding at all.  All with all it's a great game and I love playing it. Keep on the good work folks!",
        "I would give it more stars, but it glitches a lot.  My car jumps to random places on the screen. If you fix I will give it 5 stars.",
        "I really like the game, but since its single player, for 400 coins (that's what I call the in game currency)could we have a mode where you can create your own vehicle and vehicle stats , (health, speed, etc.) Pls. then I will give a five star rating, keep up the great work.",
        "Game is really fun but crashes all the time. Downloaded after watching a friend who plays on iOS - where it never crashes. This version crashes when you start ads and sometimes just randomly.",
        "Damn cop cars coming out of f, nowhere. Can it give us a warning of where they coming?"

        "I don't mind ads, but one after every round is excessive, especially when you can't skip them. Perhaps consider only ads you can't skip when requested, like for bonuses and prizes. I've quickly come to love this game, but I also love plenty of games who get by on much less frequent and interfering advertising. . You're generic response doesn't address anything I said except the target word \"ads.\" I'm talking about ads you can't skip after many levels.  Save the unskippable ads for when we choose to watch them.",
        "Enjoyed the different level challenges -having to drop all the balls with fewer of your own. Do get fed up with adverts at times. One or two won't clear screen and have to shut down game to resume playing",
        "One of the best bubble/ball shooter games. And yes very addictive.  Only 2 negatives... bubble at the bottom unable to move to the left or right as in another favorite game. Secondly there is a creepy ad or something dark that pops up periodically between games.",
        "Between every level guess what? Ads, ads and more adds . I hate it! I understand that ads will help you as developer somewhat but how it will help you if we , users going to instantly uninstall your app and rate it low? Maybe it is time for a different aproach since it is abosolutely anoying that level of ads?",
        "It's a good game and challenging in places. Adverts every round is just excessive and frustrating so I'm going to delete the app."

And now, our locomotive with multi-colored cars arrives at the platform, and the cute little animals are hurrying to take their places in the carriages to set out on their way to their home. They sit down by the windows to admire the passing landscapes along the way. But young passengers do not yet know that the children's railway will bring them many surprises and hard trials. To get to the right station, you will have to try very hard and apply a little of your efforts. The trip will be very difficult. On the way our little passengers will have to stop many times to help another train to collect the lost cargo, to show sharpness, to take special tools and to repair broken railway rails, to repair the bridge, destroyed by the terrible earthquake, to get its train out of the tangled underground labyrinth and much more. The last whistle sounded and the merry locomotive set off. Ahead of us waiting for a fun adventure, a very exciting and colorful journey. Games about the train - a real godsend for parents and their kids. These are development games, which represent a whole set of developing elements that are present at every stage of the game. They teach your child color perception in a playful way, teach you to distinguish figures and count, develop visual memory and fine motor skills, attention and logical thinking.

        "Amazing game!! I have purchased 1 or 2 bikes already, I would even pay to get new bikes, but it is very expensive. Please consider lowering to prices or making better bikes more accessible. Ive been stuck on the same level for 5 weeks. I want to continue playing but im loosing intrest not being able to advance. Maybe you could trade your old bikes in to get something in return for a newer bike. Im sure you will never read this, but you do have something special here! Thanks",
        "Very fun BMX pump game. Seen a few reviews say it's gets impossible after level 3 when it becomes pay to win. I don't agree I've just reached level 8 in a few hours. If you ride bikes off road and understand how to pump you'll love it",
        "Its way to hard to win and and the stats do nothing.  You have to be perfect and even then they fly by.  Still LOVE this game.  Just takes away the fun when you get left in the dust and you play the same lvl a million times hoping maybe one time you will be perfect.",
        "I loved this game for 3 days. Then it got to the point where I couldn't beat a level without upgrading my bike, but I couldn't upgrade my bike without spending real money. So disappointing. Don't waste your time if you don't want to spend real money!",
        "The game is fun up until around the third level. After that it becomes near impossible to win any races without spending actual money to upgrade your bike. Had a lot of fun with it up until that point, but it's definitely not worth spending actual money on. Deleted the game after pay to win clearly became a necessity.",
        "It was fun for a while - until it becomes impossible to beat any opponents with your current bike. The difficulty spikes around level 7 and the process of buying a new bike or upgrading your existing one becomes very frustrating, as you can't win any races to earn any money."

        "Ok best game ever. I always dreamed of playing games like pubg or ml something like that but its just not my thing yknow? How its hard to control and super annoying to play. But this god this takes the trophy. Easy control, fun game play, get to live again after dying so no need to be sad so yeah well done gi",
        "Update: Game was fixed very fast and is my favorite game. Everyone should download and play this game. It's simply amazing with great graphics!!! Only thing is why can't we have a woman character? I'm a woman in real life and want to play one online too!!! When are you all going to add women characters???",
        "Graphics are good an Gun play is pretty fair. When battling the game goes on runs where I get matched against teams whos members are way stronger then my team an I. Then it goes back to fair match making.   3 Month UPDATE: The game has turned into a money grab. You have no chance to compete against players that drop a bunch of money an have 4 an 5 star guns. This was the top shooting game in my opinion, but turning it into a pay to compete killed the fun with this game. Havent been match fairly against players in a couple weeks now. I would recommend trying a different p vs p shooting game.",
        "Amazing game, however there is one small problem, but not enough for me to not give it 5 stars. Recently when I've been watching an ad to double the reward at the end of the battle, the video has played until the end and it says the reward has been doubled, but I only receive the regular reward? It has happened 15-20 times and it's getting slightly annoying, as I'm about 4000 gunbucks short of what I should be now. Anyways, thanks for making such an awesome free game with little to no adverts!  UPDATE: video watching for additional rewards does not work with anything. No extra crates or supplies",
        "One of the best fps I've played. Graphics is cartoonish but fun, Remedy is underpowered in the sense that it doesn't generate a decent HP on each hit. On lower levels, it's decent but on higher levels against Porcupine, Ranger, Thunder it doesn't stand a chance that could be balanced out by either increasing the rate of fire or increased health generation on each hit , Lifestealer is pretty darn awesome but could do better with a bit smaller crosshair and little bit more accuracy",
        "Initially the game seems super addictive but once you hit level 16 it gets ridiculous. You have players who have spent money on guns and you're practically no match. Also the teaming of players should be balanced out. Another thing is even if you win a match you win around 30 trophies, if you lose there's a loss of 60 and if by chance you're internet is bad and you automatically get kicked out and cannot reenter you lose a 100 .Eventually you get sick and tired of all this and the game gets boring."

        "Loved this game!!! It is my new favorite game I love all the powerful weapons and armor. I wish there was chestplates instead of amulets and leggings instead of bracelets and an easier way to find out what your hero level, But else then that it was perfect. I loved how you can choose the controls to your own preference. Chame on anyone who gave it a less then 5 Star review. I still dont know ho to tell what your hero level was but still my favorite game.",
        "I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there's only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can't beat them! Keep making more awesome games!",
        "I can't help but love a mobile game that doesn't constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it's tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.",
        "I'm really loving this game it's simple but still a ton of fun. My one complaint would be the sometimes the grind is too long and I almost gave up... I wish the developers would throw in some kind of experience boost in the store instead of just being able to buy coins. I would pay real money for an exp boost and would love to support the Developers! just give me the chance!",

I have soent the last 3 hours trying to upgrade my helm to lvl 15. Guess where it is now, On goddamn lvl 11. I have spent less time grinding mounts in wow than getting my gear to lvl 15. Stupidest thing ever. One tip. Play the campagin lvls to lvl 40. Then dont do campagin at all and run hell for gold and xp. Repeqt to lvl 80 and then get rekt by the stupid item upgrade system."

Such a waste of time and money when no corrections are made.  Trying to give the developer a chance to redeem themselves from this error.",
        "I like the idea of changing prices and finding new recipes. I want the barista to automatically start the machines if there isn't one already there. i want to be able to hire another barista. I want to put my menu on the other wall. I want smaller windows. There's basically a lot of things i feel limited on and i still haven't figured out if i can change the color on wallpaper or not.",
        "I watched the 4 adverts and got a no diamonds for the doing so. I also watched the the add to pick a bonus prize, never got a that either. I used to play this game a lot and I've noticed the prices of everything have went up and including the spices. You no longer have the option to buy the cheaper furniture forcing you to spend more so customers come in to the Cafe. Very greedy and game makers. Sort these issues and give me the diamonds I'm owed or take away the ads.",
        "I'm used to like this game very much, addicting and lovely although it is so p2w. After certain update my game will start to reverse progress itself when one message pop out and state \"profile change, please restart\". Recently this problem occur very frequent and its so unbearable and irritating when what u done it just become undone, ALWAYS.  Im so fed up with this and quit for few days, wish developer can fix or lessen this issues or i will just uninstall it one day, thanks for reading.",
        "In the world of cafe games this one is a gem that stands out like a diamond in the rough. Fun and easy to play, it's set at a relaxing pace with you learning new recipes and chatting with your customers. Who are all really interesting people with unique storylines....I think one of them is trying to steal the Mona Lisa,lol.",
        "Fix the controls! Atleast have an option to enable and disable the editing of the layout or location of the items in-game. Such a pain that God-forbid you touched an item for a half a second too long it will prompt you to move, delete or put that item in storage."

        "I think it is a great game and great concept. Then in the stories characters would send pictures and videos. Great except you have to pay to see them. Not pay and boom you see stuff permanently, but its a weekly, monthly, or yearly thing like its a PlayStation plus account. There are ways of making money without doing this, its called advertisements. Yea they are annoying but they work. I would rather deal with ads and experience the full game then have the game be free but I have to pay for parts locked behind a pay wall. Aside from that the game is great.",
        "Well the reason I put a zero on the graphics was bc I didn't get to see them.😢 I just wanted to let you know that I want to request a update on the game maybe just like let people see the video chats and not the pictures. It was really hard knowing what it was talking about. Overall I like it!😀",
        "I love these stories because they're  breathe taking, mysterious, juicy, horrifying, gruesome and just amazing. I find clifhanger inspiring because it gives me bazaar ideas for when I want to write a horra story. However, I don't like the idea of paying because when I first downloaded this app I read the first story and while I was reading the story a blurred picture appeared so I was so excited but when I went to click on it, it said I hat to pay which was quite disappointing but other then that I feel like this app was a realy good idea I feel like it was well made well organised and well planned",
        "I understand this would be good entertainment for some, but honestly the set up you have is bad. having to pay multiple time to see a video or anything that is added as an extra is bad enough, having wait time are worse. On top of all of it the stories are lack luster. Please fix it.",
        "I love the app it's amazing. I advise u to download it but pls put ads bc u have to wait 14 mins I mean I'd rather watch ads than wait 14mins it just makes me angry.",
        "Love the whole concept, great how the phone actually rings like someone is calling you. Sadly this main novelty is hidden behind a subscription wall. Advertisements I can deal with but a subscription I point blank refuse."

        "Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it's just my phone. Also I'm not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)",
        "I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the \"mine\" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it's nicely done!",
        "I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.",
        "Overall the app is really great. It's the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you're not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.",
        "Input delays keep getting me killed. Instead of marking a bomb my input sets it off. I'd prefer two different inputs for marking or removing tiles.  I'm using a stylus too so I know it's not an issue of accidentally hitting the wrong tile.",
        "Great game. Love it! Sometimes the flag wouldn't place when you pressed a square, and once it selected a square instead of placing a flag, but I still really liked it. Wish there was a zoom because the mini square field is a ton of fun, but a bit small for my fingers. I still love the game though!"

        "EA please keep improving, i already in love playing this game until i realized that i had to spend a lot amount of money to upgrade my team and collecting great cards.. actually im not feeling good at this because i'm not a rich guy that could paid all those packs with very high price.. im saying this to represent all f2p players out there, although im not so f2p at all. i only spent a dollar to buy that eoe pass and nothing again until now. so please, give a chance for f2p player to keep playing this game with no jealousy with those high overall p2p players.. thanks",
        "Be careful on this game, its possible to spend real money and get absolutely nothing in return! For example I bought a Saint Patrick pack, 1000 gems a pack and got 10 lucky leafs, I could use the lucky to buy another pack, which I got a lucky leafs from, so I spent 10 lucky leafs got 1 lucky leaf that I couldnt use  unless I brought more! Literally got nothing for my money. This is EAs way of mugging people.",
        "Please add more sounds effect on this game, and fix the sfx that already on this app. I hope you add full match online like the other game (90 minutes) so we just not attack but defends too. Replay button must be great, and i have idea that you guys add event like \"best goal of the week\" or so, from that replay, we can save, and send to you, and you can choose who will win it. I think it will make people playing this game. Commentator should be great too if you add full match versus online. I love this game, please read it. Egy Maulana V plays for Lechia Gdańsk now. Add it! Add to all of your fifa games. That replay button should be great",
        "I just saved up all my team hero points, watched a heap of ads so I could build up stamina so I could do my best to try to get Mané in team heroes. About half way through collecting my hero rewards, the rewards pages started to go blank, and the last 25 packs I opened were empty. Is there any way to correct this?",
        "The game is good but it could be better. Elite players are too expensive  so it's hard to upgrade team. Informs and special cards are all untradable so unless you get lucky in events you won't get a chance to play with them. The new layout is better though. Unless you have plenty of time or money don't expect to progress in this game all that quickly. Mobile games should not be as grindy as console games.",
        "What's wrong with this game. I was playing Vs mode and was in world class level and got more then 600000 fans.and now I saw I'm in pro level.how it could be automaticy.fix it pls what the hell is going on.i make my progress playing v hard and all gone with in movement.even I did not play and lose."

        "Great idea to bring all the puzzles together into one app. The ads can get a little excessive at times, but you get used to it fast. The 10 puzzles for 25 coins is a very nice idea to encourage you to do more puzzles to get those coins! I haven't bumped into any problems with this game yet, so that's good! I entirely recommend this game for anybody who likes puzzles, novice or advanced! :)",
        "I love a lot of the puzzles on offer and the fact that you can earn plenty of coins along the way to use for hints when you get stuck. But some of the hints for some of the puzzles are extremely confusing to figure out, meaning I've gotten stuck with several of the puzzles and this is very disappointing for me.",

        "I love this game! I love how there are so many puzzles and how new ones are being added all the time. I've read some reviews and I do admit that there is a lot of ads, but for the most part I don't really mind it. I don't know if its just my type of phone or not, but I can usually skip these ads pretty quickly. So yeah this is a great app! Keep up the great work!",

This is an entirely inappropriate ad for a game rated like this. My 7 year old daughter would love to play these games but unfortunately I won't be letting her. Very cross."

        "Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It's nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don't want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn't get a key.",
        "Good little time waster, simple classic gameplay but puts its own unique twist on it.   Side note: I clearly played this game more than they thought anyone would as I have started getting repeated designs when I upgrade my spells xD",
        "It stopped working on my One plus! Help! I was excited about the side games! *********************************** Excellent, addictive fun. I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn't level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can't progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.",
        "All in all it is a really great game there are very few ads, its fun, the graphics are crisp. Its amazing except for one thing. On one of the levels all of the monsters have exactly 666 health and im not religious or anything but I'm pretty sure that if some one who is religious see's that, well lets just say that it might not be good for the company, so I suggest you fix this.  Thanks.",
        "Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion.",
        "Fun game but takes forever to get gold to upgrade. The cost to pay for the gems to buy so you can buy gold is really expensive. Not much dynamic to the game. Same stuff on each level just takes longer to bet enemies cause of higher HP."

        "Great start! No glitches. Performs smoothly! One of the best games on Android!! Must download Belive me I have never spent a single penny of \"real\" money and the game has never been unfair to me. Its really very good game. They found a sweet spot to balance both paid and free players. You just need to go on playing. I got the costliest robot of the market for free. Keep playing you'll eventually be strong enough and then you'll never stop to play.",
        "I really hated this game at first, when i was trying it on a friend's phone. It has really grown on me since then, i love it. I've been playing it for years now and still love it; the graphics are amazing, the game play is smooth, my clan is great, there's always new stuff to do or new bots/weapons to acquire. Yes, there are some people playing that kinda ruin a battle for your team but Hey, it's just a game and you still get points if you lose. Do your best and have fun.",
        "After being so long on the game I can see that the development team behind this game is pretty committed. I can see they really put effort into debugging, improving and renewing some elements of the game, I've decided to increase the star counts for War Robots (This is the original one). It's one heck of a game for mobile device I can tell you that. As for attaining the \"best robots\" or the \"best weapons\" in the game, it's hard but it's not impossible.  Just take part in the festive events... and you don't neccessarily need the \"best bots\" to annihilate your opponents...",
        "Supposed random game is not random. You only win the lowest prices until you start spending gold.  Black market is the same. Also it will take you a decade before you get the best robots unless you shell out your hard earned money. I hope the drop off scheme would earn me points, however it's just for one type of robot.",
        "This game is very much Pay to Win. So expect some people to crush you.  All the \"gambling\" games are fixed to make sure you get the lowest possible reward. Don't waste your gold gambling. All that said this game is worth 5 stars just for the gameplay. The graphics are amazing and the game is fun even when you end up against someone spending hundreds of real dollars on robots and gear. Be patient. You may not always win or do well but in time you can give all but the most hardcore spenders a run for their money (all pun intended)",
        "It will be cool if we can upgrade not  just one robot but all!! And pls double the gold I rlly need it right now for just 1 orkan And also why is it so hard to get a weapons like with puzzle logo on it it's like 10,000 can you imagine that! If I made the game I would do just 6,000 or 5,000! One more make a single player like player vs AI and it will say easy medium hard"

My dad rates tones of games and I'm the one playing some of them and I told my dad that these adds are so horrible I even had to report it. Now here me out great game but the adds. And in the beginning there is no instructions on how to do the game so like I said in the beginning there is a add at the end of every round so in the beginning there are many adds. Now i think there are more adds then game in this game. I'm not trying to be mean so don't go crying😢 to ur boss.",

It keeps me entertained while I am bored or when I am on the bus on my way to school. But there are way to many ads and I hope u guys please fix that. 💜",

Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don't get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don't mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!",

Other than that complaint it's actually a nice game for a quick 5 minute time waster.",

I again installed it and started from the beginning and after completing 573 games & 1487 stars I am giving you just 2star rating because game lag all the time sometimes the ads got struck or maybe during rewind I lose my $1 but the game didn't rewind back instead crash and auto shutdown and I ahve to start the application again. Before adding 30th season please update your games stability it will be more useful.",
        "Surprised at how good this game is... very clever concept and I'm only half an hour into it and I'm already hooked! Recommend it to anyone who's a fan of football, well in fact, anyone who's a fan of gaming in general... well worth checking out, chuffed I came across it. 5***** for all features from me. The developers really did a fine job. Get it now is my advice! Peace out people :)",
        "Would like more customisation options for my character. This game keeps crashing for no reason and doesn't like to reward it's loyal users. It is a fun game if they just let you play it. Fun game, but the gold farming and inattentiveness to what the users want will ruin it. Great game, lots of potential if taken in the right direction, but WAY to glitchy.",
        "Like most other games, there is too much effort to bait you into micro transactions. The older games were so much better. It's a shame the Devs have resorted to such money grabbing standards.",
        "Kinda annoying game. Teammates won't go after the ball and watching ads sometimes doesn't let you try again.                 Season 3 level 76 is impossible I pass to my guy and he doesn't bother to move a finger.",
        "I like the tactic aspect of it, pretty good time waster. Took me a while to beat it, but didn't have to spend a dollar to do it. The story itself is very unrealistic and after 15 seasons I completely stopped following it and focused only on the games."

        "Buggy! Once they fix the signing bugs, this might be a good game. Now, there are widespread examples of users not being able to get in; instead, it freezes at a white screen.  Many videos crash the game, which means you lose the treat you would otherwise earn by watching those ads. Other crashing problems as well.",
        "For not getting even the first event bird out of 3 in alien excavation after opening so many premium eggs reaching (*4) of the premium eggs. I blame - chimera and rovio. Either the makers of the game are idiots or the game is stupid and seriously 2000 per month for an imaginary egg everyday that cannot guarantee a 4 or 5 star bird. Yeah, the makers of the game really are idiots.",
        "the game is really fun and humorous. I love the clan feature- found a great clan to be part of. there are glitches that rovio needs to iron out that affect play. I am hoping this new big update helps fix all that. the changes look to be really good. excited to see what they've done.",
        "I did not expect to enjoy this nearly as much as I have. The frequent events are nice and having a guild just makes them better. I don't feel compelled to be social be because there is no chat, just playing the game. It is a wonderful balance.",
        "Love the game. The game play is great. Only down side is that I feel that the game cheats against me sometimes by adding enemies. Only happened about 3 times now. ***edit*** I have since realized there are certain pigs that do add more pigs when hit. The game doesn't cheat. I'm extremely happy with the game play and ability to build a great team without paying a whole bunch of money. You just need patients and good planning.",
        "Decent game, lots of fun to keep you coming back. I would of rated a 4 star game but every time I need to watch a video the game stops working, stopping me from getting a free premium egg or opening chests!"

        "Honestly, this is the best game I have ever played. It's very addicting and I think I have a very high IQ because I have beat four out of five levels in less than 3 seconds. Longest level I've played is maybe 15 seconds. I have beat the first two sets of 50 levels within about 10 to 15 minutes. I'm curious, you know how there are game runners who beat games in a record time? Is there some kind of game Runner tournament or any challenges for this game? I am beat this game completely in arecord time. Thank you developer for making the best game ever. This game can actually bring out the genius in anyone. Btw, I haven't used any hints also, I'm impressing myself... Yay!!!😎😎😎",
        "\"contains ads\" is an understatement! unless you plan on paying, dont bother.  you play a stage for 5 to 10 seconds and get an ad after EVERY SINGLE STAGE! AND THE ADS USE DATA.  videos. long ones. spammy. uninstalled.    i would have maybe paid if the game did not turn me off so quickly with their ridiculous amount of ads that made me annoyed instead. so i uninstalled instead of getting far in, and rewarding dev with $$$.",
        "Dumbest game ever! A silly trick is enough to complete 20 stages in 5 mins. Trick -&gt; Just extend the start point to the direction which you cant cover by a whole traversal! Oh forgot to tell you, out of that 5 mins, 2-3 minute is just ads!",
        "It's a cool game where you outplayed every other game on your phone and it helps to kill time when you're going somewhere or just waiting on someone or class to start.",
        "I love this game when I'm feeling stressed or stuck on a project I start to play and it relaxes me enough to get my creative juices flowing again",
        "I don't have anything else like it, and so far its a much different kind of challenge then I'm used to."

        "Very fun game. Multiplayer is awsome! Please add private matches so i can play with friends.   Physics still need work to hold up to real world standard. Rocks dont follow thru on take outs in real life as they do in this game. Also (rules), a rock needs to make it all the way over the hogline in order to stay in play.  Thank you for making this game!",
        "Best curling game I've seen Enjoy the graphics, controls, love the 1 on 1 against international players and career game options. Seems consistent and easy to learn. Needs a few tweaks like... throws that don't make hog line or touch hogline must be taken out of play. Have seen the bug that others reported, sometimes rock after thrown disappears , some kind of glitch that happens occasionally.  Sometimes the sweepers don't react to my movement to sweep. Would love to see 8 stones instead of 6. If you love curling, this should satisfy",
        "Great game except for hackers. There is a hack that allows some to bump or change finish of a throw. Yoy can go from having 2 scoring to opponent having the score, changing after the rocks stopped. Developers have not replied ti report. Fine for some fun but don't waste your money in upgrades",
        "Good fun. Physics seem good, sometimes my sweepers don't sweep at all but I don't think that makes too much difference. I'd like to play alternate ends rather than winner goes first and the rocks don't spin which would add a bit of something to the graphics. I've yet to play online, just practicing against the CPU.",
        "Decent. The game is close to curling. Issues are that the only real way to earn coins it to play online mode. If you do career mode you actually have to SPEND coins to play, and there's no payout for winning. The rocks don't behave like real curling stones, but it's the best curling game you'll find on your phone.",
        "Physics are not like real curling, rocks are dead in the house when hit, physically impossible doubles and triples, improper use of the free guard zone rules (if a rock is in the house, it is free to be removed...not in this game).  Connecting people across the globe is a cool idea but you frequently lose people and you win without finishing a game.  I've played for 35 years so I speak from experience."

        "My favorite puzzle/physics app. After I reached my goal of 3 stars on all the levels, I was sad my conquest was over. Then I discovered a whole other area of the app that consists of user created levels to solve. Now I've got new puzzles everyday thanks to the active fans in the brain-it-on community and I submit my own levels on occasion by using the level editor. If you like solving puzzles this is a great way to escape for awhile and exercise your brain at the same time.",
        "I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.",
        "this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates",
        "I'm surprised this game scores so well. It's an exercise in drawing/scribbling, not physics. The puzzles are very one dimensional and most of them are solved by trial and error over thought and skill. It's a novel idea but given what else is available out there I wouldn't pay a penny for this game as it lacks innovation, originality and just feels very dated.",
        "LOVE this game!! Literally, I don't think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it's just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜",
        "A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it's really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it."

        "Hey RobTop, the game is ok, but there is one issue. im used to playing geometry dash with my samsung chromebook 3 (it doesn't have touchscreen) and when i press the spacebar on my computer (this is the same issue on geometry dash lite and subzero) it doesn't let me jump. And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.",
        "This is really hard. I can't buy the full game as I am only 9, but I think I am missing out on a lot. Please add check points to normal mode as some levels are basically impossible",
        "This game stress me out but the next day when I play it I beat the lv in one go and fills my heart up with joy! So what if the control's are sensitive? I know they are.. but if you take a day and give it another go you know what happens and you do great!",
        "If you are looking for a fun game, this is not one of 'em. It is so annoying. It gets me is mad that I've DELETED it twice. But... when you win the levels you feel like you have just met Jesus. Also, the first few levels are easy.",
        "I love this game just...can you fix one glitch? On the final level final area the wave is bugged ...when I tap it goes down by itself! Can you please fix it? I was trying over 3 hours to make it but I can' t because of the glitch :( Please fix it.",
        "Got all the way to the end,  and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow,  and ended up having to restart all of the levels,  fix this,  it doesn't happen with the other geometry dash games,  just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted...  Fix then 5 stars"

You have to aim like 30 feet above your opponent and hope that you are lobbing the knife high enough to make it there. Sometimes I would somehow win a round without even throwing a knife. Other times I'd die in the first second of play after being hit 1 time but it would take me at least 3 hits to kill my opponent. Watched a video for a free crate and then the game went back to the startup screen like it was rebooting and i had to watch another to open it. Not very much to do either. Im out.",

        "Purchasing the other ponies is worth it. Don't know why other people are complaining. It's only 5 dollars, you could get a DQ lunch for 5 dollars. Anyways, game is amazing. What's cool is that you can reset your progress so you can have fun all over again. Amazing work Budge Studios!",
        "This game is my 5 yr olds favorite thing to do during trips. She loves the music and animation, and the gameplay is entertaining enough to keep her engaged. It's definitely worth the few bucks to get the add free version.",
        "Pay to play mechanic. Seems rather predatory for a game targeted for younger CHILDREN. Not to mention the constant barrage of ads that can only be removed by paying for ponies which shouldn't be EA'd. Outside of that the game is enjoyable but the paywall issue is a problem. Devs... you should feel bad about yourself.",
        "Remove the paywall and just charge for the game, it's worth it and people will buy it. But the way you can't unlock ponies without paying is insulting. Such a shame... I'll be sure to avoid any games you make in the future. And, yes, that's a bit harsh. But if we all don't stop letting devs get away with this kind of thing every company will turn into EA and will ruin the fun of gaming.",
        "Installed it, launched it, after the bungie screen was presented by a full screen ad for some game involving a woman + handcuffs + panties. Not a good look for a game aimed at children, my 6 year old was standing behind me.",
        "Why advertise the game as \"free\" when it really isn't?  You can only get so far with the \"free ponies\" before you hit a pay wall that requires parents to purchase additional ponies to finish the quest.  The reason I say \"free ponies\" is that your child is subjected to a ridiculous amount of ads in order to play. The only way to get rid of the ads is to buy the ponies.  Even though my daughter loves the game and it's easy for a 5 year old to play, I had to uninstall it due to the ad content.  You really should be more careful who you solicit ads from for content designed for children under 8."

It was super fun and interactive at first then it gives you the option to pay to continue to play or to complete free offers to unlock the game for free.  I have found that you can complete as many offers ad you want but the game won't ever unlock and emailing the support web site doesn't do any good either. They don't ever respond and it is a complete waste of time.  Don't waste your time on this game.  Go out and find yourself something worth playing because this surely isn't it.",

After buying you eventually get to the accordion level just before leaving the prison roof only for one (or 2 on some phones) ball being outside the play area which makes the mini game impossible.  Many reviews all over the internet highlighting this bug but the developer has not bothered to fix it.  AVOID THIS DEVELOPER !!!!!!!!!!",

Couldn't get past the level where the inmate has the task of cleaning the glass pane and has to gain entry into the clerks' office...it just freezes up and I can't resolve it no matter what I tried.",

The only down side is that the spins cost alot of coins and those coins can be hard to earn. So 4.5 stars i would rate it is that was a option but its not so i rate it a a big fat 5",
        "this game is the bomb. it is stupid that they asked you is this game beautiful, of course not, people die, and crack their necks, backs, and shoulder blades. This game all in all soooooooo fun and you should totally get it. just say no if you want to write a reaport on this game because it will ask you is this game is beautiful which it is not. GOOD LUCK, good  night, new york city. at late night talk show with stephen colebert......jk",
        "Would rate give starts, but the amount of ads is absolutely ridiculous. I'm actually thinking about uninstalling please fix that. I know you want players to pay but in all actuality, it's quite stupid. Anyway, I do believe the game is quite fun",
        "Whatever they did last update broke the game for me, this is why I never buy anything in these games. No way to contact anyone to resolve any problems.  Game gets boring anyway",
        "I love this game a lot. The only problem is that when you do the Dailey spin, you only get like coins. And then with the coins you can buy another spin which is what I do. And I get even more coins. It's really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and",
        "It's a really good game and works really well. The only thing I don't like is how the cost of the daily spin goes up every time. It is quite annoying. Other than that I really enjoy playing this game. Great job guys😀"

        "Great game, me and the family enjoy it immensely and we have all made our contribution, thank you. The controls in card battles on the phone are too fiddly, considering there is a lot of unused space on the screen: this would have been developed differently if it wasn't attempting to mimic the desktop version. Lazy! Is the \".. playing over WiFi...\" warning still relevant? Unlimited mobile data and 4g means many of us have as good a connection as fixed line. Love the game, thank you.",

But I did get my last account deleted for some reason I was mad and couldn't get it back so I had to create a new one",
        "Everytime I play a club arena game (free every 24hours) it will keep telling me i disconnected from the game while my Internet connection is fine. But when I play other normal arena games, it turns out fine. I find it very annoying because i have to wait 24 hours to play my favourite club games and it always disconnects, and it makes me mad. I hope you notice this comment and leave a reply... Please fix this... Thanks :(  Edit: It works fine now, thank you! :)",
        "Very fun game, my most played game by far but the major issue in this game is hackers. You get good and start to play the end gamers and realize 90% of them are bots with millions of coins and as soon as the game starts you are sent balloons to your side that cannot be activated until round 15+! It's frustrating to earn my coins legit just to have them taken by all the hackers and bots. Ruins the game when makers aren't doing anything about it.",

But when I'm connected to Wi-Fi there's too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you'll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I'm playing the game??!! It's too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.",
        "Well before I say my review, I would like to clear out a few of the negative reviews. There are not very many ads at all, in fact I barely ever even get any. Second, the controls don't suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.",
        "I don't know why the controls have a 3.7 rating, they're actually pretty good. The gameplay's decent and the graphics are too. Btw I get over 600 score everytime just to let you know because the controls quote on quote \"barely move the car\"",
        "I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don't you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?",
        "THIS GAME IS THE WORST!!! Save yourself some time and DON'T install this thing I can barely move the car so please make easier to control. I know your trying but I,m sorry I,m uninstalling this game.",
        "It's stupid. It's really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn't turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked."

        "I have loved Hot Wheels for years and this is a good game. Fun and challenging. However I have been a bit frustrated because sometimes I just explode for touching a wall like on level 6. Awesome😒 Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don't reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie's handling. You killed it, literally. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.",
        "The game is good. There are problems though. D-muscle is absolutely useless. It's the worst car in the muscle set and has no business being the fourth car in that set. The final upgrades for the fourth car on all sets are far too expensive. It requires an insane amount of grinding to unlock the last cars. The prices of supercharged upgrades are all over the place. Why do all of Haulinator's cost 100 coins while Dune It Up's cost 1000-2000?",
        "Good graphics. If you fail and do exact same again you may pass level if you level up car, you end up failing sooner and have to slow down but after trying 7 r 8 times gets annoying and the level up car is worse than your basic car. Too frustrating so deleting",
        "Game would be good if the dev's took time to work out the huge amount of bugs. Everytime I run this, I get 3 races deep then everything stops responding. Running it on Samsung Galaxy S9+ with perfect cell service. All the buttons click but do nothing. Uninstalled.",
        "Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I've never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.",
        "My 2 almost 3 year old and I really like this game. It's pretty fun BUT it seems to freeze up after a few races and I have to shut the game off and restart it to play more. This obviously frustrates little man and I'm sure I'm not the only one this has happened to. Other than that, we think it's a great game."

Got 3 stars got 3 stars but when I went to go to the next level it show only 2.   Levels 8 thru 12 I won first time. Level 13 I lost and the same thing happened as level 7.  Other than that I really like the game.  Very cute graphics.",

        "The game is good (played like 5 missions so far) but i feel like there should be a jump and crouch feature, even if its just a jump feature. Maybe make some levels where you gotta utilize the jumping, maybe throw in some jet packs during some missions/raids to get to a certain area to either continue the mission and/or find some hidden crates. Also, maybe add some melee weapons too?  Besides that, the game is fun, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay could improve tho.",
        "This game has little bit inspiration from many big games like destiny (duh), titanfall, doom. The game does have similarities to dead trigger. All the random loot is cosmetic, guns are easily obtained through missions. Good performance on my S7, but need internet 24×7 to run, even during campaign.",
        "Literally the best mobile game I have ever played. All IAP so far is cosmetic, which is great. Very similar to destiny with it's own flavor. I do wish you we're able to jump though and shotguns in pvp are OP. Game is optimized well for my mid-grade device. However, it won't run on my gf's ZTE Grand X Max which is very unfortunate considering it's basically the same phone as mine. Hopefully this changes soon because we really looked forward to playing together. Download this game!!!",
        "Giving the review after 24hrs of gameplay. Have to say that it's awesome. Cudos to the creators. Loving the gaming experience. Graphics rendering should be calibrated more. Make sure to do that in next update. Coins and slots are hard to obtain. Many of them don't want  to spend real money so better give some daily tasks to complete and earn coins.",
        "Its actually pretty good for a starting mobile game. Its a little buggy, but thats because its new. If y'all want a mobile Destiny, this is where its at. Shooting is relatively comfortable (can't figure out how to jump), and movement isnt too bad either. Not bad at all dev team, good work! I expect good things to come of this if you don't try to go the dumb pay2win route.",
        "Good game but I expected it to be the best.  No loading issues or bugs encountered so far. Game loading takes about 6 seconds so no big deal. If madfinger sees this please add new maps and skins and weapons in SGDZ and enhance the game experience at FB as playing the game at gameroom sucks. I promise I will bring you about 100 new players if you did that."

I got a bit impatient waiting for all the ads to end but I liked the game set-up. I think that was a neat idea. I just think it would be better without all the interruptions",
        "I think it should be a bit more realistic and by that I mean more people on the streets; if you crash into someone, that person would come out of their car angry and cars get damaged when you crash into them. Maybe, to add a bit more reality to the game, you could add the money that they pay you to the levels. Apart from that it is an excellent game. However, some people, when they get in a taxi, chat away to the taxi driver."

        "Awsome game. Completed all levels without any hack jzt waited  for hope   ( the lives ) evrbdy shld try this. Sry i gonna uninstall this app only bcoz i finished all levels. Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.",
        "The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don't get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new \"enemies\". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you've lost some lives. But that's not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.",
        "I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It's more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.",
        "Remember the old days when platformers taught you through trial and error how to interact with new game mechanics? If you don't like that, you'll hate this game. So much fun, so creative, and once you start to get down one of the new features, it ramps it up and keeps you learning creatively how to beat the level. I love this game, it's a fantastic platformer that will challenge you to learn as you go instead of giving you a tutorial every time something new comes up.",
        "Completed all but just couldn't get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I've ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.",
        "I love this game 😍😍 it is my favourite but.... I don't like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it's a great idea😋😋 btw i loved it 😍😍😍 ill give it 5 stars then😊😊"

This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can't without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.",
        "First up the images used as what the game looks like are fakes. I saw too many polygons.... (Shudder) Secondly there is no start menu. NOPE! Just some fancy loading screen and boom you're in the game without a chance to look at the controls. Plus your first mission is ruined by the tutorial at the worst places on the track.   Bad game knockoff. If you download this just delete it. This game is [EXPLICATIVE]",
        "Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?",
        "Update: so I've been playing for several weeks now. You cannot win with maxed out mods, racing the same level cars. They're twice as fast and you can only knock off 3 cars at the beginning of the race and you're unable to catch with others. Even if you spend money, you will not get 1st place in a lot of the races. Very unbalanced game. Whoever programmed the ai should be fired  Fun game, but the intrusive ads are ridiculous. It pops up in the middle of a race, before and after the race, finished off by asking you to pay to remove ads.",
        "The controls is very floaty like your car is late responding when tilted and i really like that this game is very fun and time wasting but it lacks car selection very small but i know it will add soon. And i thought the pic is real but it is not even the same on the game for its originality that all thanks",
        "People have low requirements nowadays. This game doesn't deserve a 4.4 rating. It feels good as long as I stay in the menu (even with the weird japanese mascot) but once the game loads it gets horrible. The camera angles are terrible, the cars feel like toys in the overscaled world, the car's softshadow is terribly aligned and the physics simulation is just mediocre. The whole game is just a mediocre clone of Asphalt 8, I don't understand why people choose an inferior copy instead of the original one..."

Why is that? Now the only way for me to earn more gems os through the free gems  (by watching adds), getting a high enough ranking in battlez, or buying them.",
        "I think the new update is nice battlez is awesome and the good news is that my phone doesnt crashes anymore and when I played Inzanity it did'nt lag great rework but 1 question, WHY DID YOU REMOVE ULTIMATE BATTLE AND DEMONSTRATION MINI GAME THEMES TO EVERY WORLD?? Im sick of every level with just only themes",
        "I think the new update is very cool. It adds some multiplayer into the game. When I heard of this new update I rushed to my phone and started playing. It turned out to be good I was happy and thought it would turn out well. Then after that I remembered pvz one. It's multiplayer mode was much better. One player would be plants and the other zombies. Why could they not have made that. It was such a good idea. I would personally play that mode more than this. But it's just my opinion. Thanks for reading.",
        "Since last update it is very unstable and keeps crashing. Also every time i finish the last inzanity it crashes then once reloaded says expired so ive lost out. In fact im not that interested anymore. Im not a fan of battlez and it all seems geared to that now so had fun while it lasted.",
        "I HATE YOUR UPDATE. Battlez mixed battle between players who bought plants with money with the players who don't is totally unfair. There are many players out there like me who play everyday collecting coins by coins and gems by gems patiently waiting for a good plant offer that we can buy with gems. Buying plants with money is not on the budget. I'm not angry. I'm sad. Because PVZ is always one of my top listed games. Now it's pathetic. Crashed. Unfair. Expensive.",
        "Just like.But EA just want money right? You just wasting money.Money cause something bad.This wirld need to follow the truth path.Not money path.I dont like those plant,pinatas and more that need to buy with money.Useless."

        "This is an extremely fun game. O have a few suggestions on how to fix things on the game. I noticed three things while playing this game. 1. There is not a continue playing option. This can easily be fixed and with all of the great work from Dvloper I think that this is not too far away. 2. I noticed you can uncrouch in the tunnel in the basement even though you are not all the way through. 3. Everything is in a certain place. If one object is in a certain place then if you are familiar with the game enough you will know where the other objects are. To be honest this is not a minor concern but still could be fixed. Other than that I can't stop playing! Thank you so much!!",
        "I love this game, especially when you hide just in time and there's that tense moment wondering if she saw you. I get chills down my spine when I'm hiding and I hear her saying \"I see you\". If I could, I would give this game 100 stars. I would suggest having a mode after you beat Granny to become Granny because I think it would be cool to chase the player around the house. Also, I think the game would benefit from a much bigger house, more drawers and of course, more locks. Love the game, keep up the good work.",
        "It's really really really fun game.  But I think if you guys do some more improvements so it will be much fun.  Here's what I think:  1. I think you should make the house much bigger.  2. You should add more enemies for example:  child o' slenderina,  slenderman and the spiders.  3. You should add an Adventure mode.  Where you need to find some books or something like an emblem like that stuff to make them uncursed like that.  4. Last but not least, you should add more weapons for example:  Pistol,  sword,  injection etc.    If you do that,  it will be super cool and fun.   ThanQ 😃👍",
        "It's definatly one of the better (more fun) horror games on the store, but I feel like there could be some more improvements. Firstly I think that if you've completed hard than there should be an (almost) impossible mode. Also minor details such as different textures and Easter eggs would be good. Last, I think that when you escape there should be an outside section where it's still got puzzles but it's more about the atmosphere. (Maybe that could just be for the \"impossible mode\") but it would make the game a lot more enjoyable. Also maybe a reward for escaping. (For incentive). Thank you and maybe you could take this into consideration :) also new app icon plz",
        "Who doesn't love this game? It's bone chilling and exciting for the whole family (Litterally my whole fam plays this game) it would be cool to have a mode where there was no granny just to explore the house and get a feel for how to escape. Also some weapons to attack granny. Lastly a map of where granny is would be super cool. Good luck!",
        "It's a vary good game so hood i can't believe it's on mobile game! Also the game mechanics are so amazing as well. Then there's series of things you have to do that keeps you in the game for a long time; the theme and music fit the atmosphere, and there's not much of a problem with the game either. \"This game gives me goosebumps!\" (From Dashigames aka Dachi) he loves it as well too. #goodgamemakemore"

        "Good app but few glitches. One day I was playing against computer. It made a miraculous move of eating my pawn at a place where none of my pawn ever existed. Awesome. :P Net connectivity is as good that when other apps show good connection under high speed wifi, ot shows no connectivity. Lol",
        "Freakking great. Best chess app EVER!!!!. I have the free one and it can teach you tactics, help you in situations and if you dont want that no need to do it. You can even costumize your wallpaper or theme. Skill ratings 100-2600 playing real people. Or you can play a computer, 400-1200 or 1400 i think. Great app, get it you wont regret it.",
        "I think this app is horrible simply.. I'm a diamond member, but I don't think i will be for much longer. There's other chess sites that don't disconnect and lag so much. Main dislikes is the constant disconnection, no order at all in the videos section. Tactics, lessons and drills bugs and crashes when turning the mobile or screen goes off. Specially drills bugs and just repeats the same one over and over when you finished instead of going to the next one. Also, app was unhappy I was logged in on my turned off computer.. come on..",
        "I cannot respond to chats. The support team promises they will fix the issue, but it's only lies so that I can give the app a decent rating. Now my custom board, pieces, and background settings get reset every 2 days. Frustrating app.",
        "The last update sucks! Premove is not at all intuitive. It now just shows the block which we want to move the pawn and doesn't move the pawn itself like before. The toast message that showed 'challenge rejected' was better than the current one. Dislike it!!",
        "I have no connection issues but some times game discontinues with showing no n/w.pls solve otherwise good game Finally uninstalled... Worst team."

        "Was an awesome game Very addictive game! Was well done.. until the update. Needs more pens and new themes as I have thousands of coins but nothing left to unlock. Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don't register as pineapple hits for the counters. There's a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it",
        "Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.",
        "Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.",
        "Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.",
        "BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn't have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What's bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I'm not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game.",
        "How can I say this? I can not stop playing this!! Everytime I set a new and higher record I want to achieve and I only stop until I get there xD atm with 6400 coins and everything unlocked 😁😁 please release new content for months and months!! It will make me so happy! Thank you for this game."

        "Love it to pieces. The characters are loveable and the stories are fun. I got through three to four in a few days I can't put it down. The only downside is certain decisions cost gems. Major ones are fine and expected but to have to be a jerk to someone because you don't have enough kind of sucks a little. But it's not often and by no means a deal breaker.",
        "Actually, I came here because I'm a fan of Jakayla Toney. I'm a reader from wattpad, and I'm checking out her story here as game. 😂 Anyways, I finished one chapter and I'm enjoying so far. Gotta check out other book after I'm done. Looking forward to this app, though I don't really like the choices costing gems.But its okay, still like it. 😊",
        "Every GOOD choice involved money.  Hard to find one interactive story game that doesn't involve money so much.  I don't mind paying for extra bonus scenes in the end but at least give us some GOOD selection WITHOUT charging!  Then maybe I'll rate it higher",
        "I'm frustrated by the fact that this is supposed to be a choose your own adventure game, but all the choices that make the most sense to me are stuck behind a paywall, requiring me to purchase those choices with a currency called diamonds. I get the story passes, and I would have been fine if that was the only barrier to read the story, but to require you to pay money for making what you feel are the right choices is just greedy.",
        "The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the chapters update too late that you lose interest and sometimes forget what's happening in the story. If the chapters were to update on a regular basis then readers would feel the need to keep this app and will constantly play instead of playing the waiting game. However the content is good and most storylines get you hooked.",
        "I literally have nothing bad to say about this game. It's one of the best story/choices/chapter games out, in my opinion. I'm ready for sequels and the remaining chapters of Bad Boy Blues. Other than that, keep up the good work."

        "Great game This is a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing aesthetics and highly addictive. Totally worth the $2 for the premium version. I do have one problem though: even though I am pretty decent at the game, Google Play won't give me any achievements even though I'm sure I have earned some. It won't even let me open achievements or leaderboard pages. Is anybody else having this issue?",
        "I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I've decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I've upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!",
        "There are so many good things to list about this game. First, the graphics are extordinarily beautiful. And how much this game can relax you is AMAZING! When I play this, I swear my stress is gone. This game is never stressful. I find it amazing how satisfying this game is. I also love how realistic this game it is. The veiw and echoing is what really make up this game. Every sound is perfect for the setting. You need to download this NOW!",
        "Really fun and addicting! The first time i saw this app was when my dad told me about this game, he said that it was very good. Literally the first 10 minutes i played this game my mind was blown and i beacame addicted. Around 2 years later(now) i found this game again and instantly installed it. I love this game and I have played it for a long time. The graphics and music are amazing. This a really good game and you should install it! Who could think that glass could be so fun. However I think this game would be better if some of the thing you have to pay for would be for free.",
        "Great game, but premium is almost a requirement. The game itself is great, with an uber-cool, never-seen-before concept of smashing glass with metal balls in mysterious dimensions. The only problem is that getting premium is almost a requirement if you want to do well in the game. You can't continue the level once you die without paying. I would rate this game five stars if it weren't for this.",
        "So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn't save where I'm at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won't be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!"

Really developer?, ya cant wait a tad longer to stop the game and make us stare at a cat puzzle? The worst. I didnt even play it long enough to appteciate the poor controlls. Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.",
        "Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)",
        "I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn't have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it's Definitely Not a game you'd wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!",

        "I like this new update. Hanks now have His own happy meter like Tom and Angela. Nice. Also this is just my suggestion. Can you guys also make My Talking Ben and My Talking Ginger. Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that's it. You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It's not fair. Lastly good job guys.",

I also did like that u got stickers for taking pics. I did end up having to uninstall the game as it took up to much storage space D: Overall I did really enjoy the game yay =D"

        "The responsiveness of the controls I  this game make it unplayable... it's slightly more responsive than the original sonic dash but it's still no where near good enough for such a fast paced game.  I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it's the same on all of them",
        "Way too many advertisements. I actually downloaded this game because subway surfer makes start over everytime you download it but after my next tech upgrade I'm going back to that, atleast the game not flooded with ads.",
        "I would give it 5 stars, I made an in app purchase to remove ads, but after the game updated non Sega ads started showing again and it asked me to make another purchase in order to remove the non Sega ads AGAIN... love the game, hate the ads...",
        "TOO MANY ADS!! Decent game but ruined by an add every 20s. Sonic forces doesn't have half as many adds as this game but isn't as good so looks like Sega have fallen short trying to add more pounds to their fortunes and made the game unplayable.",
        "Ads are back. I paid for a red ring bundle, which did remove them for a while, but they're back. The only reason I made a real purchase was so that I wouldn't have ads, so can someone please remove the ads from my account. On another note, I really like this, and nice to see Shadow playable again."

        "Been playing since goblins vs gnomes (2014) and still play today. Not a diehard player, but as my buddy put it, \"hearthstone is the best toilet game ever\". It's pretty simple and easy to learn. Newer and f2p players have a bit of a rough go, but you can easily keep pace in this game for less than $100 a year.",
        "It's a fun game for a while before you will get frustating. Too much depending on luck no matter how good your deck is if you couldnt get the card to do your combo its useless againt an opponant that have better draw than you.  Also if you are free to play you have to be petient to get ass kick for a while till you have luck enough to get some useful legend card.",
        "I love card games and this got some awesome elements. However... The randomness and luck in this game is pure bs. You can be in a winning position and still lose because of 1 in a 10000000 chance of the oponent getting lucky. Even when I win I feel bad from winning because I know the oponet was unlucky.... It is very rare I get a game where I think. This game was awesome because we both did our best.",
        "I never even got to play. I have now tried to install 3x. The first two times the app became unresponsive. The third it caused my phone to crash and reboot. I have a pixel which should be perfectly capable of running it. If not then don't offer it for this device. First blizzard product that's ever pissed me off.",
        "Great game! Love all the really cool animations! I do have a problem that since I installed the game, my store has been closed 😐 I am installing it on PC right now to see if I can get to the store there. Game play is awesome though!",
        "Really fun game. 3 stars cause it closes very easily. If I get a phone call even when I dont answer the game closes.even on wifi it closes. Then it takes too long to reload causing me to lose a turn. This is the worst in arena because losing one turn will kill you and it becomes a waste of gold. Please do whatever you can to solve this problem."

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love living the family life with my wife and kids but I will always miss poker night with the fellas. Now that I have stumbled upon WSOP I have been able to invite all of the fellas to join and we can all play together still once again. THANK U!!!!",
        "Seen to many players leave because of this. Players with over a billion in chips. Goes to a small table with players having 30k or 40k. Goes all in every hand and kills the table. Players ask him why he does it and not play bigger tables. His answer because game allows me to and I can knock out player after player. Regulate players if they have X amount of chips play on bigger tables. Let the smaller players gain chips and enjoy the game.",
        "It appears that I have reached a certain point where my free play is being met with bot resistance. I've gained over ten million in one day and lost it all and more in suck outs. This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you'd have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun",
        "Win a bit and loose everything in a few hands...  Once you win a good hand, leave the table.  Dealer will not give a a chance.  After this review, I received an e-mail from the designer assuring me, that game is fair.  I have been losing several hands with pocket KK, QQ, JJ, and so for.  So I stand with my original review.   Win on a good hand and leave game.  Or else you will lose it ALL!",
        "This is a good game , only prob I have is there seems to some hackers/botting which makes it a little hard to play. Now as far as some people's comments even if the  people with a billion chips come to smaller tables , if you all knew how to play you wouldn't have to worry about them taking your chips. Trust me the majority of them started out at low tables also having to have to fight the ones with more money. I have been playing this game for a few years and love it.  Like I said only problem I have is to many bots/hackers.",
        "I really enjoy this game .At first I just added it for one of the games on app like to gain points for gift cards.And of course to learn how to play poker. Now if their no points given for this game I would still play it. I totally enjoy this game , and the people that play it. Its truly an enjoyable game. This game is a keeper know matter what.tthe only thing I wish is that their was more coins given ."

But its good,  I think what sets thia one apart from the other tap to play games is the frequency of bonuses. While granite not the best for your phones battery life. The bonuses come very frequently and add an appeal to the game I haven't found with others. This is day one though so keep that in mind. Good rates from me though on first play",

I'm getting bored after 3 trophies, I was expecting more challenging after 2 or 3 trophies. Anyway they worked well on this game! Congrats",

I did manage to find it in the end but it took a while. This is an amazing app and would definitely recommend it but it would be ideal If it worked In the back ground and you wouldn't have to keep turning the system on and off but otherwise app great app :)",

Why change something that wasn't broken!! 😡  UPDATE...since the second update the game is back and I LOVE it. Thank you so much for sorting it out. I genuinely love this game!!",
        "So frustrating to play since the update. Game constantly crashes, cannot play for longer than a few minutes before it crashes, can't go into any other hospitals because it crashes, can't watch videos because it crashes.....*STILL crashing, even after new update. I'm now getting a message on update screen 'this app may not be optimised for your device' - this app worked perfectly fine before update, why now is the app not optimised??",
        "This is A cute game to play doctor and all.  I just wish earning coins did not take so long, because to add on a clinic or expansion, it takes up all your money.  Also to purchase item for the hospital, the cost of each item goes up after you purchase one item. Like the waiting room chairs starts at 40 coins after a few chairs it is now at 70 coins per chair. Like how unfair is that?  Like is their a limit to how high each item gets?",
        "The problem is the friends system requires you connect via Facebook. For people that don't want to, or don't have Facebook, you're screwed. Please implement a way to add friends inside the game rather than through Facebook harassment.",
        "The game has the potential to be very entertaining however the constant crashes and app failure is very disheartening. Definite work needed to improve these issues, now its saying the app may not be optimized for the device. Why wouldn't it say that before downloading? Try again!",
        "Very laggy, took up alot of space on my phone. Wouldn't let me drag anything from one place to another. Very annoying. Don't reccomend"

        "Overall, the game is pretty cool. But, I feel much more can be added though. Great game. Just more needs to be added. It's a great app I wish the devs could make like, Sandbox modes where you can build your own... Em... Coasters? I dunno. You had to verify them first. Annnd in order to verify them you had to complete them yourself. Then you could publish them. And maybe a two player mode? Not sure how that's gonna work out. That's all that could be added. Most of all. 3 and a half out of 5 stars.",
        "The only way to play online is Facebook and Google play! First, you can make a 3rd option for an in-game name, like in Clash Of Clans,  and make the Google play account optional if you don't want to download Google play (not meaning that Google play is bad). Many people can not even think of any name that is not already taken in Google play (including me). It still is a good game,just it needs some more work.",
        "Don't get me wrong, it's amazing and seems to be fun, but there's one thing that ruins it all. Whenever I open the game, everything shifts to the right quite a bit, so I can't see about one fifth of the screen, which doesn't allow me to use the button control setup, and some other things. Would love to see this get fixed, as the game has some nice potential.",
        "As much as I want to love this game, its also quite cheap. Every single race, the same \"real\" players are always there regardless of time of day. They follow the same route and incredibly make no mistakes at all! Meanwhile, I'm getting stuck on every edge, my wheel gets stuck in the ground and every single gate smashes only me. Amazing!! Its a super fun game but don't think for a second that it plays fair.",
        "Love this game for the cool clip art graphics with all the chaos. Relly funny when they crash. Lol i just dont like the constant ads gou have to watcg when ever you have to open a prize chest and when you win. I mean you win and then you gotta watch a clip for 30 secs, then it feels like you lose. Lol",
        "Thankyou gor being creative i wish you add more challenge : crash crush. That is like just crush using vlad and rufus (example) and then crush make them crush so who is the winner. Using that game we can know who is the stronger"

        "I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance",
        "I LOVE THIS GAME This is good game design. It rewards you no matter how high you go with a beautiful little tower. The colors are really satisfying. It keeps me engaged since you can \"regrow\" your blocks. That creates tension too--something to strive for. It's so simple but soothing and really addictive!!",
        "A Great Game For When You're Dumpin'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I'm in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren't too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I'm happy to say that. I don't like to stay too long. Great game!",
        "So,  basically it's a pretty fun app to play when you're bored. It's a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It's a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don't really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!",
        "Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn't have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic.",
        "Good, with a major flaw I've ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I'll tap, and the game won't register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I'm on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I've closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It's an issue I'd like to see fixed."

Couple due to pieces not moving or stuck. Very happy to be able to skip levels.  Would have been great to have a certain bank of hints for some of the  difficult ones. I found the later levels easier than the ones around 100. Max levels 120. Great fun!",

Had to close out of the game every time so I just quit playing. Typo many similar more challenging games out there to try and work with this one.",

Level 89 doesn't work, as well as other levels where touching the same place over and over and over might get something to work.  Most puzzles are extremely easy,  it's just a matter of the game not working.",
        "I like the concept of the game in and of itself however the controls leave a bit to be desired. I will tap on an area a few times trying to locate an item to no avail then get frustrated, tap again and whatever object will move and item revealed. This gets old very quickly please fix it.",
        "Maybe it's just my phone, Galaxy S7, but even when i knew what to do i had to tap over and over again to get a response. Seriously, tap the object 10 times and nothing happens then tap it an eleventh time and it reacts. Very frustrating. Spent most of my time just repeatedly tapping the object. Game is a good concept, but really bad controls.",

I try to do research and the times counts down but it wont show as completed although it takes your rss away which is why i bought so many packs i wasted that money just last week!!! Haven't even had time to use the things i bought and now its all gone!!!! I loved the game but i will not continue to play or spend a dime on it until this issue is resolved if i get my money back i will think about not sueing them and play the game again which i dont mind spending money on because it is fun just needs improvement and Google play needs way better customer service!!!!"

        "I really enjoy playing this game. It helps me to relax while I am watching TV, or even using in split mode while watching a video or something. It's a bit different then the way I originally used to play Klondike, but still a great game and easy to get used to quickly! I don't mind the 5 second or so ads between games. It's the price you pay to get a good, free game. It's not like they play constantly and during a game there is usually an ad on the bottom screen but it will quickly move if you go to start a new game or need to access the other options.",
        "It's a fun relaxing game. Its so addictive that every device I have, must have this game. I have it on my phone, ipad and tablet. Except my laptop cuz then I would get no work done. About the ads, one pops out each time you finish a game, so I'm not to bothered by it. Also, theres no videos too watch in order to earn coins or diamonds because none are needed. I just love it. Its stress free.",
        "I would have scored higher except there is suddenly super annoying music being played that there is no option to turn off. The ads also now autoplay loud music. I agree with another poster who said it starting to seem like you lose more so you see more ads. I liked this because it was good for a quick game while getting ready to sleep. The music ruins this. I'm going to try another app now.",
        "I love the game solitaire played it on many different computers over the years. Downloaded three other version on my phone. All of which I deleted almost straight away because they were finicky and I didn't like the format. This one is easy to use and no glitches. So far so good.",
        "Addicting to play. The amount of ads is annoying and gets in the way of some of the controls sometimes, but otherwise it's a nice little game! I also like that it keeps track of stats and that you can deal just one card or 3 cards at a time!",
        "Terrible ads. So bad they hid the menu bar behind an ad banner so you click the ads just to access settings. Pretty sure they recently increased losing deal rate to make more ad videos play. So many other solitaire aps available so skip this one."

Sure you get daily rewards and everything, but that still doesn't compare to the lack of coins you get. For example I recently reached lvl 11, and when I go into lobbies with people with high tier amor and weapons. I find It hard to get kills now. I really hope you guys can fix this in the further future",

And could you make the fire button a little bigger because whenever I try to fire I always miss the trigger and then get killed😬 but I still like pixel gun better (sorry alot) but I think the game needs more improvement that's why I gave it a 3 star",

Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.",
        "This game is both funny as serious it's a great way to make kids understand the danger of some things around them. Like trains and wires and different things. As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.",
        "I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I'm playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can't complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍",
        "I love the game, it's so addictive! Some of the levels are confusing, but most are super simple and super fun! One thing that is a little bit of a downer is how every time you want to play a new round you have to watch a 30 second add , which gets old when you want to play a lot, but don't want to pay for add free. But I would highly recomend this to anyone",
        "This game is so good but please get rid of some adverts. Whenever I click on somthing it always comes up with a long advert. Also, can you add a toutorial at the start, showing how to do each thing.",
        "I think that there could be less ads. When I'm trying to replay he game an ad pops up which is really annoying. What I would say is that this is an excellent game but just less of the ads"

        "I really enjoy this game, but I have found a flaw in the design. The game speeds up as you go and after a point it doesn't go faster, but after around 10,000 you notice the ball start to move forward on the screen and after about 20,000 you don't even have to move the ball to not die. It just misses the spikes. I know you might be thinking Its not on the leaderboards, but that's my next complaint. Im currently 6 on the leaderboards, but I've gotten a better score and it won't update. I quite frankly destroyed that score and it doesn't show up. Thank you for your time and I hope this helped",
        "Game is great, far too many ads, after each level AND major issues with the videos giving rewards. I watched 4 and only received 1 reward which makes the game unfair and not worth playing.",
        "I HATE the vibration when u die I almost uninstalled the app bcuz of that. I also have a problem with pop up ads. I really like the game though",
        "Fun game, but occasionally an ad will pop up while I'm playing, causing me to mess up and die. I was having a really great run when an ad popped up. Not cool.",
        "Theres random ads in the middle of playing and you cant move for like 1 sec and you die to a spike.",
        "I think this game is very addictive. To all the people that say u have to many adds well i dont i can actually play the game without getting interrupted"

They both show completed and say that they've given me the reward.... but they haven't.   I disputed it.   Waiting two weeks on one of them and one week for the other.  This is racketeering.  I've been hoodwinked.. bamboozled!  I'll change my my review after they give me my CASH$$",

        "So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game",
        "A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job 'fun games for free' 👏👌🖒☺",
        "Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you're having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.",
        "I've been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn't force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game's development! :)",
        "Pretty cool app. I'd like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it's pretty cool so far.",
        "This is the most addictive flight simulator I have ever played. The game is fairly easy to progress through without having to spend any money. If I had to find one fault it would be that you can't reverse when on a runway which means some times you have no option but to crash your plane as there is very little room to turn around."

Only thing that frustrates me is the fact that you can only achieve a new high score if you play from the current level you are on and upwards. You should be able to go  back to a previously passed  level and have the ability to get a new high score that way. Other then that, great game!!",

        "Do not spend any money on this game. This used to be one of the best slot games until the developers got greedy. Payouts are small and events are nearly impossible. They try to make it all sound good but it's not. They also changed the customer service on here where it's hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!",
        "What the hell kind of question is that?  \"Is it beautiful\".... meaning the game! HOW NOT PERTAINING TO ANY GAMES!  Anyway,  this game is hands down the best Slot game EVER!  Have played slots in and out of casino's for over 20 years and this is the one to play! A huge variety of Casino games,  easy to maneuver and a lot of really nice people.",
        "I used to love this game but something they did changed it. Winning is nearly impossible even if you are a paying customer. I know it is a game of luck but when you purchase 85 silver tickets you should be able to complete puzzles when you only need 1 piece for each of them. Make winning a little easier and people will be happy to spend money.  I think the game is broken. I was just playing in a room on Billionaire with a person who was playing on Huge Casino. I know it's the same developer but I don't think that is supposed to happen. I know the person was playing Huge Casino because it was my husband playing it. May want to look into it.",
        "Customer relations are horrible even non existent. If you spend money you will lose far more than you win, in their eyes you will spend even more. If you send a message they will hide behind a canned \"industry standard\" response. This is not a free standing casino there are no freebies and you can't collect any winnings. Yet they have their games dialed in so you lose in hopes you will spend money. Horrible company.",
        "I just started this account in hopes of recovering my lost one. If it goes smoothly, I am happy with the app to date. The slots don't pay as much as they used to, a little tite , otherwise a fun app. The events they choose for you to play, daily, do steal a lot of chips. If u want to remain in a successful club, you must do them, is the main downfall. I would recommend it to my friends.",
        "This is an interesting game. After I played it for awhile it became very boring. Haven't gotten a big or any good win for the past 70 million. I guess if you buy chips you might win more often. It doesn't give you all the bonuses, and it takes gifts and doesn't give them to the gamers you gave it to. So all in all it's just okay. I've never been able to get anywhere with their support team as they added to my reply. I'd give it a one star but if you buy chips it might be better."

        "Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.",
        "Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you're given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.",
        "Must be the shortest time I have had a game installed. Pace of gameplay is SLOW and I hate the voice of the game. So annoying! If I could skip the animation before and after a level it would be much better.",
        "Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.",
        "Liked it but sometimes it just wouldn't give me the right bubbles to win at the end when I absolutely could've. If there's 4 bubbles left and none of them are yellow why do you give me a yellow one? I felt cheated",
        "The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item."

        "This is the best of its kind for mobile, and one of the best overall. The graphics and UI are nice and stylish, the controls are great, the gameplay is solid and it's generally just very fun to play. However, the game has some optimization issues. When you minimize it, it disconnects, and if you wait long enough it shuts down the entire game. I get that it was made like this to reduce background data, but come on, not everybody stays in the game all the time. It also takes longer than most games to connect. These are minor issues, but it would be great to see them fixed.",
        "This game works good but the reason I gave it 2 stars is whenever I click on ranked games it shows leaver penalty and the time to wait is shown 00:00:00:00. After waiting for so many days,it is always showing like this and not allowing me to play ranked games.Hope you would look into this.",
        "developer, i used to keep on playing cuz its very very fun but idk why recently when i click on connect via google play it shows connecting after that nth changes. i DONT want the ops acc i WANT my usual account back. the name of my usual account is   -FiReRY-  and the clan name is DeNY. pls pls pls pls pls help me get that account of mine back. i worked v hard for it n i have almost all the skins n i seriously like all of them v much. Many thanks.",
        "This is the best First Person Shooter available on Android. The only game that's not pay-to-win. Ok I give you that this game is great, but damned login issues are the reason for 3 stars. I just can't LOGIN with google play. It's like the game decides when I can login and play coz sometimes I am able to login. REST OF THE TIME IT SAYS PLAYING AS GUEST. FU!CKING FIX THIS LOGIN ISSUE!!!!",
        "Well they still have to grow but I think it's op. As I play a lot of CS:Go (not sponsoring)  then I thought this could help me because my PC stopped working.. Anyways graphics aren't great but good.. They aren't clean. Oh and last before I end this comment- when you complete offer for credits it doesn't give you the credits.. That's sad..  So yeah.. Just keep it up!! 👍👍"

        "As expected, it looks and performs amazing. Fighting mechanics and modes are pretty innovative and thrilling. It is quite stupid to compare the console version with mobile one. Each one has its own unique style, so they should NOT look the same, cz' each one provides the fans with a different gaming experience. This surely increases the already huge number of fans of Tekken. 5 🌟 game",
        "WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you",
        "Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It's pretty decent. I'm enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I've raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn't a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)",
        "First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I'll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC's (and MK's) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.",
        "As a long time Tekken fan I am happy that we have a version for mobile. I am also quite impressed with how smooth the gameplay is. The graphics are impressive for mobile. I'm underwhelmed by the controls though.  For me Tekken is all about the controls, and while I didn't expect a full controller interface. I feel like there could have been a better control layout available. Also the interface and game play menus feel quite busy, like there is too much going on. They could take a note from the wb fighters on mobile in this regard.",
        "As a lifelong Tekken fan this game is about as good as you could get for a mobile game. Sure there's microtransactions but they don't feel shoved down your throat and you'll get a decent amount of fun before they feel remotely neccesary. The gameplay is good, simpler but as concise and impactful as it always is. The only thing that I've found off putting so far is some of the writing is a bit... off. Just some out if character stuff but the story dialogue is mostly setup so it's not too bad.  Overall this is definitely worth a try if you want Tekken on the go."

        "Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!",
        "Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I've basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I've got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.",
        "A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it's a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you've done them and reached level 10 on both, there's really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.",
        "Be cool if there is boosts. Example if you get 3 perfect you get a free auto perfect boost or something. Also plz add a line of code to stop people from the date/time bug abuse - save current time to file. Player won't get money till that last input time has passed.  Also be cool to spend the coins on boosts",
        "Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot's more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn't bother me that much. 5 stars for the team",
        "It's a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the 'colony' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you"

So when the most recent (3) babies were available for purchase I bought them, but now those babies don't work!.... I'll give five stars when you get them to work. In the meantime, I think I should get a refund on my money.",

She is constantly bugging me to buy them again, but since I have already purchased them I do not think I should have to. Please may I have a full refund so I can purchase again or better yet fix the problem, then I can give 5*",

        "Definitely enjoyed the game. The only issues I found with it is the amount of time it takes to upgrade a new weapon slot. The Success and Failure prompts in general linger on the screen for so long you're forced to tap the upgrade button hundreds of times before your new weapon slot is caught up to your current weapon. The area to tap in the field to is a bit unclear as well.",
        "Ok graphics for an idle game imo. Not super responsive to touch on my Note 8, sometimes have to double or triple tap or try to scroll twice to get it to move. Wish there was more reason to mine, but the combat is pretty fun. Satisfying sound effects in combat.",
        "I really like the game. It's lots of fun when I need to pass the time. I do wish that you could pause things when you get stuff in the store and you want to use it but maybe you want to stop the auto button at some point and have more control of the weapons. It would be nice if you could disable the auto button. I prefer having more control of the weapons unless I'm away from my phone but I haven't seen a way to pause it. Thank you very much! I love the game and will definitely keep playing.",
        "I THOUGHT this was an idle game. But no, you ACTUALLY have to actively be playing the game to make any progress. It really is a novelty idea if it was an idle game. Like keeps making money while you're away. Again you actually have to be active to sit through very, VERY long battles to make money. Make this an idle game and it would be more worth it. Until then, I for one am uninstalling.",
        "Fun game. Only thing that needs to be fixed is the enhancement aspect. It is inconsistent, as I've failed to enhance weapons despite having a 70-80% probability of success.",

        "The game is amazing, addicting and a lot of fun just to collect and level up dragons. The events that are constantly coming on always make you feel like you have something to do. However when of the events are very unbalanced and, if you are against one of these people, not very fun. The heroic races are a great way to compete with other players to add a powerful dragon to your collection but some people take the fun out of it by spending 100's of gems to ensure that they come first. The ability to use gems during these races should be removed as it is highly unbalanced, or at least add another way of collecting the heroic dragons without having to compete with people who pay to win.",
        "I love this game. Its very addicting and fun, but I find that there are barely any female dragons. This upsets me very much and I would like for this to change. The only females I see are the dragons with names like  motherly dragon, belle dragon, viktoria dragons, and sleeping beauty dragons. There are also descriptions like \"add some girly pink to your collections with the gummy dragon\"(which is also coincidently a girl). Then I see cool legendary dragons, but OH plot twist they're all boys. This is a very fun game no doubt on that, but please, stop with the sexism and make cool female dragons. Thank you.",
        "Still Having Lot's of Fun! Cool to mix different dragons just to see what u get!  I just opened my 6th island, When I first started playing this game I think there were only 3 or 4 islands & maybe about 300 to 400 dragons. I'm having trouble keeping them long enough to get the next island!😉😄😁!!",
        "Game would be great except for the fact that you can't do certain things without bugging people on Facebook for help. I just want to play the game. I can't level my dragons past 10 without building a special building which you build without gems or bugging people. No way to get gems other than extremely slowly by completing achievements which take days to complete and give 1-3 gems. Supposedly you can watch videos for gems but there is absolutely no place on the game that allows this. If your friends on Facebook don't play this game they can't help you and you are screwed if you truly want to enjoy the game. You can't win battles with level 10 dragons. You can't breed more than one dragon at a time without gems. You can't expand past 2 islands without gems. If you get the required gems to level your dragons past 10, then there is another super expensive building to level them past 15, and get, guess what, you need gems for that too. Other games allow in game friends which this one doesn't and that is frankly ridiculous as it's a \"social\" game. Other games allow other ways to obtain gems like watching videos or trying other games which this one doesn't. There isn't enough time to complete special events for special limited dragons unless you can get gems. Overall, the game would be fantastic if gems were easier to come by and you could make in game friends instead of having to rely on Facebook friends!",
        "Just a few gripes. 1st of all I LOVE DRAGON CITY. Been playing for years. About your survey, I would never. You ask for too many permissions. Tree of life....when I get a Dragon here comes the same Dragon adding up for hatching. Like why? 815+ dragons are more than enough. Why do u keep adding, adding, adding. We could NEVER get all of them as it is. Why more? Love me some Dragon City like a said in the beginning.",
        "THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! I totally recommend it to EVERYONE who loves addictive games and dragons. I find myself constantly playing this game all the time! I honestly feel like I can't say how much I LOVE this game with words. Again, this is the best game a player can have. Just one thing, I wish there were more ways to get gems instead of just buying 'cause I can't buy anything. So please make gems more easier to get. Also please make the islands worth less gems.😊"

I've purchased all unlocks and until now extras, even enjoy the pc version but now even after I've handed out funds they want more money to enjoy features.

        "Can't seem to open the game... It hangs at the loading screen with \"downloading please wait\" the downloading lettering blinks and the game never opens... Previous version was fine with my device.. Plz fix soon... Otherwise i love this game",

        "Its nice but theres one problem for me.When i logout and login again the game loading glitches and it wont let me play.Pls cix this glitch but anyway thankyou and its still really fun to play",
        "This game is for people who love to be stuck in time, since this game came out there hasn't been any proper updates except from adding new unnecessary stuffs to the game so kids can waste their money on, the time limit in the game is 4mins for either team battle or free for all; this has been the way thia game has been for years since i started play the game anything new in the game is all about spending more money, what tyoe of developers are you guys? Do you even play the game? It gets more boring every second, the are no proper changes no organization of your weapon and other stuffs in the game... It takes like 2+ minutes to change to another outfit because the list is too long, YOU DEVELOPERS NEED TO FOCUS ON THE GAMEPLAY AND NOT NEW ITEMS... Add in squad battles so it can be more competitive and allow people to be able to see their stats and then players will care more just look at what other games are doing in 2018 and don't get stuck in time...GOODLUCK"

        "ADS with every click, annoying as hell. You can't even decide whether you'll watch ads and you don't get any rewards for doing so. Don't install it, it's a waste of time. you see more ads than game. It's a fun game, but there are thousands like it with less or no ads at all.",
        "Love the concept.. but its way to buggy with way to many ads  . It really spoils the game.. good or now will see.. but it concerns me with so many adds with every move.. is it letting spammers in",

        "this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It's a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that's it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame",
        "Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn't came in two years it probably isn't. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don't pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges.",
        "Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.",
        "This game is very nicely done. Its a genius concept except the fact that u catch zombies to make it into something is really gross. I would preffer if you could lower the pri e of the drone a bit so that there would be more play time rather than waiting play. Overall this game is superb",
        "I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.",
        "Great game, addictive, in a good way. This is one of the few games that is addictive, but does not take up a large amount of your day, unlike some game (Clash Royale), I feel it's not Pay to Win. Great job guys, thanks for making an entertaining, relaxing, non time consuming, free to play and win game. Graphics can be bested."

And it stucks there forever until i close the game and then restart it again it again show the first match and again i won but still it stuck. Please do something for it.",
        "Awesome. But I'm here to share the review about what's not working after this update. Bugs are inevitable so i hope this is resolved soon. After the first battle in chapter 4, the screen freezes. I win the battle but everytime the app hangs and i have to repeat the battle.",
        "One of the worst controls and gameplay in these type of games. Graphics are good but game is full of bugs. Shadow attacks dont work properly. Duel system is cancer. Game randomly matches you the opponent that has 1.5 times stronger armor than you. I think developers havent heard something like \"justice\".",
        "Love the game, but a bit of a problem with the new update. It seems to freeze up after any mission I complete, side quests included. Please fix this bug.",
        "Bug after the update today it is not working for me. The game doesn't connect to start duel and doesn't let me open chest. It says no connected to the server. After playing side quests it hangs after I win. I don't want to uninstall the game."

        "It's a great game, hilarious concept, only thing I have issues with is that the noises for picking up the coins pick up as sound. Frustrating when you are trying to be careful and it dings and sends the chicken into a mine... Maybe make them doubtless so they don't get picked up by mic.",
        "Dont know where my last review went so im writing another...  This game is the worst game for ads i couldn't even play the game because the ads were constantly spamming me.  So ive had to uninstall. I'll never know if this game was good or not because i never got to play due to ads!  People are saying  'pay to remove ads if you dont like it '   well we should have to pay to remove ads on a free game.. whats the point in saying its free when really it isn't because you have to pay to remove ads in order to play the game!!!",
        "Good game but enough with the ads. Way too many and way too long. The ads are longer than the game play. Ine ad was over 30 seconds long. You guys obviously do not read these comments or reply to any of them. This could be a great game.",
        "The ads are excessive. There is an ad at the bottom of the screen at all times, and after every single attempt at a level, I was getting an unskippable 30 second ad. Some I had to participate in to close out of. Not cool. Not worth it. Game concept is funny, though. I just know I wouldn't play it enough to bother paying for ad free.",
        "Love the concept, but it doesn't work at ALL. I downloaded it, and no matter what I do, nor how absolutely silent it is, the chicken is running and jumping and I have zero control over it. Super disappointed--hopefully it's just glitching?? I wanted to try it, but neither sound nor silence give me any control over it 😣"

        "Great puzzle game and great way to teach kids basic logic. I disagree with the review saying you're wrong about the loops/recursion; I would say they are loops as recursion would imply a return value/end condition.",
        "Enjoyed the game and the problem solving aspect of it, but I wish there were more levels. I don't really feel like this brought me any closer to knowing how to code, which is a pity because the game itself was a lot of fun.",

        "Great tool for learning logic concepts! I look through games/apps like this occasionally, but only to help advise people on what will help get them started. I code for a living, primarily focusing on python, java, c++, and bash. I highly recommend starting here. Beyond the suggested sites, I would recommend Codecademy and/or Sololearn for learning to code outside a classroom.",
        "I personally like the game. All levels are possible which some people say otherwise. I wish there were many more levels as I did them all within an hour... Or maybe that's the point? Anyway, it doesn't teach you code in the slightest but it does teach you the concept of functions and loops. Mind you, the loops in the game are all infinite. You wouldn't want to do infinite loops in the real world."

Game constantly crashes, cannot play for longer than a few minutes before it crashes, can't go into any other hospitals because it crashes, can't watch videos because it crashes.....*STILL crashing, even after new update. I'm now getting a message on update screen 'this app may not be optimised for your device' - this app worked perfectly fine before update, why now is the app not optimised??",
        "This is A cute game to play doctor and all.  I just wish earning coins did not take so long, because to add on a clinic or expansion, it takes up all your money.  Also to purchase item for the hospital, the cost of each item goes up after you purchase one item. Like the waiting room chairs starts at 40 coins after a few chairs it is now at 70 coins per chair. Like how unfair is that?  Like is their a limit to how high each item gets?",

        "Very laggy, took up alot of space on my phone. Wouldn't let me drag anything from one place to another. Very annoying. Don't reccomend"

        "Love it to pieces. The characters are loveable and the stories are fun. I got through three to four in a few days I can't put it down. The only downside is certain decisions cost gems. Major ones are fine and expected but to have to be a jerk to someone because you don't have enough kind of sucks a little. But it's not often and by no means a deal breaker.",
        "Actually, I came here because I'm a fan of Jakayla Toney. I'm a reader from wattpad, and I'm checking out her story here as game. 😂 Anyways, I finished one chapter and I'm enjoying so far. Gotta check out other book after I'm done. Looking forward to this app, though I don't really like the choices costing gems.But its okay, still like it. 😊",
        "Every GOOD choice involved money.  Hard to find one interactive story game that doesn't involve money so much.  I don't mind paying for extra bonus scenes in the end but at least give us some GOOD selection WITHOUT charging!  Then maybe I'll rate it higher",
        "I'm frustrated by the fact that this is supposed to be a choose your own adventure game, but all the choices that make the most sense to me are stuck behind a paywall, requiring me to purchase those choices with a currency called diamonds. I get the story passes, and I would have been fine if that was the only barrier to read the story, but to require you to pay money for making what you feel are the right choices is just greedy.",
        "The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the chapters update too late that you lose interest and sometimes forget what's happening in the story. If the chapters were to update on a regular basis then readers would feel the need to keep this app and will constantly play instead of playing the waiting game. However the content is good and most storylines get you hooked.",
        "I literally have nothing bad to say about this game. It's one of the best story/choices/chapter games out, in my opinion. I'm ready for sequels and the remaining chapters of Bad Boy Blues. Other than that, keep up the good work."

        "Educational and fun. Some of the gameplay has a bit to be desired. For example, in bonus area flags disappear as soon as they tell you what they are, so you cannot take time to learn them. Graphics are decent but style is a little dated and too ornate. That said, I still like to play it,  I'm learning from it and I appreciate all the effort that went into creating it!  So it gets a 5 from me.",
        "The graphics aren't the best and the set up isn't totally comprehensive. Some maps are so zoomed in that it's hard to recognize the general location unless you're already really familiar with geography. It could be more interesting, but the questions are good and it has helped me learn some.",
        "I'm extremely impressed by your app. It is not only fun, but it is the best educational app that has taught me so much! The border outline is the only thing that needs better graphics...otherwise I couldn't be happier!!! (An offline mode would make this app perfect) . Thank you!🙋💯💡👍❗🌠🏆💝☺",
        "Excellent game. Learnt lots. Ads frustrating but can be paid for. More frustrating is when you get to higher levels and constantly run out of lives. Find myself having to hang on 3-4 days between games waiting to accumulate lives to allow me to proceed further. That's why I have not given it a 5/5",
        "Was a great game, I learned a ton of geography. But now the ads are seriously out of control. Top players are really the ones who watch the most ads. Also, it would be nice if the encyclopedia allowed you to compare countries for a given category instead of only being able to view a single country.",
        "Excellent and really informative game. As someone who loves geography I learned a lot of new things. However I have just one problem to adress. Religion info on Bosnia and Herzegovina is incorrect and not updated, I've sent several reports but it is not fixed yet."

        "New Review because of update: ° I really love this game. I'm hooked. Relaxing yet stimulating. Some levels are easy as cutting through soft butter with lots of delightful bombs and others take several tries to master and need that one devise a strategy and some others are much up to luck. I love that variation: relaxing and stimulating and sometimes a bit frustrating. ° I had finished all the levels of version 2 and then waited for an update which came with new levels and I finished them also about 4 weeks ago. I've opened the game every day since to see if yet an other update came, and yes, yesterday it did and have already finished all levels (that says more about my fanaticism than it says about the difficulty of the game). ° I appreciate the tournament (I topped the monthly yesterday but had dropped 3 steps while I was sleeping and have clawed my way back to the top this evening, but I guess I'll be back down tomorrow. But it's fun! And I got generous daily prizes. ° And I love the new version that even though I again have finished all levels, I can just go on playing thanks to the Level Tower (even if it at 46 repeated a previous level). ° Lovely graphics, good game sound.",
        "Annoying and boring. Got headaches playing this. You can spend 5 sets of 5 lives each without passing the task. It's rather a \"Push to pay or wait forever\" game. Uninstalled. Sorry.",

        "I loved it so much😍😍",
        "Can anyone tell me what SNS is?",
        "Well this is a surprise. It does not have much story yet but a good read if you've every played pixel berry's \"choices\" game. Same concept which means choices are going to need diamonds. Meaning you need to pay to do them. I really find it a nice read but since the books are few i'm on hold on purchasing diamonds. I guess once a series is completed i'm willing to buy diamonds to replay that game. For now i'm just browsing the game and taking notes on how many diamonds are going to cost per book.",
        "This game is amazing! The graphic is pretty great, plus the story is super ADDICTIVE. I can't stop reading this story but because of I have no pass left. However the problem is the pass, the pass is too little and the time is pretty long to wait. I hope this app would give much pass and please make the time shorter. But still this game is awesome, I recommend this game for you. You should download this app and try it."

        "The game is good, but there's one hilariously bad oversight that cost it a star. The leaderboards are useless because you can pause the game and still get on the leaderboard. And clearly people are pausing the game, solving it by hand or on a computer and then quickly entering all the numbers in just to get on the leaderboard. There are so many Hard silver times of under 30 seconds that is makes it pointless to HAVE a leaderboard. It's pathetic for people to do this just to feel like a winner for one be in their lives, to be sure, but the developers should have prevented. Most Sudoku games or similar-type games disqualify you for leaderboards if you pause.",
        "I would enjoy the game more if the possible (tiny) numbers erased as other boxes were filled in, so I know that number is no longer a possible number for that box. If that makes any sense? Love the night mode.",
        "The ads suddenly playing is a real drawback. I just want them automatically muted so the don't interrupt my flow. Ads are not the problem. The noise is",
        "I would like this game if the ads didnt come with sound, but im usually playing where i need silence.  Since i cant play often, the controls are awkward because im not used to them.  Very different from other sudokus.",
        "Not a fan of the penalties for using features and also missing a \"best time\".  Otherwise it's not bad",

This actually isn't valid as I just looked at each option to buy and none give the option of no ads. Plus I've made purchases and still nothing. I just updated the app and received the option of no ads. I clicked it and paid to no avail. Email has already been sent about it.",

The only thing ive noticed is the levels seem to have stopped introducing challenges and are sometimes just not possible to beat without serious coin. But that doesn't mean I plan to stop anytime soon hahaha.",
        "I really love this game. I downloaded it for mindless stress relief in between classes and it has not disappointed. Some of the levels are really tricky, I think in an attempt to get you to buy more balls. But that's not too much of a complaint. I bought the full version and it's worth it to be add free.",

        "This was fun... Until level 100 when they take away the ability to switch colors of the ball you're shooting. It makes it too difficult. I'm missing clearing it by one ball each time so then I'm watching ad after ad to avoid restarting the level. It's really disappointing how much that one thing has made me abandon the game and uninstall.",
        "While its addicting its quite easy. I've gotten 3 stars on every level and I've played over 200 levels already. Ive only had to replay a level that failed 3 or 4 times."

Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.",

It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can't just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...",

Contact me as soon as possible.",

I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don't read it before. I can't find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....",

        "I have only had the game a few hours and I am already falling in love with it. It is great to go on when you have a spare 10-15 minutes. The grid is larger than others so I can read the words fluently and quickly without them being hard to see. You get points after each time you complete the grid so if you are really stuck you can receive a hint for some points. I would highly recommend this excellent game.",
        "Only been playing for a few days now, and so far, I love it! Forgot how fun Word Search puzzles can be, and to have it on my phone is priceless lol.. No complaints with the app so far. I will say though, maybe they should tweak it just a tad, instead of giving a hint only after a short moment, possibly creating 'the option' to have a hint may be a little better. Not a big deal to me. It truly is a great app, love the simplicity of the graphic design too. Glad I came across this game.",
        "I enjoy ALMOST the whole game, being a word find and all, simple, yet deceptively hard at times. Still, I wish there was a way to turn off the 'hints' it gives, as they get annoying... unless there IS a way that I haven't discovered yet...otherwise, I REALLY like the game, and would suggest it to all ages, as it's not too tough for the young ones, but still challenging enough for experienced players.",
        "Pretty good word search game. It's sometimes hard to hit the right letters, especially toward the bottom of the screen. Occasionally words share more than one letter in common. Sometimes  (especially in the  lower levels) a word will show up more than  once in a puzzle. Maybe extra credit for finding a word that's not on the list?",
        "It's a good game but there needs to be a way to turn off hints. If you don't find a word in the time it thinks you should, it keeps giving hints which ruins the gameplay. I pause for various reasons like talking to someone, cat catching a mouse, watching tv at the time, etc.. Or sometimes it might take longer to fins a word than seconds allowed before the hint.",
        "I love this game. Really nice and well thought out game. It's educative too. But I have just one issue with it though: The flashing hint. This gets me distracted each time it flashes. Maybe there could be a hint button at the bottom of the puzzle. That way instead of it flashing and getting us distracted, we could just click on it whenever we need help. Apart from that, it's just perfect. Will give it a 5 when the flashing hint is worked on😁"

        "The game is amazing, addicting and a lot of fun just to collect and level up dragons. The events that are constantly coming on always make you feel like you have something to do. However when of the events are very unbalanced and, if you are against one of these people, not very fun. The heroic races are a great way to compete with other players to add a powerful dragon to your collection but some people take the fun out of it by spending 100's of gems to ensure that they come first. The ability to use gems during these races should be removed as it is highly unbalanced, or at least add another way of collecting the heroic dragons without having to compete with people who pay to win.",
        "I love this game. Its very addicting and fun, but I find that there are barely any female dragons. This upsets me very much and I would like for this to change. The only females I see are the dragons with names like  motherly dragon, belle dragon, viktoria dragons, and sleeping beauty dragons. There are also descriptions like \"add some girly pink to your collections with the gummy dragon\"(which is also coincidently a girl). Then I see cool legendary dragons, but OH plot twist they're all boys. This is a very fun game no doubt on that, but please, stop with the sexism and make cool female dragons. Thank you.",
        "Still Having Lot's of Fun! Cool to mix different dragons just to see what u get!  I just opened my 6th island, When I first started playing this game I think there were only 3 or 4 islands & maybe about 300 to 400 dragons. I'm having trouble keeping them long enough to get the next island!😉😄😁!!",
        "Game would be great except for the fact that you can't do certain things without bugging people on Facebook for help. I just want to play the game. I can't level my dragons past 10 without building a special building which you build without gems or bugging people. No way to get gems other than extremely slowly by completing achievements which take days to complete and give 1-3 gems. Supposedly you can watch videos for gems but there is absolutely no place on the game that allows this. If your friends on Facebook don't play this game they can't help you and you are screwed if you truly want to enjoy the game. You can't win battles with level 10 dragons. You can't breed more than one dragon at a time without gems. You can't expand past 2 islands without gems. If you get the required gems to level your dragons past 10, then there is another super expensive building to level them past 15, and get, guess what, you need gems for that too. Other games allow in game friends which this one doesn't and that is frankly ridiculous as it's a \"social\" game. Other games allow other ways to obtain gems like watching videos or trying other games which this one doesn't. There isn't enough time to complete special events for special limited dragons unless you can get gems. Overall, the game would be fantastic if gems were easier to come by and you could make in game friends instead of having to rely on Facebook friends!",
        "Just a few gripes. 1st of all I LOVE DRAGON CITY. Been playing for years. About your survey, I would never. You ask for too many permissions. Tree of life....when I get a Dragon here comes the same Dragon adding up for hatching. Like why? 815+ dragons are more than enough. Why do u keep adding, adding, adding. We could NEVER get all of them as it is. Why more? Love me some Dragon City like a said in the beginning.",
        "THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! I totally recommend it to EVERYONE who loves addictive games and dragons. I find myself constantly playing this game all the time! I honestly feel like I can't say how much I LOVE this game with words. Again, this is the best game a player can have. Just one thing, I wish there were more ways to get gems instead of just buying 'cause I can't buy anything. So please make gems more easier to get. Also please make the islands worth less gems.😊"

        "Lost another These constant updates caused me to uninstall this. Fun game - very good game!But if it ain't broke don't fix it. I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.",
        "I am not able to play with my friends in custom mode. We are a group of 11 & we want to play together in custom mode by creating our own room. But My 4 friends have IOS devices & their Servers are showing different than us. I don't know why? We can't even connect by number also. Tried doing that!. Please let me know its fixture",
        "It's a fun game. If you're a COD player you'll love it. In general It does good on it's own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It's good that there's a grind to get them but I think it's a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.",
        "I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to \"rent\" which is an option in the game.",
        "this game is great, but i rated 3 star cuz i wanted this gaem to be like COD: WWII, and like ravenfield. There are NO MG nests, no war modes like COD:WWII, and please, fix the prices! It took me 3 years of full gameplay, 5 hours just to get a shotgun. And please optimize the guns. Overall, really great game!                                  By a youtuber                            Zombiehunter78oo  P.S. Please add more guns and some more features.",

Play something else and yea a FREAKING TANK IN A MAP THIS SMALL. like were you under the influence of some substances when you made this game. Wast of time. Dont download this abomination."

        "This game is a lot of fun get to customize some great cars . A lot of my favorites and i was surprised to see some cool muscle cars . Very unique collection of cars. This is actually better than their console games. Well recent carbon and most wanted are amazing. The newest are hot garbage. This one is fun.reallywish there was free roam or a sand box room where you can admire and test drive  what you have grinded out so many hours to get. Only bad thing. Also the boxes are too expensive leaving having to grind way too much just for absolutely anything. By the time you get anything good this game servers will be empty.",
        "Thank you for making this awesome game, I love it! I've not had this much fun playing a Need For Speed game in years.. Update 2.9.1 is fantastic. Although after updating, I'm having trouble connecting to the game servers... :/ Hope it gets sorted soon! nevertheless, I look forward to future updates. ;)",
        "It's a great game, graphics are ok, smooth playing. But. There are some ideeas that may do something different. Think about a chat room, or a place where players can do some trades. Think about adding the possibility for players to get vip points for watching videos, or maybe one day..open world gameplay. And there could be a lot more features. Thumbs up if you agree.",
        "The gameplay/races r so short. It takes less than a minute to finish it. And the police cars than u see in the gameplay don't even do anything they just keep going on on there own, sometimes getting to finish line before u. So basically this would be a perfect game for a three year old but incredibly boring for anyone over the age of 7",
        "I just bought a golden crate for 100 golds, only to get a muscle ECU uncommon part. Disappointing,  no blue prints. Even in a free crate you get blue prints.  Frustrating the reward system is horrible. Am never going to buy any golden crate. Players should be given choices to buy golden crate but you get trusted upon with useless worthless part. Otherwise good game",
        "Great game, accidentally spent 100 gold buying a crate I didn't mean to because they swapped them around in the recent update. Wish they didn't do that, but i guess I should've been paying attention. All in all love this game as far as an arcade racing goes."

        "Was more enjoyable to play before the update. Before I could move items I bought now everything I buy ends up in upper left corner. Cannot really even see each item. I basically watch each time a purchase is made to see the stars before moving on.  Also agree the game was easier but now is much harder and takes longer to open treasure chest.",
        "Can't create your own tanks,  things just get placed there and you can't move them. The game itself is okay,  but if you take more than two seconds to find a move you want to do,  it starts flashing a move hint,  and not the best move either.  Nothing different to make this game stand out from most match three games.",
        "Only played until level 8. It's an okay game but you can't really decorate your reef. You buy items and they plop down but you can't move them, so they stay where they fell. Not impressed. Used to play Fishdom and it was SO much better. The graphics were better and you could really decorate your tanks by moving items to where you wanted them not where they plopped down. You could also rename your fish. This game is like expecting Oreos and getting generic, chocolate sandwich cookies. Just a cheap imitation. Uninstalling",
        "I would give it a 5 IF it had some instructions.  How do you choose a picture for the character frame?  I choose a house for my tank and it didn't show up.  I checked out all of the icons and couldn't find any help.  I really don't want to delete game but I would like some help, and I see that other players would too.  Thanks.",
        "Only wasted my time for a few levels then got rid of this pretty quick! Why waste your time completing levels, earning coins to buy stuff to decorate  when whatever you buy just gets a ll plopped down in one spot and cannot be moved. That's NOT decorating!!!! Fix that and I may be back.",
        "The game is listed as Everyone, but it is likely up to age 10. Helping fish friends? No, even less than 10. Dont understand why the game occupies 123 Mb of space, that is over the average."

        "I love to play hold em, but it's just to hard to round up the posse for poker night due to simply getting older. Life takes everyone n different directions. Not too mention, having kids and getting married, doing the family thing. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love living the family life with my wife and kids but I will always miss poker night with the fellas. Now that I have stumbled upon WSOP I have been able to invite all of the fellas to join and we can all play together still once again. THANK U!!!!",
        "Seen to many players leave because of this. Players with over a billion in chips. Goes to a small table with players having 30k or 40k. Goes all in every hand and kills the table. Players ask him why he does it and not play bigger tables. His answer because game allows me to and I can knock out player after player. Regulate players if they have X amount of chips play on bigger tables. Let the smaller players gain chips and enjoy the game.",
        "It appears that I have reached a certain point where my free play is being met with bot resistance. I've gained over ten million in one day and lost it all and more in suck outs. This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you'd have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun",
        "Win a bit and loose everything in a few hands...  Once you win a good hand, leave the table.  Dealer will not give a a chance.  After this review, I received an e-mail from the designer assuring me, that game is fair.  I have been losing several hands with pocket KK, QQ, JJ, and so for.  So I stand with my original review.   Win on a good hand and leave game.  Or else you will lose it ALL!",
        "This is a good game , only prob I have is there seems to some hackers/botting which makes it a little hard to play. Now as far as some people's comments even if the  people with a billion chips come to smaller tables , if you all knew how to play you wouldn't have to worry about them taking your chips. Trust me the majority of them started out at low tables also having to have to fight the ones with more money. I have been playing this game for a few years and love it.  Like I said only problem I have is to many bots/hackers.",
        "I really enjoy this game .At first I just added it for one of the games on app like to gain points for gift cards.And of course to learn how to play poker. Now if their no points given for this game I would still play it. I totally enjoy this game , and the people that play it. Its truly an enjoyable game. This game is a keeper know matter what.tthe only thing I wish is that their was more coins given ."

Installera bara detta om du kan tänka dig slänga bort 300 kr på ganska tråkigt innehåll.",

        "Krösus Sorks spel om och med Bamse Fint koncept av Egmont förlag, tyvärr faller det hela platt då åldersgruppen som spelet främst riktar sig till inte riktigt förstår nyanserna med denna typ av kritik. Kul idé iaf, och spännande att se hur Egmont förlag vågar sätta sig själva i rollen som Krösus.",

        "Everything about this game is great, but this company/developer really differentiate themselves from the competition with their customer service and support. Any issues I've ever had with adcap or any kongregate apps were handled extremely quick with the most professions experience.   Try the game, it's addicting, challenging, and very fun. It is a freemium game but don't forget to support the devs but purchasing a gift pack or even just downloading a game you like for $1.  Thank you for the hard work guys/gals",
        "About a few years ago, I had this installed on a Droid phone. I never was able to open the app to play. Recently, I glanced through the apps I had & remembered this one. After thinking it over, I decided to get it. Now, I am happy the developers decided to upgrade the game. This is fun. I am contemplating letting the 💰 accumulate for one full day just to see how much I earn. Thank you developers for providing a fun little time waster. I recommend this if you are the type of person who 💘 s making fake money. Try it out & hopefully you enjoy it.",
        "Yes this is addictive, yes it's fun, and it's great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don't have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it's not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it's clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.",
        "Was having fun until the game decided to take about 30 of these megabucks from me for no apparent reason. Took me a while to get them considering how far I am. Not sure if I want to play anymore knowing this could happen again. Other than that it's pretty good.",
        "Way way WAYYY too laggy. It's an easy casual game though. I wouldn't say it's \"fun\" but it does pass the time and make you want to achieve the little goals. Only goal, make more money in game. That's it and you achieve that by not even playing the game so there's no challenge whatsoever. Uninstalled after first day reaching about 500 Trillion and force closing 100 times.",
        "It clicks on adds with out me hitting it at all. Then when I get back to the app it forgets that I watched the add at all even tho I watched all the way through. It happens repeatedly. It only forgets half the time but it almost always clicks on the adds. Other than that it's a good time killer with easy ways to get through it quickly as long as you watch some adds."

        "So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game",
        "A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job 'fun games for free' 👏👌🖒☺",
        "Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you're having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.",
        "I've been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn't force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game's development! :)",
        "Pretty cool app. I'd like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it's pretty cool so far.",
        "This is the most addictive flight simulator I have ever played. The game is fairly easy to progress through without having to spend any money. If I had to find one fault it would be that you can't reverse when on a runway which means some times you have no option but to crash your plane as there is very little room to turn around."

And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.",
        "Good, but has some bugs I'm sorry if I'm being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall",
        "It's good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn't too much skill involved but it's a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I've lost countless games because it doesn't stop or doesn't back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!",
        "Awesome It's a very good game, great graphics even for a bunch of cubes, but I also have an idea. You guys should make a game called smashy water, where we can choose from a wide variety of different boats that run away from boat police. Hopefully I helped you with my idea and I will download if made;-). You can work on the title if needed. Please reply:-)",
        "Excellent could use weapon pickup like smoke machine gun or oil slick.... A health bar which is unique to each vehicle depending on if it is made for speed or for just ramming stuff and an add health pickup... a bouncing red or blue stack of cash equal to a hundred dollars once action picks up and a 1000 dollar pickup after a ten minute counter for those who have gotten very good and lastly an arrest count down when stopped.... Sometimes you get only a breif second to get away other times you get like ten seconds???",
        "Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it's a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can't go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I'm out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!"

        "Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it's just my phone. Also I'm not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)",
        "I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the \"mine\" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it's nicely done!",
        "I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.",
        "Overall the app is really great. It's the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you're not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.",
        "Input delays keep getting me killed. Instead of marking a bomb my input sets it off. I'd prefer two different inputs for marking or removing tiles.  I'm using a stylus too so I know it's not an issue of accidentally hitting the wrong tile.",
        "Great game. Love it! Sometimes the flag wouldn't place when you pressed a square, and once it selected a square instead of placing a flag, but I still really liked it. Wish there was a zoom because the mini square field is a ton of fun, but a bit small for my fingers. I still love the game though!"

        "This game used to be fun, but now there's hardly anyone on it so you can never keep a volley going for long. Furthermore, it seems the only people who play anymore are the weirdos who just write the word instead of draw so you can guess, which makes the whole game pointless. Like, the heck, dude? They want all the points and none of the fun. Ruins the entire app because that's all you ever get anymore.",
        "It is interesting and addictive game to play with friends. I would have given 5 for everything but for some bugs. One is it takes along time to load. Two there is a bug where even if the game loads we cannot see the drawing. Please fix them",
        "Too many ads! I liked this game years ago, forgot about it and recently downloaded again. I would of hoped that things would of improved but no. The annoying \"do you need a bomb\" keeps popping up non stop. Wish they would of added more brushes by now since it's a drawing app, it just makes drawing much harder since I use it on my mobile phone. A paint bucket would also be nice instead of coloring the whole page.",
        "Redownloaded this game after not playing for a while and it's pretty similar to before, but the amount of push notifications is making me uninstall again. I have notifications turned off in the app, yet I still get a push notification what seems like every hour. It's so unnecessary. So I am happily deleting this app again.",
        "Needs a much better chat function. Can only communicate once per round!   Some of the words are ridiculously bizarre!  A lot of the words are repeated over and over again.    Oh yeah, STOP asking me if I want a free bomb! If I want them It's already very obvious where to get them!",
        "The game it's self isn't bad, it's the notifications that's annoying. Even if you turn notifications off you get them 4 or 5 times a day. It's pretty annoying."

        "So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn't find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren't extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don't know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I'm not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.",
        "I loved the original. I've gotta say though, the part with the wizard dying and the endless mode game over scene is kinda sad. Also i found a glitch, if you go to tournament mode and select an icon you haven't unlocked yet and then go to the main menu. You can go back into tournament mode and you'll have the icon even though you didn't unlock it.",
        "Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it's not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I've survived 24 nights but I don't even have the achievements for\"survive 5 nights\". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don't because some of the zombie achievements I'm not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I'm currently at 59. GG!",
        "Addicting game. At start It's easy but It becomes Quick impossible, unless indeed you buy some gems. So It gave me some frustrations but too quickly. Sorry for my notation, Because really It's good work dudes!",
        "Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh",
        "Brilliant game kept me occupied for hours I loved it! I think what seperates this from the test of the stick man games is that you are able to control one of the warriors or miners and you can move them around or fight when them. Absolutely love it! Wish it was longer as I completed canoeing on hard in 67 minutes, please make more and more upgrades and skill points!! Fantastic game!"

        "The game controls are very annoying. The character won't go where you want him to. During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don't want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn't want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.",
        "Maybe the reason people think its boring. It's probably because they are boring and lame. I beat the first level without a problem, they didn't because they feel like everything should be easy and they shouldn't have to work hard for anything. The game is challenging and fun if you like a challenge. If your a lame, whinny, expect nothing to be hard, and can't handle a challenge as tough as making toast, then this game isn't for you.",
        "These other reviewers are jerks! Lol. The game is awesome! And my 4 year old can even play it well!  I like it so much, I'm downloading it onto my phone (4 yr old plays it on my old phone)  just to see how far I can get lol",
        "NC and you know what you doing today beautiful lady and her husband to be with u but I can't wait till I see you in the car and my mom said she will be here for me to go to the store and get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get the money for the first time I was just wondering if you want to be a good day at work and I don't know what I",
        "This game is stupid because you have to get a part of the key just to get more lives and the bad guys are technically cheating because they have guns I made it to the last level and it was impossible to beat the boss because he puts fire everywhere on the second level the guy keeps shooting you so it took me an hour to get off that stupid level  it took me about five days to get of the last level but I suggest that you just play the first level. This was a ripoff it doesn't make sense to wait that long for a stupid freaking game I'm to cool for that dumb game. Another thing that is stupid about the game is the remote controls its confusing because they all look the same they should put the names of what that control does in the buttons. And the thing builds the stuff for you at a scale of 1 to 10 I pick 1  I rather play with realistic legos than the iPad ones don't waste your time on waiting for the game to download  its a ripoff",
        "I would get to the title page and that was it. It won't let me go further. I have turned my phone off and back on and I have uninstalled it twice and installed it 3 times. Please fix."

It's realistic, but Ammo is also expensive, and I hate how You can't jack a car because if they're at a red light, and you're trying to jack their car, they may start going, or when you toss them out of the car, they annoy you and sometimes KILL you.

The game takes you a thrilling adventure, and although the object stays the same I find myself never growing bored. The way that each new character changes the level is just awesome. Each character is well thought out and designed amazingly. If you're looking for a game to pull out in a waiting room, or while you're bored - then give this game a shot. You definitely won't regret it.",
        "It's definitely a fun game. But I cannot figure out where the in app purchases are! I looked everywhere within the app and there is absolutely no place where I can find in app purchases!! But play store says that this game supports in app purchases. So I'm very confused! Can someone please help me out here??",
        "Its awesomr and makes the time go by so quickly. The tiniest problem is that the gas is too little, but thats the point of the game!",
        "This game has so much potential... I started playing and immediately enjoyed it, they've got the game mechanics perfect, everything is easy to get into and the core gameplay is pretty fun. But simple. This usually isn't a problem because game designers usually build complexity ont on top of simple mechanics. Not these guys. The vast majority of jumping platforms, which is all this game is, are incredibly easy to do once you get the hang of it. And that's it. The game doesn't progress at all. It never gets harder. There are some trees and eventually a couple black holes to avoid. Like I mean 3 in the first 100 platforms. Then after platform 100 and something they introduce this drum symbol thing that you can bounce off of. Do they design jumps that implement these bouncy things in a fun and exciting way? Nope. You just go around them. I made it to platform 200 before I finally gave up. This is just lazy game developing.",
        "A great game for relaxing and honing your jetpack skills. It becomes a little boring after a while though, seeing as it's primarily the same activity over and over again. Otherwise perfect =]",
        "Such a great, simple, enjoyable game. I love the visual effects, the art team did a great job. Sound design is great too. I agree that the game is easy once you get a hang of it, but so are games like agario or *cough cough* all of ketchapp *cough cough*  Honestly the devs did excellent, even with ad implementation, all around 10/10 game"

And it is just what it says it is it's just a game like we played When We Were Young remember Cowboys and Indians this is the same thing I had a slingshot when I was young I think every little boy did it's harmless. It does not teach your child to become a murderer.",
        "It's an ok game,a little ridiculous that you can't control the hand movements. I know it has to be a challenge but unless you have some sort of a nerve disorder no one moves like that!",
        "Great if you like spamming adds and flashing buttons to spend here and there. Game itself is a turd but I've had some amazing turds before. So whatever worse then turd is.. this game is",
        "It won't save to cloud and if you can't sign in you don't get online interactive play. Can't figure it saved once, got to play head to head, but no more....great game though.",
        "I am deleting this for several reasons. 1, the physics are not real. A person's hand doesn't move like that. 2, there is an ad after just about every level. Short, but still annoying. And 3, I think a company that can't take the time to respond to it's feedback isn't worth it.",
        "Like they say, good time killer. Easy controls. Keeps you focused on game. First game I've kept downloaded after playing a couple of times in awhile. Good game."

Gonna put a hindrance on the event that's over on Friday. Do hope it's resolved soon. Still like the game tho, but would like it better if I can play.",
        "Well a very basic game, as any other idle game. Has no real extra things that would wow you. Notifications less than a minute after closing the app (or simply pressing home) can get very annoying. As if I need a notification to tell me I closed the game.",
        "Right.  First off, If you are not a fan of Idle games, then don't play. This is the epitome of an Idle game.   The Early game is pretty simple. Click, Collect, Make your way to Level 80. You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn't bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn't been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event's are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events'  All in, pretty good.",
        "Well guess they deleted my last post cause I complained that the game took up 1.8 gig till I uninstalled it and reinstalled it then lost my saves because of bad programming.   Don't waste your time or money on this company.",

        "They put so many buttons to purchase things ion the main screen. When tapping as is the nature of the game, it brings up confirmation for your purchases. If you're trying to play fast, you could easily spend $20 in mere seconds without noticing. Put all the purchases in one place instead of cheating players."

        "Its nice but theres one problem for me.When i logout and login again the game loading glitches and it wont let me play.Pls cix this glitch but anyway thankyou and its still really fun to play",
        "This game is for people who love to be stuck in time, since this game came out there hasn't been any proper updates except from adding new unnecessary stuffs to the game so kids can waste their money on, the time limit in the game is 4mins for either team battle or free for all; this has been the way thia game has been for years since i started play the game anything new in the game is all about spending more money, what tyoe of developers are you guys? Do you even play the game? It gets more boring every second, the are no proper changes no organization of your weapon and other stuffs in the game... It takes like 2+ minutes to change to another outfit because the list is too long, YOU DEVELOPERS NEED TO FOCUS ON THE GAMEPLAY AND NOT NEW ITEMS... Add in squad battles so it can be more competitive and allow people to be able to see their stats and then players will care more just look at what other games are doing in 2018 and don't get stuck in time...GOODLUCK"

Until i close the app and restart it Tried making a fresh Charecter and goes straight into other characters but just not my main.. This started happening an hour ago",
        "I can't get certain menus to work. In shop its the purchase for mount gear, all i see is random text and it freezes the game. Some of the event menus do the same. Ive been playing for a little over a year and never had this problem. Please help.  Also the merit shop menu is broken. I can't buy anything and the event ends today. Ill update as I see other menus broken.",
        "This game sucks.. I always get thee same armament with only one star!  and some items are soo expensive that the money you pay is not worthy for the br you get and in return you'll get low br and also low money not worthy.. If they make this game less expensive maybe I'll give it a four stars... But no! not this time",
        "Makes you pay good money to be strong then merges you with much older servers that allows a no pay player to be much stronger ... horrible customer service also! Edit 3\\18 I see Gatorcade replied to this saying contact them for help. I did 8 days ago with no reply... So yeah like I said horrible customer service",
        "I paid money on This game only for it to stop working once I did...plunder doesn't open for me, mounts won't open for me...assassins creed play won't open...if I do open them....game immediately freezes and I have to shut down. Funny how I pay money and now I have Chinese characters all over the damn game...  THIS is absolutely a pay to play game...except when you pay...the game apparently stops working....",
        "Hey guys.. So when I try to level up my mount I click on the icon and when it comes up most of it is blank except a few words in another language. It freezes the screen so I have to close out and sign back in. Also I can't get anything on plunder either. Some help would be greatly appreciated, thank you."

        "Was an awesome game Very addictive game! Was well done.. until the update. Needs more pens and new themes as I have thousands of coins but nothing left to unlock. Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don't register as pineapple hits for the counters. There's a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it",
        "Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.",
        "Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.",
        "Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.",
        "BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn't have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What's bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I'm not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game.",
        "How can I say this? I can not stop playing this!! Everytime I set a new and higher record I want to achieve and I only stop until I get there xD atm with 6400 coins and everything unlocked 😁😁 please release new content for months and months!! It will make me so happy! Thank you for this game."

        "Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.",
        "There's always a bug when there's about to be substitution of players causing the players in possession of the ball to run like headless chicken. Pls fix that. Add SULLEY MUNTARI of Deportivo La Coruna to the game pls. 'Need FTS18 with embedded dream league soccer ffs! Seems many players who have their current teams in the game are missing. Lawrence Ati of Sochaux in Ligue 1, Joe Dodoo, and many more. A quick update with massive changes will be great 'cause the game currently sucks!!!",
        "Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don't get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a \"Create a Player\" option under 'My Club' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It'd be so nice if you add that.",
        "Look what I experienced. Dls needs development. The commentry needs more reasonableness and intelligence. The behaviour of each player, at least the famous ones should be unique. Controls need more improvement. Add real team logos for the opponent teams. Update players team data according to the recent transfers. And one more issue, while playing local multiplayer we need an extra device to connect two phones. This is a bad experience. If we can connect with each other simply by connecting wifi and hotspot of the two phones respectively, it would be great and simple.",
        "This game is awesome overall. But some changes could be made like adding German league players (especially AUBAMEYANG though he's moved to England) and when you face them leagues top players( in the game) you could add the legends like Pele, Maradona, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and others. Hoping to see these changes in the next update. Thank You!",
        "I will love it if i can send players on loan and be paid some coins instead of directly selling them off. Also switching players for a few or no coins will be great. Since players like pogba likes changing his hairstyles, it will also be great to effect some changes in some players hairstyle. More leagues are needed, if possible, German,  Chinese, Nigerian and south African league. Lastly, commentators find it difficult to call the name of a created player, work on these and this game will be perfect.  Thanks"

        "Loved this game!!! It is my new favorite game I love all the powerful weapons and armor. I wish there was chestplates instead of amulets and leggings instead of bracelets and an easier way to find out what your hero level, But else then that it was perfect. I loved how you can choose the controls to your own preference. Chame on anyone who gave it a less then 5 Star review. I still dont know ho to tell what your hero level was but still my favorite game.",
        "I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there's only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can't beat them! Keep making more awesome games!",
        "I can't help but love a mobile game that doesn't constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it's tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.",
        "I'm really loving this game it's simple but still a ton of fun. My one complaint would be the sometimes the grind is too long and I almost gave up... I wish the developers would throw in some kind of experience boost in the store instead of just being able to buy coins. I would pay real money for an exp boost and would love to support the Developers! just give me the chance!",
        "I understand that people want their games to be entartaining. But i dont understand why there is a thing that downgrades your item upon trying to upgrade it. I have soent the last 3 hours trying to upgrade my helm to lvl 15. Guess where it is now, On goddamn lvl 11. I have spent less time grinding mounts in wow than getting my gear to lvl 15. Stupidest thing ever. One tip. Play the campagin lvls to lvl 40. Then dont do campagin at all and run hell for gold and xp. Repeqt to lvl 80 and then get rekt by the stupid item upgrade system."

        "03-23-18: HOLY SHEET THE SCI-FI UPDATE IS CRAZY AMAZING! Outerminds has done it again! I wish they made more unique celebrations (like SciFi) other than Christmas or Valentine's in the future, such as Easter or even a Video Game Mashup update. It is time to rewrite my review!  So far, it's my favorite time-waster in my device. Never utilizes the Pay2Win paywalls for the most of the time (It's one of the best non-Pay2Win apps in the era of Pay2Win), and never crashes at all! Bugs aren't frequent! There are easy ways to save Bux and Brains in the game, which gives almost every player the opportunity to customize without any problem.  The game is hugely customizable. It's like being a home designer and a Tuber at the same time. There's lots of different customization options for your room, Tuber, and stuff. I also love to switch to a certain theme during events like SciFi or Valentine's Event.  And next, the videos. You can name your videos whatever you want, and you can select a combination of genres. You could make hilarious titles like \"PewDiePie Plays His Game\" or \"Edgar The Rapper\". And then you can pretend to act them out.  One of the best parts of the game is that there are almost no annoying popup video/banner ads, unlike in most games I've played like Vlogger Go Viral. The only way to view them is to simply go for a free shipping boost by watching an ad (which does not interrupt gameplay. Watching ads is also in Quests too, and it's fine as well.)  I like the Puggle minigame as well. It doesn't make the game feel boring as it can help boost shipping time while being a playable Pachinko with Edgar and Maya.  The game's community is also very cool. No cancerous fights or something, many players of this Tuber Simulator mostly focus on hatching Pixelings, participate in room contests, and get tips on how to grind Bux! Check out the Google+ semiofficial community as well.  Probably the greatest Tuber game on the web, Outerminds. I'll send you a Sponsor Eagle filled with \"Good Job\" messages. Keep your game as good as possible, there's no time to lose in beating PewDiePie to his #1 spot!",

Words cannot fully express what this game means to me! Thanks to the developers I look forward to playing everytime. The music is wonderful! I highly recommend this game. Thanks again ♡",
        "As much as I understand that you want to make a few bucks, the amount of advertising and the way the advertising is being presented has gradually become quite intrusive and annoying. I would much rather pay a one time license fee that this crabby implementation of user annoyance  / advertising. The other problem is that on the high end phones (read pixel 2) the board are so big that the tiles as a consequence are made very small so they fit with a final result that makes it very difficult to see/read",
        "The ads are very annoying and I have lost interest in playing  the game anymore. I have to start over for each play. Ad won't let me continue. Someone has Really messed this game up. Just fire their butts and send them down to the river swamp. No need for them to be in the public when they can't leave well enough alone.",
        "I think the game is great. I love Mahjong. I'm unhappy that I paid 1.99 to stop the ads but when I collect my 2,000 coin bonus I still have to watch an ad to receive the bonus. I will not be paying 1.99 next month just to still have to watch ads.",
        "The latest update places advertising banners in the play area. You can't move them or play around them and I don't want to install the advertisement app.  They suck out loud.",
        "Does not even lay tiles down in a solvable fashion. Had no repeats thus shud be solvable in any order, wasn't, what's the point? Sort ur algorithm out.  Also, non stop ads and u want us to pay monthly for ad free? £8 one off fee wud b highest I went for an app I'd want to keep"

The reason I gave it only 1 star is just to seek your attention because I wanted u all to add an effect of sound of engine as the car speeds up which will make the game really more realistic. I really loved playing this game but if u add that effect, it will make the game more interesting. I hope u add some more realistic effects in the game. Again I say that I gave it just 1 star to seek your attention, otherwise the game really worths a 5 star........Thank you.",

This would fail state regulations on gambling games. Fun but a sucker game for rolling anything that counts as statistically random",
        "This is fun, IF you can figure it out. I like playing yahtzee but this is complicated. Every time I get extra dice, the ???? spends them or takes them away from me so I don't get to spend them the way I want to. That sucks.",
        "Love the game! But recently did an update for the app now my game glitches out. Takes forever to roll the dice. Only updated the app cuz it said they fixed bugs & made faster well it did the opposite for my app.",

        "Very realistic and nice game. Missions and descriptions are entertaining. Controls are also great.   Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!",
        "Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!",
        "Great game but more issues to address.  The longer flight durations are a real waste of time,  make them more challenging rather than waiting for the destination. Also add more controls as the ones we have are not effective. How do you tell me to slow down yet i don't have the option for that?",
        "Its quite good but a little bit of fixing will do. The part \"Slow Down thing\" can you please please place that where it can not block the view of the player. It is very difficult to see whats behind it so it causes us players to crash. T.Y",
        "Why the hell they add brake when we cannot see the brake option even after landing which forces us to crash. Total stupidity do not waste time in downloading. Previously was better when there were no brakes just reverse it and stop or keep brake button always active.",
        "Its really boring... You have to do missions you cant just fly around and do whatever you have to fly through the squares and make it to the end... And who wants stripes?! Why are they so important?! Plus its really hard to control!!"

There were only one pair of cards with two dots and they overlapped each other, which of course I could not pair them up. And there were three pairs of one strip appeared.",

        "need team voice chat and its super perfect.... anyone wants to try new battle royale? then try this... I think it might've been better than Rules Of Survival... this game is worth it..... it also lets you to shoot while your friends is driving a vehicle..well, only for duo or squad mode obviously....but what's more, you can actually pilot a helicopter..... nice...",
        "Great graphics with minimum config,controls are awesome  and it has dive button,can jump thru walls and climb windows,way better than the other survival games on phone,it has bullet physics! the only thing im concerned about is The lagging when shoorting from far distances,and id like to suggest a configuration for the graphics to adjust compatibilty . Thank you for this game 5stars! Your doing just great devs!",
        "I love this game and the devs reply to my requests in their official facebook page, thats awesome. One thing I wanna have here is voice chat. Definitely the best even low end devices can play this lag free. I recommend this. I don't know why they rate this so low but it's probably cuz it's not tha popular yet. Keep it up!",
        "I don't know why it got low ratings ....    I want to tell u thie guys..  ur game was absolutely great.... 125 players that impressive....graphics is good.. some minor buys ... plz reduce the sound of the heli...the most important thing is the render distance is soooooooooooo good.... i don't know how it's achived with in 180 MB .... I'm telling u this I really liked ROS....but not any more.....bc In here their is no such a lag and it can in any device... skill based  .. very good rendering distance.. the bullet drop is so realistic...jumping mechanism sooooo great and all this good things come with in 180 MB .. I love u guys.... GREAT WORK. keep it up....I really look up to the next update.......😘😘😙😙👌👌👌👌👍",
        "there are some bugs, that i knew the player is in the building and in his/her phone, but in my phone the player just float in the air its good for me to kill that player, but its not good if the player was me.  fix the building.  add or fix some features like: 1. the distance of the safezone in the mini map. 2. after automaticaly open the door, please make it close automaticaly too. 3. make the control wheel just by move the camera not by the direction arrow. 4. foot step is just too small. 5. make a gun fire radar. 6. make the animation of the character more realistic.  its ok to me if the update makes the game become 500 mb bigger than previous version.  i love this game. its run nicely in my phone.",
        "Hard to attack, easy to die. I already point the crosshair to the enemy, and when I start shooting, the crosshair miss the enemy and start to move around randomly, looks like I attack the ground, and end up died. Also, hard to find weapon and ammo. Your game is good, but not good enough. You are trying to fully copy PUBG, which is played on PC, while your game is Android-Based, hard to control. Hard to control. Easy to aim, but never hit, because the crosshair like to move around and land the bullet on the ground. Try to play Free Fire Battleground by Garena. Overall, Free Fire much better than yours. Uninstalled!"
