        "I play the official release on the computer a lot (over 400 hours) and this is an amazing job! Shout-out to the team for redesigning the levels to be better suited for the mobile! The gameplay is so simple and we'll suited for a mobile phone game. There are some bugs that I'd like to report.  My first I game I played I won with 6 kills in a solo. Can't wait to get my friends into this amazing port! 5/5 stars",
        "Smooth controls and gameplay. No glitching. Amazing graphics. Running on Samsung Note 8 with the latest updates and no other apps running in the background. Kinda reminds me of Battlefield 3... :)   One thing I don't like is the option to either play as a Guest or sign in using Facebook. Not everyone has a Facebook and it would make me want to play it more if I could sign up using my email account etc. Just my 2 cents. Enjoy!",
        "Wow! Great job on this mobile port. In addition it's also free. Download it! This might be the best mobile game I have ever played, with the best looking graphics. It's absolutely insane that this will run on my phone, but I'm not sure if I can run it on my computer. This is impressive and super fun. The controls are fine, but take some getting used to. If you added Bluetooth controller support, I would buy a controller just to play this. Good job guys  :)",
        "Honestly I've always wanted to play PUBG, and now that it's on mobile it's a dream come true. Only problem I faced playing the game is keeping the items you have in inventory. Ex: Changing a recommended rifle to a pistol, then trying to get ammo for that pistol but auto picks up the rifle instead. With this minor fix, and others, it would improve gameplay big time",
        "The gameplay is so great so far! There are stil a lot of bugs though, like mic doesn't work sometimes, aim and reloaded ui is gone, and I don't know if it's my phone but when I use 8x scope, the frame rate drops; like a lot. Hopefully the game will get fixed, and get optimized for low spec phones on a further update, oh and also a suggestion make the hud mini map a little bit big and also make the map itself hd. Anyway you guys still did a great job and thank you for this! :)",
        "I think this game is really good compared to the Xbox and PC versions of the game. It also adds a few other options for the game that aren't on the PC/Xbox version such as distance from your marker, dotted line to your marker, and it tells you how many poeple are in the plane. The aim assist really helps balance out the phone controls to keep gun fights running smooth and everything works really well. There is the occasional lag spike and stuff but the game works really well for my 2 year old Samsung  tablet.  10 out of 10 would recommend."

        "The game is good (played like 5 missions so far) but i feel like there should be a jump and crouch feature, even if its just a jump feature. Maybe make some levels where you gotta utilize the jumping, maybe throw in some jet packs during some missions/raids to get to a certain area to either continue the mission and/or find some hidden crates. Also, maybe add some melee weapons too?  Besides that, the game is fun, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay could improve tho.",
        "Good game but I expected it to be the best.  No loading issues or bugs encountered so far. Game loading takes about 6 seconds so no big deal. If madfinger sees this please add new maps and skins and weapons in SGDZ and enhance the game experience at FB as playing the game at gameroom sucks. I promise I will bring you about 100 new players if you did that.",
        "Its awesome. Running smooth with maxed graphics on s8+ and I had no problems while playing it for 10+ hours.  May be starting area could be expanded along with more multiplayer features and interactions. More unique missions between lvl 11 and 15. Also smaller package (5$) could be added. P.S crashes when collecting contract rewards ...Puzzles sucks. Avoid multiplayer and arena untill is fixed",
        "This game has little bit inspiration from many big games like destiny (duh), titanfall, doom. The game does have similarities to dead trigger. All the random loot is cosmetic, guns are easily obtained through missions. Good performance on my S7, but need internet 24×7 to run, even during campaign.",
        "The graphic is awesome.But the game sometimes crashes when entering the casino full of people. Also, add chat system in co-op modes. It's hard to make people understand the puzzles without a chat. Add jump,crouch. It will make the game more attractive and the things are also needed for a game like this. I love the game. Keep adding new things, just don't turn the game into mostly pay to play game.Thanks.",
        "Giving the review after 24hrs of gameplay. Have to say that it's awesome. Cudos to the creators. Loving the gaming experience. Graphics rendering should be calibrated more. Make sure to do that in next update. Coins and slots are hard to obtain. Many of them don't want  to spend real money so better give some daily tasks to complete and earn coins."

        "I d give it 10/10 if there way a search button to look for mayors, more communication options (private/public) messaging to facilitate talking in the game etc..and concerning the gameplay, it would better if devs reduce the production time of items. It takes way longer and as players we dont have all day to play even if we used boosters and in game cash !",
        "Wonderful game indeed. The only thing is missing is the financing part. Would be really nice to have a banking inductor a stock market where you could trade financial products like other cities bonds or debt. Financing during the game can be a big problem so having a financial hub from where you could trade and borrow would be really useful. Thank you for developing this amazing game.",
        "This game is crazy and awesome at the same time. My population has been awesome. Just 2 months and it was from 0 - 92 000+! The crazy part is when I see a blue hospital sign, the people dont even tell good reasons. ALL THEY DO IS SAY, Sometimes I go to the clinic just to read MAGAZINES! My citizens are so crazy JUST BEACAUSE IN ONE HECTARE, I AM A GOOD MAYOR!",
        "Too much waiting for things to get made and produced. The storage and items for upgrades FAR too difficult to get. 42 items to raise storage by 5 items. And it can take weeks to find all the items. When you go to global storage and find an item that you really need, by the time that you get there, it's already sold! 😠 Also, it takes 3 different items, and you have 3 of one item and 24 of another. Really? Also, it should be that you get needed items more often, randomly rather than at specific times. Other than that, a good game.",
        "Like the competition challenges it holds your attention. the time frames of production are a little long however the markets move products fast. I also like the club wars and the mayors challenges. My dislike is there are not enough thought bubbles in the fact that you only get two the rewards should be more frequently.",
        "The Sims keeps progressive challenges fun and interesting, and the Club Wars make for a very fun multiplayer experience!  The graphic attention to detail is amazing! It's quite relax just to watch the shadows of the skyline stretch as the sun crosses the sky or to see hot air balloons floating around the metropolis.  This game is lots of fun!!"

        "Overall, I love it but it would be helpful if we could get something like a monthly subscription. Maybe like 10-15 characters fragments plus 10-15 gems or something. It would help us be less grindy. It would help with collection and able to get legendary easier plus monthly revenue. I would love that. Compare to MFF which is a lot more hectic, you guys a bit more generous. Just please don't put any paywall characters. Hated that.",
        "Fun game but currency is insanely expensive. I don't mind spending money but this game is ridiculous. So instead of me spending a little I spend nothing. I guess my wallet thanks you. It's also so hard to level people up... They keep introducing new characters I have to level up to keep up with alliance missions. Those are fun but I want to level up my other characters too!",
        "It was a great game until they introduced Deathstroke. Now you either need to have him(I do but it takes the fun away) or have people specifically to counter him. They made him way OP and arnt nerfing him anytime soon. So if your just starting you will want to spend money to counter death stroke.",
        "Agreed that DS needs reworking but not frm one of the best to the weakest. Developers, do you even play your own game?? Wasted my $$ & time invested in him. I don't even have lobo if you think I use the 'lowbo' combination in pvp",
        "Upgrade superman please, he is so weak.. i  have Lvl 52 Superman with Lvl 7 gear but his overall is still lower than Lvl 50 Cyborg, Power Girl or even Jessica Cruz with Lvl 4 gear. He is the weakest energy character even though i invest a lot on him.",
        "Pretty good turn based strategy. Wish should some things were explained a bit better, especially buffs and debuffs. Also feel like progress stalls as the game gets fun... Higher energy caps or lower energy drain per mission would be nice."

        "I wrote a review already for my game on my laptop,and as I said I love this game but for some addicting reason I now have a new game on my new tablet I just got hehe. I am not here to complain and I'm not saying anyone else is in just wanted to let you know that some of the ads don't show up on the tablets you can hear them play but can't see them and as I said (some). I have managed my way around it through memorizing where the close (x) is just from trying to tap every corner but I would like not to have to do that hehe. But like I said I can manage, it's just that I know someone who would like to play but can't really stand that lol my mom hehe anyway I just thought about it would be nice if she could play too and it might help as well. Thanks for reading and listening and have yourselves  a nice day and night. Plus thanks for this game!",
        "I love this game because is it active! I can play it all day and not get board! Keep up the great work everyone!😛😛 ( there a lot of ads every 5 minutes though. I don't know why. Pls fix that and the game will be even better! Respond to me as soon as you can! Thanks you for your time to listen to my opinion!",
        "I love this game! So much,very addictive and very unique!  I would rate 100 stars if I could!You can battle, feed dragons, do clans...ECT ! Every update it gets new things!  Best dragon game ever!You would love this game, just get it! And it's free!There are so many islands too! You can connect it on Google play to save the game or Facebook! The dragons are so cute!!! Please get this game! There are so many activities  And tournaments!",
        "I love this game so much but... I used to play this game a year ago then I got tired of it then I returned yesterday  I had a Facebook account that even has a legendary called Ice cream , so I signed in back half of my dragons are gone , my farms , my island everything that's why I rated 1 if I could get my account back I would rate 5 Thanks. Sincerely,  A Google Player ( Facebook too ).",
        "good game but y'all gotta fix how valuable the gems are. its impossible to get lots of gems without paying and you're only rewarded 1 per video. and then it costs me 150 gems to get TWO hatchery spots? that's bs. fix that and I'll give 5",
        "There is an unnecessary amount of ads. I understand representing your sponsors, but at what cost to your customers? General game play is also very challenging for new players  as far as leveling up dragons, collecting coins/food, and even breeding times are ridiculous."

        "It was enjoyable before the latest update, and the new features look interesting and will make the game better, but there's now a glitch with actually playing? Whenever I hit the ball, I receive some gems and go the distance that would take me two bounces in a matter of seconds before it resets and I'm back at the start. Thought it may have been just a one-off but it seems consistent. Hoping the developers can fix this soon.",
        "Great to use when you're on a quick break. However, the new update needs some more updates. I like how the ball flies faster... But now it's too fast to try and strategically bounce it @ end of flying. Maybe slow it down then. Also, first hit when I open is fine, all hits after, the screen goes black halfway through flying in the air...",
        "Fun game. I would like to see an update that includes sounds effects, music etc. I would also like to see different characters to choose from and/or customization of the character(s). Overall, good job.(Edit**) Great job on the addition of new content with the last update, however with this latest update the game will glitch. The glitch makes the ball not land and resets the game to the pitching of the ball.",
        "I like the game a lot and have been playing it for around a month. The new  update looks and cool and fun and I like the new features and character and stuff but I can only open the game and hit the ball once or twice before this glitch that starts happening. The glitch is that it will go the distance then reset and I won't get credit for going that for or get any money. Please fix fast and keep up with the updates",
        "I liked the game before. I did pay to remove ads. The game was simple and fun. However the current update has the game broken. The ability to get new characters is a nice addition but the game at higher levels is unplayable. The game keeps resetting because the ball is hit so hard and high it goes out of the playable area even if you hit it \"perfect\" once this issue is fixed I will adjust my review",
        "It was fun up until the last update when the developers I assume said \"hey! If we make the ball move faster, we can squeeze more ads in\". The game itself is very fun, however, once you get onto it, you are practically forced to turn your internet off. Things to improve on: change the ball speed back to normal, and make ads more spanned out."

        "I tried the beta and loved it, with my main hope for a way which you can backup your game so I don't have to worry about losing my progress. The developers came through and enabled CloudSave. I already love everything about this game and the addition of that meant and immediate 5 stars from me. Additional plus points for the cute games and being able to toggle whether you want poop.",
        "I love this game. I loved the first game a lot but was always super sad it didn't have a save function. But this one does! So you can save your progress with no problem. And there's so many areas of the house to fill up with stolen goodies. This game is awesome. 100% recommended!",
        "Really like this game however. It's been taking big amounts of coins off me in the past few days? I've purchased some of the coins etc. I leave the game with 2000+ coins to return to 800 this morning? I had the same thing a few days ago but thought I must've pressed some buttons wrong. But since it happened again, am not impressed with this. I've paid money for coins which are going missing? Shame cause its a fun game.",
        "I was so excited for this game since the first one is so fun. Sadly, this seems like it was made as a cash grab. Merely riding on the success of the last one, but changing a lot of the mechanics. For one, it costs more to bring the cats back, and it's more difficult to obtain coins. Also, forget about kiips unless you're willing to spend money, because they even changed the system of trading coins in for kiips, costing you more coins for each kiip you obtain via buying with coins. So if you're okay with all of that, it still has cute cats, fun little items to collect, and new rooms.",
        "It is cute and likeable. Love the YouTube video on the backstory. The cost sending the Klepto Cats Out is a little steep with the amount you make. Feeding, petting and bathing seems to do nothing. Having arthritic hands playing the games is bit difficult. Also why do you get dust cloud when tapping on something?",
        "I miss being able to send out one cat per room (like you could in original Kleptocats) now you have to pay 100 coins to send more than one out (even if the cat is in a different room). It's also harder to get gems as you can't trade coins for them now and you only get one per day from the 'gem dog'. Hopefully this will improve with future updates as I've seen others complain about these mechanics too."

        "This game had a lot of potential which was litreally ruined by the props mechanic. I can bare with my prop being noisy but why do you have to make it seriously obvious? That's not even hiding at all. Also the health taken down when shooting wrong boject should be 1 and remove auto-shoot. Make it easier to hit props and remove the frigging emoji above the props.  This is more like a running simulator.",
        "This game is good. You should add more guns, coins to buy things with that aren't really expensive and one grenade launcher in every game. You should also add bigger maps and a lot more props to become.",
        "Great concept and overall pretty good, but hunters are heavily favored and it's pay to win. I wish purchases were just cosmetic instead. A few glitches such as the rotation being a pain (Samsung gs6).",

        "I think this game has potential. The gameplay is fun and so far I enjoyed the pvp battle. I gave a 4 star because the game lacks variety in the early levels - I don't feel myself making any progress after playing for two hours. Also,  the game is pushing too hard to sell their ingame currency and bundles, reminds me of those cheaply made games with a sole purpose to scam your money.  Please create a better sales strategy because this game has more potential than that",
        "I would have given it a 5 however the game will not connect to play unless it is via wifi. The game is great and it's fun to play. It's unfortunate that this game now has such a connect issue. I am a few days from uninstalling the game. Again, its a great game, adicting and plays beautifully...until this last update.",
        "Awesome PvP game, just needs more maps. Excellent graphics and the broken space station is a nice touch. Update; your last update for this game has a bug in it. I have access to my ships but when I try and launch a battle it will not connect. Please fix.",
        "BAD CONNECTION ISSUES WITH LATEST PATCH. Pretty fun, but it's never able to find a game while on 4G. I have to connect to wifi (slower!) for matchmaking to work.",
        "Pretty good. I am able to go pretty far without purchasing anything but I am sure money makes it easier.   Only complaint is there are no PVE missions. That would totally make this a 5 star game.",
        "I might've given 4/5 stars for this game but i rate it lower due to game lack of honesty. 90 or 80 percent chance of success means 90 or 80 percent of failure. im fed up being failed upgrade despite 90 percent chance of success failed several times on highest tier ship which req lits of golds. ssounds like a rigged slot machine but too obvious"

        "I love the game its really fun, but the overall game progression is a super grind. I'm only on chapter 3 and I spend more time enhancing my mech with fooder, that mind you doesnt scale up with rank. The exp you have to put in goes up but not the exp you get from C to A rank mechs is pretty much the same unless it's an enhanced mech and those are super rare after the daily mission is used up.",
        "Really impressed with the quality. Even some voice acting in it. More pervy than I expected, but makes me laugh sometimes. Only gave 4 stars because it's a gatcha type of microtransaction game, and I will never give a game like that a perfect score.",
        "The last maintenance fixed the lagging issue thx for the great work  I just started playing it but my impression are positive  I think sounds takes a big cut from  game size and only one male char.  Appeared until now, overall i think it will be a big success, thx",
        "Turn base game. The mech from C rank can easily promote to the last S rank within 3 days of grinding. Other thing that I like about this game is the Pixie's episode. I really thought I get the correct answer and they gave me a long cut scene. End up it was wrong. I was surprised. Yup there is fan service",
        "Finally a good mecha-themed turn base rpg game I can actually enjoy. Cute graphics, awesome mecha designs, cringe-worthy fan services (which I am a sucker of), all in one nicely packaged mobile game. Thank you Nexon for presenting us with this gem 😊",
        "Game is over 2GB! But dl doesn't indicate that. Only installing the opening. Way to big for a mobile game. What a waste"

        "I think that the developers should make this game into a subway surfer type if game. You steal something and run away from the cops or person. I don't really like the game because of the controls and the layout of the game.",
        "Bugs. And not enough space not to fun. Wish the powers told you when they are going to wear off. Oh well not like smart people made this app...",
        "This game is bad. The controlled are very hard to use and the gameplay gets repetitive. There is nothing different. Each game you play is the same. There isn't even a point of the money. The only thing you could get was a skin that is 10000 dollars. It's is very hard to get any money. The only good thing was the graphics and the audio.",
        "What the other reviews say are not necessarily true the insanely high turn sensitivity is needed later in the game. People are just not willing to put in that much dedication into the game so they actually have fun they probably only played it for five minutes.",
        "It's a good game. The only thing about it is the controls are different. But overall I actually like the game I thought it was going to be stupid but it was fun. U don't even have to worry about lagging. The stuff in say in real life is in the game.",
        "It's a great game except for the controls, I think I know what they were trying to go for but I don't think it's appealing to the community, just give us the basic touch screen joystick controls. But other that it's great though it would also be nice if characters were cheaper and you could buy accessories with no effects."

        "Great game most fun I've had on a mobile phone in years. Need to add wider turning radius so drifts are better and longer. Cars slide to much or maybe the cars are heavy? Idk but hepatic feed back would help so much. Ad these thing's and I'll rate 5 stars and fully purchase the game.also multiplayer with like 3 to 5 other people just messing around  would be awesome. Keep supporting this game and has a lot of potential unlike other mobile games that are very linear and closed off. This feels like a console quality game please keep it that way.   PLEASE ADD HEPATIC FEEDBACK SUPPORT",
        "This is legit the best car simulator type I had ever played. It can easily succeed Extreme Car Racing 3D, which was one of the original simulators back in 2014. Smooth gameplay and realistic sounds. I would suggest to add the 350z, RX7 FD and a touge map for late night uphill driving, that would be insane",
        "This game could be even better if you could: - Add the settings to the menu to control the music and SFX volumes.  - Add a map.  - Add a cockpit mode!  - Add an online or multiplayer mode!  - Add weather conditions like rain and snow.  - Add the brands to the cars!!!!.  Fix the speed of the cars and add the actual speed of each car. For example, the speed of the Lamborghini Aventador is supposed to be at 217 mph and it's supposed to have 7 gears but it's only using 5. Please fix that. - Make the city as BIG as you can please!!!!.   - Please add more shadow effects!!!. - ADD UPGRADES PLEASE!!!. - Add car stats. - Add more cars like:   • Chevrolet Corvette Z06  • Chevrolet Camaro SS  • Mosler Land Shark • SRT Viper GTS • Mosler Super GT  • Marussia B2  • McLaren P1 GTR  • Pagani Huayra  • Pagani Zonda R  • McLaren F1 GTR  • Ford GT  • 2017 Ford GT  • W Motors Lykan Hypersport  • W Motors Fenyr Supersport  • Lamborghini Huracan  • Lamborghini Veneno  • Lamborghini Reventon • Lamborghini Centenario  • Trion Nemesis RR  • Ferrari F50 GT  • Ferrari LaFerrari  • Ferrari FXX-K  • Ferrari FXX Evoluzione  • Ferrari F80  • Hennessey Venom GT  • Henessey Venom F5, and the   • Devel Sixteen. Please!!!!!. It is totally fine if you can't add any of this, but it would be better if you could do so!. This could be an official car driving simulator game. WHO WANTS MORE CARS!!!???!?!?!.",
        "This is a fun game. I'm still personally waiting on that police chase mode. Also, can there be engine mods and body mods, and some more low end cars?😀",
        "There is a glitch in this game when u go to airport by the wall u keep on falling !! I dont knew i fall for 800000 mts and i didnt got the bonus 🤣🤣 crazy",
        "It is a good game over all. Please add instructions in the settings on how to shift at the right time and add older cars. Like the 1966 E-Type Jaguar 4.2 roadster.Also please add the stats of the car when you're at the car choosing screen. And let us be able to change the tires of the cars and stuff like that."

However, it's still missing something and at the end it'll get boring fast. Overall, I kinda like the game and the pixel art.",

    "description" : "Last Battleground: Survival is a survival shooter game. Each match takes 40 players and puts them on a deserted island. At the start of the game, all players parachute onto the island completely empty-handed.The way the game unfolds is: players are spread around the island unarmed and must find and use various weapons and items to eliminate opponents.As time goes on, the island's \"safe zone\" gets smaller and smaller, and certain areas will also be bombarded. Players and teams will be ranked for the match in the order they are eliminated.The safe zone changes randomly in each match, providing players with a fresher, more intense experience each time.Remember, find a weapon and supplies as quickly as you can and then move to the island’s safe zone.This is not just a game, this is battle for survival!!!PLEASE NOTE! Last Battleground: Survival is free to download and play, however some game items can also be purchased for real money.

At the start of the game, all players parachute onto the island completely empty-handed.<br><br>The way the game unfolds is: players are spread around the island unarmed and must find and use various weapons and items to eliminate opponents.<br><br>As time goes on, the island&apos;s &quot;safe zone&quot; gets smaller and smaller, and certain areas will also be bombarded. Players and teams will be ranked for the match in the order they are eliminated.<br><br>The safe zone changes randomly in each match, providing players with a fresher, more intense experience each time.<br>Remember, find a weapon and supplies as quickly as you can and then move to the island&#x2019;s safe zone.<br><br>This is not just a game, this is battle for survival!!!<br><br>PLEASE NOTE! Last Battleground: Survival is free to download and play, however some game items can also be purchased for real money. If you do not want to use this feature, please set up password protection for purchases in the settings of your Google Play Store app. Also, under our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, you must be at least 12 years of age to play or download Last Battleground: Survival.<br><br>Have any questions or issues with the game from Elex Tech? <br>Reach us at: LastBattleground.help@gmail.com<br>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/LastBattleground/",

Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",
        "This game is top grossing because they take your money! Then they dont respond to you trying to contact them! This game is a LOT of fun. However My Game Has Been Reset And ALL of my purchases have been deleted and I did not receive my last one. PLEASE HELP",
        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money."

No complaints... No p2w... and the graphics if you set them to full are just phenomenal!!! Keep it up guys!! But fix the loading issue so we can get back to akademia!!",
        "Great game so far. Not sure if there is a community forum or something somewhere which would be nice. I had a character on some other server and it seemed to be erased when the new server opened? Its fine though, previous character did not have too much progression. Music is not the greatest though, would be good if you could include more classic FF music in the game.   Dailys seem a bit overwhelming. There are so many quests to complete each day to get all the chests.   Other than that im quite enjoying it. If you can't load the game after update clear data and dl again",
        "Support is incredibly slow, they will happily take your money and not let you have access to the items you payed for. Will update this review if they ever actually resolve my issue. It has been 5 days since I submitted a support issue with no useful responses made by them. Update: over 48 hours since last response still not any closer to having my issue resolved",
        "I installed the game. I was enjoying it then suddenly it stoped working giving me an error message of \"license stoped working\". I uninstalled it and will try to install it. I hope this time it won't happen again.   What?? Still having the same error! Please do something about it, since the game is really nice.",
        "I was hooked up playing this game as you can still get stronger without spending. Unfortunately looks like something broke during the update and was stucked in the FF splash screen. Hoping that the devs are on top of this and release an official announcement to players.",
        "Characters repeat the same thing over and over and it gets really irritating. And now the game doesn't even start, i love the final fantasy franchise and you have a really great game, and i like that you have to interact with the game to stay alive and it's not just automatic bullcrap, please keep updating the game."

        "I think it is a great game and great concept. Then in the stories characters would send pictures and videos. Great except you have to pay to see them. Not pay and boom you see stuff permanently, but its a weekly, monthly, or yearly thing like its a PlayStation plus account. There are ways of making money without doing this, its called advertisements. Yea they are annoying but they work. I would rather deal with ads and experience the full game then have the game be free but I have to pay for parts locked behind a pay wall. Aside from that the game is great.",
        "Most stories are good but its Very very very pay to read. With weekly and yearly subscriptions. After reading every story in 1 day, i canceled my free trial and uninstalled. I refuse to pay 3 dollars a week. Or even 50 a year to just sit and wait for them to come up with more material. On top of the subscription cost they ALSO have gems you buy and spend on making the fun choices in the stories. So my advice it to start your free trial, cancel it, read every story in a day. And then uninstall and thank me for not spending money to wait weeks for one more story.",
        "Well the reason I put a zero on the graphics was bc I didn't get to see them.😢 I just wanted to let you know that I want to request a update on the game maybe just like let people see the video chats and not the pictures. It was really hard knowing what it was talking about. Overall I like it!😀",
        "I love these stories because they're  breathe taking, mysterious, juicy, horrifying, gruesome and just amazing. I find clifhanger inspiring because it gives me bazaar ideas for when I want to write a horra story. However, I don't like the idea of paying because when I first downloaded this app I read the first story and while I was reading the story a blurred picture appeared so I was so excited but when I went to click on it, it said I hat to pay which was quite disappointing but other then that I feel like this app was a realy good idea I feel like it was well made well organised and well planned",
        "I understand this would be good entertainment for some, but honestly the set up you have is bad. having to pay multiple time to see a video or anything that is added as an extra is bad enough, having wait time are worse. On top of all of it the stories are lack luster. Please fix it.",
        "I love the app it's amazing. I advise u to download it but pls put ads bc u have to wait 14 mins I mean I'd rather watch ads than wait 14mins it just makes me angry."

Why change something that wasn't broken!! 😡  UPDATE...since the second update the game is back and I LOVE it. Thank you so much for sorting it out. I genuinely love this game!!",
        "So frustrating to play since the update. Game constantly crashes, cannot play for longer than a few minutes before it crashes, can't go into any other hospitals because it crashes, can't watch videos because it crashes.....*STILL crashing, even after new update. I'm now getting a message on update screen 'this app may not be optimised for your device' - this app worked perfectly fine before update, why now is the app not optimised??",
        "This is A cute game to play doctor and all.  I just wish earning coins did not take so long, because to add on a clinic or expansion, it takes up all your money.  Also to purchase item for the hospital, the cost of each item goes up after you purchase one item. Like the waiting room chairs starts at 40 coins after a few chairs it is now at 70 coins per chair. Like how unfair is that?  Like is their a limit to how high each item gets?",
        "The problem is the friends system requires you connect via Facebook. For people that don't want to, or don't have Facebook, you're screwed. Please implement a way to add friends inside the game rather than through Facebook harassment.",
        "The game has the potential to be very entertaining however the constant crashes and app failure is very disheartening. Definite work needed to improve these issues, now its saying the app may not be optimized for the device. Why wouldn't it say that before downloading? Try again!",
        "Very laggy, took up alot of space on my phone. Wouldn't let me drag anything from one place to another. Very annoying. Don't reccomend"

        "Hi,  I just started playing this game yesterday, and I am already addicted. I really enjoy the interface and the community. The game is really easy to play and enjoyable too. The only thing I would change would be in the new update with the choice of how much money you want to steal, would it be possible to place the cursor at the maximum capacity right of the bat instead of at like 30%? Personally, I want to get as much money as possible, so I have to swipe the little thingy all the way everytime, and it would be way more convenient for everybody if it was straight at the end, and then people could decide to change the amount if needed.  Thank you for you comprehension,  SimsFireball",
        "I'm in love with it.... played it for a few days now and I kinda haven't stoped stayed up until 2am and I work at 6am so yea... it's like a odd rpg with 3 class attacker, Defender and balance NO there are no classes just areas you add levels into that add exp to your over all level and also there is no level cap so come in join now and be the best hacker you can be and also there are crews",
        "I really like the game... my classmate come to me and tells \"hey i'm a hacker look this 😂\"  after this we start play the game together... I Just wanna a \"Denunce App\" in players desktop for denunce for somethings like abusive nicks or \"The trash talkers\" in system logo.",
        "So far I'm having a great time with this game.  Its great for passing the time or if your looking for a good casual game.  Something I'd recommend would be to add some more features between the levels. A 10 level gap seems a bit empty to have nothing new.",
        "This is an amazing concept. Ive spent all night playing and this game is so addictive, I love it.   The only thing I could suggest for this game is to add a shop where you can buy customisable options for your \"phones\" home screen in the app with the money you earn from hacking other players because it would add an element of user customisation into the game. But overall this is a great app and would definitely recommend!",
        "I played HackEx and vhack xt. This game is by far one of the best hacking simulator games for Android I have played, it's got it's issues sure, but the devs work fairly quick to fix the issues and the player base from what I seen is very friendly."

Well for one, just trying to to fill my feilds with wheat, or anything for that matter, is agonizingly slow, as well as harvesting your crops.. I shouldnt have to keep swiping over the same thing, when ive already swiped over it.. This game is almost like Township, which i loved, however, that game stopped working on me so finding this game was quite exciting.. Please fix this speed problem..",
        "Total waste of a potential good game dont play this game. It needs to speed up to be slow! Game control is like they dont know what their doing. Or they purposely screwing with the game to see how long players last. Cant get around the game without it editing. Need water for trees and when your neighbors water them it doesnt take. Do urself a favor and dont bother",
        "It's not a badd game but it would be nice if there was an easier way to chop down the old plants like the grapes and the apples.  You can never get the tool that it requires to chop it down so I have all these old plants hanging out on my game..  It is a very slow game.. very slow also",

        "Love this game.  Once of the best made games I've ever played, with an amazing concept and exceptionally executed. One thing I think should be changed is the \"infinite resources\" mode. It does not give you infinite resources,  it gives you 100,000 of everything except science.  You can reach 0, and it does not regenerate unless you get structures that do it.  That is the only fix I would make",
        "This is the mobile game that other games wish they could be.  After playing for 5 minutes I said shut up and take my money (to unlock additional features, not pay to win).  Gameplay is simple enough to get going, but deep enough to keep playing.  Interface is well suited to my cellphone.  Art/Graphics are very nice.  If I had to nit-pick, the resource icons could be less similar in some instances, but this is ONLY complaint I could come up with.  If you like resource management, civilization building game play, this is a must play.",
        "There's a very annoying bug - animals often freezes and don't produce resources so I have to put them on certain tiles once again. The game is also laggy when an empire is big enough. The concept is great but there's some work needed 👷🏻\u200d♂️",
        "Absolutely amazing game. The unpaid version is really fun, excellent as a stand alone.  The paid expansion is awesome and very much worth the money. The challenges are fun and diverse, you can spend hours perfecting them.  I also like that this company is not a money grabber. Once you pay for the expansion that is it, no micro-transactions. Great representation of what a game app should be, something I am happy to support.",
        "The game is fun at first but it gets hard i cant win any other planets. I really really wanted to play infinite mode but sadly it needs money to unlock and im poor so i cant pay to get it :( also it sometimes the game freezes when i upgrade something and it the screen hangs. Please please please make infinite mode available free!!!!!!!",
        "I like the game but I don't like that you have to buy the unlimited mode and i don't like that the time is limited. I thought I found a game I would love but then it said the \"end game is here.\""

Challenging but not so much that you can't enjoy it. I've been a fan of Gobit for years and years...you guys are the best! Thank you for putting BS2 out on Android mobile...Bee boo beep!!! Kristen C.",
        "I always liked games like this, now that this has different foods, makes it more interesting to play. I don't mind the ads, as long as I can play the game. I will however continue to play until I can get the full version which will be soon. Staying on my phone.",
        "I have played the first game 'burger shop' long time ago using my PC.. And i love it (thankfully, i found the game here in playstore-while playing the game it bring back old memories 😊)  so I am super excited when I bump into the 2nd version.. So far I am in love with the game, still keeping the same format from the original one but adding new food choice and new customer.. Thanks to the developer.. I am really hoping if you guys can come up with the 3rd..",
        "DIDN'T THINK IT COULD GET BETTER!!!! Thought nothing would beat burger shop one.... So wrong. I started this and completed all of story mode with three stars in a couple of hours. ADDICTED!!! Going to complete the rest!",
        "I love this game. It's a great time killer. The only feature I don't really care for is the flicking feature because I can click something to grab it but it flicks it instead and does things I don't want to but other than that, it's great.",
        "This was my favorite game on the pc. I literally have played this thru so many times and never got bored. So happy to play on my tab. Bring on burger shop 3 please!"

Watch your hops and make sure you time your landings right. If you miss the landing you can go from holding a large lead to struggling to get up the next hill...I highly recommend this game!",
        "Amazing game!! I have purchased 1 or 2 bikes already, I would even pay to get new bikes, but it is very expensive. Please consider lowering to prices or making better bikes more accessible. Ive been stuck on the same level for 5 weeks. I want to continue playing but im loosing intrest not being able to advance. Maybe you could trade your old bikes in to get something in return for a newer bike. Im sure you will never read this, but you do have something special here! Thanks",
        "Very fun BMX pump game. Seen a few reviews say it's gets impossible after level 3 when it becomes pay to win. I don't agree I've just reached level 8 in a few hours. If you ride bikes off road and understand how to pump you'll love it",
        "Its way to hard to win and and the stats do nothing.  You have to be perfect and even then they fly by.  Still LOVE this game.  Just takes away the fun when you get left in the dust and you play the same lvl a million times hoping maybe one time you will be perfect.",
        "I loved this game for 3 days. Then it got to the point where I couldn't beat a level without upgrading my bike, but I couldn't upgrade my bike without spending real money. So disappointing. Don't waste your time if you don't want to spend real money!",
        "The game is fun up until around the third level. After that it becomes near impossible to win any races without spending actual money to upgrade your bike. Had a lot of fun with it up until that point, but it's definitely not worth spending actual money on. Deleted the game after pay to win clearly became a necessity."

        "This is an extremely fun game. O have a few suggestions on how to fix things on the game. I noticed three things while playing this game. 1. There is not a continue playing option. This can easily be fixed and with all of the great work from Dvloper I think that this is not too far away. 2. I noticed you can uncrouch in the tunnel in the basement even though you are not all the way through. 3. Everything is in a certain place. If one object is in a certain place then if you are familiar with the game enough you will know where the other objects are. To be honest this is not a minor concern but still could be fixed. Other than that I can't stop playing! Thank you so much!!",
        "It's a vary good game so hood i can't believe it's on mobile game! Also the game mechanics are so amazing as well. Then there's series of things you have to do that keeps you in the game for a long time; the theme and music fit the atmosphere, and there's not much of a problem with the game either. \"This game gives me goosebumps!\" (From Dashigames aka Dachi) he loves it as well too. #goodgamemakemore",
        "I love this game, especially when you hide just in time and there's that tense moment wondering if she saw you. I get chills down my spine when I'm hiding and I hear her saying \"I see you\". If I could, I would give this game 100 stars. I would suggest having a mode after you beat Granny to become Granny because I think it would be cool to chase the player around the house. Also, I think the game would benefit from a much bigger house, more drawers and of course, more locks. Love the game, keep up the good work.",
        "It's really really really fun game.  But I think if you guys do some more improvements so it will be much fun.  Here's what I think:  1. I think you should make the house much bigger.  2. You should add more enemies for example:  child o' slenderina,  slenderman and the spiders.  3. You should add an Adventure mode.  Where you need to find some books or something like an emblem like that stuff to make them uncursed like that.  4. Last but not least, you should add more weapons for example:  Pistol,  sword,  injection etc.    If you do that,  it will be super cool and fun.   ThanQ 😃👍",
        "It's definatly one of the better (more fun) horror games on the store, but I feel like there could be some more improvements. Firstly I think that if you've completed hard than there should be an (almost) impossible mode. Also minor details such as different textures and Easter eggs would be good. Last, I think that when you escape there should be an outside section where it's still got puzzles but it's more about the atmosphere. (Maybe that could just be for the \"impossible mode\") but it would make the game a lot more enjoyable. Also maybe a reward for escaping. (For incentive). Thank you and maybe you could take this into consideration :) also new app icon plz",
        "Who doesn't love this game? It's bone chilling and exciting for the whole family (Litterally my whole fam plays this game) it would be cool to have a mode where there was no granny just to explore the house and get a feel for how to escape. Also some weapons to attack granny. Lastly a map of where granny is would be super cool. Good luck!"

        "Would have given 5 stars; I love the gameplay. However it only gets 1 star because it's incredibly hard to play with adverts coming up everywhere. Too many adverts, spoils game play.... simply have the 1 advert at the bottom and don't inturupt game play!! ALSO, I couldn't press the back button to get out of the game, even with several pressed. I had to quit out and close the app manually.",
        "I paid to get ad free.....STILL HAVE ADS! I like the game a lot. But if you have a button that gives you the option to pay for NO ADS, then you should get what you PAID for. The game itself is a lot of fun. I enjoy it a lot and its great time killer. But NOT getting what I PAID FOR does not make me a happy customer. This issue needs to be addressed and fixed.",
        "Just listen to all of the reviewers and don't download this app! I got about thirty seconds of game-play, then an ad popped up. The ad lasted about a minute, and after that, my phone started glitching out.",
        "Gravity is meant to work like gravity. The \"alien\" isn't the centre of gravity. It's meant to fall SIDEWAYS not directly AT YOU. I would understand if you were playing as a planet traversing through space, but you're not. This game is ass.",
        "I 9/10 love this companies games however this game has Flaws. You will have nothing that hits the bottom and it will say game over. I am not happy with it ! The ads literally make you click on it and then take you to Google Play store to download it which is very annoying. I would not download it not a good one.",
        "Uninstalled after playing for 2 minutes. Reason? 1 minute 30 second was ads, 30 seconds actual gameplay. YOU CANT PUT AN AD EVERY TIME YOU FAIL IN A GAME YOU MIGHT MAKE A MISTAKE A FEW SECONDS IN LIKE THIS! For goodness sakes, be reasonable! I won't download anything from you again, I hate developers like you, you are just milking as much money as you can from people."

        "Love the game. It's fun and interactive but have only hit bonuses and free spins on the first game. Been playing for awhile now and not once did I hit the Wheel of Riches or What's in the box. It's bit deceiving that you have to increase your bet to activate the Wheel of Riches or What's in the Box when it rarely or never hits. At least allow those to hit once every thousand spins or something.",
        "This game is awesome. Love the graphics, sounds, and games. Makes me smile everytime Ellen talks. Silly I know but I absolutely love Ellen and this game is amazing. My 3yo son loves taking turns with mommy and we absolutely love the bonus games! He laughs and gets excited everytime we win!!! I wish I could give it a million stars!!!! HEY ELLEN MAKE A KIDS LEARNING GAME TOO PLEASE!!!! but seriously this game is relaxing and fun! If you haven't downloaded it yet, DO IT!!!!! ♡♡♡",
        "My mom loved you so much. She passed away Dec. 18th. She would've loved this game you have. I play in honor of her memory and well, i love you to. Been a fan since before your johnny carson appearance. Wish i could go to your show and play a game for the fun of it and to meet you. Sincerely, Tim Simpson",
        "Ellen, love the candles that light up to spell your name. Clever. The reels in your games are Hurkey jerkey. Smooth is better. Solo, where is the box in What's in the Box? Where is the reel in wheel to riches? Your pay outs are much better on max bet. Took me a while to get to 100M. Keep up the creative good work.",
        "I keep watching the ads to get extra coins and none of them get awarded. I never get the wheel of riches or multijackpots or what's in the box no matter how high I play. I've played SO MANY times on the #Imatellen one and the heart emoji is as big as it gets but I've never gotten the bonus game. These glitches are ridiculously frustrating. Honestly if they don't get fixed soon I'm just gonna delete and find a different casino app.",
        "This game is so great. I play it in my free time. Not normally a slots can but this one is so much fun. The fact that you start out with 5,000,000 dollars is awesome to me. If only those were real winnings hah !"

        "Addictive!!! The characters have so much PERSONALITY. The graphics are awesome. I like playing with Chumbot Ogie!! . It's like playing with a real person. Alot of FUN! I decided to purchase the game and get rid of the Ads. Well worth it!! This is the best word game out there!! I love watching the characters go into the store to shop and when they come out they have on different costumes. Some are so funny. I just sit watch them come out sometimes. One about every 15 seconds or so. I crack up, HILARIOUS! Better than plain Scrabble. Love, love, love IT! Please, don't change anything and mess it up.",
        "Great fun, very challenging & a sleek new design.  It's different to Scrabble or WWF in a good way. You can quickly see if you've made a word, plus you get extra points for long words. Lots of players, so you never go short of a game, & now there's a quick play mode too.",
        "I am giving one star because I thought this was a game that went at my own pace. I have a busy life so I thought that was perfect. But today I opened the app and 3 of the current games I was playing and in the lead I might add said I lost and the game just ended for no reason🤷\u200d♀️😠😩 I don't understand why. I am so upset about this I dont even want to play anymore😡 It's going to go on my game record and it isn't fair😒😒",
        "The new update, where you get ads that blare at you for 5 sec before you can close them? Not cool.  Update... they are gone!! Thx!!  I have another request - is it possible to keep track of the number of times someone scores a 7 letter bingo, or a best word?  I would love to see those numbers in my dashboard too! Thx.",
        "The items to accessorize seriously needs to be updated, which would only make me spend more. All of the knightly garb is not that interesting for everyone. The hair choices are clearly geared for white people, and more food  needs to be offered (mexican, asian, african, etc) because  I love to change all of the time. Lastly, we should be able to sort and organize our accessories so they are easier to see and select - like a real closet!",
        "This game is great,  especially if you aren't so good at making words because it helps by highlighting and using the stars. The only thing I would change is to make a version where the boards are random. Scatter the bonus tiles around to make it a little more interesting."

        "It is fun to play. The first games I played when I got a computer, were solitaire games. I still like them better than ANY of the other games I've played. I will be adding this one to that group. I like games that make you \"think\" rather than \"time you\" and you have to hurry. They make me too anxious. This game works for me. Thank you.",
        "I wish i knew if all games were solvable.  I like to play winning games and replay the deal until i can figure it out.  As it stands, i cannot tell if it is a winning hand so i move on if i lose more than a few times in a row on a single hand.",
        "There is absolutely nothing new about this game except that you slapped the name \"Crown\" over Tri-peaks and called it a \"new strategy game\". I was really hoping for a solitaire game I hadn't played before. I'm extremely disappointed. I'm a HUGE fan of your regular solitaire game. Huge fan. But the name and description are misleading and it's embarrassing.",
        "I really enjoy the game, EXCEPT for the fact that there seems to be no way to turn off the ad sounds. Even setting my phone to mute won't mute the ads. It's intrusive and annoying, especially in a public place.",
        "You have the best solitaire games by far, I have almost all of them and I love everything about them!   Only one complaint on your solitaire and spider controls-----thev are not stationary (stationery) l.    Thanks. People love you!",
        "Another great Mobilityware game.  My only objection is that they didn't use the same familiar controls from their other cars games.  I don't like these, particularly since I'm used to the originals."

There should be and online multiplayer race mode and the mountains just endless also the rocks on the mountain should have a chance to swap places and stuff like that after a few falls also a easy one add in some funny cool looking skins for the hiker and maybe a tool upgrade system and how to get these is u get rock points which u get a few every time a certain hight is reached",

Once i got a 15 second ad, but the skip time stayed constant and i had to watch the entire thing. The game also bugs you constantly about connecting your facebook account. So if you want to be able to play without interruptions constantly, you need to pay and connect to a facebook account.",
        "Brilliant, innovative, addictive game BUT please reduce the number of ads. That's why this game is only averaging  3.5* and why I can only give it 4*. People will stop playing very quickly as it currently is. Just take it down to an ad break every end of run. Also a way to easily view all positions on the leader board would be nice. Otherwise the game itself is great.",
        "I would have bought the ad free Version eventually, but it was so annoying even to get used to the game, that I gave up. If you want more people to buy the game you have to give them the opportunity to play without being interrupted every death. Your game can be the best ever but still no one will play it if they have to invest the same time in watching ads that they invest in playing the game.",
        "Too many ads with a skip button that reduces ad time by 10 seconds. Literally, f off, dude. Can't play your game, I play for a minute and than watch an ad for half of that time. Unfair and boring. You almost don't get to play the game. Which is, btw, awesome",
        "Visually satisfying, nice, fitting soundtrack and pretty innovative. One thing is that it's extremely packed with ads. One every round you play. Maybe dial it down a little?  Also, maybe add tail patterns...",

        "Absolutely love this game. The graphics are gorgeous and the beautiful colors are the main attraction. The gameplay is smooth and the system is easy to understand. Only hindrance would be to those that want to sit down and chug through the game. Simply put, you can't, unless you but in game credits. You'll generally be limited to a few puzzles a day or a good puzzle here and there to eat up the occasional time. It's a calm inducing, fun puzzle game with filled with gorgeous hues through and through",
        "I really enjoy the game, but the monetization method behind it sucks the fun out of it: unless you continuously spend money on in-game credits, you are limited to a few puzzles per day. I would gladly buy this game for, say, $5 if it meant I could play however many levels I wanted, whenever I wanted. Otherwise, a great game, very relaxing and therapeutic. Until the monetization method changes: 3 stars rather than 5.",
        "Edit: changed my rating as I've watched the same ad twice now and it won't update my prisms. Can't be the internet connection as the whole ad shows without interruption! Really enjoy the game and the colours and graffixs are great but the ads after every game are super annoying! If I want more credits I'll watch an ad or at most every 3 games to keep the app free.",
        "I absolutely love this game. Completed all the levels for a few months now and am eagerly awaiting new puzzles! It really allows me to relax but challenge my mind at the same time. :D This game is one of the best colour puzzle games so far when compared to other games such as Blendoku and Color Puzzle. The only thing missing is really just not having enough levels to play.",
        "As many have said this game is relaxing, challenging without being frustrating and its graduated colors are very appeasing to the eye. I do wish I could save the 'puzzle' after its complete without having a heart in it. And even though I mainly play as a relaxing passtime the competitor in me wishes for some stats that rank my ability a little more indepth then 'you did better then the world average' ...  All in all this is well worth the download. Thank you Zut!",
        "I love hue is a simple puzzle game that is relaxing and entertaining. Good for helping me to wind down and chill out. As much as people complain about in game currency, the game is free and i cant fault the method of watching a 30 second ad to be able to play 4 more levels of the game. The developers have to make their money one way or another and its not like the game pops up with ads after every level or bombards you with content you absolutely have to pay for. I think this is probably one of the best puzzle game apps on the play store. 5/5 stars for sure"

        "Mars: Mars is a very fun game in which you take platforming and collectables to the next level. The game takes you a thrilling adventure, and although the object stays the same I find myself never growing bored. The way that each new character changes the level is just awesome. Each character is well thought out and designed amazingly. If you're looking for a game to pull out in a waiting room, or while you're bored - then give this game a shot. You definitely won't regret it.",
        "It's definitely a fun game. But I cannot figure out where the in app purchases are! I looked everywhere within the app and there is absolutely no place where I can find in app purchases!! But play store says that this game supports in app purchases. So I'm very confused! Can someone please help me out here??",
        "Its awesomr and makes the time go by so quickly. The tiniest problem is that the gas is too little, but thats the point of the game!",
        "This game has so much potential... I started playing and immediately enjoyed it, they've got the game mechanics perfect, everything is easy to get into and the core gameplay is pretty fun. But simple. This usually isn't a problem because game designers usually build complexity ont on top of simple mechanics. Not these guys. The vast majority of jumping platforms, which is all this game is, are incredibly easy to do once you get the hang of it. And that's it. The game doesn't progress at all. It never gets harder. There are some trees and eventually a couple black holes to avoid. Like I mean 3 in the first 100 platforms. Then after platform 100 and something they introduce this drum symbol thing that you can bounce off of. Do they design jumps that implement these bouncy things in a fun and exciting way? Nope. You just go around them. I made it to platform 200 before I finally gave up. This is just lazy game developing.",
        "A great game for relaxing and honing your jetpack skills. It becomes a little boring after a while though, seeing as it's primarily the same activity over and over again. Otherwise perfect =]",
        "Such a great, simple, enjoyable game. I love the visual effects, the art team did a great job. Sound design is great too. I agree that the game is easy once you get a hang of it, but so are games like agario or *cough cough* all of ketchapp *cough cough*  Honestly the devs did excellent, even with ad implementation, all around 10/10 game"

        "I can't understand how the controls work when I try to go down or up it's so delayed I end up not getting the thing I wanted by the time in does it. fix that and it would be a very fun and popular game but until then the controls are so messed up it's practically unplayable.",
        "It's like this game was made just for me.  I love everything about it.  I hope for future upgrades to keep the game fun and engaging.  The magnet tail needs to be improved a bit, so that the meat doest drag behind.  Also a change of scenery could be cool.",
        "Ads don't work (it always thinks I'm at the 20 day limit) so making any progress in the game is impossible. It's just a grind without any payoff. Really boring.",
        "My only issue right now is I can no longer watch the ads for extras. Every time I try, it just tells me they will refresh in 24 hours.",
        "Fuuuuuuuun! Silly timekiller and a solid game. Ads are not intrusive.",
        "Sometimes there obstacles that I have no choice  but to receive damage the question is what causes less damage like that's not fair. Or when the tank comes. Before it comes it shoots a missle how am I supposed to predict where the missle is going to be at if it gets fired before I can even see the tank. And several other things I would love to point out but I'm sure I can only type so many characters. I genuinely like playing this game a few fixes can make it more enjoyable instead of me getting frusterared. Another small suggestion the magnetic tail is a waste the way it is. Mainly the meat gets dragged around and gets left behind. Maby make it to where with each upgrade it increases the circumference of its pull and actually pulls them to you instead of dragging and leaving behind. Any ways of you would like to hear more ideas let me know. Also I'm just going out on a hunch whoever made this game is not the one fixing it. Game create out creating games and intern or whatever is the one doing the \"pollishing\" to the game and is making it worse. So someone who knows what they are doing needs to be doing the corrections not some dumbass you found down the road if that's the case. Everyone should see the difference in the signature and everyone has a unique signature aka trade mark."

        "The stories are really interesting and it is hard to out down the phone once you got into one of the story. 😂😂 Although I really do wish that it is more easier to get the diamond but overall I totally recommend it!!  Keep it up the good work!  😊",
        "I loved it so much😍😍",
        "Can anyone tell me what SNS is?",
        "Well this is a surprise. It does not have much story yet but a good read if you've every played pixel berry's \"choices\" game. Same concept which means choices are going to need diamonds. Meaning you need to pay to do them. I really find it a nice read but since the books are few i'm on hold on purchasing diamonds. I guess once a series is completed i'm willing to buy diamonds to replay that game. For now i'm just browsing the game and taking notes on how many diamonds are going to cost per book.",
        "This game is amazing! The graphic is pretty great, plus the story is super ADDICTIVE. I can't stop reading this story but because of I have no pass left. However the problem is the pass, the pass is too little and the time is pretty long to wait. I hope this app would give much pass and please make the time shorter. But still this game is awesome, I recommend this game for you. You should download this app and try it."

        "Love it. Been playing for over a year. You can earn gems slowly to get premium characters or spend money to get them. However you do not need premium characters to play the game. I think people forget that your \"FREE\" games have to make money some how to pay developers, animators, IT support and more. Either they have dozens of ads everyday (DK has a few but not dozens) or premium paid content.",
        "Most addictive game! Playing it since it 1st started. Love the new mystery event it's so adorable except your missing one vital character!!  I think there's a couple points to improve on... the send home button in the characters actions list I think should be up the top and smaller instead of scrolling down for it cos I use it often. 2nd all of the sounds in my game are very poor, it's nearly always silent and music is always late. Haven't heard the high 5 sound in ages 😔 please fix the sound!",
        "The game is fun and all, but do you think you guys could get this game optimized for the Lenovo tablets? I had to get a new tablet since previous one broke. Now the game keeps closing out on me when I'm trying to do something. Think you guys can fix this somehow?  I'd appreciate it if you do. Thanks in advance.",
        "This game has given me nothing but problems. Every update has to have a glitch. First there was a problem when ever I tried to open a chest. Then an update came and After that update now the consetion stands close out the game anytime I want to view. Now with winnie the poo update the whole dam game is slow. Seriously thinking of quiting. It doesn't matter every update has a glitch. Can't u guys fix it? Or is just me?",
        "This is a fun game. Graphics are so very Disney.  I have a question.. WHAT is the reason for the guests to have a character over their head? That is quite distracting..especially when I don't know what their purpose is.  Also..I wish their leveling up and their quests weren't so long..I only get to play about 5 minutes. But I do love the game",
        "This game is amazing! I love it so much! It just reminds me of my childhood, and of all of the TV shows I used to watch. I have only 1 problem with this game, it does not count time when you go out of the game or close your phone. It might just be me, but if it wasn't for the bad saving, I would have given this game 5 stars, since it deserves it, or even more."

They should have ways to earn more tickets, and give you at least 5 tickets. Lol ...I thought the characters talked, but they don't. So that'll be a fun if they add that in. I've been play bad boys and I like it.",

        "I think that if u like drama u should get this app. I've always loved this app I always get upset when I loose the ticket thingys cuz I'm at a good part of the story lol 😂 but ya I give it a 5 stars. I LOVE IT 💕",
        "Its great but should include more stories that you get to not only customize your character but also choose your romances, career, Paths. And so much more but overall the app is great",
        "I can't see my full screen! I cannot even see one word our my character in the story! I see one little fragment of the game! This game is a horrible game! I would be nice if I could actully see the game!"
