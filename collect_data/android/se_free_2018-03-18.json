        "Love it. Been playing for over a year. You can earn gems slowly to get premium characters or spend money to get them. However you do not need premium characters to play the game. I think people forget that your \"FREE\" games have to make money some how to pay developers, animators, IT support and more. Either they have dozens of ads everyday (DK has a few but not dozens) or premium paid content.",
        "Most addictive game! Playing it since it 1st started. Love the new mystery event it's so adorable except your missing one vital character!!  I think there's a couple points to improve on... the send home button in the characters actions list I think should be up the top and smaller instead of scrolling down for it cos I use it often. 2nd all of the sounds in my game are very poor, it's nearly always silent and music is always late. Haven't heard the high 5 sound in ages 😔 please fix the sound!",
        "This game is amazing! I love it so much! It just reminds me of my childhood, and of all of the TV shows I used to watch. I have only 1 problem with this game, it does not count time when you go out of the game or close your phone. It might just be me, but if it wasn't for the bad saving, I would have given this game 5 stars, since it deserves it, or even more.",
        "The game is fun and all, but do you think you guys could get this game optimized for the Lenovo tablets? I had to get a new tablet since previous one broke. Now the game keeps closing out on me when I'm trying to do something. Think you guys can fix this somehow?  I'd appreciate it if you do. Thanks in advance.",
        "Fantastic graphics, great controls, overall great game.  Recommended to my friends child.  Some tasks  (i.e., leveling up a character, waiting to clearing a curse, waiting to open a chest...) take too long and their is nothing to do while you wait.  Game has improved tremendously! Love the game, won't stop playing. Thank you Disney!",
        "This game has given me nothing but problems. Every update has to have a glitch. First there was a problem when ever I tried to open a chest. Then an update came and After that update now the consetion stands close out the game anytime I want to view. Now with winnie the poo update the whole dam game is slow. Seriously thinking of quiting. It doesn't matter every update has a glitch. Can't u guys fix it? Or is just me?"

        "Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!",
        "Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm's Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!",
        "Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I'm just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it's going to be good.  We'll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!",
        "This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10",
        "I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.",
        "I've been playing this game since the last lvl was ToE. First time when i was surprised was an update with three or four new maps, also demon levels, but that was actually nothing, i felt at this moment ''Wow, update, ok''. I got more admired by new update with this walking thing, still dunno the name, but things they have added, i still love it. Animated trails, new wallpapers that was awesome. New updates have arrived in mini-games for free, also awesome, but now i guess they have no idea what to add, because what they've done this is the biggest and greatest update. I love this game so much, so i can't just put 4 or less. Gg RobTop, Gg."

And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions.

Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!",
        "I LOVE this app! And I'm so glad it's free! Everyone is like 'it's the same thing over and over again' but they're not actually getting into this game. They're are tons of different options to choose from and like Toca Boca says cook it your way. I LOVE TOCA BOCA!!!",
        "I'm giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won't make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least"

        "Dont get it it kuses",
        "This game is awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
        "I love the game sooooooo much ❤❤ its just some stories say u need soooo many diamonds to get it! Y cant it just be free for it? X also when u customize your character i would like there to be makeup and able to choose your clothes! The options are amazinggg! ❤❤ i hate having to use wifi as well xx love the game loads! Your amazing! ❤❤ please please please add these things i like xx ❤❤😉😁",
        "I love this game and I have been playing for years. Now I've decided to create stories as well but I'm not a laptop person for I prefer using my phone. I would appreciate it if there was more background options like allowing me to upload my own background and more emotion options in the mobile version of create a story. Please make that happen and keep up the good work!",
        "My only complaint would be the gem choices. Although the app allows you to earn gems by reading episode official stories, most choices cost 15-20 gems. You would have to read an entire story (sometimes more) to gain the ability to get ONE gem option, and most stories have multiple gem instances. Other than that, the game is addicting. I would enjoy it much more of the gem costs were more reasonable (5 gems), or if you could earn gems by reading user stories too."

        "I love this game especially play when I have alot on my mind and need a distraction. Outs addictive and they are reasonable with purchasing extra anything. They give daily prizesand makes thou wsnt to come back. It can be frustratingly challenging and that is a hood thing.. thank you creators.",
        "Ok new review, I've passed all 1740 levels would have given 5 stars but the upper levels can only be passed when you hit the right program! Play same level 20-30+ times then suddenly pass with 10-15 moves left!!! Not fun anymore!!! Uninstalled",
        "This game was my favorite, however the lack of being able to reset the game is truly sad 😢 and takes away from my joy of the game! Please give the option for us to reset our play easily, please 💕",
        "Can you sponsor a video for me? I've introduced this game to several people and I have yet to hear it be exposed on youtube. As a creator I can give the game the exposure it deserves.",
        "The recent changes to the game bother me, you can no longer see how many points you get as you go or when you fail. Now it seems that they limit the amount of points you can get at the end for the moves you have left. The only time you see points is the total at the very end. Seems like they're screwing the people who want to get 3 stars on the levels...",
        "I enjoyed playing this game but I was to reset game to beginning.Tried clearing data and cache but didn't work.E-mailed developers to ask them and they e-mailed back saying they would but only once which I am still waiting for them to do.What is the big deal about wanting to start over the game again?Better that than once getting to levels you can't do to not play game again surely!!!!"

Another Thing is the name your child gets when your child is born in korea but you are from another country, the kid gets your name instead of your surname as his/her surname",
        "I love it! The only thing I would say is to let is have the option to transition without being diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Or at least give us an option on the action board(with the profile of our person) with the option to identify as a transgender at schooling age of 6 or 5. Also, can we have the option to go to early schooling from 2 years? Some people do this. I love this game! It's very interesting and fun.",
        "After so long Google will actually let me review this now! I absolutely guarantee you will have fun with this game. There's so many choices that affect your life, you can be so many different things, and no life is like the other. If you're looking for a quick life simulator game to pass the time, or just play any time at all, this is the game for you.(P.S if you want to transition, you need to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Very rare.)",
        "Overall Its time killing for me, and, just some advice, we should have a Save state, because im kinda upset like.. i have played these game for 3 hour to age of 60 and retire and having a 7/8 mansion bedroom but i accidentally clicked back and then its started over again.. I wanted to see ma kids grow lol, but then i clicked it :(",
        "I love this game and it leaves a lot to your imagination. I do have a few things I would really love to see in this game. I would love for there to be 5 bedroom houses. 4 bedroom houses just aren't big enough sometimes and mansions cost WAY to much even if you're making over 100k a year. Also if you can control your children as well as make suggestions to your spouse to get a job, work out, ect. Would be amazing.  I would love to be able to have little grand babies on the game as well as step children. Even though this last one is a small request I would love to have my children in order by age if I adopt an older child then the children I already have without them being at the bottom of the list. It already states that they are adopted in their details tab so they shouldn't have to be at the bottom.",
        "Great fun little life simulation with a lot of potential. Their need to be more career paths other than work, painting, music or ceo. I want to be an athlete, a career criminal, drug runner, politician etc. And the UI needs to be cleaned up. There's no reason why clubbing and holidays shouldn't be under leisure."

        "Well I think you need better graphics and I don't like how it is slow when you turn. Plus it has TOO MANY ADS! I just started playing this game! The pictures showing the terrains is probably copied off of MCPE's pictures (I am not saying it is! But it might be). I really like this game I really do but there needs to be some changes. People aren't going to like this game if there isn't some changes. I just read a comment saying this game is \"gay\". That was incredibly rude. People shouldn't call it \"dumb\" or \"gay\" just because this game needs better graphics or it has to many ads. Does anyone even know the definition of \"gay\"? There is two meanings for it but they both mean your happy! Stop calling the game names! It is not necessary to!",
        "I love this game, it's sooooo fun but my only problem is the ads. It was fine when I first downloaded it, there were no ads but after I upgrade the game, all of a sudden there's ads every second. If you can get rid of the ads, I would greatly appreciate it",
        "There's so many things wrong with this I don't even know where to start. First off your in a confined space and if you go so far you just hit a blue wall. If in was infinitely generated and you could go farther it might be better. Second its kind of slow when moving. Third since the whole confined space thing you have each different biome all pushed together so when you walk two steps your in a different biome and its small. So you extremely need to make it better.",
        "So, the game itself is incredibly enjoyable and fun. Sometimes the controls get me here and there, but I'm sure, with time, I'd get use to it. The thing is, THERE IS NO TIME. Literally every minute, I get a thirty second ad. I'm just here building my home and making foundation when all of a sudden, an ad pops up. I say, \"oh okay, it's just one, whatevs.\" WRONG. It is now ten, just over the past 5 minutes. This game has serious potential, if only it'd let us play the game and cut out the ads. I'm spending more time watching ads rather than using time to efficiently play the game. It irks me, so I uninstalled the ap. It really is a good game, just lower the ads from 2 per minute, kay?",

For the rest I find the game great and super fun to play, although I'd hope to see newer, cooler and more expensive cars.

When you go to global storage and find an item that you really need, by the time that you get there, it's already sold! 😠 Also, it takes 3 different items, and you have 3 of one item and 24 of another. Really? Also, it should be that you get needed items more often, randomly rather than at specific times. Other than that, a good game.",
        "Like the competition challenges it holds your attention. the time frames of production are a little long however the markets move products fast. I also like the club wars and the mayors challenges. My dislike is there are not enough thought bubbles in the fact that you only get two the rewards should be more frequently.",
        "The new arenas for war are terrible... There is a massive lag time... I can't even get to the war after rebuilding until the game thinks for approximately 45 seconds... By the time I actually get one shot off it's a minute and a half... Then I'm almost dead and you come back with I'm sorry we're experiencing connectivity issues get it fixed please!"

        "Hey... I would give this game 5 stars but there is 1 main -VE POINT. FUEL takes TOOOOOOOO LONG TO RECHARGE.  The point of this game is to playyyyyy the game. I don't want to keep waiting. I downloaded your great game TO PLAY it. Please try to solve this issue. I will definitely give you 5 stars if you fix this. Please listen to us and read our comments. Most of us are mentioning this 1 -ve point. Thank you",
        "Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it's only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that's bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it's a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I'll rate 5 star$",
        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn't really feel like you're getting anywhere.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "It shouldn't be easier to level up rather than actually playing game. I wouldn't say that the gameplay is difficult to play, but the purposefully placed trucks that shoot you is a bit ridiculous. Other cars are in the way which ultimately eliminates you before you can attack the shooting trucks. There really is no challenge except trying to beat your previous score. I give this game an eh out eh."

BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it's not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It's just not fair.",
        "A lot of Numberlink programs have \"fake\" puzzles - they have multiple solutions unless additional non-standard \"rules\" are followed... which are NEVER fun. This app doesn't do that. These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.",
        "I loved flow free from a young age. I've played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I've tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs",
        "Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.",

The original starts to get boring after awhile, but with all the different variations they come out with, it never gets old. A very fresh experience with one of the recent updates, feels much more refined when compared to the one I used to play.",
        "Simple yet clever, Free Flow is about connecting brightly colored dots together without crossing the lines. With an abundance of board shape, size, variety, and difficulty, there's something in free play to challenge nearly everybody. Those who find even the largest puzzles too easy may alternatively challenge themselves in time trials to finish the boards as quickly as possible."

I'll give 5 stars if 5 theres improvement. Thanks!",

The only reason this game has so many player is the game size & device compatibility. If your phone is capable of playing \"the famous 3v3 moba\", you'd better play that game",

But please don't  let me team up with low level players it's affecting my game and stats when I'm trying my best to carry they would just afk which can be frustrating. But overall it's a good game",
        "I hv been playing this game for two years alll good perfect game perfect graphics..bt there should be some changes for the afk players... strict steps should be taken towards for these afk players not bye lowering credit score by banning from game for a period of time so that they won't be spoiling game any further",
        "I love the game and everything about it, but however there is a issue which I get reported for and lose credit because of it.   The game client keeps restarting itself whenever I find a match, leaving other players to report me thinking i'm AFK or DC'D  I've gotten alot of Penalty messages and lost credit because of it, I also can't play a single game because the client keeps restarting!

Because we have to waiting for it to be downloaded before can play again. Can we choose to update whenever we want?  Anyway, this is a really nice game and I've been playing it for a long time. Keep up the good work!",
        "I love the game. There's nothing wrong with it because I feel like it's the old game that I grew up with. But what I hate is that the prices for packs, lp, sp and simoleons went high. The prices before was okay but now I don't think I will spend anymore for packs that give only like 5vip points. Such a fun game but aimes for large microtransactions.",
        "I really enjoy this game, and love developing my Sim's homes and the world. Unfortunately, my game won't open. It hasn't for about a month now, even after this new update. It shows me the loading screen for five minutes, then crashes. It would be wonderful if there could be a fix for this.",
        "Love love love it! This game is actually better than The Sims Mobile... 2 problems,, 1st. The Modern houses with second floor, so expensive😭! 2nd. The time it sometimes takes ages just for one activity!😐 but hey, everything else.. TOTALY AWSOME! 😍 thanks so much for creating this game. Cuz its so hard to download the sims 4 in a Mobile. 💕",
        "This is actually cool and I really love this game. However, the expiration of most of the quest that i'm having are only 2 days to finish. I think it's unfair, and the materials needed are too expensive. Sims are busy on finishing tasks so they won't be able to go to work and earn. So I'm not totally enjoying the game.",
        "When you get an event sometimes it only lasts for like 2 days which really isn't enough because some actions take 1 day. Please extend event times and don't give like 5 events at the same time. Also you should be able to log in other ways apart from Facebook because lots of people don't have Facebook. Please make other ways for us to login  so we can get more neighbours."

Which is fine I just have to wait. But now my issue is that the actual levels for the wedding event, and the normal quest, it kicks me out of the app and it does thatt every time. Please fix this issue. Maybe then Ill give it five stars.",
        "Great addictive game! Starts out cute and innocent. Recently found out through a spoiler thread that it does take a darker turn in Ch 15. The U.S. servers are currently only on Ch 12. Still a great addicting game that many players start out thinking \"Awesome! A great game that I don't I can have the option to play for free!\" Soon they cave when that ONE outfit comes along that they HAVE TO HAVE lol.",
        "I love this game! It's really good for creative people who like to design their own outfits. I just downloaded on my new phone and started over (I don't have Facebook to link my progress with). Please make it available to link with Google play so I don't always lose progress!   Also, since downloading again, I found that some of the names are different... I was very confused, since the voice over still says the old names. I like Yoko way better than Bobo!!",
        "I loved this game, and am V8. So its not like I am against paying. I am against the ranking event especially since you devs LIED TO YOUR PLAYERS and said we wont be getting one again. We will not pay 100s for a non guarenteed reward. It would be more HONEST, if you set up the suits as 300 USD each recharge.  If you are smart at all, devs you should understand that business ethics is just as important as profit and will benefit everyone in the long run.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events."

More lessons would be nice as compleated all of them already more cars and possibly a bike would not go a miss. Like the free ride option allot Barry minor glitches to sort out but other than than that keep it up excellent game well done. But please sort out little problems. Thanks.",
        "I like the game but when you are driving in the slopes/hills it's really hard to turn and then you have too watch a ad to undo it.At Every time you turn on the hill you go on the other side and get points taken off you for crossing the line so could you improve the game by NOT taking points off when you turn on a hill and can it PLEASE not be constanly raining because you the driver in the game have too keep on turning the wipers on and off. (Also sorry for long review and i wasn't shouting just making the point clearer)",
        "Im having troubles with the canada map i go straight when it says straight and it says i had an error of blinker usage or ill turn with the blinker on and it says error as well so im confused another thing is i wish the camera wasnt so easy to move. One more thing is in real life i know i should put on a blinker when changing lanes but i cant tell if your game does that or not sorry for tge long review i hope it helps tho",
        "It has very good graphics, controls, and it's a very addicting game. On of the best driving games I have played. But there is a problem with the Canada map. Cuz I see cars go straight through red lights and when I turn it says that I didn't use the correct blinker when I know I did. But other than that I think it's a great game. I hope they can fix the Canada map for me.",
        "It doesnt work. Tries to load I see a car and a stop sign I see it loads me google account then it just closes the app kicking me back to home screen. I have a samsung galaxy s3 yeah its old however I do play gta san andreas on it I should be able to play this.",
        "The game would get a much higher rating if it didnt penalize after each stoplight. It wants you to turn your blinker on at each light regardless if you switch lanes."

FreeFire Battlegrounds is x50 times better and more simply. Go and die in a hole developers.",
        "It has a lot of bugs, but it's a fun game. It has a lot of potential, if you decide to keep on working on it. One major bug that i've noticed is ITEM DOESN'T EXIST. For instance i saw a Scar laying down on the gorund in Military base and when i tried to pick it up it said \"item doesn't exist\". Fix this please, otherwise, a decent game.",
        "Everything is well put together tmain thing I love is that each area is different from on another like at the school ive had alot of vertical fire fights or power plant or the supermarket. But one thing I think u guys forgot is that the ump 45 takes .45 acp rounds",
        "Controls are terrible. When aiming directly at a player between the crosshairs. Bullets still miss. Terrible game if you're reading this go download rules of survival. That's  what I did. Also sometimes during the middle of a game a loading icon will appear. You won't be able to move or shoot your weapon. You'll pretty much die. When in the safe zone you will still take damage even tho you are in the white circle. To many hackers.",
        "I love this game free fire and this game are my favorite mobile games so far but there should be some changes like you should be able to aim with an iron sight. And the aiming could be better and what I mean by that is aiming is already hard on mobile so I just think stability should be really good without any attachments or like the aiming system on free fire battleground. The graphics are not the best I've seen really just up the graphics a bit and add the ability to aim with a iron sight. Other than those things I love how exciting the game is as well as how close it is to pubg.",

        "I'm not a downloading games on my phone or tablet kind of person but I saw this game and decided to try it out. I loved it and played it all the time but then one day it suddenly stoped working when I was doing so well. I couldn't open the game anymore I tried many things and didn't work. I started a new game all from the beginning I had 55 cash in my town and all randomly it showed I had like 20. This game just wants you to keep making purchases. If you don't it will block you out.",
        "I love this game. I dont play a lot of games. Township just keeps getting better. Some things are a minor downfall to this game, like how you can usually get great items from the store, untill you need a product or item for a task or event item. Then unless you have the township cash to hire the dealer then its hard to get things done in time. Plus in order to complete some tasks, you have to sell everything in your barn to complete the task. You should be able to just harvest than sell without it subtracting it back from your task. But either than that its an awesome game...",
        "Something different and fun. I usually don't play these type games, but I love TOWNSHIP! Still having so much  fun with every level. AMAZING FUN! WOW! The HALLOWEEN decorations were so cute, I can't wait for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Loved the Cranberries. I'm enjoying Township more and more with each level. Year of the Rooster.  Greetings we're all gussied up for the holidays. It's Easter season 2018 still playing.",
        "Loved this game but I can't seem to get on the game now. I wait for a long time for it to start and have to sometimes uninstall and reinstall and wait for it to start again.  If It I do make it on I can't help other players by going to there town. I paid money on this game and play faithfully everyday. I'm feeling some kind of way about this. Please fix this.  Update: The bugs are fixed..Thank you",
        "It is fast pace and complex good for ny age,but it with it ads and constant up daes it is hard on your device. It can be played with out any cost, if one has the time and the patients. Other wise it can be costly.  If it a child playing it I would highly recommend supervision,not because of any other reason other than updates and complex issues.  But it is a thnking ame that is fun.",
        "This is one unique blend of many things made into a game that makes me feel obligated to keep coming back and keeping everything running in the game. It doesn't feel like this when I played HayDay. One highlight I have to mention, game cash (township cash) is generously given away in many form! No more worry of being unable to achieve this and that due to no cash available..."

The sound on the game is on and the last time it worked properly was 3 days ago. I have to shut down the game for me to get the ads gone and still no sound. I have lost many chests and many coins this way. I updated the game and still nothing. Please fix because I have no idea what is going on.",

        "Great game the reason of why the one star is no matter what if you delete the app or get a new phone it doesn't save. Not to your Facebook account, or Google play game and has problems with it's server. Why any one would spend money on this game until they could at least save stuff is beyond me.",
        "MY STORY OF HUNGRY SHARK  I've been playing hungry Shri since years and I reached my tiger shark.... suddenly it got updated and I lost all my progress and returned to the first level of reef shark...I was so disappointed and uninstalled the game after a few months I reinstalled it and while playing I saw the cloud save and clicked it.....I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I COULD RETURN TO MY PROGRESS....I enjoy playing it and I love the new background and updates  Best wishes- A hungry shark fan",
        "! GOOD !, Arcade style eat'em up game. Feels ALOT like \"Echo The Dolphin\". Except ur a badass shark! The ONLY hold backs is the controls, but u really can't do much about that problem unless u actually had physical/analog joysticks built n2 ur phone.?. The basic control problems u have w/ ne downloadable games.",
        "Addictive, played for hours at a friends house until 3 in the morning. Got it for myself. Gems are costly, but save up and you can get the baby on the last shark. Then get hungry shark world.",
        "This game was awesome but sometimes I don't like it when my Shark freezes up and who came up with all these sharks? It is a fun game but why are there pressure limits sometimes I don't like it but this game is it for teens it's for everyone it's really fun and well sometimes I don't like it when it takes me a long time to get money for a shark",
        "Love the game but in the last couple days, I'll get into a warp and it'll freeze completely on me. And It truly disappoints me because I could've had so many coins by now. I cannot play the game at all with it not freezing and making me start over.. I don't know if it's a virus or what but I wish it would get fixed."

        "A great app to download. Great format and graphics. Lots of fun and challenging. Rated everything 5 star other than gameplay. It's good but not great due to the water hazard or out of bounds shots.  Players can hit into the water yet still finish on par. Water hazard should automatically be 2 shots. If this gets changed it would be 5 star no doubt and best golf app.  Single mode would be fantastic to practise",
        "OK I really love this game but all if a sudden I can't play it anymore. I try to set up a match and it just hangs in the loading screen then boots me to the main menu. I have sent 2 emails to support within almost a week and more than 48 hours apart. I have not received any responses. Other than that it is a great game and for the time I was able to play I enjoyed it very much and hope to receive assistance in this matter soon so I can continue to play this wonderful game.",
        "I had to change my rating for this game because I seriously believe it is rigged for me to stop advancing. Everything was great until I made it to pro level and now I'm noticing that whenever I am tied with another player with gems, an extra gem magically appears in the hole making me lose that round. How is it possible that I made it to pro level winning a good percentage of games and now I have played at least 50 rounds on level 3 and can't win a single one?",
        "To many play just to attack your ball after you hit. Regardless if they don't play well they win. A bit eh. The way it's done barely allows you to win. I agree with many others reviews. Something fishy about the scoring system and who you are placed against. Won't keep long if it continues. Could be awesome if it wasn't unfair. O.o",
        "This game is ok at best. More about luck then skill. Fun and addictive, yes at times. Ive collected all the trophies from 3 of the maps and was on a roll. Then out of nowhere a 15 game lose streak. You will get to the point past anger. There are a lot of pretty good/lucky players from around the world.",
        "Overall, game quality is pretty solid. Few graphic glitches here and there but can be expected. It would be nice to rotate to see a better perspective and easier to hit.   One must improvement needed is that when you play a bot, it's way too noticable. You need to improve the bot intelligence! I understand why bots would be needed time to time.  Coins could be cheaper too.  EDIT: Game froze on a Pixel XL, cost me lots of coins! Not happy."

It's exactly how I remember it being on our old computer, and it is SO ADDICTIVE. The very day I got it I played for like 4 hours straight. Literally. Honestly I love the game. A little unhappy about the ads but honestly you get what you pay for, and this was free, so I can't complain too much.",
        "I have completed 3 rounds in the past on this game and wanted to play again not having to watch a video after every level is too time consuming. Years ago not as bad. after 5 levels deleted. EA took a good game and turned it into a ad seeking game. UGH AND UGH. Do not play unless you love ads. Other games you can watch ads at your leisure for prizes but not mandatory. Good luck but if new to game RUN..Lots to choose from.",
        "It remains a classic, yet some parts are just too screwed up. After paying to remove the ads, the ad hoes with the play button still show up. The vase breaker was my favourite in the past. Now it is broken. 65% of the time ir reads actap like a double tap making it utterly unplayable",
        "Irritating. At first it gives you an option of playing a video to receive additional help. Which works only for the first time. Next time onwards no way to cancel the video in case you don't want to install it. It is so frustrating. Either allows to cancel or tell the users what to do next. Worst way of promoting other apps.",
        "It was good but then this happened. I was playing just like any other day. My phone had died while I was playing, so I charged it and left it untouched for about an hour or two. When I signed in, all off my progress was erased! Please respond and tell me what happened.",
        "The game was great than EA got to it with there sticky fingers and put adds everywhere, it isn't the same game I enjoyed ages ago. It's just another add infested game now, even if you do pay for it l. The charm is gone"

        "I love this game there are so many games to play within.  One thing I would say is that I wanted to buy shoes before I got to the level I had enough coins but when I clicked it it took my money but didn't give me the shoes so now I have to play loads more when I could have got them five minutes ago. Please fix this and I will rate 5 star",
        "After I posted my recent comment, there were some angry comments pointed out at me. I apologise for that. I mean, this game in great! There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars. For someone who says \"too many notifications\", go to the settings and turn off that notifications button. Thank you for those hate critics you guys made. It really teached me a lesson.",
        "Massive Pou fan, but after a short break from playing I find it fails to respond and crashes a lot- anyone any ideas why? I don't want to risk re-installing it in case I lose what I've already got!"

        "I've liked this game for years. Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you're still coasting or you're in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You've had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven't fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!",
        "The best racing game ever, I've played this game along time ago. the first version it has 4/5 cars it was so fuuun.That was 5 years ago now I want to play it again.I feel the nostalgia ooohh the good old days.Now I'm going to install the game.U guys change my life Thank u guys soo much guys. I hope my tears will help u guys. :)",
        "Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it's just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............",
        "For this game to be so simple compared to todays games and grafics, I love it. I spend hours sometimes playing this.  Not to mention they keep upgrading and making it beter and better, keep it up fellas....i havent experienced any of the problems mentioned withthe updates others have but until then great game",
        "Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!",
        "Its a very good game without any tension of wining any difficult task...I like it very much and its not much addicting I have played many games but its very different. controls are also good but this game needs some practice . I am enjoying this game because the tasks are not very difficult but at the same time not very easy its a perfect game and the main character of the game is very funny he always sleeps in the vehicle.....so finally.... I like this game very much"

        "The game is good (played like 5 missions so far) but i feel like there should be a jump and crouch feature, even if its just a jump feature. Maybe make some levels where you gotta utilize the jumping, maybe throw in some jet packs during some missions/raids to get to a certain area to either continue the mission and/or find some hidden crates. Also, maybe add some melee weapons too?  Besides that, the game is fun, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay could improve tho.",
        "Literally the best mobile game I have ever played. All IAP so far is cosmetic, which is great. Very similar to destiny with it's own flavor. I do wish you we're able to jump though and shotguns in pvp are OP. Game is optimized well for my mid-grade device. However, it won't run on my gf's ZTE Grand X Max which is very unfortunate considering it's basically the same phone as mine. Hopefully this changes soon because we really looked forward to playing together. Download this game!!!",
        "Giving the review after 24hrs of gameplay. Have to say that it's awesome. Cudos to the creators. Loving the gaming experience. Graphics rendering should be calibrated more. Make sure to do that in next update. Coins and slots are hard to obtain. Many of them don't want  to spend real money so better give some daily tasks to complete and earn coins.",
        "Its actually pretty good for a starting mobile game. Its a little buggy, but thats because its new. If y'all want a mobile Destiny, this is where its at. Shooting is relatively comfortable (can't figure out how to jump), and movement isnt too bad either. Not bad at all dev team, good work! I expect good things to come of this if you don't try to go the dumb pay2win route.",
        "Good game but I expected it to be the best.  No loading issues or bugs encountered so far. Game loading takes about 6 seconds so no big deal. If madfinger sees this please add new maps and skins and weapons in SGDZ and enhance the game experience at FB as playing the game at gameroom sucks. I promise I will bring you about 100 new players if you did that.",
        "The graphic is awesome.But the game sometimes crashes when entering the casino full of people. Also, add chat system in co-op modes. It's hard to make people understand the puzzles without a chat. Add jump,crouch. It will make the game more attractive and the things are also needed for a game like this. I love the game. Keep adding new things, just don't turn the game into mostly pay to play game.Thanks."

Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It's a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It's very competitive!!! I swear my husband can't beat my score no one has lol",
        "It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone's or tablets I find it hard to control I don't know if anyone else thinks so but that's my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company",
        "It's good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it's my opinion so don't get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don't have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn't play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀",
        "Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface",
        "A very addictive game that's great fun! The only problem is with the controls. It seems to go too fast without even hitting the speed button (if you have played it you will know what I mean). IMO the speed function is uneccesary, take it out of the game and it's 5 stars all the way!",
        "Great game however I wish there was a way to avoid the button that makes you speed up suddenly.  This us partially because you use your fingers to maneuver it and your fingers can get in the way of your view of the screen. It could cause you to kind if lose control of your worm."

        "Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It's nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don't want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn't get a key.",
        "Good little time waster, simple classic gameplay but puts its own unique twist on it.   Side note: I clearly played this game more than they thought anyone would as I have started getting repeated designs when I upgrade my spells xD",
        "It stopped working on my One plus! Help! I was excited about the side games! *********************************** Excellent, addictive fun. I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn't level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can't progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.",
        "All in all it is a really great game there are very few ads, its fun, the graphics are crisp. Its amazing except for one thing. On one of the levels all of the monsters have exactly 666 health and im not religious or anything but I'm pretty sure that if some one who is religious see's that, well lets just say that it might not be good for the company, so I suggest you fix this.  Thanks.",
        "Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion.",
        "Fun game but takes forever to get gold to upgrade. The cost to pay for the gems to buy so you can buy gold is really expensive. Not much dynamic to the game. Same stuff on each level just takes longer to bet enemies cause of higher HP."

I usually like more realistic car games, but even the \"extreme\" warp in physics in the gameplay doesn't distract from the fun. These are the cars you'd want if you're trying to beat the traffic, run from the cops, or solve a parking dillemma. Great fun time killer! One thing though, the other reviewers are correct in their complaints about how often and when ads pop up. That shouldn't happen smack dab in the middle of a maneuver."

        "Do not spend any money on this game. This used to be one of the best slot games until the developers got greedy. Payouts are small and events are nearly impossible. They try to make it all sound good but it's not. They also changed the customer service on here where it's hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!",
        "What the hell kind of question is that?  \"Is it beautiful\".... meaning the game! HOW NOT PERTAINING TO ANY GAMES!  Anyway,  this game is hands down the best Slot game EVER!  Have played slots in and out of casino's for over 20 years and this is the one to play! A huge variety of Casino games,  easy to maneuver and a lot of really nice people.",
        "I used to love this game but something they did changed it. Winning is nearly impossible even if you are a paying customer. I know it is a game of luck but when you purchase 85 silver tickets you should be able to complete puzzles when you only need 1 piece for each of them. Make winning a little easier and people will be happy to spend money.  I think the game is broken. I was just playing in a room on Billionaire with a person who was playing on Huge Casino. I know it's the same developer but I don't think that is supposed to happen. I know the person was playing Huge Casino because it was my husband playing it. May want to look into it.",
        "Customer relations are horrible even non existent. If you spend money you will lose far more than you win, in their eyes you will spend even more. If you send a message they will hide behind a canned \"industry standard\" response. This is not a free standing casino there are no freebies and you can't collect any winnings. Yet they have their games dialed in so you lose in hopes you will spend money. Horrible company.",
        "I just started this account in hopes of recovering my lost one. If it goes smoothly, I am happy with the app to date. The slots don't pay as much as they used to, a little tite , otherwise a fun app. The events they choose for you to play, daily, do steal a lot of chips. If u want to remain in a successful club, you must do them, is the main downfall. I would recommend it to my friends.",
        "This is an interesting game. After I played it for awhile it became very boring. Haven't gotten a big or any good win for the past 70 million. I guess if you buy chips you might win more often. It doesn't give you all the bonuses, and it takes gifts and doesn't give them to the gamers you gave it to. So all in all it's just okay. I've never been able to get anywhere with their support team as they added to my reply. I'd give it a one star but if you buy chips it might be better."

THANKS FOR THE AWESOME GAME 👍👍👍👍👍",

        "Great game most fun I've had on a mobile phone in years. Need to add wider turning radius so drifts are better and longer. Cars slide to much or maybe the cars are heavy? Idk but hepatic feed back would help so much. Ad these thing's and I'll rate 5 stars and fully purchase the game.also multiplayer with like 3 to 5 other people just messing around  would be awesome. Keep supporting this game and has a lot of potential unlike other mobile games that are very linear and closed off. This feels like a console quality game please keep it that way.   PLEASE ADD HEPATIC FEEDBACK SUPPORT",
        "This is legit the best car simulator type I had ever played. It can easily succeed Extreme Car Racing 3D, which was one of the original simulators back in 2014. Smooth gameplay and realistic sounds. I would suggest to add the 350z, RX7 FD and a touge map for late night uphill driving, that would be insane",
        "This game could be even better if you could: - Add the settings to the menu to control the music and SFX volumes.  - Add a map.  - Add a cockpit mode!  - Add an online or multiplayer mode!  - Add weather conditions like rain and snow.  - Add the brands to the cars!!!!.  Fix the speed of the cars and add the actual speed of each car. For example, the speed of the Lamborghini Aventador is supposed to be at 217 mph and it's supposed to have 7 gears but it's only using 5. Please fix that. - Make the city as BIG as you can please!!!!.   - Please add more shadow effects!!!. - ADD UPGRADES PLEASE!!!. - Add car stats. - Add more cars like:   • Chevrolet Corvette Z06  • Chevrolet Camaro SS  • Mosler Land Shark • SRT Viper GTS • Mosler Super GT  • Marussia B2  • McLaren P1 GTR  • Pagani Huayra  • Pagani Zonda R  • McLaren F1 GTR  • Ford GT  • 2017 Ford GT  • W Motors Lykan Hypersport  • W Motors Fenyr Supersport  • Lamborghini Huracan  • Lamborghini Veneno  • Lamborghini Reventon • Lamborghini Centenario  • Trion Nemesis RR  • Ferrari F50 GT  • Ferrari LaFerrari  • Ferrari FXX-K  • Ferrari FXX Evoluzione  • Ferrari F80  • Hennessey Venom GT  • Henessey Venom F5, and the   • Devel Sixteen. Please!!!!!. It is totally fine if you can't add any of this, but it would be better if you could do so!. This could be an official car driving simulator game. WHO WANTS MORE CARS!!!???!?!?!.",
        "Wow. Great game. I wanted a good car customizer just for fun and this app takes it one step further. Open world game where u can drift and wreck into everything. Soooooo fun. Download now. No names on cars but u can still tell what they r. Soo fun.",
        "Hang it up yet info it yet info username and yet I've used back but isn't it is it is to see the in person but I don't have a Instagram account and follow me on Instagram account and I have a lot going I look forward to hearing back from you close by and I will be there for you close the door and it going to be thankful I look forward to seeing the new Star is it possible that I look cute and he is it is to be done by the time I look forward to seeing the new one and I can you know what time you are available",
        "This is a fun game. I'm still personally waiting on that police chase mode. Also, can there be engine mods and body mods, and some more low end cars?😀"

Perhaps i used bad tracks but its nothing like rockband blitz. It cant decide jf it ants to be a car racing game or a rhythmic game doesnt succeed at either. Looks neat at least. But hard to tell where tongo next with most graphics",

I love how you guys do the ads. If there's a car or level I want and I want to be lazy, I can just watch a couple ads to get it. Not only that, but It's my music. What a great idea. Kudos. I'm 100% on board.",

Full of bugs and the game freezes constantly and if it crashes mid game you wont be reimbursed your wager or energy. The old family feud was great. This is just garbage. Uninstalled and moving on.",

        "This game would be alright if you removed the chat. I came here to play the game, not talk to randoms who want to know where I live and if I'm single. I don't enjoy being harassed. If I wanted to meet people I'd download a dating app FFS.",
        "Geared only for Americans, takes an hour to get another ticket, answers like \"go for a run \"are incorrect only to find the actual answer is \"running\" are a few reasons why I have not enjoyed the game. Room for lots of improvement. If they fixed these plus the glitches I've just read in the comments section, then it would be a great game indeed!",
        "Stupid game. The more answers you get right the more points your opponent gets. You make more points bu not actually playing and guessing"

        "This game is really fun and addicting. However, the omission of \"not nice\" words including \"sex\", \"damn\" and many other legitimate words makes it hard to take its learning value seriously. The word \"sex\" is on driver's licenses, passports, and all forms of legal ID. Oh, and the word \"queer\" is not recognized. Why? If the game could at least recognize words accurately, I'd give it 5 stars in a heartbeat.",
        "I just received an update yesterday  (2/1/2018) and now where you can watch videos to get coins, the videos are not playing.  It just goes to a black screen or boots you out all together. Please fix it,  for this is a great game, thank you",
        "Somewhat 'addictive'. I do enjoy this game, BUT, like other \"make words\" games, even if you have a large vocabulary, some words are too obscure, like \"burin\", \"carer\", \"cine\", \"doyen\", \"olds\", \"prig\", \"weal\", and \"weir\" (I have a list of 52 such words from the game). Can be frustrating when you have found a word that falls between two other words, only to have it be an \"extra\" word instead of THE word in the list. Really irksome when I spend tons of time on one last word, only to find it was one of the words in my obscure words list AGAIN. Maybe those really obscure words should be \"extra\" words.  At least you can get $ credit for those extra words. The Daily Wheel spin is nice, but when you press STOP, a random speed up or slow down occurs, so the predictable-ness that the wheel would seem to offer is useless. Old treasure chests were better.",
        "Awesome game!  I can't put it down. There's just one problem. Last night I had almost 500 points, but had to go to sleep; so I quit. This morning I had to start from scratch.  I've played this game before from my old phone & could always start where I left off, but playing it from this new phone, where I had to download it anew, I can't do that. Every time it's the same thing. HELP!!!",
        "This app is amazing I honestly don't know why you get bad reviews the only reason why is not always the apps fault. I would be grateful if you guys would sponsor my YouTube channel called night virizen",
        "It's a cool game to occupy your time. I'm hoping it will get a little more difficult as I go on but it's ok for now"

        "One of the best sports games available on the market right now. The graphics are awesome. And the player realism is good. The challenge of acquiring Elite Players keeps you going.    EDIT: This game is a perfect example of how not to screw up a top notch game. Used to love it to death before the update, now every aspect of the game has been worsened; Auctions, Gameplay, Teams. Just name a feature and you can be sure that it's been screwed up. Just hope they resolve this the next year. Will just uninstall till the new yearly reset.",
        "YO IS IT ME OR BEFORE THE UPDATE I HAD CHOICES TO PICK BETWEEN 5 TEAMS I WORK SO HARD TO BUILD? DEFENSIVE LINE UP, SHOOTING LINE UP, AND SO ON. Listen Whoever made the game. I know what type of tricks u tryna do ok. I'm smart enough to know. And I know what y'all doing with that MONEY. So I would appreciate it  if I can use my teams again✌",
        "I can't see myself EVER giving EA mobile games anything but a 1 star rating, the game is geared to cheat unless you're spending actual $ on paccs & players. How many times can an event rob you of stamina to only rob you again by redundantly giving you the same fucc'n collectables over & over & over again!!! By the time you actually complete the set either the seasons over, or there's better players @ the position that you'll probably never end up getting either... Unless you spend some cash. EA succs man, SINCERELY!!!",
        "I think i'm dissatisfied with this game of rule. You should change this rule... when the all people can feel comfortable, and can be feel happy, free and enjoy it. This is so very very bad news with you EA. If you still use this rule, i think... this game can be game over forever. You should back this rule like before. if you can't, everymonts, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, this rating of Nbalivemobile always down, decrease, and fall, hopefully you can understand if you feel this game very important for you! Trust me!. Thank you. Tru",
        "EA, the game is official and is above average as far as graphics, gameplay go etc. etc. but food for thought and I think it'll be a gamechanger really...it'll take the game to new heights on a consumer level. It's the only thing missing aka Commentators/commentary as part of the in-game gameplay and the rest will speak for itself. 🔦"

        "I feel inlove with the game the second I opened it! being a huge naruto fan I had high expectations! and most of them were met.  I have two issues! it's seems the only way to get hero fragments is through the shops which is only 10 at a time. or special attack missions which keep changing! makes it very hard to awaken shinobi.  also why only 8 chapters in story mode! You have a whole two anime to base off and we only get 8 chapters! how disappointing.",
        "I am a little disappointed in the game right now. I saved up for the Jiriya banner which is supposed to have a higher drop rate, got one Jiriya card in a multi 10xs summon. I would like to know why that happened seeing as with every other banner I have ever pulled on had numerous cards for that shinobi, sometimes even the full kit minus an ult. I am not looking for an ultimate every time. But when I pull on a banner I would like the rate to actually be reasonable thank you very much.",
        "Everything was working just fine until not long ago. All of a sudden, everytime I try to play any kind of mission on my android, a message will pop up saying, 'Due to an unknown error the game will return to the title screen'. It's been happening for over a week now, I've tried to reinstall but nothing works. Please fix.",
        "4 days ago i was having a problem of playing missions. I couldnt start it because the screen showed \"due to an unknown error the game is returning to the title screen\". The issue was resolved yesterday and again today the same old stuff. Is this a joke going on with my account?",
        "To BANDAI NAMCO... Just suggesting a few thought about this game. I've taken liken this game more than any other I played so far.  I just thought during the mission about the choosen characters. I think this game will be more stratigical if you can switch characters during the mission. It just doesn't make any sense if the main character you control died right away. Since in a story there's still a chance to turn the table on your side. Just like in Naruto series though their team captain may die the subordinates will carry their will and a chance to win. And in this game,  If the main character died the rest automatically dies though there's still a lot of spare life. Hope you call consider.  Just making suggestion. Your AWESOME making this game BANDAI NAMCO.",
        "I really like this game, the only reason im giving it a 1 star. Is because I've tried to send them a message involving an issue but I cant seem to find the way to do it. In regards to the issue I hope they see this message and fix it, for some reason it wont let me do any missions. I have updated it and deleted the cache but the problem persist."

I started a new game all from the beginning I had 55 cash in my town and all randomly it showed I had like 20. This game just wants you to keep making purchases. If you don't it will block you out.",
        "I love this game. I dont play a lot of games. Township just keeps getting better. Some things are a minor downfall to this game, like how you can usually get great items from the store, untill you need a product or item for a task or event item. Then unless you have the township cash to hire the dealer then its hard to get things done in time. Plus in order to complete some tasks, you have to sell everything in your barn to complete the task. You should be able to just harvest than sell without it subtracting it back from your task. But either than that its an awesome game...",

Update: The bugs are fixed..Thank you",

Other wise it can be costly.  If it a child playing it I would highly recommend supervision,not because of any other reason other than updates and complex issues.  But it is a thnking ame that is fun.",

It doesn't feel like this when I played HayDay. One highlight I have to mention, game cash (township cash) is generously given away in many form! No more worry of being unable to achieve this and that due to no cash available..."

I understand it will be discontinued in June and I wish it wasn't so.    ...Hey Uno & Friends, could you please not ask me to rate an app I've already rated??? I was asked to read it again and then I came back to find I had made that specific request not to ask me to re-rate something. Your app needs to be reprogrammed so it knows if someone has rated it or not. (sigh)",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",

Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "LOVE! Please DO NOT end the game! This app is perfect all the way around. Best card game app ever. SOOO many people are gonna be upset if you take it down, so leave it up! These uno players are ready to rock this app! You will never not have people playing. It would be kind of cool if you could create your own avatar though.. & pick outfits and such. Not necessary, but a fun little quirk (:",
        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it."

        "I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.",
        "I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn't work.  So I pressed the 'X' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I'm pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE 'X'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I'm triggered.  Please fix that.",
        "If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.",
        "It's good at first but you'll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.",
        "Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I'm not spoiling it, but I will tell you it's a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don't know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.",
        "Both my husband and I have this game.  I opted to pay for the no ads though, he did not.  DO NOT do this!  He is able to get \"continues\" for watching adds and can keep climbing up the levels.  I cannot since I purchased no adds.  I get to continue once and that's all since I have stopped ads from allowing me to get the extra chances.  I wish I would have known this beforehand. Otherwise, this game is seriously fun and addicting."

        "I really enjoy this game, and unlike similar games, bonus coins are given generously, so it isn't too difficult to move to the next stage. A slight irritation is that many words are specific to the American language, and there are some I've never heard of (and I'm over 60!). For me though, this doesn't spoil the game. The best of its type I've tried.",
        "The game is Good and a good way to test your skills, Although it contains to many adds. Another good thing is that the game gives you free coins everyday and you can use it to help you out just in case you do not know the answer very well. What I dislike about the game aside from too much adds, It is an expensice price to pay if either you want to Reveal a letter, Tell the 1st and 2nd pic or skip the question. If possible, please make the amount lower😇 THANKS",
        "It's a good game but having an add after every puzzle is a bit much. Yake a bit too much time and easyy to lose interest. Maybe every 5 puzzles wo ups be better I know y'all gotta make your money but the constant ads make me want to uninstall.",
        "Now that I've played it awhile its an alright game. You definitely should give more points for solving since they're pretty good puzzles. Only getting 2 pts for each solve makes you not really wanna play. Not enough reward for the work. Especially when it costs so much for hints.",
        "Since no one reads 5 star reviews I figured I would rate as 1. Great time killer during those boring meetings or occasional bouts of constipation. Want to take a break from your mind numbing job? This is equally mind numbing....but hey, play on your bosses time. When you see a picture you can't figure out, lower your mental ability to where it makes an amoeba seem like Einstein......from there you will get every puzzle. Enjoy",
        "Great game. You should definitely earn at least 5 coins by default  when you solve a puzzle instead of 2 and more when watching an ad. The game seems Americanised (I'm British)  and  I didn't recognise some of the words (webmail?). Very fun though!"

        "The game is very good for WWE lovers. But there is some changes if you made in this game then this will be the most amazing game ever you can add this features  like . Buying a single super star with gold or cash we earned 2. Adding various types of championship  s like. Tag team championship or universal championship etc.  3. Divas & legendry super stars are not a available.   And last when I open the lootcases it stops on anathor item but suddenly it's change and give some other item.  Kindly resolve the issues    Thanks Team Reliance Keep It up  .",
        "I am in love with this game ! Can't stop playing !  But I would like to suggest some improvements  1. There should be triple repeat display in slow motion of special & signature moves. 2. Divas are not present 3. Legendary superstars like Rey Mysterio, Hulk Hogan, Rob van dam, Mark Henry etc. are missing 4. Gameplay can be more interesting with ladder, cage, Ironman, tlc types of matches. 5. Most importantly entrances of the superstars is missing. In story mode, only a single player to be selected and his journey should be displayed, improving his stats in between etc.",
        "Game is nice enough, but the  LOOT  is real LOOT . Its  CHEATING  to us. because when we pay 200 or 400 gold for 4 rated super start, why you have included 3 rated super start? Although it is OK with 3 rated start, but 2 rated super star why??? Its real  LOOT  man. ITS NOT FAIR .I am very much disappointed.    Secondly I think in 1 vs 1 match your should gift some reward for every 100 streak.",
        "Lags in between when the game is on. I go for defense but player starts attacking. Fix that issue. Also give update upto 100 mb max. Every month update is almost 360+mb & still the game lags.  Apart from it give an option of Make your own Superstar... Fight , Win & Upgrade... Fight against legends.   Also, once if I got AJ Styles he shouldn't be repeated again & again after opening another suitcase.  Fix it",
        "Love this game but the lootcases are so rigged hey its not even funny! For example i clearly see triple H next to Rick Flair but when u press close to them magically money or an item appears inbetween them. FAKE!! You forcing people to buy 3 or 4 star superstars and I waste my money if its this way!! Atleast its still fun to play",
        "The recent update is horrible. I can not play it like before as it Lage very much.Any attack we made on our opponents only his energy bar got full though my superstar has more rank.please fix this."

The down side is though, that if youre building an enclosed area, the villagers get in and you have to wait for them to get out so you   can close it.",
        "You shouldn't have a certain amount of blocks. Also you shouldent have to unlock everything except for the basic packs. The way you have to jump I am not a fan of I wish it was on the other side. Lastly is it would be nice to have doors,so the viligers couldn't get into your house. One more thing is I wish you didn't have all of these assignments to do to get money and diamonds.",
        "It's a okay game. Dumb thing though is you cannot craft blocks... you will need 10,000's stone brick and only get 150 every few hours. Developers and support staff are useless. You will have to spend money.",
        "This game is amazing. It wastes your spare time which is great. Just one problem. The blocks go down too quickly can you make it so the blocks dont go down?  Thank you!",
        "I love this game. When my sister downloaded it on her iPad i was sooo addicted to it and now i am downloading it on my own phone!!!! I really recommend to try it at least for once. If you will do so you will not be able to delete it easily beacuse you will be addicted!!!!!",
        "Remove the villagers plz i hate that they keep coming into the house i build and dont leave i have built 10 houses for me and they just keep coming in and its really inoying"

Making one mistake at lvl 190+ and then having to go back to zero was so frustrating it was the main reason i uninstalled.  Terrible shame honestly, the game could have been really fun and is an original idea",
        "Its a great game i love it. The only problem would be that the speed X2 sign covers how many balls i have left and i hate that maybe try placing that top right hand corner instead of bottom right. I also hate that it only speed up X2 and not anymore but i can live without it"

        "Amazing game, great time-killer. I discovered a game breaker: if you go into the settings after you die, the number of coins you got in that level, [the number in the brackets] becomes equal to the total number of coins. Keep going back and forth into the settings, and the game will eventually ask if you want to triple the coins by watching a video. Instead of tripling the number of coins you got in that level, the number of total coins you have gets tripled.  Instantly triple your wallet every run.  I want the devs to see this and see if they can patch it because I really like this game and I want the coins I earn to be legit.  Thanks for your time, Mike C.",
        "It has a progression system, but it's completely worthless. The only reason to try to win belts is to get weapons that serve no purpose. You can win most of them by paying 200 coins and getting a random one, but you can, for some odd reason, get duplicates. Not to mention the fact that coin combos actually do nothing, not even useless cosmetic items, nothing. I think adding function to the weapons (e.g. Making long swords slightly longer range or making small weapons quicker) could add more depth and more of a reason to play the game. Overall: It's a good timekiller.",
        "Great game. Best for killing time. Great concept. Need to add a  counter for counting the number of people killed, otherwise awesome. Also there is not much incentive to play to win belts. Make playing with boss again free. Add new opponents (not bosses but the minions) . Make the game a little less challenging. Also remove the brief stun completely",
        "Really fun game. Nice graphics and simple controls. More depth to combat system would be nice. There is no point in achieving coin combos. It does not affect the amount of coins won. Add a multiplier for coin combos, as well as a score multiplier for chaining combos together without missing enemies or coins. Don't allow duplicate items to be won. Very annoying to grind and grind for coins, only to get a duplicate you can't do anything with. Lastly, an option to pay to disable ads would be nice.",
        "The game gives you an unskippable mission to get kills with a certain type of weapon and then will never give you that weapon. I've opened over 100 chests and never got a two handed sword, so my options are pay real money for the the weapon (what they want) or delete this cancer app. I get you have to make money but there are better ways than stopping all progression and ruining the fun. Overall good game 6.7/10",
        "Fun button slasher. Ultimately stopped playing because I got a weapon mission and three random drops buying weapons with in game currency were taking too long to get a weapon of the right type... They want you to pay for them: lame.  Game is a bit unforgiving, especially when you get to boss fights. Once you fail a boss once it becomes much harder to get back which is a strange and annoying design choice."

As you can earn  daimonds  by just watching the ads.",
        "I love this game. I've never been good at fighting games like Tekken or soul Calibur but this game is a very simple take on the genre. I love how very martial arts based this game is and the hit boxes on the characters are quite accurate and simple to understand as well as the moves. Being a martial artsist my self this game has given me an outlet to mentally practice distance management, fake outs and strategy as well as practicing to be like water. The famous Bruce Lee saying. Love this game. Also the rank up system and the grinding isn't too over bearing or tedious and makes it fun through and through.",
        "Great game, my only problem is that it took a long time grinding for the money you need to buy items. It took me about 5 hours of grinding just to upgrade each weapon/armor, 6 hours to buy new ones. Still a great game, loved the way it's in shadows, making it harder to tell who you are.",
        "Game is awesome. But for past 2 days whenever i open the game, it closes after intro showing that unfortunately SF 2 has stopped. Pls do something as i dont want to uninstall it. Also I hv sent feedbacks 2 to 3 times but no reply or fixation. Do something about it.",

More lessons would be nice as compleated all of them already more cars and possibly a bike would not go a miss. Like the free ride option allot Barry minor glitches to sort out but other than than that keep it up excellent game well done. But please sort out little problems. Thanks.",
        "I like the game but when you are driving in the slopes/hills it's really hard to turn and then you have too watch a ad to undo it.At Every time you turn on the hill you go on the other side and get points taken off you for crossing the line so could you improve the game by NOT taking points off when you turn on a hill and can it PLEASE not be constanly raining because you the driver in the game have too keep on turning the wipers on and off. (Also sorry for long review and i wasn't shouting just making the point clearer)",
        "Im having troubles with the canada map i go straight when it says straight and it says i had an error of blinker usage or ill turn with the blinker on and it says error as well so im confused another thing is i wish the camera wasnt so easy to move. One more thing is in real life i know i should put on a blinker when changing lanes but i cant tell if your game does that or not sorry for tge long review i hope it helps tho",
        "It has very good graphics, controls, and it's a very addicting game. On of the best driving games I have played. But there is a problem with the Canada map. Cuz I see cars go straight through red lights and when I turn it says that I didn't use the correct blinker when I know I did. But other than that I think it's a great game. I hope they can fix the Canada map for me.",
        "It doesnt work. Tries to load I see a car and a stop sign I see it loads me google account then it just closes the app kicking me back to home screen. I have a samsung galaxy s3 yeah its old however I do play gta san andreas on it I should be able to play this.",
        "The game would get a much higher rating if it didnt penalize after each stoplight. It wants you to turn your blinker on at each light regardless if you switch lanes."

        "What I  know is this; to win free spins isn't easy for any player & most times you only get 5 spins at that with little chance of winning anything major. You guys always claim how much you appreciate your players, why not show your appreciation by increasing the number of spins a player can win from 5 to 8, 8 to 10 and so on. Now that would be a great update  (without making it more difficult to win free spins) that all players would appreciate & it will make your game more fun to play. Knew U wouldn't respond.",

        "I really enjoy playing this game. It helps me to relax while I am watching TV, or even using in split mode while watching a video or something. It's a bit different then the way I originally used to play Klondike, but still a great game and easy to get used to quickly! I don't mind the 5 second or so ads between games. It's the price you pay to get a good, free game. It's not like they play constantly and during a game there is usually an ad on the bottom screen but it will quickly move if you go to start a new game or need to access the other options.",
        "It's a fun relaxing game. Its so addictive that every device I have, must have this game. I have it on my phone, ipad and tablet. Except my laptop cuz then I would get no work done. About the ads, one pops out each time you finish a game, so I'm not to bothered by it. Also, theres no videos too watch in order to earn coins or diamonds because none are needed. I just love it. Its stress free.",
        "I would have scored higher except there is suddenly super annoying music being played that there is no option to turn off. The ads also now autoplay loud music. I agree with another poster who said it starting to seem like you lose more so you see more ads. I liked this because it was good for a quick game while getting ready to sleep. The music ruins this. I'm going to try another app now.",
        "I love the game solitaire played it on many different computers over the years. Downloaded three other version on my phone. All of which I deleted almost straight away because they were finicky and I didn't like the format. This one is easy to use and no glitches. So far so good.",
        "Addicting to play. The amount of ads is annoying and gets in the way of some of the controls sometimes, but otherwise it's a nice little game! I also like that it keeps track of stats and that you can deal just one card or 3 cards at a time!",
        "Terrible ads. So bad they hid the menu bar behind an ad banner so you click the ads just to access settings. Pretty sure they recently increased losing deal rate to make more ad videos play. So many other solitaire aps available so skip this one."

        "This game was absolutely perfect and was very much enjoyable, but now to unlock the full experience you have to pay. One of the reasons I enjoy this game and recommended it to my friends is because it is one of the only games that isn't locked behind a paywall. Overall, I have had countless hours playing this game, and trying to land on everything and return successfully. Instead of the microtransaction, why not institute a merit-based system for unlocking parts?",
        "Very great!  Here are a few suggestion from me to make your game more enjoyable :)  1. Can you please make the earth scale correctly because its diameter is around 12.000 km and moon orbit is around 380.000 km  2. Please make a smaller powerful engine like the 9 engines of the falcon 9  3. Please make a button that is simple to cycle from another rocket to another one to ease the attempt of landing a booster  4. Please add an ocean on the earth for some splashdown  5. The last one. Im a free 2 play player and i cant enjoy a majority of the new update :*(",
        "This game is awsome. Loads of fun. Told my friends about it. Could you add a free sandbox mode and more free parts. Thanks. Keep up the good work. Shouldn't have added micro transactions. It just ruined the game for me. Had to take it from a 5 star to a 3 star. Please bear this comment in mind for future updates. This game was 100% free when i downloaded it in december last year. Since then, you added a new build system, free parts which make the game absolutely amazing, and then you add pay for parts. Thats just buzzkill.",
        "Very fast and simple rocket building and great graphics. I wish there was a sandbox mode with infinite fuel. Also there is no indication for loading screens when you hit the launch button. Somethimes you think you tapped the button and end up sitting there for a minute or two wasting time.  Edit So glad they made a small payment option. Well worth the money and glad to support",
        "Great!  Only thing I miss is the ability to rendezvous and dock with another object.  In a moon landing, you could leave a stage in lunar orbit and pick it up for the outbound burn.  Also, karman line should be 100 km??  Edit:. Great updates.  I have no idea how to use docking to reattach parts that have been undocked though.",
        "Can you please add option to center the map on the rocket/vehicle when being in the map mode? It is difficult to switch between near objects in the current version, since I assume the map is stationary relative to the body in which influence sphere we're in at that moment. Also, a \"docking guide\" would be cool in some future update"

        "Honestly, this is the best game I have ever played. It's very addicting and I think I have a very high IQ because I have beat four out of five levels in less than 3 seconds. Longest level I've played is maybe 15 seconds. I have beat the first two sets of 50 levels within about 10 to 15 minutes. I'm curious, you know how there are game runners who beat games in a record time? Is there some kind of game Runner tournament or any challenges for this game? I am beat this game completely in arecord time. Thank you developer for making the best game ever. This game can actually bring out the genius in anyone. Btw, I haven't used any hints also, I'm impressing myself... Yay!!!😎😎😎",
        "\"contains ads\" is an understatement! unless you plan on paying, dont bother.  you play a stage for 5 to 10 seconds and get an ad after EVERY SINGLE STAGE! AND THE ADS USE DATA.  videos. long ones. spammy. uninstalled.    i would have maybe paid if the game did not turn me off so quickly with their ridiculous amount of ads that made me annoyed instead. so i uninstalled instead of getting far in, and rewarding dev with $$$.",
        "Dumbest game ever! A silly trick is enough to complete 20 stages in 5 mins. Trick -&gt; Just extend the start point to the direction which you cant cover by a whole traversal! Oh forgot to tell you, out of that 5 mins, 2-3 minute is just ads!",
        "It's a cool game where you outplayed every other game on your phone and it helps to kill time when you're going somewhere or just waiting on someone or class to start.",
        "I love this game when I'm feeling stressed or stuck on a project I start to play and it relaxes me enough to get my creative juices flowing again",
        "I don't have anything else like it, and so far its a much different kind of challenge then I'm used to."

        "Really enjoying this. Difficult but not annoying. I recommend buying the basic starter pack which gets rid of necessary ads, but you can still watch ads to get more coins etc.. Which is smart I think. Gameplay is pretty fun and responsive. Upgrades don't feel unattainable. Definitely one of the better games on the play store",
        "There is a sudden difficulty spike in this game around level 20. Even if u have the best ship and weapons ur no match for the hordes of enemies. This is not right. Even after spending money the developers dont want you to win in my opinion. Dont know whats the logic.",
        "It's almost nothing without buying coins, u cant even win normal difficulty without ads and purchasing coins, how r we supposed to upgrade our weapons when every map gives u only around 200 and u need 20000 after a while for only one upgrade????!!!!!! Its graphic and gameplay is really good but like I said no progress in winning after a few maps",
        "It's simply too difficult to see when your finger is in the way.   Is there a fix? No.  Fun game. Too hard for my taste.  My $0.02",
        "Stuck on level 32. Theres no way past this level without spending some bucks (crazy prices). Hate the fact that there is no other way, but to  pay for the best upgrades.",
        "Well I can't be mental, I am physically disabled, only this body is disabled, but we can think, ask somebody mental to play pass level 21 plus, we  did pass 21 plus LEVELS.  No disrespect to anybody mental/physically disabled."

        "I kind of miss the old version because isn't that why they came out with a 2nd game so if we eant more we got it.  Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.",
        "This game is both funny as serious it's a great way to make kids understand the danger of some things around them. Like trains and wires and different things. As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.",
        "I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I'm playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can't complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍",
        "I love the game, it's so addictive! Some of the levels are confusing, but most are super simple and super fun! One thing that is a little bit of a downer is how every time you want to play a new round you have to watch a 30 second add , which gets old when you want to play a lot, but don't want to pay for add free. But I would highly recomend this to anyone",
        "This game is so good but please get rid of some adverts. Whenever I click on somthing it always comes up with a long advert. Also, can you add a toutorial at the start, showing how to do each thing.",
        "I think that there could be less ads. When I'm trying to replay he game an ad pops up which is really annoying. What I would say is that this is an excellent game but just less of the ads"

With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!",
        "Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I've basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I've got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.",
        "A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it's a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you've done them and reached level 10 on both, there's really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.",
        "Be cool if there is boosts. Example if you get 3 perfect you get a free auto perfect boost or something. Also plz add a line of code to stop people from the date/time bug abuse - save current time to file. Player won't get money till that last input time has passed.  Also be cool to spend the coins on boosts",
        "Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot's more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn't bother me that much. 5 stars for the team",
        "It's a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the 'colony' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you"

        "Was pretty good, liked the levels and the graphics were cool. The combonation of the colours on the black and white were quite nice. The only problem i had was when it came to the controls. Its a bit hard to naviagte back and forth. It can be easy to make a turn you didnt really want to do but harder to correct it cause it does not stop until it is too late or very far down the path. It would be great if you were able to stop mid run. But other than that I enjoyed playing this game.",
        "If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It's by far the best maze game app I've come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I've tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It's the only maze puzzle app I've found worth playing! 😀💜",
        "Sublime controls, varying but very original and fun game modes, and an online leaderboard for the ones interested..!  I'd easily rate this 5 stars if the white-on-grey theme didn't give me a headache! For the love of whatever God is out there, at least give the choice between a light and dark theme, PLEASE?!",
        "I'm not far into it, but it's fun so far. My eyesight could be why it's not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It's still a very good game though.",
        "I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven't played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I'll have to download a separate kid version for her.",
        "5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes"

        "There is absolutely nothing new about this game except that you slapped the name \"Crown\" over Tri-peaks and called it a \"new strategy game\". I was really hoping for a solitaire game I hadn't played before. I'm extremely disappointed. I'm a HUGE fan of your regular solitaire game. Huge fan. But the name and description are misleading and it's embarrassing.",
        "It is fun to play. The first games I played when I got a computer, were solitaire games. I still like them better than ANY of the other games I've played. I will be adding this one to that group. I like games that make you \"think\" rather than \"time you\" and you have to hurry. They make me too anxious. This game works for me. Thank you.",
        "I wish i knew if all games were solvable.  I like to play winning games and replay the deal until i can figure it out.  As it stands, i cannot tell if it is a winning hand so i move on if i lose more than a few times in a row on a single hand.",
        "I really enjoy the game, EXCEPT for the fact that there seems to be no way to turn off the ad sounds. Even setting my phone to mute won't mute the ads. It's intrusive and annoying, especially in a public place.",
        "Would like it better if it didnt a group of ads that popup and cant be exited out of. Dont mind watching an ad to play the game but these ads are a dead end and to get them off my screenI  have to CLOSE the screen and then open it back up again. Tedious. Frustrating. May uninstall because of this. But like the game. Like seeing all the cards and the collapsing stack.",
        "You have the best solitaire games by far, I have almost all of them and I love everything about them!   Only one complaint on your solitaire and spider controls-----thev are not stationary (stationery) l.    Thanks. People love you!"

        "Fun until you get to Miami.. absolutely impossible to make 100 000.00 to unlock the next level.  Computer outbids or up bids you so that you either give up or lose your money.  No daily incentives to keep brining you back.  Unless you are willing to spend real money for boosters and money to move on.. play to Miami and then delete.. impossible to move forward after that.",

Its to hard to make that kind of money playing and now its just playing the same level over and over trying to get enough. Now its boring!! I'm disappointed, I really enjoyed playing until that point.",
        "Was a great game until I got to Miami level 19 now just bloody stupid & waste of time. I went to 4 straight auctions couldn't buy a unit because competitors bid more than what the units worth how are you suppose to level up & move on when the designers of the game make stupid unrealistic flaws in the game no bidder is going to bid in real life on items they can't see or know are there so why put this into the game? Fix this issue & I will adjust my review accordingly!",

        "After the latest update, I've only gotten one set of daily quests which populated right after the update. After that, I haven't received any additional daily quest where I can win some gems. Why is that? Now the only way for me to earn more gems os through the free gems  (by watching adds), getting a high enough ranking in battlez, or buying them.",
        "I think the new update is nice battlez is awesome and the good news is that my phone doesnt crashes anymore and when I played Inzanity it did'nt lag great rework but 1 question, WHY DID YOU REMOVE ULTIMATE BATTLE AND DEMONSTRATION MINI GAME THEMES TO EVERY WORLD?? Im sick of every level with just only themes",
        "I think the new update is very cool. It adds some multiplayer into the game. When I heard of this new update I rushed to my phone and started playing. It turned out to be good I was happy and thought it would turn out well. Then after that I remembered pvz one. It's multiplayer mode was much better. One player would be plants and the other zombies. Why could they not have made that. It was such a good idea. I would personally play that mode more than this. But it's just my opinion. Thanks for reading.",
        "Since last update it is very unstable and keeps crashing. Also every time i finish the last inzanity it crashes then once reloaded says expired so ive lost out. In fact im not that interested anymore. Im not a fan of battlez and it all seems geared to that now so had fun while it lasted.",
        "I HATE YOUR UPDATE. Battlez mixed battle between players who bought plants with money with the players who don't is totally unfair. There are many players out there like me who play everyday collecting coins by coins and gems by gems patiently waiting for a good plant offer that we can buy with gems. Buying plants with money is not on the budget. I'm not angry. I'm sad. Because PVZ is always one of my top listed games. Now it's pathetic. Crashed. Unfair. Expensive.",
        "I like this game very much but after updation it get worst. It's not fair that   we are playing with level 1 n some are playing with level 10 so disappointed now"

        "This is an extremely fun game. O have a few suggestions on how to fix things on the game. I noticed three things while playing this game. 1. There is not a continue playing option. This can easily be fixed and with all of the great work from Dvloper I think that this is not too far away. 2. I noticed you can uncrouch in the tunnel in the basement even though you are not all the way through. 3. Everything is in a certain place. If one object is in a certain place then if you are familiar with the game enough you will know where the other objects are. To be honest this is not a minor concern but still could be fixed. Other than that I can't stop playing! Thank you so much!!",
        "I love this game, especially when you hide just in time and there's that tense moment wondering if she saw you. I get chills down my spine when I'm hiding and I hear her saying \"I see you\". If I could, I would give this game 100 stars. I would suggest having a mode after you beat Granny to become Granny because I think it would be cool to chase the player around the house. Also, I think the game would benefit from a much bigger house, more drawers and of course, more locks. Love the game, keep up the good work.",
        "It's really really really fun game.  But I think if you guys do some more improvements so it will be much fun.  Here's what I think:  1. I think you should make the house much bigger.  2. You should add more enemies for example:  child o' slenderina,  slenderman and the spiders.  3. You should add an Adventure mode.  Where you need to find some books or something like an emblem like that stuff to make them uncursed like that.  4. Last but not least, you should add more weapons for example:  Pistol,  sword,  injection etc.    If you do that,  it will be super cool and fun.   ThanQ 😃👍",
        "It's definatly one of the better (more fun) horror games on the store, but I feel like there could be some more improvements. Firstly I think that if you've completed hard than there should be an (almost) impossible mode. Also minor details such as different textures and Easter eggs would be good. Last, I think that when you escape there should be an outside section where it's still got puzzles but it's more about the atmosphere. (Maybe that could just be for the \"impossible mode\") but it would make the game a lot more enjoyable. Also maybe a reward for escaping. (For incentive). Thank you and maybe you could take this into consideration :) also new app icon plz",
        "Who doesn't love this game? It's bone chilling and exciting for the whole family (Litterally my whole fam plays this game) it would be cool to have a mode where there was no granny just to explore the house and get a feel for how to escape. Also some weapons to attack granny. Lastly a map of where granny is would be super cool. Good luck!",
        "It's a vary good game so hood i can't believe it's on mobile game! Also the game mechanics are so amazing as well. Then there's series of things you have to do that keeps you in the game for a long time; the theme and music fit the atmosphere, and there's not much of a problem with the game either. \"This game gives me goosebumps!\" (From Dashigames aka Dachi) he loves it as well too. #goodgamemakemore"

        "Not worth it. The stories are TERRIFIC.  problem is you can only have 1 ticket per hour. If you wait 2 hours for 2 tickets your still going to get 1. The only way u could have more than 2 is if u purchase . So for that reason I'm installing sorry I can't wait that Long and sometimes I'm barely active and can only read 1 chapter is just not my thing.",

        "To make your own choices.... You need gems!   Well too bad there's no way to get more free gems.  You get 1 gem for reading a chapter.  But that's not near enough to actually make the choices you want.  If that was fixed and you could get more free gems,  game would be more awesome",
        "The stories can get a bit addicting. However, the tickets you need to read them are ridiculous. I can go to sleep, wake up, and only have one ticket. It says you can speed up to get another ticket by watching adds. That's OK. But I've watched so many adds and haven't received even one ticket for them. Honestly debating on deleting it. Seems like a big waste to have to wait so long. Especially when you like to read the stories. There's a couple apps that are better. And you can get further with. It seems the only way to actually enjoy this app the way I want to is to spend money to buy tickets. Why spend money when I can just open a book?",
        "You should be able to get more than one ticket every hour instead of only 1 until you use it. Really dumb and wastes my time. I'd be on it more if more tickets were available"

        "Ads are not intrusive. Since I've been playing for about 4 years, the animations really bug me, tho. I want to play fast, so I want to see my scores quickly. However, I must wait until an animation is over--an animation I've seen SO many times before. NO way to turn off completely if you still want to see your best scores. I've emailed suggestions, but have gotten no responses.",
        "If you're a little more old fashioned than some, and don't want bells and whistles,  this is the one for you. Takes me back to when my granpa used to play. Ahh!  And, to tell the truth, I've never even noticed the ads.  So there!  And -- and this is really important -- does anyone know why it's called Spider?",
        "After more than 500 consecutive completed challenges this game has become bad. It is no longer a game of skill, but a game of luck completing it exactly it the way it was programmed. I now have to make multiple undo to complete the game and sometimes four or more attempts to start over again.  Mobilityware games like crown and twin peaks are again just pure luck to complete like spider.",
        "I love this game.  It is addictive, but challenging when you want, or easier if you just want to chill without thinking.  It does have ads at the start of each game, and sometimes they are frustratingly loud, and some as long as 15 seconds before you can dismiss them, but they are less intrusive than some free games have.  I am happy that it does NOT freeze up like some games do.",
        "I love this game generally. The graphics are fab. I love that you can personalise the background and cards. It's easy to use and follow. If I could add one thing,  it would be that the game tells you when you have run out of moves; it only seems to do that if you play the daily challenge.",
        "Fun and addictive, BUT, the stats in the leaderboards for scores, number of moves, etc., show so many people using a computer program to win win the game, it takes the fun away from a mere mortal trying to compete.  Like 109 moves in 30 seconds?  C'mon, man.....I call cheaters.  If it isn't humanly possible it shouldn't get posted."

        "Great idea to bring all the puzzles together into one app. The ads can get a little excessive at times, but you get used to it fast. The 10 puzzles for 25 coins is a very nice idea to encourage you to do more puzzles to get those coins! I haven't bumped into any problems with this game yet, so that's good! I entirely recommend this game for anybody who likes puzzles, novice or advanced! :)",
        "I love a lot of the puzzles on offer and the fact that you can earn plenty of coins along the way to use for hints when you get stuck. But some of the hints for some of the puzzles are extremely confusing to figure out, meaning I've gotten stuck with several of the puzzles and this is very disappointing for me.",
        "This game is alot of fun in my opinion and it has a whole bunch of diffrente games/challenges. But the ads are a bit of a problem and i don't know if this happend to you but it should me the same ad every time.",
        "I love this game! I love how there are so many puzzles and how new ones are being added all the time. I've read some reviews and I do admit that there is a lot of ads, but for the most part I don't really mind it. I don't know if its just my type of phone or not, but I can usually skip these ads pretty quickly. So yeah this is a great app! Keep up the great work!",
        "Love it! *UPDATED REVIEW * i would like to retract my first review as the game no longer works. I had gotten a far way into the game but now the game won't load or even open. Very disappointing.",
        "The game may be great. I don't know as I haven't played it yet. The first thing that happened when I started it up was that I saw an ad for Grindr. The game is a PEGI 3. This is an entirely inappropriate ad for a game rated like this. My 7 year old daughter would love to play these games but unfortunately I won't be letting her. Very cross."

The game takes you a thrilling adventure, and although the object stays the same I find myself never growing bored. The way that each new character changes the level is just awesome. Each character is well thought out and designed amazingly. If you're looking for a game to pull out in a waiting room, or while you're bored - then give this game a shot. You definitely won't regret it.",

But play store says that this game supports in app purchases. So I'm very confused! Can someone please help me out here??",
        "Its awesomr and makes the time go by so quickly. The tiniest problem is that the gas is too little, but thats the point of the game!",
        "This game has so much potential... I started playing and immediately enjoyed it, they've got the game mechanics perfect, everything is easy to get into and the core gameplay is pretty fun. But simple. This usually isn't a problem because game designers usually build complexity ont on top of simple mechanics. Not these guys. The vast majority of jumping platforms, which is all this game is, are incredibly easy to do once you get the hang of it. And that's it. The game doesn't progress at all. It never gets harder. There are some trees and eventually a couple black holes to avoid. Like I mean 3 in the first 100 platforms. Then after platform 100 and something they introduce this drum symbol thing that you can bounce off of. Do they design jumps that implement these bouncy things in a fun and exciting way? Nope. You just go around them. I made it to platform 200 before I finally gave up. This is just lazy game developing.",
        "A great game for relaxing and honing your jetpack skills. It becomes a little boring after a while though, seeing as it's primarily the same activity over and over again. Otherwise perfect =]",
        "Such a great, simple, enjoyable game. I love the visual effects, the art team did a great job. Sound design is great too. I agree that the game is easy once you get a hang of it, but so are games like agario or *cough cough* all of ketchapp *cough cough*  Honestly the devs did excellent, even with ad implementation, all around 10/10 game"

        "I love to play hold em, but it's just to hard to round up the posse for poker night due to simply getting older. Life takes everyone n different directions. Not too mention, having kids and getting married, doing the family thing. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love living the family life with my wife and kids but I will always miss poker night with the fellas. Now that I have stumbled upon WSOP I have been able to invite all of the fellas to join and we can all play together still once again. THANK U!!!!",
        "Seen to many players leave because of this. Players with over a billion in chips. Goes to a small table with players having 30k or 40k. Goes all in every hand and kills the table. Players ask him why he does it and not play bigger tables. His answer because game allows me to and I can knock out player after player. Regulate players if they have X amount of chips play on bigger tables. Let the smaller players gain chips and enjoy the game.",
        "It appears that I have reached a certain point where my free play is being met with bot resistance. I've gained over ten million in one day and lost it all and more in suck outs. This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you'd have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun",
        "Win a bit and loose everything in a few hands...  Once you win a good hand, leave the table.  Dealer will not give a a chance.  After this review, I received an e-mail from the designer assuring me, that game is fair.  I have been losing several hands with pocket KK, QQ, JJ, and so for.  So I stand with my original review.   Win on a good hand and leave game.  Or else you will lose it ALL!",
        "This is a good game , only prob I have is there seems to some hackers/botting which makes it a little hard to play. Now as far as some people's comments even if the  people with a billion chips come to smaller tables , if you all knew how to play you wouldn't have to worry about them taking your chips. Trust me the majority of them started out at low tables also having to have to fight the ones with more money. I have been playing this game for a few years and love it.  Like I said only problem I have is to many bots/hackers.",
        "I really enjoy this game .At first I just added it for one of the games on app like to gain points for gift cards.And of course to learn how to play poker. Now if their no points given for this game I would still play it. I totally enjoy this game , and the people that play it. Its truly an enjoyable game. This game is a keeper know matter what.tthe only thing I wish is that their was more coins given ."

        "So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn't find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren't extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don't know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I'm not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.",
        "I loved the original. I've gotta say though, the part with the wizard dying and the endless mode game over scene is kinda sad. Also i found a glitch, if you go to tournament mode and select an icon you haven't unlocked yet and then go to the main menu. You can go back into tournament mode and you'll have the icon even though you didn't unlock it.",
        "Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it's not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I've survived 24 nights but I don't even have the achievements for\"survive 5 nights\". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don't because some of the zombie achievements I'm not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I'm currently at 59. GG!",
        "Addicting game. At start It's easy but It becomes Quick impossible, unless indeed you buy some gems. So It gave me some frustrations but too quickly. Sorry for my notation, Because really It's good work dudes!",
        "Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh",
        "Brilliant game kept me occupied for hours I loved it! I think what seperates this from the test of the stick man games is that you are able to control one of the warriors or miners and you can move them around or fight when them. Absolutely love it! Wish it was longer as I completed canoeing on hard in 67 minutes, please make more and more upgrades and skill points!! Fantastic game!"

        "Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it's just my phone. Also I'm not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)",
        "I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the \"mine\" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it's nicely done!",
        "I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.",
        "Overall the app is really great. It's the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you're not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.",
        "Input delays keep getting me killed. Instead of marking a bomb my input sets it off. I'd prefer two different inputs for marking or removing tiles.  I'm using a stylus too so I know it's not an issue of accidentally hitting the wrong tile.",
        "Great game. Love it! Sometimes the flag wouldn't place when you pressed a square, and once it selected a square instead of placing a flag, but I still really liked it. Wish there was a zoom because the mini square field is a ton of fun, but a bit small for my fingers. I still love the game though!"

        "Perty good Edit: We're in the middle of an event and the game won't load. Finally says down for maintenance. It would be nice to get a heads up on when that happens. Gonna put a hindrance on the event that's over on Friday. Do hope it's resolved soon. Still like the game tho, but would like it better if I can play.",
        "Well a very basic game, as any other idle game. Has no real extra things that would wow you. Notifications less than a minute after closing the app (or simply pressing home) can get very annoying. As if I need a notification to tell me I closed the game.",
        "Right.  First off, If you are not a fan of Idle games, then don't play. This is the epitome of an Idle game.   The Early game is pretty simple. Click, Collect, Make your way to Level 80. You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn't bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn't been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event's are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events'  All in, pretty good.",
        "Well guess they deleted my last post cause I complained that the game took up 1.8 gig till I uninstalled it and reinstalled it then lost my saves because of bad programming.   Don't waste your time or money on this company.",
        "One of the best \"tap\" games. Love the satirical theme. Who would have thought that politics and money were SO interconnected😁. Just to be clear to some, I AM being sarcastic!!!! Great time waster. And that's NOT fake news.",
        "They put so many buttons to purchase things ion the main screen. When tapping as is the nature of the game, it brings up confirmation for your purchases. If you're trying to play fast, you could easily spend $20 in mere seconds without noticing. Put all the purchases in one place instead of cheating players."

Until i close the app and restart it Tried making a fresh Charecter and goes straight into other characters but just not my main.. This started happening an hour ago",
        "I can't get certain menus to work. In shop its the purchase for mount gear, all i see is random text and it freezes the game. Some of the event menus do the same. Ive been playing for a little over a year and never had this problem. Please help.  Also the merit shop menu is broken. I can't buy anything and the event ends today. Ill update as I see other menus broken.",
        "This game sucks.. I always get thee same armament with only one star!  and some items are soo expensive that the money you pay is not worthy for the br you get and in return you'll get low br and also low money not worthy.. If they make this game less expensive maybe I'll give it a four stars... But no! not this time",
        "Makes you pay good money to be strong then merges you with much older servers that allows a no pay player to be much stronger ... horrible customer service also! Edit 3\\18 I see Gatorcade replied to this saying contact them for help. I did 8 days ago with no reply... So yeah like I said horrible customer service",
        "I paid money on This game only for it to stop working once I did...plunder doesn't open for me, mounts won't open for me...assassins creed play won't open...if I do open them....game immediately freezes and I have to shut down. Funny how I pay money and now I have Chinese characters all over the damn game...  THIS is absolutely a pay to play game...except when you pay...the game apparently stops working....",
        "Hey guys.. So when I try to level up my mount I click on the icon and when it comes up most of it is blank except a few words in another language. It freezes the screen so I have to close out and sign back in. Also I can't get anything on plunder either. Some help would be greatly appreciated, thank you."

Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don't register as pineapple hits for the counters. There's a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it",
        "Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.",
        "Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.",
        "Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.",
        "BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn't have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What's bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I'm not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game.",
        "How can I say this? I can not stop playing this!! Everytime I set a new and higher record I want to achieve and I only stop until I get there xD atm with 6400 coins and everything unlocked 😁😁 please release new content for months and months!! It will make me so happy! Thank you for this game."

        "Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.",
        "There's always a bug when there's about to be substitution of players causing the players in possession of the ball to run like headless chicken. Pls fix that. Add SULLEY MUNTARI of Deportivo La Coruna to the game pls. 'Need FTS18 with embedded dream league soccer ffs! Seems many players who have their current teams in the game are missing. Lawrence Ati of Sochaux in Ligue 1, Joe Dodoo, and many more. A quick update with massive changes will be great 'cause the game currently sucks!!!",
        "Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don't get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a \"Create a Player\" option under 'My Club' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It'd be so nice if you add that.",
        "Look what I experienced. Dls needs development. The commentry needs more reasonableness and intelligence. The behaviour of each player, at least the famous ones should be unique. Controls need more improvement. Add real team logos for the opponent teams. Update players team data according to the recent transfers. And one more issue, while playing local multiplayer we need an extra device to connect two phones. This is a bad experience. If we can connect with each other simply by connecting wifi and hotspot of the two phones respectively, it would be great and simple.",
        "This game is awesome overall. But some changes could be made like adding German league players (especially AUBAMEYANG though he's moved to England) and when you face them leagues top players( in the game) you could add the legends like Pele, Maradona, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and others. Hoping to see these changes in the next update. Thank You!",
        "I will love it if i can send players on loan and be paid some coins instead of directly selling them off. Also switching players for a few or no coins will be great. Since players like pogba likes changing his hairstyles, it will also be great to effect some changes in some players hairstyle. More leagues are needed, if possible, German,  Chinese, Nigerian and south African league. Lastly, commentators find it difficult to call the name of a created player, work on these and this game will be perfect.  Thanks"

When GSN does well I rate it well, when it doesn't, I have to report that too. If you look at the trend of reviews, many see a drop in payouts.",

I would much rather pay a one time license fee that this crabby implementation of user annoyance  / advertising. The other problem is that on the high end phones (read pixel 2) the board are so big that the tiles as a consequence are made very small so they fit with a final result that makes it very difficult to see/read",
        "The ads are very annoying and I have lost interest in playing  the game anymore. I have to start over for each play. Ad won't let me continue. Someone has Really messed this game up. Just fire their butts and send them down to the river swamp. No need for them to be in the public when they can't leave well enough alone.",
        "I think the game is great. I love Mahjong. I'm unhappy that I paid 1.99 to stop the ads but when I collect my 2,000 coin bonus I still have to watch an ad to receive the bonus. I will not be paying 1.99 next month just to still have to watch ads.",

        "Loved this game!!! It is my new favorite game I love all the powerful weapons and armor. I wish there was chestplates instead of amulets and leggings instead of bracelets and an easier way to find out what your hero level, But else then that it was perfect. I loved how you can choose the controls to your own preference. Chame on anyone who gave it a less then 5 Star review. I still dont know ho to tell what your hero level was but still my favorite game.",
        "I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there's only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can't beat them! Keep making more awesome games!",
        "I can't help but love a mobile game that doesn't constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it's tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.",
        "I'm really loving this game it's simple but still a ton of fun. My one complaint would be the sometimes the grind is too long and I almost gave up... I wish the developers would throw in some kind of experience boost in the store instead of just being able to buy coins. I would pay real money for an exp boost and would love to support the Developers! just give me the chance!",
        "I understand that people want their games to be entartaining. But i dont understand why there is a thing that downgrades your item upon trying to upgrade it. I have soent the last 3 hours trying to upgrade my helm to lvl 15. Guess where it is now, On goddamn lvl 11. I have spent less time grinding mounts in wow than getting my gear to lvl 15. Stupidest thing ever. One tip. Play the campagin lvls to lvl 40. Then dont do campagin at all and run hell for gold and xp. Repeqt to lvl 80 and then get rekt by the stupid item upgrade system."

        "Actually the game is really fantastic. The reason I gave it only 1 star is just to seek your attention because I wanted u all to add an effect of sound of engine as the car speeds up which will make the game really more realistic. I really loved playing this game but if u add that effect, it will make the game more interesting. I hope u add some more realistic effects in the game. Again I say that I gave it just 1 star to seek your attention, otherwise the game really worths a 5 star........Thank you.",

        "03-23-18: HOLY SHEET THE SCI-FI UPDATE IS CRAZY AMAZING! Outerminds has done it again! I wish they made more unique celebrations (like SciFi) other than Christmas or Valentine's in the future, such as Easter or even a Video Game Mashup update. It is time to rewrite my review!  So far, it's my favorite time-waster in my device. Never utilizes the Pay2Win paywalls for the most of the time (It's one of the best non-Pay2Win apps in the era of Pay2Win), and never crashes at all! Bugs aren't frequent! There are easy ways to save Bux and Brains in the game, which gives almost every player the opportunity to customize without any problem.  The game is hugely customizable. It's like being a home designer and a Tuber at the same time. There's lots of different customization options for your room, Tuber, and stuff. I also love to switch to a certain theme during events like SciFi or Valentine's Event.  And next, the videos. You can name your videos whatever you want, and you can select a combination of genres. You could make hilarious titles like \"PewDiePie Plays His Game\" or \"Edgar The Rapper\". And then you can pretend to act them out.  One of the best parts of the game is that there are almost no annoying popup video/banner ads, unlike in most games I've played like Vlogger Go Viral. The only way to view them is to simply go for a free shipping boost by watching an ad (which does not interrupt gameplay. Watching ads is also in Quests too, and it's fine as well.)  I like the Puggle minigame as well. It doesn't make the game feel boring as it can help boost shipping time while being a playable Pachinko with Edgar and Maya.  The game's community is also very cool. No cancerous fights or something, many players of this Tuber Simulator mostly focus on hatching Pixelings, participate in room contests, and get tips on how to grind Bux! Check out the Google+ semiofficial community as well.  Probably the greatest Tuber game on the web, Outerminds. I'll send you a Sponsor Eagle filled with \"Good Job\" messages. Keep your game as good as possible, there's no time to lose in beating PewDiePie to his #1 spot!",

Second, the controls don't suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.",

        "Very realistic and nice game. Missions and descriptions are entertaining. Controls are also great.   Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!",
        "Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!",
        "Great game but more issues to address.  The longer flight durations are a real waste of time,  make them more challenging rather than waiting for the destination. Also add more controls as the ones we have are not effective. How do you tell me to slow down yet i don't have the option for that?",
        "Its quite good but a little bit of fixing will do. The part \"Slow Down thing\" can you please please place that where it can not block the view of the player. It is very difficult to see whats behind it so it causes us players to crash. T.Y",
        "Why the hell they add brake when we cannot see the brake option even after landing which forces us to crash. Total stupidity do not waste time in downloading. Previously was better when there were no brakes just reverse it and stop or keep brake button always active.",
        "Its really boring... You have to do missions you cant just fly around and do whatever you have to fly through the squares and make it to the end... And who wants stripes?! Why are they so important?! Plus its really hard to control!!"

The AI will always take advantage of beating you with moves that will take what you need 98% of the time. Moves that no one can see but magically the AI knows what to choose to beat you. I love strategy games, but cheating is not a fun for anyone. The AI compition is not a compition. It's a slaghter waste of time until you get lucky or they give it too you. No strategy there. Just piss you off cheating AI. Being the top of Candy Crush and Candy crush soda. And yes also Jelly. It is ridiculous sometimes to waste my time with this one. If the AI opponents played at the highest level of what to use, then I wouldn't mind getting beaten. But when you watch the AI make the dumbest move to get what it needed, tells you that the AI sees the whole board. Even what is hidden. Give up or beat yourself up on this one. I seem to love the Gluten of punishment, lol.",

Watch the number counter not the monklings going under the rope & u will see the counter not go pass a certain number! THE SAME NUMBER continues like 6 will stay 6 4x's! That way u don't beat the level & u have to buy a booster, KING Co are CHEATS!",
