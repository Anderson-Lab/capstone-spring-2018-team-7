Now I have nothing to spend apples on.  But here is what i really wanted to say i really like this company and the games you put out to your users. I\'m newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me. I own alot of your games and have spent alot trying to help. I wish I had more to unlock things in time. But Thank you very much.',
       'The game sucks it\'s alwful. It\'s gliching non stop for your bad. There are ADS everywhere! Ketchapp you getting worse and worse. There are ads of stupid games everywhere. What a game maker will pay to another game to show them in ADS! That makes the game in the ad even worse. Please ketchapp I was a big fan of you but you made your games so STUPIT. PLEASE FIX YOUR GAMES!',
       'This skill-based time waster would be better without the hyper-agressive advertising. First you have the constant banner ad at the bottom of the screen. That\'s forgiveable because it\'s out of the way and doesn\'t really affect gameplay. It\'s the fail-state adevertisements that constantly interrupt retrys that will irritate even the most casual of gamers.   The only people writing good reviews for this game are bot accounts.',
       'Ads interrupt gameplay and are extremely aggravating. The video that you have to watch to continue your gameplay never works. The game crashes when xp increases. I personally dislike this game, and it would be better if these issues were resolved. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this review.',
       'Deleted all my data with no reason. Had a bunch of Legendaries and Rares that have now been deleted. I put a lot of time into this game, and even bought the ad-free package. If you don\'t want a load of wasted time, don\'t download this app.  Edit- Updated the app and levelled up a bit. The game crashes every time I get a free revive. Still a massive waste of time.',
       'The game was amazing! There was only 1 problem. Sometimes when i  started a game in the middle of it, it would just show an ad and it would make me lose. Unless you fix this my rating will be 4 stars. Fix this and the rate will be 5 stars' ],

       'Update...as I go though the levels Ill get stuck for a day or two...even 3 on a level. Gameplay FUN has Dropped significantly. Moved to 3 stars as a result. If it does not change I\'ll continue to move to 1 star. Games are many to be played...not just stuck on a level forever!  Other issue with the game is that there\'s so much clicking and waiting once you win. I wish that it would just go right to the next level and it wouldn\'t have to wait for the splash screen. I just spend so much time wasted versus playing',

The only way I could figure out the pass that level was to use the things at the bottom of the screen or the things the page where you choose what you want to put in there in advance. But if you don\'t buy extra coins then you can\'t either had moves or get anything that will help you along. Not to mention that 100 coins per item is a lot of money. When you charge $2 450 coins.

     [ 'This game is an entertaining and super relaxing way to spend time. New pictures are added every day, and there is a large selection of different things to color. I really like this app, and think at deserves five stars. To whoever is making the art on this app, it is really beautiful. If you are reading my review, (Wich you probably aren\'t) I think it would be really cool if you did some pictures from popular books and movies.',
       'In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it\'s just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.',
       'I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It\'s kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.☺',
       'Awesome app, its oddly satisfying and can either be really challenging ir really easy. Its constantly update with new pictures to do, and already contains probably hundreds lol, if dont 75+ and in saving the really detailed ones for last. If there even is such a thing. But, i think a counter for how many blocks of each color are left would be a really awesome alteration. There are many strategies to use when you do a color by number. So a counter for how many blocks of the selected number are left, it would be such a life save.this game has taken enough of my life already as is lmao',
       'Way to many ads, was hard to enjoy. Would have been more bearable If the ads weren\'t 30 seconds each, and played everytime I open/close a drawing. And, to prevent any ads you have to pay. I just want an easy, accessible, relaxing game. And by either making one pay, or making them suffer is not really my idea of "Relaxing". Thank you for your consideration.',
       'Good but £4 is a lot to not quite remove all the add. Some pictures are still locked behind and walls. Easy enough to unlock but for the price id expected all add to be removed. Also really would like the pictures to be sortable by category with more fantasy and space stuff in the complex pictures. Also there appears to be no way to sync pictures across devices. If I\'ve paid £4 I should be able to switch between the phone and tablet at will. Both are android.' ],

It seems like in 38 years with all the technology we have today , someone would finally figure out that when you go up, You go up and not right and when you go right it goes right and not down. Not the case here. Man we have games that live life for you basically. But still cant figure out how to fix pac man. REALLY? And the ads an ad after every board. Ads ads ads and then guess what? Another ad. Very shameless',

       'Latest update: The agressive pop up ads are gone and have been replaced by video ads. Even when connected to mobile data services. I wouldn\'t say this is an improvement. Draining my data volume for advertisement is not nice. It\'s just greedy. This app is producing so much money anyways, why video ads? Wouldn\'t normal images be enough?  Update: The agressive advertisement is back and it\'s worse than ever. There are huge amounts of unauthorised browser popups partly midgame and even when the app is simply running in the background. This needs to be addressed!  Earlier: I like this app a lot. The concept behind it is great and it\'s great fun to play. The questions are mostly balanced aside from the annoyingly football heavy sports category. Lately though the app kept opening up dubious websitest, usually at the beginning of a round. This is absolutely untolerable (!). It should not have the permission to do this. I\'ve been hoping for the latest fee updates to fix this - they didn\'t.',

     [ 'Awesome Game!! Really I like this game. I dont even have words to describe it. Totally Fantastic... Whatever you say, this is totally cool. But I have a request...please add a column of legendary bikes. Like there is Common, Rares, Epics, and Specials , there should be a column of legendary. Waiting eagerly for the next update. Thanks a lot of making this fabulous game. And I would also like to appreciate the colours and graphics of this game. Thanks to the team for making this game. I advice this game to those who are looking for cool new games. Please install it and have FUN!!!! Dont just look at the pics, install and you\'ll be amazed.',
       'Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death',
       'Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won\'t register your flips. These aren\'t huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.',
       'Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I\'ll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.',
       'This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can\'t seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn\'t be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it\'s not something you have to add, it\'s just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven\'t seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it\'s an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘',
       'This game would be great if it wasn\'t so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn\'t slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.' ],

     [ 'I love decorating the rooms but I am having to pay too much to get enough points to do it.   I also don\'t like that each room requires more points to do the tasks than the previous room.  I have changed my rating to low because you end up spending too much of your own money to get powerful to get your stars to complete the tasks.  They also lose your purchases.  I bought a desk chair yesterday and now it is missing and the task is gone too.  Rip off.',
       'Never thought it would be this addictive! At first i thought "Oh, its THAT game that always pops up in advertisements." but after deciding to give it a try, i am hooked!   I introduced homescapes to my mom as well and downloaded it for her and she finds it adorable and fun as well. We both take time to chill out and have fun with the puzzles occasionally when we are together.   I cant find a single flaw or critique for this game, its amazing :)',
       'Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it\'s advertised too much, but it\'s definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That\'s slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.',
       'Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I\'ll be playing this for a long time! I\'m working on the living room right now, getting close to level 600. Can\'t wait to see what the new character, Jerry, has in store for us! Thank you Playrix!',
       'I really like this Game so Far. I will play for awhile to See how it Works & If I like it. Absolutely Love Your Game. Play it ALL THE TIME!!! I Must Admit that I Really Do enjoy this Game! Sometimes I find myself Having a Hard Time With Certain Levels. I Could be On that Level for Days or a Few Weeks. I think with Some Improvement that Would make People Play. This Game More. But I Must Say Hat\'s Off to The Developers',
       'This game is awesome. But the stars, please increase the amount of star not just 1. Make it 2 for the Hard Level. And lastly, it\'s hard to download new rooms when it always appear the Technical Error. Better if you do not require to download it and the user can open it without connecting to internet. However, the game is great for relaxing. Keep up the good work!' ],

     [ 'I could have given five stars. The only problem is the number of players per drop/game. Please change it to 80 to 100 range. Pretty sure youll have a lot of players and ill be glad to recommend it in my facebook page if youll be able to increase the max players. It tends to become boring when you see only 12 players left when the safe zone did not even appear yet. You will look like a rat looking for a cheese around the map. More players means more fun. If you\'ll take this suggestion seriously, you will thank me later.',
       'I love this game, today i jus download the game, cause my friend ask me tooo download this game and he also said it was fun! So I download it, and he was correct, this game is fun, I just become level 4! Not so soon I will become level 5! Yay for me😁 And I already bought the 1500 Diamond suit! It is so expensive!😲 but I just want to show  I am not a noob and I like to show at people who dosen\'t heve it, lol😂 and also I loved the game very much, so thank you for making this game and shout out to my friend Imbran! And bye😁',
       'The best survivor royale esque game you can find on the play store. Takes up immensely less space than others like Rules of Survival. Anyone can play this, no matter the quality of their phone. It\'s intense solo, duo, and squad gameplay will always have you coming back to take a shot (no pun intended) at another win. An amazing feature is it\'s voice chat communication system. You can talk to your teammates (though unfortunately, I find most players speak Spanish. You may have more luck.) though i wish there was a text chat as well. It will hopefully come in the next update, bur I would definitely recommend getting this game. My only other suggestion is new maps, a night mode, more weapons, and attachments.',
       'It\'s a pretty solid effort at a battle royale genre it need more customization however maybe another map and just a tad smoother on the game mechanics. Also if it could hit the 100 player per match marker that would be great but I understand that the map must be smaller so it might get a little too crowded.',
       'I love this game so much, but what about more structures? Also I wish there was a chat in game that you can just type instead of voice chat, also the number one thing I wish you guys could add in or fix is the snipers bc they are weak... also I think there should be a counter somewhere when people dismount the plane so we can Dee how much are still in plane and how much already left  That\'s all',
       'good game. but I think u garena should add more trees, buildings, and others. and I thinks its good if we can play 5-10 players in one team in squad game cause in GUILD the max. members\'re 20 players. sorry for my bad english' ],

     [ 'What really drew me into this game was the the Pac-Man promotion, I love a good crossover and I can say with total certainty that I wouldn\'t be playing it if I couldn\'t play as Pac-Man, he\'s such a good inclusion. It\'s a super addictive game, setting it aside to do something else is quite difficult, hours go be seamlessly when playing it. The graphics as well are beautiful, very vibrant and colourful.   I have a few minor gripes with the game though, it crashed on me and when I restarted the game I had briefly lost all my content, that gave me a minor scare. The game is heavily geared towards microtransactions as well, unless you\'re prepared to pay money, get ready for a very, very long grind trying to get the stuff you want. Having said all that I absolutely love the game, very glad I downloaded it.',
       'Game looks good and it\'s well design, but far too many gimmicks and interruption. Hardly ever can actually run. Plus some silly hanging in the air for no reason. Got bored in 5 m',
       'This game is one of the best out there. Now I know it might seem like a remake of Subway Surfers or any other endless runner game out there, but I must say, Sonic Dash is much more than that. You can do way more in this game than you could in Subway Surfers. I would recommend this game of you haven\'t tried it. It\'s occupies time and above all else, this is a great game!',
       'This is a pretty cool sonic game for moblie for 1 it\'s cool for 2 you can unlock other sonic Characters and for 3 other characters from other games will come too like Mrs. Pac man!',
       'I love the new updated keep up the good work and thank you for making us vs people online this the way to earn more rings and red stars rings',
       'This is a good game with a decent progression system. The ads are a bit much sometime but my son and I can play and have fun everytime.' ],

     [ 'With an easy guide, on \'How to play\'. Once you get going its great fun. Dare I say quite addictive. Fantastic animations. Amazing back ground music. Plus, no app freezes either.  Its an \'A☆\' from me at least.  Only, what would be a great idea. Is all the piggy bank jewels you build up, should be awarded for your hard efforts. Should not have to buy them back.  Only purchase jewels when desperate.',
       'Ok.....we need an aquarium just for the holiday\'s.  I cleaned out one aquarium and that\'s all I have in there is the holidays.  After this session I\'ll probably save one just for Christmas itself.  Love the unlimited times! Keep the surprises coming!! I don\'t like so many clocks in one game and the "timed" games are insane! It is definitely challenging.  I play several times a day if possible.',
       'Great game but would love it more if it kept track of when you bought something . Like a little quantity number in the corner after you purchase a fish or decorations. Hard to save up to buy things for guests, sucks when you buy something you already have when trying to complete a task. Other then that it\'s a great game lol I enjoy playing it.',
       'Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I\'m 32 and play this often so it\'s not just for kids . Give it a try it\'s very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen 😉',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already.

     [ 'The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn\'t make it better at controlling. I don\'t know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌',
       'this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It\'s so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It\'s just so addicting and I can\'t get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the \'play online\' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊',
       'I\'ve recently upgraded from cubot to galaxy s7 and unfortunately the game is not working properly like it did on the old cubot phone. The screen gets stopping and it\'s impossible to play. I\'ve tried uninstalling and changing Wi-Fi settings but nothing worked. Other than that the game is sick! Love it,my kids love it and it\'s fun to play.',
       'So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I\'ll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It\'s in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I\'ve ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍',

       'I\'m highly addicted to this game. It\'s a thousand times better then agar.io in my opinion and it\'s really cool that you get to create your own skin. The only downer is that I just wish there was some music because you start to get a bit bored after a while.This game is NOT a waste of time, and everyone needs to download it to experience the awesomeness!' ],

     [ 'I paid the 2 odd dollars to remove the ads since i really enjoyed the game. If you are thinking about doing the same DON\'T. Paying the money removes ZERO ads. It simply allows you to skip most of them after 5 to 10 seconds rather than watching the whole 20 to 30 second ad. They still pop up just as often and are just as annoying. Personally I would wait for another developer to make a good clone of the game, shouldn\'t take long it\'s a simple engine.',
       'I paid the price to get the ads removed, because I like to support developers and because there were a LOT of ads. The ads were never removed. I have contacted the developers more than once and received no response. Then I contacted the Play Store and they rejected my claim. Now I have paid for the ads to be removed and they are still there at a level that makes the game unplayable. Worst customer service ever; what a waste of money. I will remember this developer and never download another of their apps.',
       'Terrible game. I can\'t pay twice without having to sit through a full 30 second add. I found it faster to exit out the app and go back in to avoid adds. But there are just too many adds that it made it not fun after the first few goes.',
       'EDIT TO PREVIOUS REVIEW: I PAYED FOR AD FREE AND REINSTALLED IT AND NO LONGER HAVE AD FREE!  I loved basically all of it except... If you don\'t buy ad free the game is completely unbearable with how many ads there are. Also I absolutely hate how it kicks me out of the challenges after I die if I tap too many times or I hold the screen while waiting for it to load.',
       'I liked the game at first, but got tired of ads and bugs. The gameplay is not smooth (using s7 edge). When losing a challenge  and want to retry, you have to be careful not to tap too much or you\'ll get sent to the main screen instead. It wanted permission for location and to make phone calls.',
       'This game looks great and plays well, BUT the ads are ridiculous. I hadn\'t paid attention to reviews since I had not intended to originally purchase anything, but just like many others I bought the Ad Removal and it did nothing. The ads are too frequent, too annoying, and worst of all unable to be removed even with purchase. I have reached out to Google about a refund.' ],

Im prob gonna try to get more ppl to play with me too lol. There could be more variety in the blocks, and there should be like different modes, just an idea',
       'Its cool and all but needs some extra features.  Maybe a way to store 1 brick for later or some level advancement.  Maybe challenges or a power up system. The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.',

       'This is very deceiving. It looks like it\'s Tetris, but it\'s not. The pieces don\'t come down like the pictures show. I hate apps like this who deceive people to believe its a certain game when it\'s not just to get people to download. Will never download a game from this developer again.',

Make this game have more tutorials n stop this freezing part for a better game n have  a 5 star rating from me n not a 2 star rating. Do u want a 2 star rating or 5 star rating?

Finally reached legendary 32, I\'ve unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so. Or at least a new adventure spot. Making a modded version of the rally car would be fantastic. Also, an upgrade on the formula car where it doesn\'t almost dead stop after it lands from a big air.',
       'I enjoy the game greatly. It\'s slightly different with  the chest and stuff but it is sure nice to get bonuses every now and than. There are new adds though which I\'m not super stoked about like the brake time adds but they keep them short and can be skipped quick if you have already watched them. All and all great game',
       'If you don\'t want to give away free stuff from the chests, don\'t. But stop wasting my damn giving me these "free" coins for watching a video only to have the ad freeze %95 of the time. The are plenty of other free games out there, might be time for a change.',
       'Well done with stealing the boxes idea from clash royale wow you didn\'t even Change the opening times, I think the next thing you should do is offering legendary and epic chests with legendary and epic cars. I have loved the first part of this game it was funny and doesn\'t make any pressure on you, the second one should be blocked from play store, shame on you..',
       'Superb game! Too bad, the elements of hate like to hack good things and cause frustrations. For this reason, constantly run constant updates. I wouldn\'t mind paying through my rather expensive data to diffuse the damage by these bored, small prick nincompoops! Africa😝😝😝',
       'Pretty good game the Ads are insane and they want a ton of money per month to get rid of them. Seems to be the way all the games are going. For the Chinese new year could have mad a tuk tuk I think it\'s called a mini taxi. Or something cool for China.' ],

     [ 'I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It\'s pricey but we\'ll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn\'t need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get',
       'Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn\'t need to have the internet on. Don\'t know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.',
       'I loved the game but after the first restaurant you need gems to upgrade things regularly and they do not come around often after the first restaurant. All the achievements are money based. Money is easy to come by and I have only won on the casino once and all the fun is lost grinding to make money to spend on the slot machine to try and get gems. I\'m on the second restaurant and I\'m bored of waiting for gems to upgrade now.',
       'I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.',
       'I think it would be better if you got more gems. You can barely win anything on that little slot machine. I also noticed that you no longer get gems for every day you log in to play. Sure, the money is nice but you can\'t upgrade with just the money you earn while playing. I spun that slot machine 80 plus spins and barely won anything. Do the gems even pop up as a winning combo? They used to but not anymore.',
       'It would be nice for updated casino with new slot machine games and also some new restaurants.  Last one was quite sometime ago?  Are you still actively developing the game or you called it quits like some other games I had to uninstall because there was nothing left to do in them.  Just curious.....' ],

There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.',
       'Cant sync with facebook gameroom so all money spent on there and had to start again when tablet was fixed and wanted to move back.  Another playrix cash cow... and the sole reason all payments have now stopped... stop making levels that can only be passed when players are made to pay to advance.',
       'I try other games that are similar to Gardenscape but after playing them for 5 minutes I delete them. They will never be as good as Austin designing his garden. Thank you Team for creating such a brilliant game.',
       'This game is a lot of fun and must admit. My biggest complaint is it\'s so expensive. I\'ve spent more on this game than any other game! Once you get so far along in the game, plan on forking out $$$. On some levels you\'ll need 2 or 3 boosters and extra moves to beat one level to win one star. They will use all kinds of tricks to get you to spend more and more money.',
       'I enjoy playing Gardenscapes. I appreciate the ways we get bonus items to help complete the level. The latest update put in something annoying and frustrating tho. I do not need a reminder when I have lost a level that I can spend coins to continue. I used to be able to at least disable that reminder for the fireworks show but now it reminds me for the magic hat, the competitions, basically everything. Please remove this "feature". Trust me that I am QUITE aware of what I lose when I can\'t complete a level.',

     [ 'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'This is  the best game ever. And supercell, can u add google + sign in so that people who don\'t use facebook can also have friends.. Also I have like 8 leggie right now and I am so happy. And the new clan battle is awesome, it is the best. I wish it is permanent. Anyways clan battle is so fun to play and who ever created it.. U r awesome. Keep up the good work Supercell. Love you so much and ur games.😙😙😙❤❤❤❤😀😁😁😊😊😊',
       'Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn\'t one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you\'re better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖',
       'This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.',
       'What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I\'m in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can\'t push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something' ],

       'Its so super expensive to buy a fucshia tiara, please when i unlock it please reccomend 1999 coins again and my pou so super preety pink and so beautiful. Update: please when i unlock it it must be 999 coins per item and please make it cheaper and please make it more beautiful like adding sparkles in tiaras and make more minigames and specials!                                   Problem: i can\'t raise enough money and food and please make the tiara cheaper so i can save lots of money.

       'I was addicted to the game the first time I played it.  Still love it and have put it on every device I\'ve had since I was first introduced to the game.  Pou has been a constant source of entertainment for over three years!  Love love  love it!  Oh and I almost forgot to tell you that I am 56 years old!!  Lol. It is really that fun to play!',
       'I love this game there are so many games to play within.  One thing I would say is that I wanted to buy shoes before I got to the level I had enough coins but when I clicked it it took my money but didn\'t give me the shoes so now I have to play loads more when I could have got them five minutes ago. Please fix this and I will rate 5 star',
       'After I posted my recent comment, there were some angry comments pointed out at me. I apologise for that. I mean, this game in great! There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars. For someone who says "too many notifications", go to the settings and turn off that notifications button. Thank you for those hate critics you guys made. It really teached me a lesson.',

     [ 'So I played it on my iPhone e and loved it. Recently o got a new phone and it\'s am android. I connected to my Nintendo account and loaded it up. My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I\'m not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr',
       'Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I\'m paying £9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn\'t make it worth the price being asked.',
       'I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',
       'Like a big lugger spit in your eye if your a Mario fan. Iv played since the first Mario. For one I very very much hate how u can not control Mario really u just run forward very very annoying. I\'d be OK with this if not for the insane price they ask to move on after the 1st world! Highly disappointed in this. Make it like Mario or get rid of it personally',
       'Super Mario run is a great smartphone game it has the very addicting toad rally and remix ten and the simple, but very rewarding controls. The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars',
       'I could only rate this 1 star as the app does not open, it gives a message saying Unfortunately Super Mario Run has stopped working. Disappointed as I was hoping to get My Nintendo points.  Installed on both my tablet and my phone, neither installation works.  Very disappointing.' ],

     [ 'This is a great game but the bottom line is the developers want you to spend money upgrading. You get along so far upgrading with coins, which can be earned. Then they want tokens, which you must buy, to go further. The deals on weapons that are offered are always just out of reach. You can earn diamonds watching videos but I would rather play a game than waste time watching stupid add so I can play a game. It was fun but no more. Deleting.',
       'After the update on 2nd Mar-18, Spec ops not loading. Game simply terminate itself while trying to load spec ops Level 16. Everything else is working fine. I\'m stuck 😓😪',
       'What\'s wrong with the "FREE TRIAL" in PREMIUM ".??  It\'s "FREE" but I need to submit a billing transaction card or whatever it is !!! You said it "FREE" so after 7 days cut off the trial. You just want to make money in the word "FREE" 😑😑😑',
       'If you haven\'t played this game yet, don\'t bother downloading it. They will just ruin everything within a few weeks. The developers of this game are the biggest idiots I\'ve ever seen in these games. Almost every update is a downgrade. It had gotten to the point where only PvP was fun to play and then over the last 2 updates they have completely ruined it. I don\'t know why the hell these developers can not grasp the concept of "if it\'s good, leave it the hell alone." I am now very thankful that my paycheck was late because I was going to get the "premium plus" package to further upgrade my gear for PvP, but now that I\'ve seen the new update there\'s no way in hell  I\'m wasting the money. Thanks for another major disappointment developers, you guys truly are morons. But hey, at least you\'re consistent!',
       'Should just let you use the weapon you start as long as you want. Instead after 2 kills you go to a pos bolt action. To bad cause game looked fun.',
       'Very good game.Just dislike that in order to get better guns you are forced to buy diamonds and I never spend money on games.so I\'ll be stuck shortly with the game because I\'m not paying' ],

     [ 'A giant mess of people who pay a ton of money to prey on anyone with impunity. Absolutely no rules regarding who or how often you can attack someone significantly lower in level. Even if you are stupid enough to pour money into this garbage, you will get your butt handed to you by someone else.',
       'Has alot to keep you busy. For that i give 5 stars. Minus 1 star because certain features in the game cannot be unlocked unless you spend money. To me thats a recipe for a slow death. For i will soon be leaving guns of glory in a blaze of glory based on that alone.',
       'This a pay to win game with lootboxes of different packs. They will keep making you spend with micro transaction of useless stuff to get the real thing you seek. Once, they took my money and the item was not delivered to me because i asked refund before, for a pack called "hope gemstones pack" but after 3 times of 20 bucks purchases, i did not get a single hope gemstone. A scam game in a very good way to steal your money. On the other hand, the game is very addictive and well made. If only the developer has a bit of decency..',
       'Need some updates like 2 simultaneously upgrade option. Less but more extensive research. Lengthy process is boring. I know by spending money u can get rid of it but money making shouldn\'t be always a concern.',
       'Could be a five star game, but needs improvement. Screen zoom is totally non-existant. No zoom out, constant "finger scrolling " required. ZOOM OUT,  ZOOM OUT,  ZOOM OUT!!!!!   ALSO 1.5 UPDATE?  GREAT JOB GUYS!  YOU FORGOT TO POST THE UPDATE!!!    WHAT A JOKE  They are currently giving APPLE users the 1.5 game upgrade. And gave Android user the middle finger. APPLE users now have a clear advantage over Android users.   So dont talk aboit you vare about customers… they don\'t . Clearly an APPLE culture designer.  Still haven\'t posted Android tablet update to ver 1.5 (droid haters)',
       'I really like the game at first. I gave it 5 stars but after a few weeks, i change to 3 stars only. Every time after the update, i cannot play the game. It always "connection problem. please reconnect" and until now i cannot play the game anymore. This game only wants your money.' ],

     [ 'The game is good, but the multiplayer needs to be fixed.  It hangs on load and results in the player losing money or gems with no recourse.  It randomly drops ships, and when one player immediatlely gets the best ship and the other player doesn\'t receive any ship until 10 rounds later, it is impossible to catch up.  Fix the multiplayer, then you get your 5 stars.',
       'I was trying to take advantage of the first time deal. I purchased a deal and for some reason Google play didn\'t allow me to  complete the charge. The next day I look in my bank account and I have been charged for what Google play said I couldn\'t do and I was charged another $4 when I didn\'t even click on anything. I want my money back. That is real shady that you would charge someone for a service that didn\'t even go through. And where did a $4 charge come from. And there is no way to ask through support to get that back so I\'m taking this here where others can see. Don\'t spend money here or there will be random charged in your bank account.  Update: I do not want a thank you, i want my money back. There\'s no way to contact the developers except through Google play which already seems shady.',
       'Definitely not worth it. Was fun at first, but after the updated quests, the game took a serious nosedive in quality. Now you HAVE to beat the opponent in order to get anything, otherwise you\'re out 1000 gold. Before, you would get something just for playing. The new PvP just sucks.',
       'Pretty decent game, shame you need to pay gems for the second last ship. The PvP is fun but half the time reduces my gold when I win. Cannot see the devs replying to any messages so unsure if they care',
       'Th game is fun and addicting. Way to many ads!!! Ahhhh My gold counter doesnt always register after endless mode is over. Gives me dble gold if i watch ad but doesnt register after endless battle sometimes. Would gave better review but that sux when it happens. Fix!!!!',
       'its frustrating on the pvp. you get disconnected and automatically lose. and sometimes they put you against someone who has better ships and level. they need to make it even and offer each player the same ships and same power ups at the same time. sometimes I get no power ups until round 3 and my opponent is already on level 7 because he gets better ships and power ups.' ],

     [ 'I love playing this game and would give this app a lot more stars, but for some odd reason I am not showing as completed the Goal of the level I am currently on. It\'s very frustrating to me because I have hit the targeted first Star and had recently hit ALL THREE Stars showing normally that I completed the Goal. No dice. I hope someone fixes this bug soon. It\'s making me not want to play anymore and I love playing this with my kids.',
       'I love this game. It\'s so good. HOWEVER, I paid for 50 gold bars and one of each extra(i.e. Pinwheel, lollipop, striped candy, etc...). After the payment went through, I only received 14 gold bars and NO extras. Please help. I have been stuck on level 348 for several weeks, because of that blasted bomb, and need the extras to help pass it. Do you have a hint on how to pass this level?',
       'If you like bejeweled Type puzzle games you will love this one. It\'s far more challenging with every level. Sometimes I wanna throw my iPad or phone at the wall...but I can\'t get enough of this game!',
       'Love this game so much.  Just that some of the games are too hard.  I got hung up on a game 226 or so for like over 2 years.  I stopped playing for a long time because I was so tired of that tough game.  But back to playing again.',
       'O jogo tem potencial pra ser ótimo e poderia se espelhar mais nos modos de Bejeweled. Mas chega a ser ridícula a forma como o nível dos estágios sobe aleatória e drasticamente, praticamente obrigando o usuário a gastar dinheiro pra passar. E é MUITO dinheiro: você compra um jogo AAA de PC pelo preço de uns dois Charm daqui.',
       'It is very challenging. When you get stuck on a level it takes a while for you to actually pass it.   You will be so relieved until the next level. It\'s even harder than the previous level. So. Good Luck. Have fun.' ],

I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn\'t hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv',

And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add "Edit and changing names"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱',
       '"Cusion shot on 8 ball" games are great, woukd be cool if one was created at a lower buy-in though.  I think its currently like 8 million needed to play a bank the 8ball game.  I personally like the No Guidline 9ball games,but would love a cheaper bank the 8 game.    Also, well done on adding the upgrade-able cue sticks.  That alone, i think, has made this game much much better.',
       'I realize y\'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don\'t pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I\'m pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It\'s a pretty good app and I\'ve sent many people to download your app.',
       'Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don\'t decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don\'t mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don\'t actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.',
       '8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don\'t win any games until those coins are over and I\'m only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don\'t know why this is happening but it sucks because it\'s putting me off the game.. it\'s like 8 ball is making sure I\'m losing hence the rate 3' ],

Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!',
       'Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm\'s Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!',
       'Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I\'m just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it\'s going to be good.  We\'ll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!',
       'This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10',
       'I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game since the last lvl was ToE. First time when i was surprised was an update with three or four new maps, also demon levels, but that was actually nothing, i felt at this moment \'\'Wow, update, ok\'\'. I got more admired by new update with this walking thing, still dunno the name, but things they have added, i still love it. Animated trails, new wallpapers that was awesome. New updates have arrived in mini-games for free, also awesome, but now i guess they have no idea what to add, because what they\'ve done this is the biggest and greatest update. I love this game so much, so i can\'t just put 4 or less. Gg RobTop, Gg.' ],

     [ 'The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won\'t annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie',
       'Its a legit fun game to play but...  For me I get streshed because when I need to do it over again then u  streshed by not doing it...    Its still kind of a good game though..

       'Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it\'s fun because it\'s challenging and there\'s super fun things in GD except hacking because that\'s no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I\'m super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂',
       'Well, I admit, I\'m addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn\'t be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can\'t Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍',
       'It\'s a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it\'s super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.',
       'The game is epic it has been made amazingly  well when I first played it I realised I couldn\'t stop playing  and it kept me up all night. now I\'m working  my way through the levels trying to complete the game. good work guys' ],

I don\'t get it cause I thought all my games save on Google or facebook all my other games are were there left off so please tell me I didnt waste all that money to start from the begining. I made this comment like 5 days ago I emailed provider of game waited 2 days then called Google only for them to tell me I need to get in touch with the game provider. Then I sent another email with purchases I did and my email and my phone number and nobody still has got back to me or commented on my review. So what do I do now my patience is running out. I even called the number that Google has provided for me for the provider and all I get is a voicemail which I cannot leave a voicemail.',

     [ 'Everything costs money. You\'ll be playing then run out of grenades. That\'ll be 30g. Don\'t have that? Well enjoy losing until you figure out a way to win. Love this game though. Made a purchase right off for a gun. Then I saw how much grinding is involved for the upgrades. The jump between a level 2 and 3 upgrade? Then the outfits, 2nd and 3rd weapons. Man. Sorry no thank you. This shooter however is very fun but the paywall is so well thought out I am not prepared to drop that kind of money. Learned my lesson losing 1k to Megopolis.',
       'I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn\'t have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn\'t get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren\'t vigilant of their customers and don\'t take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.',
       'Great game with a lot of potential.... There can be so many more additions to make this fps better. More grenade varieties? A spectator mode? Clan levels that allow more players to join when we reacher higher levels? Gun balancing changes? I feel like the Cerberus should be buffed. It is expensive, and the 3 shots at once doesn\'t allow for many attempts for kills. Adventure mode for more gunbucks? Death match option? Allowing us to pick the map? I understand the game is fairly new, so keep on adding changes and new improvements. Thanks for listening!',
       'I REALY LOVE this game but the only thing is that I\'m on level 10 and when ever I play in a battle and win I only get 200 gun bucks. PLZ can I have money transported to my account.My name is PRO_ADMIN.I would REALY HAPPY if you do😕.By the way this is also for my FAMILY and they would love it if you do ):  . I am only 10 and I know I\'m asking for you to do a big thing but my family would really be happy😊.My brother\'s acount is PROGAMER and he is only 6. PLZ if you don\'t reply or do something then it\'s ok ):  .',
       'Game is really tooo gud, graphics also nice n smooth controls but u guys released only one game mode(Team death match), but in lot of fps games they provided free for all, bomb mode, Flag capture n many more modes.. If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games 😀 n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area.',
       'Lunar fest was a bummer.  You had to spend money if you weren\'t available often. I would appreciate not being spawned into a game on a team already losing by half the score needed. Perhaps set matches with people of similar win percentage so you don\'t constantly end up with people who can\'t see what the other team is doing (patterns are pretty easy to see if you aren\'t slow).' ],

     [ 'One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.',
       'They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco\'s in my silo then tell me they can\'t refund it because I\'m a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!',
       'I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That\'s why if I\'m going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.',
       'Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn\'t get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.',
       'Good game. I initially wrote a one star review because this game was very dependant on microtransactions but it\'s actually pretty fun if you have the patience. Right off the bat you have to wait upwards to 30 minutes or an hour for basic production and warming but as you grow your farm it gets easier to deal with. This definitely isn\'t a game you can play for, like, an hour, consecutively, which kinda sucks but it\'s great for the 10-20 minites you pop in now and then.',
       'It is an amazing game. Our entire family is hooked and i love the idea of neighbourhood chat on hay day it is awesome!!! Continue making this game as cool as it is👍. However it would be nice to have private chat on hayday where the entire neighbourhood does not see your conversation. There is also a glitch where i cannot open my daily videos.' ],

What I mean is you know when your finger is not sync with character movement (uhh how do I explain this). Sorry my english is terrible. Idk if you get what Im trying to explain. Like 0.5 second delay when look left look right look up look down. Its very hard to aim at enemy and looting and stuff. All of this happen after the Feb 28 update.',

     [ 'This is by far the best chess "trainer" for me.  It\'s got a nice flow and the game isn\'t "stupid" like most other chess apps/games I\'ve played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I\'m making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.',
       'I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!',
       'I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn\'t show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.',
       'So far it\'s o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It\'s not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game',
       'The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.',
       'Not 100% sure how that works but the other person has their king and it\'s a stale mate and I have practically most of my pieces but to unlock harder levels I have to win. Does stalemate not count? I think its pretty stupid' ],

What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven\'t listened to this game\'s. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I\'m entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.',

I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it\'s meant to be "skillfull" but thats harder than skillfull, you can\'t even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don\'t care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.',

ONLY downfall is earning gold can be a pain,  seem like the only way to get gold is by beating a boss, buying gold with real cash and levelling up which can take some time.  Other then that it\'s a very addictive game if you love BMX that is.  Folloq me on instagram @evans_customz',
       'Very good game but I wish there was a better way of getting gold without having to pay out of your hard working money. Since when did games start asking for cash? I would pay to buy the game but buying gold is stupid as hell.. either way very good game',

At least put a 15 second ad up after the round is finished where you can choose to wat h and ad to continue after you have missed and your time is up. If that person skips the chance then put up and ad. Or just remove them. Thank you dev for the lovely game though ¶:',

     [ 'I used to play this game a couple years ago, and at the time, it had satisfying gameplay and great time killing qualities. I used to love it then and I still do now, but I\'ve recently noticed pretty annoying glitch that\'s driving me away from the game. For some reason, a few hours after I download the game, it doesn\'t allow me to enter the game anymore. When I open the game,  it will run smoothly up until the point when it reaches the loading screen and simply returns me to the home screen. I try to reopen it and the same thing happens. I\'m not really sure why this happens, but until this glitch is gone, I will be forced to stay away from the game entirely as the only way to fix this glitch is to download the game again which is quite time consuming.',
       'Marvelous game!!! Likely you back to the right on your last update.  I just purchased the chainsaw blade, the DRAGON blade was a huge desappointment we was expecting phenomenal motions not that catoon flag . Also : all the good stuff are in mini game, the others dojos are kind very less quality, let us use minigame blades and dojos in arcade or zen even by purchase that will be nice. Thank you',
       'I love it! My whole family was telling my friends to download it and they just love the whole game. Anyone who doesn\'t like the game are just saying that so people don\'t download it. DON\'T listen to them liars! Keep up the good work. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤',

     [ 'Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I\'ll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily "less than 20 coins" reward. Sooooooo cheap!',
       'It\'s just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that\'s a good question.',
       'Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don\'t ever plan to, but here you also don\'t really need to. I\'ve won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you\'re not forced to watch them. It\'s not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.',
       'Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don\'t even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.',
       'Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn\'t be putting people in the "club" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this "club" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they\'re INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game',
       'Would be good if someone actually thought about what they were making. This is an over computerized auto random winning when that person didnt actually win game. Many flaws need to be fixed. Start from scrat ch and make a more user friendly uno to play with my actual friends, not random people until I make it to level 5. Not cool.' ],

     [ 'Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I\'m 20 just..😉😉 I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I\'m in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️',
       'Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there\'s nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.',
       'A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!',
       'Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn\'t respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I\'m willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.',
       'It gives me something to do on my off time and. As I play I start to get very addicted to the point that I\'m fully in the game and I really love playing this game. I at least play up to 30 to 40 minutes a day just because how intense it is. Keep up the good work!!! 👍',
       'Fun little time killer. My only problem is that daily rewards fail to show up most days. It could be a problem on my end, but I don\'t know, and it\'s a pretty small issue so I don\'t really care.' ],

I hope developers will add something with updates that are not other challenges that ofter go to luck (and waiting time should e removed also). Sometimes there are some bugs but irrilevant for gameplay. The development house has made other interesting apps too. Sorry for errors, is not my first language.',

     [ 'Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It\'s nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don\'t want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn\'t get a key.',
       'Should be called adzy. During the level theres an ad banner at the bottom. At the end of every level there\'s an ad, some you can\'t skip and have to wait an entire 30 secs to sit through. To make matters worse, the chests can be boosted by 50% by watching, you guessed it, an ad.  They don\'t even give you a shop option to remove ads for a small amount of money or some sort of package. Pure plain greed',
       'All in all it is a really great game there are very few ads, its fun, the graphics are crisp. Its amazing except for one thing. On one of the levels all of the monsters have exactly 666 health and im not religious or anything but I\'m pretty sure that if some one who is religious see\'s that, well lets just say that it might not be good for the company, so I suggest you fix this.  Thanks.',

I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn\'t level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can\'t progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.',
       'This game is simple. So simple that it is stupidly addictive at times when my mental and physical ability equates to a bowl of fruit. Nothing in this game brings me more satisfaction than the immensity of lag when bolts are caught in rapid bounce in a confined space. I say that with the utmost sincerity, no sarcasm at all. The lag is so intense, so joyful to watch. Please don\'t take it away from me. It is beautiful.',

It was easier to change coc account in it...but in the supercell id it takes a lot of time to change the accounts plus we have to write our email then wait for the password....please fix this issue..... Probably I m not the only one who is facing it......    So I hope that your team can fix this issue..',
       'This is a very good game and I highly recommend it but there are two small changes I would make.    1) I would make it so that you can move the object in your village i.e. trees, rocks as there are afew seasonal decoration that I would like to keep but they are getting in the way of my village.    2) I would also make it so that you can put more then 1 builder on a construction to cut down its time or add more builder.

The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy?

Because it is really difficult to change if you are in poor network zone. Plz consider this. Otherwise the concept is really good it saves RAM of phone as u dnt need play games and services updated. 😀' ],

     [ 'Just way too many ads. Eventually you start having to watch an ad after every second other level. Its a free game, so I get it but the levels are so quick sometimes I\'m watching more than I am playing. Fun game, though. Easy controls and great graphics and sound.',
       'Good fun and very addictive. I see people moaning about the adds 😧 but what can you expect from a free game? You get an add pop up after about 5 puzzles and to be honest it is only for a few seconds....just close it if you don\'t want to see them.',
       'This game is outstanding. Love the graphics, simple to understand. Some appear quite easy and then you suddenly get a level that looks like it should be but has you scratching your head for AGES!!! Love it. I can live with the adverts, just wish i could put the phone down.',
       'Wonderful game, excellent graphics, its a free game, I solve 2 puzzles and a video ad plays I cant get over it, ad\'s are repeatedly played and I can\'t skip, but uninstalling cos too too much of ad\'s... after 2nd level game is very easy didn\'t find much interesting..',
       'Great time killer and keeps the brain ticking good fun. Ads are annoying but it\'s free and you can pay about £1.50 to get rid of them if your that bothered 🤔',
       'I usually can find something "wrong" with almost any app or game, but this is about as close to perfect as I\'ve played or used. I did not find the ads to be *nearly* as bothersome as most games. Good stuff!!' ],

     [ 'It is  great game, for ages 10 and up even 9 is okay. It is cool that we are building a town from scratch, like from the prehistoric time, and building our way up. Not like other game that start you off with big present day buildings. It doesn\'t cost a lot to do things like building and removing things, some object are free, they give the right amount of money and you can always win some more diamonds. In other games you would have to pay to remove object and buildings are ridiculously expensive.  It is hard to make money in other games and to make diamonds. I personally at night put my hunters too make things that take 8 hours and in the day things that take 5 to 15 minutes but sometimes 1hour. It is a very good game, it is almost as a real life city town, empire.',
       'Although FoE is very enjoyable, it can get very complicated, especially for new players. The biggest drawback is the lack of instructions...new players, unless taken under the wing of an experienced player, have to fumble through at first, many times guessing or using trial and error to accomplish the simplest things.',
       'At first I was a little unhappy with the amount of stuff I can do with spending diamonds, but I now find it refreshing, not to spend active hours on a game in order to receive a reward. I\'m glad they reward patience.',
       'This is a really good solid game that you can play at your own rate. You don\'t need to spend money and someone can\'t attack and wipe you out in a night. Many faceted play that will keep you busy and entertained from start until......well, ever I guess.',
       'Loving the game so far customer support helped me out quickly when I needed help this game is a fun mix between city building and fighting I\'m enjoying the game if you like this one Elvenar is just as good it\'s made by the same developers',
       'It\'s,........AMAZING I LOVE IT RATE IT FIVE STARS BUT THE  problem is that I got 50 diamonds and the story said research the pottery but I need 100 more that equals 150 diamonds so I need more diamondsBUT I LOVE IT ITS THE BEST GAME!' ],

     [ 'I\'ve liked this game for years. Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you\'re still coasting or you\'re in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You\'ve had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven\'t fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT\'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!',
       'The best racing game ever, I\'ve played this game along time ago. the first version it has 4/5 cars it was so fuuun.That was 5 years ago now I want to play it again.I feel the nostalgia ooohh the good old days.Now I\'m going to install the game.U guys change my life Thank u guys soo much guys. I hope my tears will help u guys. :)',
       'Great game, but I only have one issue which prevents me from giving 5 stars. This issue is that the hot rod doesn\'t go as fast as it should, I know this because I have grown up around hot rods and Rockabilly since birth. This is only a small problem for me, but it prevents me from enjoying the game as much as I\'d like to. Please improve it.',
       'Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it\'s just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............',
       'For this game to be so simple compared to todays games and grafics, I love it. I spend hours sometimes playing this.  Not to mention they keep upgrading and making it beter and better, keep it up fellas....i havent experienced any of the problems mentioned withthe updates others have but until then great game',
       'Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!' ],

     [ 'I think this game is brilliant. An absolute pleasure to play and I never get bored. This game should be voted one of the best games ever. Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can\'t join my sister and were only five levels apart.',
       'Absolutely great game ,but you made some far too powerful guns too accessible early in the game, so I went down two trophies after I ran into a bunch of wallet warriors. And for God\'s sakes put a more powerful gun at the end of the campaign, I worked my ass off and it wasn\'t worth it. Other than that large rant, I love it so much and play it every day. Make exp,gold and diamond easier to obtain though.',
       'I LOVE this game My only complaint is in campaign mode it\'s said more worlds coming soon for YEARS!!! If they\'re not going to add a world eny time soon  they should at least change the coming soon part. But overall this is a good game and it seems like Cubic Games really care about what the consumers think.',
       'This game is so good! I have played this game when it was in its early stages, and it was pretty good. Now it has gotten even better than before, with lots of multiplayer game options and lots of weapons and gadgets to choose from. There is one problem, which is when I got this game about a month or two ago, the prices to upgrade guns were pretty low for coins but ok for gems, but now they are ok for coins and WAY TO MUCH for gems, so I ask of you developers to please decrease the amount of gems it takes to upgrade gem bought guns.',
       'I don\'t like this update. Why does it cost so much to upgrade  weapons 2 more damage higher. And I don\'t like the fact that all the weapons that have low stars are nerfed. When I was on level 6 the hellraiser was a beast. Then when I got to level 7 I it wasn\'t as good, so I tried to upgrade it. BUT the price cost 120 coins. I am really disappointed about this. I played this game for 2 years and it sad to see how hard it is to win. They only want money that\'s it. Make your game better and fair. It\'s so unbalanced.',
       'It\'s a great game.... until you reach level 27, then there is a REDICULOUS difficulty curve. I was steadily climbing the tornament leaderboard, I was good, then I kept getting destroyed after hitting 27 with OP items and no gems to get the new weapons, because I had spent them leveling up my weapons and was out. What are you thinking? Lag, not double jumping, not firing when I need to, occasionally. How rediculous.' ],

     [ 'Honestly i really enjoy the game thus far thank you for all the recent updates niantic... but there is one thing that has been bothering me and that is 1v1 with friends and trading... both features were shown in the original trailer... yet again i love the care your giving the game niantic i truly praise it but i would like to know whats happening with my 2 listed thoughts',
       'Simply just needs more events. I get why trading isnt available yet, which is to prevent RMT and if you have RMT that\'s just the end of the game. But hope you could soon add the 1v1 battle feature, BUT WITH MOVES LIKE THE REAL GAME NOT JUST TAP AND USING THE SPECIAL SKILL.   Overall love it tho, been walking 2km/day for 2 whole weeks now. (Lookin for a gastly xD)',
       'Please have more legendary raid events with gen 1 and 2 Pokemon for new and returning players who want to collect everything. With regards to using GPS and joystick cheats you guys actually benefit by getting more players from rural areas or dangerous areas playing and spending money. Besides you still have to do all the hard work minus the walking so it technically isn\'t that unfair to others especially since everyone is level 40 these days with legendary Pokemon. The game is already balanced just needs more events. Please consider a premium service to pay for where we can use a joystick in game. We can pay monthly or something so everyone benefits.',
       'I love this game! Been just playing on my wife\'s account. Just recently decided to make my own, and it will not let me get past choosing my first Pokemon. They all spawn in the same spot and it quickly shows error 11 or whatever and won\'t even register me moving. I\'ve tried everything to toubleshoot and fix it. Nothings working. Really sucks because I love playing. Can someone fix this or tell me what\'s going on?',
       'thx for niantic that always listened our sugesttion, but i wish we can trade or battling with other player around the world by staying at poke center or else... - and btw you should update the new gym and new pokestop... since when i was on holiday in Indonesia theres not so much pokestop and gym around :( even there are many landmark in there - another suggestion plz maked some item that can be used to summon legendary/raid battle in location that we want, so its much easier  for the communities to do raid battle in specific location',
       'Can you developers make it so people can trade pokemon and other things like items? Itll make the game sooooo much better if teamates could trade items and Pokemon. People did it with cards, atleast to trade Pokemon. My bf and i play along with his friend David and when one of them need something that i got and visa versa, we should be able to trade. If you guys can make it happen, ill give this 5 stars instead of 4.' ],

Also, I like the items and clothing on the catalog, so that you can change your avatar - remember, you need to pay for the clothing with robux! If people call you noobs, don\'t listen to them. Just be yourself. There are some bullies of there: just stay away from them :D',

However, even though this game is made for all ages the filter can prevent lots of messages of such that not only are innocent, but friendly messages. I recommend this app for younger children under 10. Overall ok app.',

But Roblox mooched us with new lims. Anyways controls are meh but gameplay is strong. Also, anyone that says this is a copy of minecraft, this was made in 2006 so in a way minecraft copied roblox.',

Also, everything\'s a BIT expensive... Other than that, It\'s a really good game! Well done Outfit7 😄❤',

     [ 'I really like this game, kind of wish the progression system was a bit quicker though, other than that, the tight controls, open world and variety of creatures you can eat make it a solid game. The special sharks look really cool, and I even considered buying one until I saw the 50$ price tag.   On a side note, what\'s the difference between this app and the Hungry Shark World?',
       'Winnings suck. Instructions are very vague. Way too many ads. Feel like in order to play you have to pay in order accomplish levels and continue story campaign. Sorry guys but I bet my criticism has been said over and over again. Result is boredom. Too many other games to waste my time playing. Need to fix these if you wish to keep this game on the market people!!!!',
       'i would rate 5 stars... but.. something with the cloud save broke, i used to have the megalodon, without any cheats.. but now i have the mako. could you fix this somehow? And do i email the support team? Im not good with all the emailing stuff.',
       'It\'s a really fun game, but sometimes you\'ll play a video to revive your shark and the video will play but you don\'t get another life afterwards. It\'s hard to believe that it is a WiFi problem because if it was an ad wouldn\'t be able to load at all. Also, I have paused the game before and come back minutes later and the game had kicked me out and not saved any coins/gems gained from that round. They clearly have a few bugs to work out.',
       'IT IS SO GOOD, YOU HAVE TO BUY IT!Every level you get a new shark,though,you have to pay for them.But the good thing is you still have your old shark! You will be challenged throughout the levels! AND WHATEVER YOU DO,DO NOT SPEND YOUR JEMS!!!! You barely can get any jems,besides the five you get for downloading it.Anyway all I want to say is have fun be cool and be one with the shark! Bye,rsvp!',
       'OMG! I love the gameplay in this arcade game I love everything about it. It is very cool that you can evolve sharks that can eat more stuff. Keep the updates coming it would be better if you added more sharks in this game . I recommend downloading this game if you want something to do in a long amount of time.

     [ 'This is an awesome game that gives you daily and weekly quest\'s and offers treasure chests. Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven\'t tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.',
       'Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a "slide," I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don\'t compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.',
       'Nice, good, adventure game.but some times your team irritating who one completed thirteen level they will easily get diamond  your giving master challenge ( now the challenge Chinese New year )who one complete your giving thirty diamond only.this offer will useful only for entry level gamers. Most of players finished fourteen level so they no need diamonds.so think about genius players.',
       'I love all the graphics it\'s a bit like the        piano tiles it test\'s your fast skills but except it is temple run 2 love it. Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.',
       'It\'s my favorite app. I love it a lot. My only issue is that it doesn\'t quite accurately update my stats especially my highest score without using a \'save me,\' longest run, most coins & gems. I would really like the developers to look into that but otherwise it\'s a brilliant game.',
       'I love this game, very addicting. And I love that it has the daily, weekly and global challenges. As well as objectives and the daily chest challenges. Lots of things to work for and win. Makes the game more fun. Plus, so far, I haven\'t come across anything that I\'ve had to spend money on in order to advance in the game' ],

     [ 'I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It\'s fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn\'t want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.',
       'I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I\'d end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!',
       'Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It\'s reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series\' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis\'s and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I\'m offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,',
       'Fun strategy game, just wish it was easier to understand upgrades and easier to get a decent vehicle. Sometimes you have to wait for boxes other times you can watch ads to get thru them with no rhyme or reason as far as I can tell. The variety or maybe the lack of variety in boxes is pretty annoying. Sometimes you get the exact same part multiple times or with slight variations, which can drag out trying to get a decent upgrade on things.',
       'This game is have potential, don\'t ruined it because of money. I have never been watching so many ads In my life just to get some 2 stars parts. Instead of being creative and making cool machines, this game is turning to - either pay to win or watch alot of ads to win. What\'s the point of "playing" in this game?',
       'Wasted up to 200gems in ultimate league so far. When you lose a match, they offer you to keep your progression in exchange of gems, but they put the option on the right side instead of left. I keep pressing it by mistake and waste gems that I\'d much rather use to reset gang fights instead.' ],

     [ 'Excellent fun and a fantastic way to introduce a new audience to some wonderful classical music as well as very talented contempory composers. My one gripe is that recently players have been given multiple oportunities to get 3 crowns or very high scores with ad powered resources. I feel this takes a lot of the challenge from the game. Anyone can get 3 crowns in 4 or 5 goes where us old guard of the game did if in 1 or 2 Still an awesome game though and well worth the download anytime.',
       'This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don\'t worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you\'ll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!',
       'I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who\'s better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn\'t seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don\'t think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.',
       'This game has no WORLD\'S favourite song  DESPACITO  SO i m hating it tooooo much  when i see this then i think that let\'s download it bcoz it contains despacito song also but when i see all album of this app then i started hated it. So i would request from CHEETAH GAMES that plezz add DESPACITO SONG also in it This is my humble request from CHEETAH GAMES.',
       'It\'s been 4 months since my report that the game has such a major glitch, still NO improvement. I lost so many lives just because the song suddenly slowed down and then as suddenly fast forwarding itself, there\'s no rhythm at all. Why don\'t you just fix the glitch first rather than add more songs.. Now, at 2018, it\'s only getting worse..',
       'I\'m in love with this game. It\'s challenging, you don\'t have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks.' ],

Please fix this it is very annoying and im not able to play the game, because when the shark attacks in a corner you cannot hit him with your spear. This is the same for the zombie. I built a little house on the raft and it spawned behind the wall of my house. Please fix it',
       'It\'s honestly a pretty good game, it\'s fun, even though there\'s no real end goal and a lack of side quests. Although many improvements can be made to the game, the worst part is the ads, it\'s really bad, and it\'s insulting as a player that they try to milk this much out of us. You have constant random ads that take over your game at any moment. 5 ads per chest you craft to unlock each slot, ads when you switch to the map, floating treasure chests that require ads to open, even more pointless ads at every crafting bench, and the list goes on. I would gladly even pay to play an ad free version, but this is just ridiculous.',

I love this game and it has great graphics and it\'s a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I\'ll rate 5 star$',
       'Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn\'t really feel like you\'re getting anywhere.',
       'I really enjoy playing this game but it takes far too long to progress. Gems are way too far and few between to enable you to \'buy\' better vehicles to defeat the boss. Then you have to also use more gems to get weapons! If you don\'t spend money it takes a long time to get anywhere. If there were more gems available this game would be a 5 star game.',
       'For a shoot \'em up racing android game it\'s really addictive. I\'m always playing it. It\'s fun. My only complaint is the time it takes for the fuel to charge, 30 mins? Come on! Otherwise very challenging. Challenge accepted!',
       'I would give more stars, because it\'s very addictive and fun to pass the time. But it just contains WAY TOO MANY ADS. Like holy crap I  get 3 different ads back to back after every single run. Kills my battery quickly and I spend more time watching the ads than I do actually playing the game.',
       'Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me' ],

     [ 'I think this is an exceptionally well made game. This truly is a great golf game. Here\'s where it falls flat... I feel as if you must spend money in order to receive all the benefits that the game had to offer.  If you have 8Ball pool, then this will make sense to you. You can still curve your shot, even if you don\'t pay for anything in the game. In this game, however, you cannot adjust the curve at all when you use the basic ball. I feel as if it is closer to "Pay to Win" than other games of similar nature.',
       'Best game period. Not just golf or sports game, but any game. Wouldn\'t change a thing. All ya all who say, oh they need to change this or that, and why do I have to play someone who\'s better than me? Well it\'s because you suck, and you have no hand eye coordination. Just shut up and dribb, uh I mean play. #1 game for a reason peeps. Love ya. Dueces. Peace biatches.',
       'Game is based on luck. Could be so much better if it was more realistic ie club selection. How can it be fair when it is easier to chip in from off the green than it is to hole a putt? NEED TO FIX BUG THAT MAKES MY SHOT HAPPEN WITHOUT MY FINGER LEAVING TABLET SCREEN!!! HAS COST ME HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF COINS!!! When are you going to fix this issue??? If this was my game I would be extremely embarrassed with all the fault\'s',
       'This game could use better and easier ways to earn money for opening the chests and scoring or pay outs after each prize or game. So you can get better equipment and achievements. Would help keep players more interested. My only dislikes so far. I most definitely enjoy the game and think it\'s pretty awesome!',
       'Stop changing the winf its getting boring now !!  I mastered the wind only for ypu to make it not work in in some games or even make the wind twice as strong as the value stated. You should be matched on games played not trophies. Otherwise the good players who go up the trophies quickly always play people with better clubs. The game goes easy on you if you\'re not good at it which defeats the point of getting good',
       'This game is really starting to piss me off.  Main issue I\'m having is the stupid game freezing and telling me it\'s trying to reconnect in the middle of a game.  I\'ll make a shot then it will continue to count me down and tell me I\'m out of time.  Freezes until my times up. I\'ve lost close to 200k in coins lately and it\'s really starting to piss me off. Also, never consistent. I\'ll make a near identical shot as my opponent and ball travels completely different. Really starting to piss me off. Been playing this game for a LONG time and I\'m about ready to delete it!' ],

Pretty good app. Challenges are obviously based on bankroll making it more of a player\'s game instead of a winner\'s game because poker is not a winner\'s game. Long play on shootout can be annoying but why you buying in at 2k? You get to play daily if you like to play for free and can even complete challenges when you went bust.',

If you contact support they just send out a form email stating that "Help is on the way..." but they will not fix the issue of bots. They deny that bots are exploiting their app but when told of evidence, they send a form letter denying the existence of bots.

I love the tune that plays as you play it. It\'s so nostalgic. My brother isn\'t anymore with me but playing this game makes me really very happy. It\'s just like I am back in those old days. Specially for me, as it has so many memories, this game is the absolute best.',
       'I have a problem with my account. My punk zombird was maxed out. Level 3. Then when I opened the game, my punk zombird was gone... I obtained that by waiting patiently and gathering 90 diamonds. I had to watch 3 15-30 sec long video for 2 diamonds each. After watching the 3 vids, I had to wait another 8 hours for it to be available again. It took me a month to obtain that bird and then all of a sudden it dissapears?! I obtained it again but I had to start all over again. I uninstalled this app because of that issue.',
       'The game is really addictive. but repeated zombie birds are generated and diamonds are getting wasted. Please change that. One bird one time please. One bird should be at max 3 level not another set. It\'s wasting my internet to watch video to get diamonds for collecting birds',
       'I was confident to delete the app from my phone cos it says that the game will be saved on my fb acc. But only the highest score remained and the potion got back to 1. I was already at 56! Deym! Ayusin nyo buhay nyo! Sayang effort ko! Aba!',

Love it, I recommend this game to everyone💖 you\'ll be definitely love this game. MobiGame you slaaaay hahaha',
       'I personally loved this game. First off,  u cant jump for high periods of time cause u to run into the bombs. Secondly, whats sup with these prices? Thats ridiculous. You cant level up with prices that high and u have to buy 💎 gems and coins just to get a level up... But tum... Very great game overall.' ],

     [ 'Good game however, once you\'ve taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world\'s and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.',
       'Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.',
       'It\'s a really great game! I\'m really looking forward to an update. I think it\'d be REALLY helpful to be able to purchase an extra boat that just goes around and picks up boxes.. Having to turn around all the time gets tedious. Also an online pvp would be awesome. Maybe have the ability to make clans with your friends that can attack other clans. I\'m looking forward to see what you guys do!',
       'This game is great overall and you have a great sense of progression as your ship gets bigger and faster. The problem is the controls themselves. I found it very hard( I noticed this when I reached HP or ship level 6 ) and sometimes close to impossible to fire at other ship even at point blank range. The game has a very hard time trying to focus on one ship and would often shoot at where the enemy was 3 seconds ago especially when there is more than 3 ships at once which often happens. I would recommend a fire button option to compliment the controls and the gameplay experience. As I said before, it is indeed a very amusing game and would be even more enjoyable with this added feature.',
       'Great game in all honesty I can actually see myself playing this game for weeks to months. Everything about it is perfect and I  love how it is not based on a story.   Note devs: for some reason after playing for 10 min strait my boat gets to the point where it can\'t hit a single shot so I have to restart the game.',
       'please, please, please. update more maps or make it more challenging, ive already conquered all the islands and there\'s not much i can do anymore. so please, either more maps, or let others conquer my islands and let me reclaim it. i know you guys can still add up to this already amazing game. also, improve the controls, really cant see much when im steering. but over all, its a really fun, relaxing game. ;) thank you.' ],

     [ 'This game is very fun and addictive but should have offline mode so we don\'t have to deal with a hacker every game.  Also after new update I\'m having issues getting into the game. It says "check comnection" and my connection is fine even tried uninstalling it and all. Other games work on my phone and so does my Wi-Fi. The game just worked last night for me now it doesn\'t! PLEASE FIX!!',
       'Could you please add an offline mode...would be nice to practice on the go. Also please please please add more guns. I have been playing this game for a year and still no new guns but glad you are keeping up with the maps. I have this HUGE problem, it says check connection when I have good connection. I tried to restart my phone and reconnect but still doesn\'t work. PLEASE FIX.',
       'Just good. This game is great. The controls are completely customizable so you can make it work the way you want it to. Graphics are on point, better than 2nd Gen consoles, lesser than 3rd gen. If this game came out in the age of the PS2 I would have bought it. Also, buy a box because this game couldn\'t have been cheap to make. This game should cost like $25.',
       'its a great game. i loved it , but old brewery map was better than the new one ,that was my favourite but after the latest update it had  been altered and this "new brewery" is not liked by gamers, all of them want the old one brewery ,old one was awesome ,so much fun , i wanna request you to please. change the new brewery with old one we all commented to u and complained about this. many of my friends uninstalled critical ops  we all are waiting for the old brewery i wish you will make a read at all the comments and take the required action against it with in time ..........',
       'I loved the game before. It was one of the best fps game I have ever seen. But after the ban in pc you guys have lost a lot of players. And I too now hate the game. It was moreover greater than counter strike go, but after the ban you guys made all of us disappointed. If you would have continued with this game on pc I am surely telling that this would be known as people\'s choice game. So please consider to it and bring back this game on pc.  Thank you,  Your great full player',
       'I love this game....  But I would like if there we can play offline....  And there is so many hackers!!!!!!  Try to band them..... And please Change that there is two missions in a day so we can open chest.....  So we can get skins...... Please..... Thank u of u guys change....  Love this game....  It\'s like counter strike...... And one more old take off the lag I can\'t take it......' ],

     [ 'This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!',
       'This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you\'re willing to go broke',
       'Its the best game I have ever played. The things you can build are amazing and it\'s great that you can build your own to. The controls and graphics are unbelievably amazing. Great animal sounds to, they actually sound exactly the same as a real animal. Its also great that you can have villager\'s and your own pets. Only problem is the packs you have to use diamonds and if I don\'t have enough then I have pay for the diamonds and I\'m just a kid and my mom says no so please make the packs and the things in them cheaper. But other than that, this game is so AWESOME. 😃',
       'Lots of fun, creative and very easy!  Review update: I reinstalled in 2018 to find it has changed. You cant dig down very far like you could before, or down to water (it only floods a little bit in places) so I couldn\'t make a moat for the castle.',
       'Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.',
       'Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses.' ],

     [ 'So far, I dig this game. Although, the individuality of it is scarce. I still play it and enjoy it. It\'s not identical to other games of this type, as the challenges are similar yet different. The scenario of the game is basic with the others. I have a variety when it comes to games, this one has similar sound affects to other games that I, personally, downloaded. (But they\'re also from the same makers.) This game is over all.... Good so far.. I would recommend, linked my account to this game and invited friends and family. (I only do so, if the game/app is worthy. I\'m a picky bull!!!!) Overall, you\'ll have fun! Cute toys and  unique power ups, with a slightly (10%) twist.',
       'Definitely addicting. The levels are challenging, the tools are fun to figure out and the reward set up is not unattainable. The only other thing is they grew more wise  for the latest update, you can\'t change the time on your phone to add lives anymore! Probably better that way, one (read: I) should pace themselves when playing....',
       'This is by far the most fun I\'ve  had with a game app! Its so cute and  colorful!  And each increase in difficulty  makes you want to keep coming back for the next challenge.  What also makes it awesome  is a no brainer,  its great for children and adults alike.  BIG THUMBS UP!',
       'Really enjoyed the game until I was entered in a two week tournament.  Now, the boards are incredibly difficult and I can no longer earn prizes on a regular basis. Of course, I suppose that\'s by design so I spend money. Which I won\'t do. I just want some "bubblegum" to past the time.  Now, it\'s making my blood pressure rise...  Also amazing how many 5 ⭐ ratings they get in one day without the user giving explanations on why. Seems suspicious...',
       'I  love this game but why does it take 30 minutes for a life to refill and also why does everyone who plays the game not receive ten lives only some of your players this needs to be fixed it\'s not fair I\'ve been playing for years and only receive five lives at a time when others receive ten lives.I play other games and the lives refill every 7 to 15 minutes. Can you please make changes',
       'Nice game challenging to think ahead. But, basically this game is cheating on you. Levels are far too difficult to complete without boosters. So, after failing several times the not so random appearing tiles give you a lot of boosters. That prevents to uninstall (at least until you master the highest level and you enter the Legends Arena) !' ],

Use your spoils to discover new homes, and to expand into all new towns.You have a singular goal: make your towns the best they can be. The bar at the top of the screen measures development - Merge buildings to earn XP and level up. Higher levels will unlock more space in your plot for you to develop, which will only allow you to develop your town to even further greatness. Once you develop into new towns, keep an eye on all your land, ensuring that you’re merging and developing to your full potential.Merge, build, and develop your very own towns with Merge Town!',

     [ 'It\'s OK I love to play the game when I\'m bored and it helps me to be settled back and have a good time. But these all happens when I\'m offline. But when I\'m connected to Wi-Fi there\'s too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you\'ll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I\'m playing the game??!! It\'s too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.',
       'Well before I say my review, I would like to clear out a few of the negative reviews. There are not very many ads at all, in fact I barely ever even get any. Second, the controls don\'t suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.',
       'Nice game but became boring in just one day! 2 options of controls: Spin (Steering Wheel) and Tap. Tap option is easier than spin. You have to complete the damn missions but the coins are only available in Normal mode they aren\'t available in arena mode. For making easy highscore follow this!! 1. Switch your controls to tap mode. 2. Open Arena mode. 3. In the beginning take the U-turn. 4. Keep driving in the middle line i.e in between of lane 1 and lane 2. 5. Just keep driving on that small line dividing both lanes and you\'ll get your highscore until and unless you get tired, I\'ve made it to 3,887.  Normal mode is quite harder than the Arena but it provides coins and you\'ve to play it for getting your missions accomplished!  Thanks',
       'I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don\'t you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?',
       'It\'s stupid. It\'s really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn\'t turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked.',
       'I dont know why people are rating Ketchapp games below 4 stars... I agree games are difficult but one of the unique one\'s in every launch. Their creativity is awesome... Love to play each of their games. Kind of more chanlenging and unique ones' ],

     [ 'Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don\'t like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option',
       'Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it\'s good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can\'t take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren\'t recognised either. I\'d enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.',

Also i payed 3.69$ to have no ads but i sometimes still grt the very long ad videos which i find a little annoying since i payed for no ads... But other then that great game 😊',
       'Update:  now the game won\'t let me start a new game.   Original post: Buggy to say the least. Paid to remove ads since it was only .99. And now the game randomly quits, and erases any games I\'ve started when I exit from the game for any period of time. Was find until I removed the ads. Great way to treat the people paying your bills.',

I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands.

     [ 'Best Drag racing game in Google play store. If you have a addictive personality don\'t play it. I do suffer from that first race was on Dec 312017 as of Feb 22, 2018 I have 208 hrs on the track 23 in the garage own 22 cars and spent over a Benjamin on it in less than a month. Ya gotta have some smarts to play and win. Money helps with extras. Only time I\'ve had a issue with it was this morning a season ended I was upgrading a Tier 5 car and paid with game money and didn\'t receive part. Still a 10 star game... Great job Developers!!',
       'Really really addicted. Yes you know when your good. Yes you do.  Ok honest? Expand on the shop.  Tweaking the appearance and performance of the rides.  Everyone has their own way of saying, yes that\'s how I would if I really could.  You end up creating a bond or developing a relationship  with it.  Take it to the next level!  Gear ratios and n02 pushezes and grip are all good but let\'s envelop.  I know I would play more if I could truly express my kickass whip that represents  me that I have to drive!  You have a clean and immersive game. Less is more.  Thank you',
       'Game is really great! Amazing graphics, amazing cars, lots of continuous fun! A few bugs and connection issues which can be frustrating at times especially when your team depends on you for points. Though I believe they\'ll eventually fix these issues as this is the BEST racing game out there and it\'s only getting BETTER!',
       'Love the new updates where you can carry on the trials without having to go back to the garage. It would be nice to able to trade up your keys i.e 500 bronze for 10 silver or 100 silver for 1 gold. And the stage 6 upgrades be not double up or get stage 6 upgrades relevant to the cars you have.',
       'Best onlin3 mobile racing EVER!! IM A VETERAN GAMER AND THIS GAME IS HANDS DOWN TOP OF THE MOBILE RACING GAME. Great detail and graphics. Precision tuning. REALISTIC CARS IN ALL ASPECTS. PLUS an added Bonus is it features FAST AND FURIOUS AND CARS FROM THE SERIES. I need access to more cars. Its so hard to get more silver or gold to get newer cars updated.',
       'Customer support has won me over. They have literally provided the best resolution can think of for the game removing all my fusion parts. Hopefully I don\'t have many issues in the future but this one time moment has definitely filled me with confidence that in future, zynga will fairly sort things out.' ],

Yes there are ads but the game is free and even the "microtransactions" are so minor and the currency so easily obtained in game I can easily overlook the ads. Some have called it a Mario clone but in a way aren\'t most platformers but unlike so many of them this is actually very creative and well done. Excellent job!!',
       'A great Mario Clone.... Very close gameplay to the original. I love playing the game and have got very far through the levels but even tho I was signed in with Google account I lost my game progress after having to reset my phone. Am I missing something? Is there a way to get my progress back?',
       'Really good game only reason I gave it 4* is because when the the toads or snails are close... they seem to be 1 - 2 steps away and you still either die or shrink into small Mario... other than that little glitch it seems really good.',
       'Great game, my children 7 & 4 love playing it.... when they get a chance haha😁 One thing I have noticed is you need to fix up the 111st to 111th after defeating the Boss! There is no st in 111',
       'Love this app . Actually I install this app in my previous mobile but my bad luck I lost it.and in My pre.mobile I  reach 125 level .i became so sad that I will not able to play my sboy adventure game and next day I just buy new phone. first app that I install in phone is this app🌟🌟🌟u deserves 1000000000000stars.',

       'I really enjoy this game but there are too many ads and it crashes every now and then. Online play is kind of bad because it pairs you with ppl that dont ever play and if they do its every couple days until you can play your turn, which could be just to discard a card. I do absolutely like this game. I play actual card game still to this day. Great app just needs work. Will update more stars after updates start coming out.',
       'Would be nice if the game would stop glitching and making me lose coins. Edit: I was excited about the update but there\'s still glitches!! You pay a coin to use the extra card in your hand boost and the robots get to have 5 cards but you only get 2 or 3 or if you\'re lucky you\'ll get 4 cards in total in your hand.',
       'I love the game, the set up is great but if you want more people to actually play the you get rid of some of the ads. I completely understand that the ads are a key point but not it is annoying while your in a middle of a game and an ad pop up. Sorry but it makes me not want to play. I have never wrote a comment or rated a game for the simple fact that if I didn\'t like it I would just delete the app or game but I took my time to write this one because I really love this game and it brings back lots of childhood memories and I don\'t have to actually sit down and play with others',
       'So many ads they interfere with gameplay! What should be a quick turn becomes a 3 minute play. I don\'t ads, I support developers making money and even click on ads for bonuses, but this is ridiculous. The game is also laggy, which I suspect if from the ads trying to load. Expect game crashes as well - one occurs every gameplay for me.',

     [ 'l was enjoying the game a lot and would have given it 5 stars. l spent a long time to get enough bricks to  build a level 7 home so dragons only needed 7 mins sleep.. NOW    only  the same 5 of my 30 dragons get out and this is making collecting bricks and healing power very slow. l have not seen all my green dragons and moon dragons( the hardest workers) for 2 days now. developers please help or l will stop playing. TY.',
       'I would love to give this game 5 stars but 99% of the ground I\'ve uncovered is covered by "treasure chests" and there\'s no way to get rid of them or contact the game makers for help. I\'ve completely run out of space and can\'t play anymore. The chests should disappear after 3 - 5 days if they\'re not opened.',
       'Love this game. Graphics are great and so much to do. Keeps me going for ages. Main concern and the reason I\'ve not rated 5 star is the time it takes to get each token. When some levels take 7 and it takes half a day to fill up it\'s a major pain. Then you do a level that needs 4 and the next also 4 it takes the p*ss. Would be great to have a higher limit without getting charged or for them to fill up quicker. If this was done I would rate 5 star all round.',
       'You can earn a Max amount of 7 chalices at one time, and it takes a long time to re-accumulate chalices (some levels require the max amount of chalices in order to play level), and do not like the timed levels at all. I am on one now, and don\'t even want to play it, as I have run out of time, and it uses chalices up each time I play, and lose. Please remove these, liked the game a lot more before the timed levels were added. Otherwise, love the game.',
       'Playing this game makes me lose track of time. Wish we could buy the dragon egg chests with game coins.  That would be greatly helpful. Please consider this. Also would be great to transfer items from other levels back to the camp, like eggs, flowers, etc. Plz have this feature.Thanks. Plus would help if there was a set button to hit to exit the game. I am finding it takes between a few to about 5 times to hit the back button on my tablet. Plz fix, would make things alot quicker.',
       '2/5 stars because the only way to play the game is by paying! You can either pay to remove "pay to open" boxes or they don\'t go away taking up all your space! It takes 1 hr for your chalices (energy) to refill only 1 and you only get 7. Love the concept of the game and it is very unique but make it so that people can actually play. Get sponsors, play some ads, have the boxes disappear after a certain amount of time, ANYYHING! This is b*lls*it and not everyone has money to throw away on games. Fix it or I keep the rating low.' ],

       'One of the best motorcycle game to date, weather conditions are great, bikes are great and handling is great, but the bad ai on higher difficulty level a few times are ridiculous and messes up everything.  Sometimes a truck speeds up to 150km/h just to close off that small gap, where you could slip through, but next time all cars in all lane slow down at once, so you can\'t pass anywhere, even though there\'s nothing in front of them. This is really annoying, when every second counts and there\'s no way to pass them for 4-7 seconds. Apart from this the game is great. The keep changing weather conditions is great too.',

     [ 'Love playing but have 2 suggestions. We need another mill.  When we have large orders to fill it takes forever to complete those orders because the mull is tied up all the time. Maybe every 40 levels add a mill purchase option. When selling on the market, we need an option for a blind add or a neighborhood only sell or trade.. make these upgrades and so far game would be perfect!',
       'It\'s great to be able to buy from other farms in theory. But there are WAY too many times that you click on something and it\'s either sold or not even in the roadside stand at all. The for sale paper needs to update quicker.  Also, it\'s very hard to accumulate any \'west bucks\' in this game and you need them to do almost anything, so the game is a big money suck too. I\'m deleting it.',
       'I love these type of games just like hayday. I have noticed it freezes and takes ages to load the newspaper. Also would be helpful if it could tell you who needs help in the newspaper would help filling orders quicker. Also I have noticed alot of people selling the same parts and harder to get others and it\'s extremely rare to get the land parts without paying',
       'Update......I have learned there is a chat feature AND a neighborhood group you can create.....so excited to get to level 19!!!! Would give it a solid 5 stars if we could have an actual chat option with friends. Looking for a new game to get away from FV2, but can\'t find one with the same chat availability.  Add this and I am hooked!',
       'The game doesnt give enough case vs things to buy or fix.  Also have issues with getting product into the alloted spaces.  I thought it was my screen but had it cleaned thoroughly and it still happens.  It takes several attempts!!!  The story is cute.  The graphics are cute as well.  Ive noticed it has a couple of choices from other games Ive played on older phones. I would suggest the game to others but get the issues fixed and itll be a 5star game.',
       'I love playing these games. I\'m not sure why we are rating gameplay they offer apps not a game. It\'s crazy how they ask us to rate game at the beginning of game. We haven\'t learned the bad points. This game makes us pay for treasure chest instead of giving us to them free like most games. Which means we have to pay for everything. Totally not fair. Takes the fun out of game.' ],

     [ 'Enjoyable game. Don\'t have to spend money on diamonds unless you\'re after a top look. Best played when linked to FB which means you can borrow from friends\' closets. Would rate 5 stars but recently I am having issues opening results in my in box. Every time I receive a result the page opens halfway then I have to exit the game and reload. Playing on an Asus ZenPad, anyone having the same issue or have a solution pls?',
       'I have been playing Covet for 4 yrs every single day! Being in the fashion industry I find it so interesting that the products you dress your models in are real items you can buy in real life. They have a great collection of brands but Im excited to see more.   And contrary to popular belief you dont have to spend a dime to play. My strategy for this is I play the daily challenge with either past seasonal clothes or i borrow from my fashion house. If your vision and outfit is great you will win the free item regardless of whether it is in season or not. By doing this you save $500 a day and i wait till a covet series comes along and play it till my heart and imagination is content.   Take it from a Covet junkie, you will be hooked for years!',
       'Loved the game when I first started to play. Beautiful clothes. Great model looks,  a LOT of fun. Until you get further in. Everything is so expensive and what you get for diamonds in a day is very little. It was disappointing to say the least. I had a few friends who played and could borrow from their closets but none of them play anymore. Probably for the same reason I am about to stop playing myself.Give better incentives and give better prizes and maybe I will play again. Bummed out, the game has great potential',
       'Great pass time and fun to play. For a while I do nothing just for the daily diamonds but I don\'t mind because the game is just overall fun to play! Maybe it would be better ifyou earned more cash for entering style challenges but... STILL FUN😉',
       'Best game EVER!! I love this game sooo much! The only problem is that you don\'t get to move on to the next level fast enough. I do hate that so much.And also e everything costs diamonds and u don\'t get alot of that.  But other than that, good game!! Highly recommended.',
       'In the beginning, I absolutely loved this game, but now, I do admit that it get\'s a bit boring and frustrating after a while because getting cash and diamonds without paying real money is incredibly difficult and time consuming. I do like that they fixed the reaction time for voting because it used to be sooo slow. But overall, I highly recommend this game for any kind of fashion lover who is willing to have the patience to play it.' ],

    description: 'Named Best of 2015 by Google Play editors! Thank you for all of your support.One of the hottest mobile games of all time! Easy to pick up and play. Wildly addictive. See for yourself why Touch Arcade called Doodle Jump “possibly the best [mobile] game ever created” and Macworld called it “a perfect micro-game, insanely addictive, and deliciously replayable.” How high can you get?Journey up a sheet of graph paper, perpetually jumping from one platform to the next, picking up jet packs, avoiding black holes, and blasting baddies with nose balls along the way. Laugh with delight as you blow past other players\' actual score markers scribbled in the margins. And be warned: this game is insanely addictive! Features:-\tMany fantastical worlds to play in - Ninja, Space, Jungle, Soccer, Underwater, Snow, Halloween, Frozen Ice, Easter and Pirates!-\tAwesome power-ups to pick-up (JET PACKs, PROPELLER HATS, ROCKETS, trampolines...)-\tTrippy obstacles to avoid (UFOs, black holes, and many, many monstrous monsters)-\tMad platforms to jump on (Broken, moving, disappearing, shifting, EXPLODING…)-\tNEW! - More than 100 missions to complete for rewards-\tGlobal leaderboards, fun achievements! Beat your friends’ scores!How to play: Tilt to move left or right, tap the screen to shoot.

One small point that a future update could sort out is making a feature to create the same bandits again. Rather than manually going in and picking them again. And if you have spares, to automatically put them in place. Also duplicates seem to have no purpose as of yet....',

     [ 'So nice to sit and enjoy a game of challenge. Almost as much fun as chess, but easier to carry. Great way to relax while waiting for the zombie apocalypse or the bus to come. Thank-you and keep up the awesome work.  *UPDATE* 17 FEB 2018.  Have started my friends and family trying to get Top Score. No one is really trying as they are all enjoying playing the app to care. Brought a tear to my eye. Once again, "Thank-you"  for a truly  wonderful game.',
       'Simple tile game with a nice learning curve. Easy enough to be able to relax while playing and challenging enough to not be boring.  Instant gratification for finishing levels, packs, and difficulty ratings.  There are \'rolling points\' that I haven\'t figured out the use for yet. Coins to purchase hints and other stuff. The ball can have different \'skins\' that you unlock as you complete grpups of packs.  TLDR?  I\'m having fun. Maybe you can too.',
       'Great game. Starts easy so you can get your eye in and then gets harder. Fun to play and not so difficult that you give up and uninstal. Ads are over fairly quickly and I like that you can choose to watch some to get extra coins.',
       'Nice game I like it very much and in game if we don\'t have money so they ask watch and after watching video they give 100 or 200 Rs the game is very long and after win we got a new Ball',
       'I love this game and I just start playing and I already have the iron ball!how cool is that!..........but there is ad after I pass every levels.If you can please fix this thing! :)',
       'This game is awesome,  a great puzzle game. I only had it for about 3 weeks and already on pacgage 20 level 10 on expert. I  will have the game beat in a few days. Thanks for amazing game.' ],

     [ 'This is the best life simulator game by far. Instead of just focusing on getting rich this game has many other focuses like love, nationality, jobs, kids etc. The one thing that isn\'t at all necessary but I kind of want to see is a avatar for the character you\'re playing as. Perfect game. 😁👍  EDIT: hi just reporting on a glitch in the game. There\'s an option to transition your gender bit even though my character is over 18 they can\'t do it. Otherwise still a perfect game.',
       'I think it\'s incredible and I am hooked. Although I do hope for more such as, instead of just instagram famous, perhaps become a famed scientist, actor, writer, astronaut or business person OR be known as beloved (or not so) Educator/Teacher etc. A bit more drama added with partner/children good and not so good. Varying reactions to their dilemmas, perhaps even a child dating, married, having a child (grandkids) and other random child updates with or without the option to react accordingly. Overall, addictive and thoughtful game.',
       'Hi - playing this game for a few months now and a big fan. I suggested during beta phase that there should be an option of money management as well. We can be a millionaire but dont know what to do with all that liquid. We should be able to invest in moveable and immoveble assets. Should be able to open a company/business and invest in other company\'s stocks etc. This game will be even more interesting that way. Hope we will see these features soon. Thanks.',
       'I have been playing through the beta phase, and am completely hooked. You can pick it up and play whenever the mood strikes. It is easy to grasp, every new life is different, and it is engrossing without being addictive. Once you\'re done with a life you can create a new one or close the app and move on with your real one. There is no waiting for something to build or happen, there are very few ads and most are by choice to gain something. There are no in-app purchases to enhance game play, its all there from the beginning. The developers have done an incredible job with a simple concept.',
       'First of all, congratulations on the full release! I\'ve been playing this game for a few months now and I\'m absolutely hooked. Whenever I\'m bored or don\'t want to use my phone\'s data, I just play this game. There are a few things that I think would be cool to add in or go more in depth with, but other than that, this game is borderline perfect! I reccomend downloading',
       'I love this game so much! Something I\'ve been doing is playing a life then playing out the children from the previous life. Since the game doesn\'t have a grandchild feature (yet?), it makes it really fun to create family trees. I do hope some more fantastic features are added in the future, but it\'s amazing as of now!  One thing I definitely want to see though, is the inclusion of an Asexual option when it\'s time to decide sexuality. I was slightly disappointed when I saw that the only options for attraction are opposite attraction, same attraction, or both bit no neither option.' ],

Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.',
       'The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don\'t get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new "enemies". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you\'ve lost some lives. But that\'s not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.',
       'I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It\'s more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.',
       'Remember the old days when platformers taught you through trial and error how to interact with new game mechanics? If you don\'t like that, you\'ll hate this game. So much fun, so creative, and once you start to get down one of the new features, it ramps it up and keeps you learning creatively how to beat the level. I love this game, it\'s a fantastic platformer that will challenge you to learn as you go instead of giving you a tutorial every time something new comes up.',
       'Completed all but just couldn\'t get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I\'ve ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.',
       'I love this game 😍😍 it is my favourite but.... I don\'t like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it\'s a great idea😋😋 btw i loved it 😍😍😍 ill give it 5 stars then😊😊' ],

Your rewards are pretty crappy too. The "chances" when we\'re opening packs are not chances, it\'s "open as many as you want until you have no money left and still haven\'t gotten anything". If you\'re reading this (which you probably won\'t give a fuck about because you get this everyday), you better make some changes. If you\'re just hell-bent on making money, then you should go fuck yourself.',

Another weird thing is that this game disconnects soooo easily... I was playing it then I got disconnected and couldn\'t join back in. I then tried playing my other games and my Wifi was just fine. EA why did you update this game the fucking shooting is so messed up... You\'ve fucked it up so bad',

     [ 'I love the game, the crafting system is awesome, the gameplay is great. However, there are some points that I suggest  1. Nerf the Damned, also the Lepers, they are strong for beginners. Club can\'t beat them easily 2. Make another way to find leek seeds 3. Lepers can detect you sneaking to them, and they spawn out of nowhere. I don\'t know if it is a bug or not. 4. Cooking meat uses too much wood.  I look forward for more updates. It\'s a great game to be honest.',
       'This game is awesome but here are the things like really want in the next game. 1. I need to disconnect with Google play to delete my old saved progress full of mistakes. Please add this feature. 2. Zombies are too hard to beat . Please decrease some of their capabilities. 3. There must be an increase in chest slots . 4. Please decrease the quantity of wood logs to cook. Otherwise all of our hardworking to gather logs while be replaced by only a few meats and others. 6. Please add another source of getting seeds. They are too hard to get.',
       'The game is ok.. i love the idea.. but in all RPG and similar games you can accuire your items from when you died from your body in that zone.. also its good when you enter the inventory to pause the game.. when entering a zone the game should give some time before reseting the material and monsters if the player re-enters the same zone.. These are the most critical points so far i have encountered.. please take these in consideration.. thank you',
       'It does look good but I get the feeling it\'s a "stolen" idea of the game Last Day on Earth because it\'s almost the exact same thing with a few minor differences. But I\'m ok with that. I have both games and play them both. But this game has very sketchy game play, even with the graphics on low on my device, it\'s all fidgity while collecting in the resource areas. This game, though I think has better overall visuals that LDON, it still has a ways to go to get to a better game play as LEON. Keep up the good work!',
       '16 energy to move to the nearest forest!! Don\'t expect to build your house or collect resources in a day. This game has potential, but the energy spent to move to a forest is just too much that after an hour you would have to spend money to get energy just to collect resources. It\'s a shame that the gameplay is really smooth but the game is focused on making you pay to win/build in the first hour.',

     [ 'I\'m 11 and i love it so much.I have some Ideas for a toca kitchen 3. You can be able to make sandwiches and soups or stews. And more ingredients, more people. And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.',
       'I like how I can give the guests disgusting drinks and food a see and hear their really funny reaction! Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!😆😆 I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!',
       'Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I\'m sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP',
       'I\'m giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won\'t make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least',
       'This is the best game ever it is also funny because I was giving the girl food and I gave her some strawberries and I put a lot of lemon, hot sauce, Barbiecu sauce,Manas,keckup,salt, and pepper... SO funny, it also sounds just like a kid is playing with the food, that I\'m eating grapes right now,😂😂😂😂😁😀😊☺🙂😐',
       'I want YOU to read this Toca Boca I love it! But I have to ask, Why is there bread if you can\'t make a sandwich? Also can you make there a way to make soup? I really like your games but I am only 10,how do you expect me to pay for the games. At make 5 free like this!' ],

     [ 'Think about playing all day Ridiculously good graphics for a mobile game, excellent soundtrack that matches the intensity of each level, and never gets boring. The free version makes you restart from the beginning instead of checkpoints, but I don\'t even mind because it\'s still challenging and fun with each replay. I do wish I could play in a different mode for free though. This would be an awesome Zen game.',
       'So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn\'t save where I\'m at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won\'t be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!',
       'I am going crazy for this game. Great time killer and stress reliever. Graphics, music, and everything else is completely superb. I am totally enthusiastic about purchasing the premium version, however, I could not buy it because I do not have any credit or debit card. Can someone please tell me if there is other ways to purchase, like deducting the fee directly from my SIM balance, perhaps?',
       'I love this game.  It\'s very simple, just go without getting hit by glass or running out of balls, but it is a lot harder than it sounds.  I am forever telling myself I have time for just one more attempt, it is very addicting.  The 3d design on this is amazing and creative.  Up at the top it says to write a SHORT review, so this will end here.',
       'I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I\'ve decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I\'ve upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!',
       'Really fun and addicting! The first time i saw this app was when my dad told me about this game, he said that it was very good. Literally the first 10 minutes i played this game my mind was blown and i beacame addicted. Around 2 years later(now) i found this game again and instantly installed it. I love this game and I have played it for a long time. The graphics and music are amazing. This a really good game and you should install it! Who could think that glass could be so fun. However I think this game would be better if some of the thing you have to pay for would be for free.' ],

       'Really fun game! Just a couple of itsy bitsy things that get on my nerves. The coins you win are miniscule compared with how many you need when you use the Help function (even bumping it up to 5 coins for each correct answer would be better) & the other thing...I get that you need ads to keep these games free but does there need to be an ad after EVERY SINGLE PUZZLE??',

     [ 'This is all I needed: another Criminal Case game to take up my free time! I love the whole four of them. The the hidden objects tease my brain to no end. Each game  is intriguing with an original story line. I do have my favorite crime scenes,  and plenty of friends(all over the world) whom play as often as they can too!',
       'It would be nice if you level up and get full energy but your energy had some if not all left before you got it restored that you just increased by the full amount, the way it is now I lose energy when levelling up because it doesnt add any more to the 110 that is standard. I dont think it is fair to those of us who play daily. I never know when my pet will find that last batch of XP and cause the level up to happen. If I am over the 110 already, I don\'t even see the new energy. Some concessions need to be made for this. I love the game though, it is fun and challenging.',
       'I love this game. I have all of the criminal case games & love them all. The only things that I don\'t like is that when when ur energy gets refilled, it only adds to what u have, instead of adding an extra 110 to what u have. The other thing is that u can\'t buy none of the hamburgers, orange juice, chips or anything with ur tokens',
       'Love Criminal Case and a True Fan!! One thing I think should change is that whatever score you have when you level up, the 110 should be added to it. We deserve it  because we Earned it and the only reward we get is to share juice with other players. Give us a Happy Meal and 110 pts.!!',
       'DONT BOTHER WITH THIS GAME Played for 10 minutes before I ran out of energy, which you need to earn stars to progress! Then have to wait ages for it to recharge.  OR......pay to top it up. Don\'t think so. UNINSTALL IMMINENT',
       '4th instalment of the Criminal Case games. I love playing them all excellent time wasters intriguing story lines. I\'m well & truly hooked on the whole series. Gainsborough, Pacific Bay, Save The World & now this Mysteries Of The Past........ all brilliant' ],

     [ 'WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you',
       'Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It\'s pretty decent. I\'m enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I\'ve raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn\'t a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)',
       'First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I\'ll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC\'s (and MK\'s) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.',
       'As expected, it looks and performs amazing. Fighting mechanics and modes are pretty innovative and thrilling. It is quite stupid to compare the console version with mobile one. Each one has its own unique style, so they should NOT look the same, cz\' each one provides the fans with a different gaming experience. This surely increases the already huge number of fans of Tekken. 5 🌟 game',
       'Love that tekken is on the phone I was a master at it when I was younger no one could beat me with my combos and counters. The game play is good but having to heal at every opportunity is not. The fight should be about the fight not having to heal before going into the fight. If I could go into every fight with full health I would probably spend money on upgrades and fighters . It\'s good but not brilliant as tekken should be. It yous would like to hear what I have to say message me back because I love and loved tekken on the PS and Xbox one of my top 3. Games off all times. Keep up the good work but yous are not just there yet for me to spend money on it but overall it\'s good but not brilliant as it should be',
       'I just download this game today and every time i open it  in 10 to 15 sec game just close automatically. I haven\'t even do the tutorial yet this game just dont even open i love Tekken 7 i play every time in ps4 but i hate android Tekken cant even open. I will hope they fix this game.i have seen the gameplay on youtube i will give this game 5 star but only if i can play the game so untill then i will give one star because thia game graphics were cool on video Thnks for the update it works grat now' ],

But please add stuff like levers, iron doors, animals, Redstone, Buttons, iron trapdoors, texture packs, adventure mode,  Redstone torch\'s, Hoppers, Ripeters, dimensions like the Nether and The End, And other stuff from the game, "Minecraft". Also, add skin packs and make it like people can see there hand, and add mobs like dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, and foxes. Dogs, Man\'s best friend. Cats, Always cute. Birds, Watch them well you build. Rabbits, See them jump. Foxes. See one on an adventure. Please Also pay for Minecraft if you want it for stuff like Creepers. Also, add farm animals like chickens, sheep, cows, And other stuff like that. But plz do it. Also, add all paintings, pictures from Minecraft, and caves. I will Enjoy the game more if you do. Bye!',

The only issue I have is in survival mode there doesn\'t seem to be enough cows, and I have only managed to make some shoe armor. But then again, there\'s a lot I haven\'t figured out yet, but it\'s been fun learning.',
       'It is a nice game but it is just shot of (some) things.. e.g animals, red stone ,pail (can contain milk ,water and lava or it can be empty) , red stone torch, paintings (diffirent sizes),mobs. Also, it would be nice if you can label the items that we picked so that it would be easier for us to pick the item that we want. I hope you can add some more items into the game.it will be more thrilling to play. Thanks' ],

Make each car have its own sound, the sounds they\'re supposed to have. Add the car stats and add a nitro feature. Add the brand each car is supposed to have. Make the cars spit fire!. Add weather conditions like rain, thunderstorm, lightning, and windy.

Please add these cars on the next update!. If you can, add them in packs!',
       'I can\'t say I love it,maybe I can. But any way, this would have to be in one of top hundred games😀. There are a few things I would like added though. Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed this😀😁😀😁😀😁.',
       'What you should improve is that YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ADD\'s I MEAN SERIOUSLY I WATCH MORE ADDS THAN THE GAMEPLAY. I ONLY PLAY FOR A LITTLE THEN MOST OF ADDS SHOW UP. I WQ5CH ADDS THAN PLAY8NG THE GAME FOR CRYING OT LOUD!!',
       'This is crazy like I understand that you need ads but the fact that they are popping up on the middle of the screen is crazy! Like I woodnt mind if you had a small one at the bottom is the screen but the fact it pops up at random in the screen is really annoying and finds the game. I do love this game but the ads ruin it. Please fix this!',
       'This game was just really really good! But please please make the exact same game but instead, if you do something illegal like crash into another car, the cops start chasing you. If you do do this I will comment on every single game that comes up on the adds. But, there is a tiny bit to much adds. Anyways, AMAZING fame!!!😊',
       'HTC U11. Like the App for the most part. Would like to have option to drive on grand prix circuit. Most troubling issue is that after I spent $119.99 for 200,000 points I believed I would be able to purchase all vehicles and packs in this App and developer\'s other iterations of this same type of App. Turns out I wasn\'t able to purchase all vehicles in this App but couldn\'t use my points across developer\'s other racing App\'s. Now I\'m stuck with 185,000 points and pretty much out $100.00 does not make me happy at all. I would like this developer to contact me somehow as I don\'t have contact info. Thanks' ],

It says it failed because I would not allow them access to my friends list. Something doesn\'t seem right about that. Never had a game NOT allow me to login, after denying access to my friends list. Sorry, would prefer you not send messages to all my friends with my name tagged on it.',
       'Every once in a while when I get on I try to click my free spin and it won\'t work. So it\'s like my phone froze but I can play every other app. So it\'s just this game that freezes every once and a while. I have shut my phone down and turned it back on but I\'m not going to do that for every time I want to get on the app. I do really love it. It\'s just that it freezes so I can barely play it.',
       'As football based game it is superb, in terms of gameplay, graphics etc. But the biggest idiotic part of this game is that if freezes like magic. The whole game main screen becomes unresponsive and stays like that no matters the game is restarted or the damn phone is. Get this thing sorted out Miniclip. You have a reputation to maintain or not?',
       'At first I was skeptical about this game. I had downloaded it and went without playing for a couple of weeks. Then,one day I just happen to open the app and play. Best move I ever made for an app! This game is just flat out addicting, fun and challenging.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much fun it is and that there is, most of the time, something new.  Chalkenign friends and new people always makes for a challenging and fun time waster. Even if I don\'t have the time to play, I still make time!! Haha',

     [ 'I used to love this game, very addictive but recent updates have made the game have too many elements (clubs - who cares???) Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels "fixed" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.',
       'This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.',
       'I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn\'t really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don\'t know how many more points you need.',
       'This game has many issues! It continually freezes and shuts me down. I can no longer play on my tablet, which I purchased just for games, and have to use my phone. I don\'t like using my phone because it drains my battery. I am so ready to quit this game and return to candy crush instead. Latest updates have rendered JP and other perks useless.',
       'Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the "boards" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it\'s addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It\'s becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.',
       'I don\'t know if a review is still available  after a game has been deleted. The game was fun to play I\'ll say that. I didn\'t need 5 push notifications coming @ me in the middle of the night however. The one that came through @ 3:17 a.m. was it for me, I\'m out.' ],

The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there\'s only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can\'t beat them! Keep making more awesome games!',

I have soent the last 3 hours trying to upgrade my helm to lvl 15. Guess where it is now, On goddamn lvl 11. I have spent less time grinding mounts in wow than getting my gear to lvl 15. Stupidest thing ever. One tip. Play the campagin lvls to lvl 40. Then dont do campagin at all and run hell for gold and xp. Repeqt to lvl 80 and then get rekt by the stupid item upgrade system.',

By far the best game that advertises it is not pay to play. Because it\'s not, despite the option to buy coins.',

I listen to podcasts while playing games and every minute or so my sound cuts out completely to prioritize the ad. Earn the ad by giving me a decent amount of playtime before it and stop overriding my audio.',

     [ 'My game is literally unplayable right now. For about a week now, it has randomly just lagged out and would take 5 seconds for every action to actually take place. Now, when i boot up the game, it just freezes when i click on anything. My shop tries to open but just goes to a black screen and freezes. I will try to play for a few more days, but if i cant play by the end of the weekend, i will be deleting the game.',
       'What is wrong with the newest update? I can\'t acquire my item from the switch shop. Every time I click on get item, the black screen goes to the top left of the screen. And I can see the normal background picture. When that happens I have to close the game and reset. I\'ve tried to get the item 20 times and it does that every time.',
       'Was a great game til the update. Now I have to open it twice for my energy to update and for the money in the pawn shop to change. Also when I bargain with clients now it\'s alway a negative profit compared to before. More annoying then anything',
       'It\'s a fun game my only complaints are that you have to wait until your energy refills. There is no way to earn energy and you should make it so you can customize and/or upgrade your shop. Make it more exciting. Also you open the building that say they will finish construction soon because the game gets boring if there no excitement added to it.',
       'Cool. Fun. But your guys really need to fix the bugs. I would load it and keep it open doing certain things (playing a auction getting a item appraised and it would FREEZE or take absolutely forever. I would have to close the game out and re load it.',
       'Game is great but every time I go to the pawn shop now my screen goes black so I\'m stuck and can\'t really play.  Need some assistance, don\'t want to have to delete and start over.  My wife had the same problem on the other bid wars app and lost everything.' ],

     [ 'Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!',
       'In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it\'s newer it\'s boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star',
       'Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can\'t just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can\'t advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it\'s basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.',
       'This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said "add break". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them.',
       'The game desparately needs to offer more coins as skill level increases.  The frequency of coins remains the same while the skill level demands more and more coins (in the thousands).  Watching ads helps, but the player finds themselves doing that exclusively, which defeats the purpose of the game.  Physics, graphics and gameplay are good.',
       'One Of My Favorite Games  So. Let me start of by saying I LOVE it! So I like very few games, in fact nearly no games. But this  game is epic! It\'s interactive, fun, motivate and time killing. But there is one problem and that\'s there are to many adds and most of them are inappropriate' ],

It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven\'t bothered to update this in years.',
       'Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can\'t stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn\'t happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can\'t buy any of the bikes.',
       'After only playing a few short but addicting levels, I am already having a blast! The game may not look spectacular on a technical level. But the gameplay is so freaking fun! And the controls aren\'t too complicated either. Recommended for everyone!',
       'Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you\'re racing friends.',
       'Bugs and Glitches... Multiplayer links are not being sent back and forth properly. Some games keep giving me desert level 1 and not showing any replays or ghost bikes are doing a different levels then the one I am suppose to be racing against. Please Fix!!!',
       'I love playing this game but id give it no stars seeming that there are so many ads and when I collected enough stars for a ghost bike I DIDNT GET IT!! HORRIBLE!! unless you can fix this, you\'re not getting a good review on my hand. Oh and also, for anyone wanting to know, it\'s 21 dollars a month for some bikes. Not in real life. Wow such a great deal... No really a great deal.' ],

     [ 'Solid mahjong solitaire.   Lots of boards, and daily puzzles to play.  A little heavy on the ads if you want to play days in the month you\'ve already passed.  And ads in between each lvl.  You can pay 2 bucks to remove the ads, but isn\'t necessarily going to make the experience better.  The ads are short, for the most part, but still can get annoying if you\'ve played 10 puzzles in a row.  And considering you can complete a puzzle under or around the 2 min mark, those ads add up.  Worth a dl if you enjoy this type of game.',

     [ 'This game needs the ability to gain more township cash. I have spent way too much real money to buy township cash and im not doing so again at this rate. Farmville isnt this bad and hard to expand.  You cant expand the barn without waiting on products by train or paying in township cash to expand. And that costs over a couple hundred township cash for each expansion. Getting a dollar or two here and there takes forever to collect. Plus the expansion makes small expansions so it doesnt help much.   If something dont change i may quit the game. I enjoy it and would like to continue but at this rate i dont see much point. I cant afford to pay more money to play.',

NO pop ups or commercials. !!!. . the inventors are genius... i Love this game..  thank you for making this game.. Graphics are Amazing!!!   Best farming game ...Bonus Zoo !!!...and breed ur animals ADORABLE BABIES.. with a splash of Cityville  ..Gold digging..making ingots to use...  So many optional tournaments if u want to win more money n prizes in the Regattas... Township friends make it SO much easier n fast 4 everyone  .. and so much more You just HAVE TO Try TOWNSHIP ❣💞',
       'The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen',
       'Great game very addictive, and I don\'t know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats\'s kind of ridiculous. That\'s the only bad thing I have to say about this game.',
       'BEST GAME EVER! It\'s my biggest game but even though I have an old phone the game still runs really smoothly. There\'s always something to do, it never gets boring. I\'ve been playing for 8 months. Super easy to use and learn. It\'s addictive. You also don\'t feel pressured to make purchases like other games.',
       'I\'m not a game player, but this game is a lot of fun, AND, you never have to spend a dime! Of course, unless you want to spend money!  I do wish the direction went into a little more depth. It would make it a little easier for new people to understand the extra things, like the snow boarding and the regatta.' ],

Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It\'s a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It\'s very competitive!!! I swear my husband can\'t beat my score no one has lol',
       'It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone\'s or tablets I find it hard to control I don\'t know if anyone else thinks so but that\'s my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company',
       'It\'s good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it\'s my opinion so don\'t get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don\'t have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn\'t play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀',
       'Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface',
       'A very addictive game that\'s great fun! The only problem is with the controls. It seems to go too fast without even hitting the speed button (if you have played it you will know what I mean). IMO the speed function is uneccesary, take it out of the game and it\'s 5 stars all the way!',
       'Worst game played ever . Too irritating , so many adds . Very disappointed . I was just seeing the ratings and I thought it will be good but after that I got very much angry. PLEASE NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. Slither.io is much better game than this one. Worst game controls' ],

     [ 'lnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'I love the game play and graphics. But I payed for adidas female clothing and an aquarium previously on the game, and then when I restarted, they have gone. I spend £3 on it in total and I actually spent more money on other things that didn\'t come back in the next game, but it\'s understandable because they were lifestyle points and you know it\'s currency not clothing or furniture. I uninstall sims sometimes a bit of always go back and before my items were there, but now they\'re not and that really frustrated me. I actually ended up in 2017 spending  £10 on sims freeplay and that\'s the only money I think I will ever spend on ot now because if you restart,  you don\'t get anything you wanted. Please fix this because I spent that money and I could\'ve bought something else with it but I didn\'t because I like sims.',
       'Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools "playable",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it\'d be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.',
       'First, I don\'t like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don\'t like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you\'re just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!',
       'I like everything about this game no questions asked but i do find a few things annoying the main one is selling items in you inventory 1 at a time i wish there was a sell all for an item that would make this less annoying  to sell after house building and such. Please add a sell all oh and when do you think you can make more quests i really like doing them.',
       'For the fact that we can\'t sell multiple items at once is a big downer. I have accumulated so many windows, computers, chairs etc with watching the daily news ads and it\'s a complete pain to delete 30, 50, 70 or even more! items one by one. Please consider adding this function in the app as it\'s in the real The Sims games.' ],

They\'re twice as fast and you can only knock off 3 cars at the beginning of the race and you\'re unable to catch with others. Even if you spend money, you will not get 1st place in a lot of the races. Very unbalanced game. Whoever programmed the ai should be fired  Fun game, but the intrusive ads are ridiculous. It pops up in the middle of a race, before and after the race, finished off by asking you to pay to remove ads.',

I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?',

     [ 'Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON\'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!',
       'Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I\'ve basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I\'ve got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.',
       'A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it\'s a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you\'ve done them and reached level 10 on both, there\'s really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.',
       'Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot\'s more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn\'t bother me that much. 5 stars for the team',
       'It\'s a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the \'colony\' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you',
       'Its a great game but ive fully upgraded my earth space ship and i am level 10 on earth and mars. I have about 8000 people on europa and theres no more planets to discover so its boring now. We want alot more plants and diffrent upgrades!!' ],

     [ 'Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you\'re given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.',
       'I\'ve reached on level 93 been at it for almost a week now. And it makes absolute no sense no matter which way I go. For example I will shoot a blue colour to burst the same colour and another colour shoots out. Can you fix this? It\'s frustrating. It\'s a game I selected to relax my mind but it quite becoming the opposite. I cannot give a 5*',
       'Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.',
       'Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.',
       'The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item.',

To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed',
       'I hope in the new update you can upgrade the engine and body kits as well. That would bring back the fast and the furious Season 7 track 6 nexts to be check it says three lap but you are basicly doing lap 2 twice and it says wrong way. Third lap starts when u finish three laps and doing 4th lap counts as 3rd lap. Needs to be looked at this is cheating  u guys are doing',

       'Awesome Game... no need to spend money to get best cards you can easily earn them... Can play offline too... There is a glitch though in season 7 - save 8 second stage... even after finishing it wont give 3 stars and fails me.',
       'Fix the detection when you touch/hit in perfect drift mode. There\'s been hundreds of times where ive definately not hit and yet it ends. So Infuriating, love the game but that one detail could definitely be optimized better. The drift should not end unless you actually hit and it screws up your direction. 4/5',
       'I love this game and so do all my mates. It dose have a few light glitches as most games do. I would love a night track of some kind in the future but other wise great game all together. Also out of all the drifting games this is the best one at of all of them.' ],

     [ 'It\'s like owning your own transportation service like Uber or Lyft, but in arcade Crazy Taxi meets Monopoly. If you hire drivers to your service, you not only make more money, but you expand your  territory. I love the diversity of the characters, how you have new with the classic arcade characters like Axel, Gus and Gena. And I also love the concept is modern, but has the classic arcade concept and feel with the scratch cards, gems, and money. Bonuses are earned through accomplishing objectives, and of course, ads.

       'To get better you must view at least 6, 30+second adverts per day. Or it will be really slow to lvl up.',

       'If you like watching ads this is the game for you.  The game idea is good and intially starts well, however to get further through the game you have to watch ads to increase bonuses, and you need the bonuses to get further in the game.  However good soundtrack.' ],

     [ 'This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further.',

I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you\'ve ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?',

Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance',

It took me ages to work out how to unlock the new skins...click on the banner that has the amount of diamonds you\'ve collected and what looks like 3 sheets on top of one another  (it comes up before you press the start key...)',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME This is good game design. It rewards you no matter how high you go with a beautiful little tower. The colors are really satisfying. It keeps me engaged since you can "regrow" your blocks. That creates tension too--something to strive for. It\'s so simple but soothing and really addictive!!',

I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I\'m in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren\'t too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I\'m happy to say that. I don\'t like to stay too long. Great game!',

I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don\'t really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!',
       'Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn\'t have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic.' ],

     [ 'I never had to pay a single cent for this game, and it\'s working out perfectly fine for me. Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don\'t like my non-responsive faction members and I\'m worried once I leave my faction I couldn\'t join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.',
       'Game is really good! Currently level 10 & I am doing pretty good. (For what I think) It\'s a fun game to play you can get free coins which makes it more fun and fair for players that can\'t pay for anything, except patience. I do wish it\'ll be easier to level up characters. But it\'s pretty easy. Just so difficult to get more characters to pay for level ups.',
       'This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn\'t make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!',
       'Company is a joke. Never play their games. Dont not install this game unless you expect to spend alot of money to even try to be competitive. There is massive amount  of hacking and cheating and support as no ability to help at all. I would never recommend this game to anyone. The cons far out weigh the pros. Scopley does not care about gameplay or its players at all.',
       'No one from the support team will respond. My game was unistalled and reinstall and I lost 2 years worth of data. Can\'t remember sync it and I know scopely can do it for me. I\'ve provided everything they need and still nothing via email or in-game support. Will change my rating if this is sorted',
       'Awesome game based on the comics. The only set back is that I can\'t seem to be able to download the content for the third chapter on the story map. It goes so far into the download and then stops.   I have already uninstalled and reinstalled the game three times. And I have even deleted unused/unwanted files from my phone to free up some extra space, and it hasn\'t made any difference.   I don\'t know what else I can do.' ],

     [ 'I like it...it\'s really fun. My only problem is that whenever i don\'t start a ritual but i have gems in the totem it keeps asking if I\'m sure i don\'t wanna start a ritual and sometimes when I was upgrading traps and didn\'t want to risk it i clicked on it by accident and then lost gems even tho i didn\'t even realize i had started a ritual nor did i intend to start one. This is really annoying for me. And made me want to quit a few times',
       'Not a fan of the new guild battle system, having to steal gems just increase your reward for that season. Most of the time I increase my gem from gems from my mines and all. Once in a while a steal a gem. This just feels like it\'s aimed towards people who actually play this non stop and are really good',
       'Overall, this is a good game, but if you lose your connection during a raid, you cannot go back to it unless you waste more of your keys.  Also, it matches players up by the league their clan is in so you\'ll have high level players stealing gems from the new players.  Lastly, the only way to be able to actually play the game steadily, you need to buy the subscription. Otherwise, you only have enough keys for one raid every hour or two.  Because of this, I don\'t really play anymore. I may start up again if they start making the game fair... I\'m not holding my breath though...',
       'It\'s good I guess but it\'s just that there are dungeons that are completely impossible for anyone to do. This game isn\'t supposed to be about being a try hard and I really think that there should be a report button if there is no way to complete someone\'s dungeon. I\'ve gotten and tried to beat a dungeon but as soon as I spawn I ram right into a trap or there\'s no way to jump over the trap. I think there should be something like that because a lot of players are quitting playing because you got try hards that make their dungeons impossible so even if they steal a gem you may as well kiss it goodbye',
       'This game is fun and a great idea but there is way too much luck involved. The wheel spins are everything and I had a gem worth 17000 stolen then I got a flawless on this dude\'s base then I spun once missed it then spun again and still missed it even though that is a very low chance. TOO MUCH LUCK',
       'Had it before decided to re-install.Great concept very short and sweet.I think if the co-op.Like creating the gang of theives its not dark but in fact funny but i think if people picked up on making teams or something like a clan on Clash of Clans lol #1 game out there lol shout out day 1 fan lol. Never leave a comment decided today lol and it was fun...but i did have this game yrs back and theyve definitely made some improvements.thanks guys' ],

Not that it happens often, but when you\'ve spent 50 diamonds for a one hour key and you lose 3 to 4 minutes  getting back in the game it sucks. How can your game allow this to happen !!! At least design a way to return the time lost to the player. Thank you.',

     [ 'Well let\'s see ..played the game fixed 7 cars and I made about $70,000 on the game I bought another car and had to replace just about all the parts on it I bought all the parts and was in the process of putting all the parts on it and in the middle of that ,the game shut down on me I opened it back up to continue playing and it had started back over from the beginning at the tutorial and I lost all progress. y\'all need to fix this. until this is fixed and or I am put back where I was on the game then I would not recommend downloading this game or any of the other mechanic games for 2018, much less even playing it. it\'s a waste of time and data also had a trouble with the other 2018 version mechanic game you will see a posting on that one where it\'s not giving enough time to fix panels and it\'s not registering clicking on panels to find out if anything\'s messed up on them .thanks for the problems and the issues. This game is on this phone of mine and the other game is on my other phone developers. You\'ll see a post on the other garage mechanic 2018 game by Wesley wright. Yaw need to fix these issues ok , because these bad ratings I have been seeing by others isn\'t looking good for you games.',

       'After playing this on the PC, I had high hopes for this. However, it never quite delivers, even though the potential is there.  Unfortunately, all you can do is restore barnfinds, rather than helping customers. This is a really a big miss, as that\'s what a mechanic often does.  The bodywork repairs are so dumbed down, which is probably done to make it more accessable for younger players. Unfortunately, by doing that, it doesn\'t feel engaging at all. It really feels like a toddler\'s game in that respect.  Fixing the rest of the cars is more to my liking, although it feels like it us missing a ton of content. I want to repair stuff myself instead of simply buying parts, test things with meters, lift the car with proper lifts, tyre machines, all that sort of stuff. Obviously a mobile game cant always create a carbon copy on a mobile platform, but in this case it feels like too much content has gone missing, even for a mobile game.  And last but not least, making people wait for new cars to fix with timers on the barns is just a no-no. You want us to play, but not too much. You rather have us pay to play properly. For me, that\'s probably the most annoying part of the entire game. Due to repairs being dumbed down so much, you fly through \'em. So after 10 mins of playing you get stuck waiting for a barn to open up. Terrible. Feels like there\'s an \'uninstall\' coming up...' ],

     [ 'Overall the game itself is pretty good and worth the download for a good couple hours of fun even with a few friends. However I would highly recommend not spending any money on the in game purchases. I got ripped off, luckily with in game currency only and the "game team" is adamant that nothing went wrong. If that is the type of support they give I wouldn\'t want something to go wrong with my actual money. So long story short as long as u don\'t spend money u should have a good time playing',
       'Love the game defiantly 5* just a couple of comments I hope get read it would be nice to gain some coins through friendly battles with people in your clan. Also if you could see when your group member\'s were last active it would be easier to sort out our clans. Thanks',
       'Pay to play, unplayable if you don\'t pay. Got to level three and could no longer match against anyone lower than level 8 so I never had a chance.',
       'I fall in love with this game !!! Amazing combination of card and strategy game. Very nice, quick and enjoyeble gameplay. Customer Support is very reliable and very helpfull. Do you really need money, or Legendaries !? No, you dont !!! I got to castle 8 (3000 Trophies) in 3 weeks with no money and no Legendaries !!! The only thing you need is to have a reliable, supportive clan !!! Dont miss any chests, create consistent deck and have a good decision making in game !!! Have Fun Guys !!! xD',
       'Game is addictive but i feel that some time mana comes fast some time not also game is providing some cards to some special zones person only so decreasing my stars from 5 to 4 by editing..... Sorry growth in game after level 6 becomes slow not happy with that',
       'THE PEOPLE THAT CREATED THIS GAME ARE STUPID IMBACILS SINCE THE CLAIM TO FIX BUGS BUT THE IGNORE THE BIGGEST ONE YET. OPENING CHESTS FREEZES THE PHONE. WHY EVEN HAVE AN ANIMATION WHILE OPENING A CHEST.  YOUR ANIMATION SUCKS ANYWAY.. USELESS!!!!!' ],

     [ 'It was fun to play earlier but as you reach the higher levels it becomes frustrating it seems like purposely it is not completing the challange ,.. my level is 1629 how much I try it is failed by single ball   ... It looks that they are not having further challanges  but  not agree to accept',
       'It\'s not fully free. It\'s designed to make you pay for extra bonuses otherwise it would be very difficult to pass a level. Uninstalling for this reason.',
       'I\'m about ready to give up on this.  The \'laser\' balls introduced around level 1260 are both unplayable and completely pointless. The game is all about popping bubbles, well... it was until this point.   I was hoping to push through to the final levels but as long as these are in the game I really can\'t be bothered.   Honestly, when I have to guess the best time to launch balls based on totally random evidence... and lose when those balls are gobbled up for reasons I cannot fathom...  Following on... I\'ve reached level 2082 and cannot possibly see how to  get further than about half way through with the balls provided!  I guess if I stick at it for a month or so I might be able to accumulate enough bonus balls to have a chance!  And there I was thinking that 2076 was tough!     And I **still** hate the laser balls!   Been playing for a year now... on the free version... you guys must have earned a motza from all the adverts that I\'ve displayed!!  Update - I think I\'ve found a bug in level 2215 - whenever I launch a ball it is immediately invisible and doesn\'t seem to have any effect on the balls it\'s aimed at. Randomly a ball will cause others to drop... sometimes invisible ones will appear as they drop.  I\'ve rebooted the phone... problem still here.',

     [ 'I kind of miss the old version because isn\'t that why they came out with a 2nd game so if we eant more we got it.  Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.',
       'I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I\'m playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can\'t complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍',
       'This game is both funny as serious it\'s a great way to make kids understand the danger of some things around them. Like trains and wires and different things. As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.',
       'This game is really good and fun but strate after you lose all 3 of your lives it goes straight onto an add. There are loads of adds and I don\'t think it needs that much adds for a game like dumb ways to die, on the other hand it\'s a grate game and it\'s a laugh and a joke, I think it\'s a really good game☺',
       'I think that there could be less ads. When I\'m trying to replay he game an ad pops up which is really annoying. What I would say is that this is an excellent game but just less of the ads',

       'Graphics are awesome, but the game itself is very monotonous. You can fall asleep waiting for something to change and make it more exciting. When a change such as an added bonus does come (bomb or a rainbow bubble) you realize that it wasn\'t worth the 20 or 30 levels you just wasted your time on. Progressive enticing events need to happen more quickly.',

It\'s not a game a advertising app, isn\'t this too much hance i know you developers make money on the game but just because of this much ennoying adds when people uninstall this app you won\'t be able to make anything out of your effort can you???' ],

       'The game is really buggy. I just started playing, and entering battle (after making your first blade) takes a tremendous amount of time just for the enemies to load in. If that was not bad enough, the entities get stuck when the blade goes through them (mostly when the goblin guy spawns). Im going to keep the game installed in the hopes that these bugs will be ironed out soon. I love the idea this game presents, but I literally can\'t play it because i cannot progress through the beginning of the game due to these bugs. I reinstalled the game, but the issues still persisted. Please fix so i can enjoy your game. Thank you.',

     [ 'Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn\'t came in two years it probably isn\'t. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don\'t pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges.',
       'Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.',
       'I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.',
       'this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It\'s a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that\'s it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame',
       'Great game, addictive, in a good way. This is one of the few games that is addictive, but does not take up a large amount of your day, unlike some game (Clash Royale), I feel it\'s not Pay to Win. Great job guys, thanks for making an entertaining, relaxing, non time consuming, free to play and win game. Graphics can be bested.',
       'Funny characters, endearing cartoon aesthetic and enjoyable game play, but after a couple hunts forces you to wait over 8 minutes before you can actually play again (in order to entice you to pay to make the wait times go away). What kind of game compels you to QUIT out of BOREDOM after playing it for 5 minutes?' ],

       'Found a game called "Infinite Balls" on my friend\'s iPhone, we loved it. This is the best Android alternative we could find, but it\'s not quite as satisfying. Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls. Would be nice to turn off the help lines, too.',

     [ 'Game unresponsive to any input on Nvidia Shield / Android TV as of the Feb 28 release.  It worked great before. Now the game starts but then it’s unresponsive to any input (controller, remote, keyboard). Other games work normally. I tried everything. Running latest version of OS, cleared game cash, game data, uninstalled game, restarted Nvidia Shield then reinstalled game. Same thing, not accepting any other input.  If this problem is resolved, I will edit my review back to 5 stars since I love the game.',
       'Update: the game keeps stealing coins from me. I had 227 coins, won a single prize, immediately play a game or two with the character, and the next time I looked I only had 16 coins. And that is not the only time it has done that. Very frustrating.   Original review: The only real thing I\'d love to be changed is the ability to switch it so the game slants upwards from the left to the right. That way, if you are using your right hand, your thumb doesn\'t block the view of oncoming traffic.',

     [ 'I never write reviews, but this game really deserves a high one. I got this game because my friend Emily adores it, and I have been playing NON STOP. It\'s so beautiful and high quality for just a dress up game. It\'s absolutely wonderful. My favorite thing is that you can really enjoy the game without having to use real money on in app purchases. Yeah, you can if you want to, but your experience isn\'t less if you don\'t. A high quality and fun game. I adore it',
       'As much as I really love the artwork and gameplay, there is still an issue: can you please make all of the current and future makeups compatible with all skin tones? It\'s not really fair for those who aren\'t of pale skin. Thank you for all the progress and work made so far, & I really hope that there\'s a way you can make this happen. Thanks!   (I would give a full five stars if everyone could have equal ability to wear different makeups)',
       'I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I\'m a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events.',
       'In depth in both gameplay and attention to details of awarded items. Continuous hours not required but with once a day of incentive activities. Controls are  sometimes unstable. If a glitch does happen, its fixed fast and your also awarded for time spent. Very happy customer. Enjoyed the best dress up game I\'ve played so far. Thank you makers!',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for about 5 months now, it has amazing graphics and wonderful gameplay. My only problem with it is a lot of the times its very difficult to obtain the events suits. I feel like the only way for you to complete a suit is to spend some sort of cash. I get that you have to make an earning but it just makes the game annoying to play. I would also like more skin tone options and would like the makeup to be compatible. Anyways thank you for creating a wonderful game.',
       'Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted' ],

     [ 'So nearly perfect. I tried several and they all had too many ads... some (others) with startling loud sounds that you couldn\'t turn off! Very upsetting! THIS game, however, has only ONE ad at the start of each game, and allows you to mute the sound "once" for all future ads. It\'s simple to click the ad off before the game commences. *wink* The background is lovely and the graphics are wonderful! So relaxing. The happy little "card dance" animation after each win is nice, as well. Thank You!',
       'It\'s a fine enough game, I mean it\'s solitaire.  However the app refuses to allow Pandora to run in the background unfettered.  I listen to a lot of music, all the time and if this app can\'t work my life, I can\'t work with this app.  Also too many adds.  I understand that some one needs to pay for the development and what not... Just make me buy the damn app.',
       'I love this app!  It helps kill time,  keeps your mind occupied and before you know it.  Waiting to see your Doctor seems a few minutes lol. Cons are wish there weren\'t too many ads. When the ads pop up, it kind of ruins the game. Other than that, great!!!',
       'Had an old version that was pretty fast and got used to it. This in comparison is kinda slow, like real cards! I will get used to it. Otherwise, really like this solitaire game. Picked it over several others.',

     [ 'Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can\'t play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.',
       'One of the few games that I don\'t mind spending a bit i.e. $10+ every month. Requires team guild effort to achieve stuffs together definitely gives a good feeling. Event is weekly and community is lively. Card\'s artwork feels like Rage of Bahamut but using matching puzzle style to deal damage. Skills of card matter as well increasing the complexity and fun. Only thing to improve would be cheaper ingame currency to encourage more people to have better decks thus higher activity rates.',
       'It\'s a lot other games of this type. I haven\'t been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you\'re looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn\'t find any more connections, that would be great!',

       'Its a match 3, pay to win game with heroes. Its pay to win lootbox style pay to win mechanics enures that unless you are extremely lucky or9 intend to pay alot, you wouldnt win jack. The match 3 RNG can also make the game infuriating, such as when there is little to no matches or the matches are for colors which yohr team doesnt have. However, unlike other match 3 games, it is fun for longer.',
       'Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I\'m watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability.

I really really like this game, it\'s fun and a good time waster. how ever I DON\'T like how your trying to make people pay for it in in-game "dollars", I was fine with watching adds for them considering that\'s how all devs make their money. Now you get rid of that option and are trying to force me to buy into your game which you basically made it a pay to win. take a tip from EA with battle front II, IT DOESN\'T WORK. Please stop. I would rather pay for life\'s than rewind ability, or just let people out right buy the game and play as much as they want. So I like the game, but the devs will ruin it if this gold farming scheme goes on, it makes me not wanna play anymore or even have the game on my phone. Just make a game for everyone to play and the OPTION to buy things, other wise you\'ll kill this game that has a lot of potential.',

     [ 'Sir i have some problems. My suits has low DPS from my other friends I upgrade all skills but nothing happend. My osteo x mediam lvl.1 has 840DPS and i compare my friends they has more DPS.  When i up on the small vehicle with my  Monster Truck(heavy vehicle)  the small vehicles can\'t wreak. Plzzzzz do something for me. It\'s a request. My problems are not solved.',
       'This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.',
       'Honesty its just like GTA which a great thing but the thing is the installation time let me share my experience to one and all reading hear... When I was downloading it at the first its done but it starts downloading once again but I am not sure is it my problem but I just wanted to share with you guys... The game is boss',
       'Best game I\'ve ever played! In fact it is the only game I\'ve had on my phone for 2 years. But there are some minor errors that keep occurring, such as when you are running or driving any vehicle, the control pad keeps stopping and I have to lift my thumb up and put it back down to regain control. Now I know it doesn\'t sound like much, it can mess up your drifts and the gas will stop as well. PLEASE FIX. Thanks',
       'It\'s a very great game,Nothing but love.   But I got a notification  that there is an update,I updated the game but I still can\'t find the new added missions in the game. Secondly I am on day 87 and my day 90 supposed  Reward changed after I downloaded the update.',
       'I don\'t understand why  diamonds are required to craft materials. As a F2P player it is difficult for me to craft new materials. The old updates never had this rubbish. Please fix ASAP.Will install again if it is fixed.' ],

The only reason I made a real purchase was so that I wouldn\'t have ads, so can someone please remove the ads from my account. On another note, I really like this, and nice to see Shadow playable again.',

The battleships and details are amazing and even better when you\'re in battle. To all future fleet commanders download and enjoy plus I\'ve been playing this for over a year or so now and it still is my go to game. So if you\'re new to Rpg try this one. All hands to battle station\'s.',
       'Movga not answer requests, game very expensive if you want to play and on the top of this you could not trust developers  because you are charged for items you did not get,graphic effects your eyes  and if you\'re longer playing you could asleep. All the time game crashes and stalls, Samsung galaxy S7 was locked several times. Game is developed for crazy profit  and normally you should pay to have fun  otherwise some one will but not you.',
       'The game seems to go through faze\'s some times good some times just ok. If you only speak english it can be very taxing, not to friendly at times. Has a very clicky higher archery . If you fall out with them you can have wasted all the money you put into the game.',
       'Great game. Kills time and unfortunately my battery too. Would be good to have a facility to tell you your battery strength (may be next to the clock?). One of the better RPG I have played and updates aren\'t obtrusive.',
       'Game would be better if was based on skills rather than how much money you can spend on it. They should remove prosperity as it is abused before legion battles or regional battles. The players with the deepest pockets win no skills required... I love the game but the model is wrong.',
       'The translator needs fixing,  it\'s ok but could be a lot better,diamonds keep vanishing and there are other issues in game I don\'t like, it seems some legiins have preferential treatment regarding tasks and rewards. Other issues with the chat keyboard freezing or not working properly.' ],

And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.',

Fix then 5 stars',

     [ 'I like the game, and it\'s addictive, but the mechanics are absolutely flawed. There have been tons of instances where the game has unfairly screwed me or other player\'s over. 1. Places mystery boxes in front of the player who drives second, but not the first player. 2. Hills like to stop a ball, that is being shot full force by an iron club, in it\'s tracks. 3. The swinging spike balls only affect some players golf balls, but not others.  Things like this piss people off, because they expect the game to be fair. Those small things easily aid a player in losing a match.',
       'Game cheats, puts you against lower lol players with better equipment who make ungodly shots, or much higher level where you don\'t have a chance. I hit things that aren\'t there, and with a crossword my ball will fly into the wind with no action. Opponent Always get better wind and direction, and will outshoot you work lower equipmeny.',
       'The game doesnt allow you to get a proper pull back on your swing. To much clutter on some stages. Plus those who play too win always beat those who dont',
       'Uhm... Playing cod pissed me off so much because of the hacking I stopped playing. Same goes for this game..good luck to all that want to play and get ripped off. F U .',
       'Where to begin with this garbage game. The game designers aren\'t sure whether gems or strokes should win the hole. Oh..out of bounds shots don\'t incur penalties, which is idiotic. Also, pairings vary wildly in an unfair manner. You could have someone with 500 more exp. than you..hardly fair. Also, the opponent might have a tail wind of 4mph, but your shot moments later has a headwind. Again, poor conception and unfair. Just avoid this game. The inconsistency is bewildering and having an opponent win the hole even though they hit out of bounds is stupid.',

     [ 'To many ads, even if they make the game free.. Pathetic. Conflicts with game when trying to back out of them and even crashes. Inconsistent game play, twitchy controls at times. Unplayable shots where one number on power scale is to hard the next one down is to soft.  Multi player has a feel of being rigged at times.  Potential for a good game but not yet in my books.',
       'Super fun game, but WAY TOO MANY crashes. I\'ve been struggling with a level several times only for the game to crash mid-level and I lose all my progress getting booted back to the beginning. Infuriating!',
       'Awful controls, heavily focused on buying coins & watching ads just to play matches. Not recommended!',
       'This game is good. You should try to make it a lot more like golf with friends (the Steam game). Try to make the graphics look more detailed and better. Add more maps too.',
       'Some observations: ball does not rebound off rails as they should, especially the back and side rails near the hole, where the ball hits the rail and stops dead. Part of miniature golf mastery is using the rails but not in this game. And when the ball is against a rail a shot is allowed as if the rail was not present. After a shot the screen should automatically rotate close to what the next shot would be expected so as to minimize manual rotation. I was making a long swipe to rotate almost 180° and my finger hit the power slide and an errant shot was made. Most hills are not smoothly sloped but instead very angular. Hitting the bottom of the slope causes the ball to jump in ways unanticipated rather than roll. This is golf, not basketball. I uninstalled the game because it just wasn\'t as fun and realistic as I had hoped.',
       'I love it for its simplicity as well as it\'s complexity lol it\'s a great game to pass the time with excellent controls.  Love the online mode too.' ],

       'I think if you could add a few extra spaces for more ninja then everybody would be happy .the reason I\'m giving this app a 4 star rating is because you can only have up to five ninja on a mission including your own .if anybody would like that to happen then give this review a thumbs up.',

     [ 'I rather enjoy the game a lot. It feels balanced for the most part,  leveling takes a while which wouldn\'t be a issue if it didn\'t take so long to go place to place. Gets sort of annoying to go back and forth trying to get resources and the game goes from fun to grindy quickly.   My main issue is the battery life of my phone. While charging my phone and playing this game but battery was being drained.  Graphics are good, I enjoy the crafting and base building, the combat is nice, and the auto harvest feature is a life saver.',
       '**UPDATE** Is an awesome game. Could use a few more perks (ie. Weapons and hard to get items) in drop boxes and yellow zones.Now the down side is if you die in a level your last position is no longer there to try and recoup some of your items. Players killing you as you open trunks in inventory. Oh ya and the free spin box...give random prizes instead of coins and rope. People will get really into it if perks are awesome. Great game could be the best with a couple tweaks. Awesome job.',
       'Alright, so I don\'t normally write reviews, but I feel like this one is deserved. The games concept is great, as with most post-apocalyptic zombie games, surviving and building a base is the main goal. Great. However, it is a micro-transaction based game, meaning you have to pay for packages if you actually want to enjoy it to the fullest. Am I saying you can t enjoy it otherwise? No, I do and I don\'t pay for the packages, however, my house constantly gets destroyed, I\'m killed by other players who do pay, and my game progression is massively slow. So, I don\'t really recommend this game, if you actually want to "play" the game.',
       'Just another game that either makes you wait to play it, or pay not to wait. Why? Don\'t make me pay not to wait. Entice me to pay with cool things, otherwise it\'s an instant uninstall. Poor business model. Imagine paying double to get them to make your food faster at a restaurant, or just wait a long time. Would you really keep going there, or somewhere else that makes something just as good but in a reasonable amount of time?',
       'Anyway i edit this review... The is nice and graphics are cool. But there is the problem on the game. Could you pls remove the energy bar so i can still play the without waiting to fill the energy bar... Cause otherwise i less play this game in days... that you know you must wait your energy bar to fill again in a couple of minutes if the energy is gone?. Pls Remove it so we can play all day along.. Thank you.',
       'This game truly amazing with beautiful graphics, decent yet easy controls, a large amunt of items and okay customization. The only reason i give this a 4 star rating is because one thing. The hoard mechanic. I mean it\'s a good concept. The only problem is that there\'s a hoard every 24 hours. And since wood is kinda pain to get it sucks to come back after work to come to a destroyed house. If it was like every month or heck even every week that would be fine just please give more time than 24 hours for a hoard' ],

     [ 'Now these days, to be powerful is cards. And it\'s really sad to see it in one of my favorite fighting game. I have a galaxy s8 plus and when I put the controls on large, it feels like there on medium. If your playing duel and your opponent has 5 power points ahead of you, just call it a lost. Do better. Battlefront 2 is about to be banned in Germany because of the card system. I hope you look into it.  Edited: it\'s still the same. It feels like a pay to win. I\'m going back to shadow fight 2. You know. The good one.',
       'The game is a lot of fun but there\'s one big problem the only way to advance in the story mode is by leveling up and getting better armor but the only way to level up is in story mode so your other option is spend real money on better equipment. So it\'s kinda just a money grab. If that was fixed I\'d give it 10 stars',
       'I really like playing the game. It has great animations smooth gameplay and isn\'t too easy or hard. The one thing I dont like is you can\'t sell your old equipment or skills. If there was a shop to sell them or add runes to them or be able to combine them to make either new or more powerful ones of the sane type I would give this game 5 stars.hopefully the Devs will take this and add this feature in a update. Speaking of updates, I just installed the latest one it was like 403MB but nothing changed! What was the update for then?',
       'Hey NEKKI i have the best suggestion ever. WHY DON\'T YOU add a grab button separately or at least give the option. Also make the side quest more satisfying. Just giving me commons just isn\'t going to work. Please nerf the herlad faction. 1 its crit chance is to stupidly high 17 percent is to much. Its also so quick and has long range',
       'The game has great potential.   One thing I hated are that the attacks have changed significantly... so much that I\'m having trouble controlling my character.  Another thing is that it requires network connection for starting the game. Many of my friends are hating it.  Other than these two, everything else is awesome.',

     [ 'Great game. But what I miss are written below.   1. Direct search & contact any city.   2. Invite a city to be friend from within game.   3. Direct private message with a city from within Game.   4. Make a city tagged as favourite city or liked city.   5. Want a clean viewing mode of own city without those construction hats and other info symbols on top of  building being constructed.  I think they are massively missed. And if you can provide these facilities then it will be the best game of it\'s class.',
       'The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I\'d like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.',
       'Thanks for new upgrade . Even when the game was slow i didn\'t stop playing. I love this game. It\'s not only a game for me...i am a President of my club and i have to lead my members... in less than one year i reached level 50 and almost all land expanded...just  you have to understand how to play... be smart... some advice for beginners  start participate in mayor competition...this way you will grow faster',
       'Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It\'s very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again',
       'I would of rated this 5 stars if I didnt loose all mt progress I tried logging in to google play but it said sorry mayor this city is linked to another device. This is the same phone I\'ve had it on so im really really ANGRY about it so yeah. Help me get my old city back ELECTRONIC ARTS . My city had over 100,000 population I had the airport Dr vu\'s tower and the port and everything else apart from the building so yea. Im so bummed. HELP ME PLZ',
       'i like the quests to earn gold keys & platinum keys. other players can see what is in my storage & i hope EA can block/fix that. there are still video ad problems; a video will either play or not; and it will not return me to game; and/or it will not offer the three choices. 02/20/2018. how many times do i have to rate game?' ],

Burn rubber in over 1,000 challenging races &#x2013; and that&#x2019;s just the starting line. Be notorious, own the streets, and score the world&#x2019;s best cars.

       'Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won\'t reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.',
       'Goog game, adddictive infact. But I don\'t understand the concept of PATANJALI adds. Whenever i choose to see adds to reduce the waiting time, you comeup with Patanjali adds of 10 and 20 seconds and the irritating part is the time doesn\'t gets reduced even after watching the whole add. Please fix this. When you say reduce wait time by watching add, you need to actually reduce the waiting time after the add instead of insisting to watch the add again and again.',
       'When I started playing this game I really enjoyed it. But now I realise that in order to progress, you MUST spend REAL money. I am a family man, with a wife and 6 children, I just wanted a game that I could play when kids are in bed and wife is in bath, I don\'t have cash to spend on games, the worst thing is the 7 Day events, you cannot beat them without spending money. Very disappointed. Good game but don\'t expect to progress very far if you don\'t want to spend money.',
       'The game keeps crashing whenever I try to play it . I can only look at my cars but when I load into a race or event.  And it would be great if you guys could fix it because I usually make in app purchases if that affects you at all but otherwise great game just keeps crashing this game usually gets me stuck for hours having fun. But otherwise please try to fix , Have a wonderful night.' ],

     [ 'Honestly, I like this one the most. I like that it keeps the mini games present, but it has a new game style as well. I also love that you can play as the characters, as well as the fact that they now have a backstory! The game itself isnt too difficult, making it a nice game to play at all times. The only thing i dont like is the amount of ads, but it is a new game, and ot needs its funding to stay up and running. Overall, good job Metro! Keep it up! :D',
       'Nice game. I like the concept of rebuilding but this game was meant to kill time, I hope so. Keep adding characters and what we require is a hell lot of mini games so that they may keep coming and coming and coming. I do not intend to harass you but try to add more and more mini games after each update. I\'m sure that in the course of  time you may be able to compete with the best games ever created but do not make the game larger than DWTD 2. Add more new locations too otherwise we will not be able to consume the tokens. The game is nice because you do not have to consume money for characters and get them through gifts instead. It is also nice because tokens can be collected easily. Please think about my opinions. I❤ this game.',
       'The character models are cute and all, but the games are getting a bit repetitive. WAY too many ads. Like, ridiculously too many. The app forces a couple right after you finish some of the minigames. You have enough to offer us - forcing even more ads on top of that is tiresome. Get rid of them.',
       'Dumb ways to die 3 gets 3 stars. No, seriously, I loved the first 2, but this one is not good. Only 4 minigames, not really different each from another. Remember FASTER FASTER FASTER ? It disappeared (I miss it), and is now ADS ADS ADS. The goal here is just to use money and play as often as you can for ADS ADS ADS. The main thing here ? Minigames ? Nooooo, just getting (or buying) tokens and use them to repair houses (no impact on gameplay). Why would this game be nice ? The graphics are still good. Yes, that\'s all. Have a nice day. ADS ADS ADS',
       'To be honest, I don\'t think this game updated at ALL. Dumb ways to die 1 and 2 were GREAT but this one... not so GREAT.  First of all,  there are only for games that you could play.  Second,  it\'s not as creative as the other ones. And third,  the only good thing about it is that for ME there are no ads.  The list goes on but that\'s for you to find out and for me to uninstall. 😐😐😐😐😟😟😟😟😢😭   Im VERY disappointed',
       'I love the first one and second game of this but the third one it\'s not so good I feel like no one should get the third one only the first and second Dumb Ways to die you can\'t even play the games you did on the first and games you did on the first and second one only the mini games and it\'s only four of those so this is what I\'m going to say about this app' ],

     [ 'I like this game but there\'s so much cheating going on. It doesn\'t resister some of the moves you make or it\'s lagging and when you smash the minions they should fly away and not stick to the screen for ten seconds so you can\'t see what\'s coming next. Just stop cheating! Don\'t take 20hours to give the necessary tools when doing a double task in the jelly lab.',
       'I have a Xiaomi Redmi 4 mobile with 3 GB RAM, 1.4 GHz Octa Core. Still Game hangs, Speed enhanced with a jerk every time and then it dies. I have reset my mobile and reinstalled it but the problem still there. It\'s very annoying. Otherwise I love this game. It\'s very addictive.',
       'I\'ve played this game since it started. My grandkids used to play until the constant glitches and the hot trails. I just don\'t understand why your company can\'t keep the glitches out. My desire to keep playing is waning on a daily basis. *sigh* I don\'t know why I even waste my breath.',
       'The game used to be fun, but not anymore.  More than that, after i did a factory reset on my phone, I\'ve reinstalled the game, but surprise... I couldn\'t sync the game to my Google account. All my progress in game was lost. All the money invested in this game was lost. I have sent them emails, tickets about it but no answer what so ever. The result is ---&gt; uninstall',
       'Really cool. Its just  too WEIRD. And sometimes when I try to Dodge an obstacle it won\'t do it. And  when the lanes bend its really Hard for me. And why do you Have to watch an ad to get free revives, get some tokens, refill the Battery for the special Mission and to open the green and blue prize pod AND to Double bananas you collect? GREAT GAME I JUST HATE THE ADS.',
       'This game is awesome and funny I guess. I\'m trying to think of something to complain about (I love complaining) but I can\'t!! Oh wait...........

     [ 'It\'s a fun relaxing game. Its so addictive that every device I have, must have this game. I have it on my phone, ipad and tablet. Except my laptop cuz then I would get no work done. About the ads, one pops out each time you finish a game, so I\'m not to bothered by it. Also, theres no videos too watch in order to earn coins or diamonds because none are needed. I just love it. Its stress free.',
       'I really enjoy playing this game. It helps me to relax while I am watching TV, or even using in split mode while watching a video or something. It\'s a bit different then the way I originally used to play Klondike, but still a great game and easy to get used to quickly! I don\'t mind the 5 second or so ads between games. It\'s the price you pay to get a good, free game. It\'s not like they play constantly and during a game there is usually an ad on the bottom screen but it will quickly move if you go to start a new game or need to access the other options.',
       'I would have scored higher except there is suddenly super annoying music being played that there is no option to turn off. The ads also now autoplay loud music. I agree with another poster who said it starting to seem like you lose more so you see more ads. I liked this because it was good for a quick game while getting ready to sleep. The music ruins this. I\'m going to try another app now.',
       'I love the game solitaire played it on many different computers over the years. Downloaded three other version on my phone. All of which I deleted almost straight away because they were finicky and I didn\'t like the format. This one is easy to use and no glitches. So far so good.',
       'It won\'t allow me to add my own pic for background. Maybe too big of a file but I know other solitare let me. I also wish there wasn\'t commercials after the win or lose because they interrupt my music but I hear you guys make money that way so let it be. I\'ll continue to play because I like solitare and the commercials only pause my music and don\'t cut it completely off to play the commercial, like other apps.',
       'Terrible ads. So bad they hid the menu bar behind an ad banner so you click the ads just to access settings. Pretty sure they recently increased losing deal rate to make more ad videos play. So many other solitaire aps available so skip this one.' ],

     [ 'It\'s a cool game, it just could be better and maybe there could be some other things in the update. Don\'t take it seriously! I\'m not trying to be mean but maybe there could be some other leotards and the update and some more hair dues because all of those buns and people may not like that\'s just buns people may want the braids that you always have in your other games. I mean the French braids and they keep going down into a braid, all those things would be nice!',
       'This is a great game... You should play it if you like gymnastics and if you are board,You   should download this game... Is very fun... I liked it... But it still needs a bit more to improve.. I would love it even more if you had more stuff.. And if you didnt had to pay for anything  at all.. Also, please just open the spa and the other stuff you cant get unless you pay!',
       'I downloaded this game for my little sister and the first thing she said was that there are way too many adverts and I agree because whenever she clicked on say the dress up or nail salon or gym and adverts would always come up. The game also lags too much even though she has a brand new IPad. However at this time I would not recommend this game. My sister said that she would play the game again if you reduce and have a limited amount of adverts. As well as the advert problems the game keeps telling me to buy everything and it pops up every time I think when you press the \'X\' button it shouldn\'t show again. Please fix this now. As much as my sister loves this game the adverts really annoy her. Would not recommend this game!!',
       'This is from my daughter, "I like the game but there\'s some things about it I kind of don\'t understand. Some of the controls are a little difficult like the one where you have to tap 1 or tap 2 when she\'s practicing. And its fun. Some of it I like a lot."   This is from me, "the app is annoying until you buy it. It downloaded a ton of icons (ads for other games) to my picture gallery without informing me. My daughter likes the game a lot and it\'s fun, but a bit intrusive with the free version. The gameplay is good overall."',
       'The main thing I didn\'t like about it is how little things you can do unless you spend like 10 bucks especially seeing as this is a game that looks like it\'s targeted towards children $10 is pretty expensive just to be able to play a gymnastics',
       'Really was enjoying this app, then about 10 minutes in video ads started popping in literally every 1 or 2 minutes. This totally killed the fun factor; not only was I unable to complete any tasks or just enjoy the game but the crummy ads actually kept booting me off the app. What a complete buzz kill; even tho this app was super cute & the graphics were total eye candy, the constant interruptions barging in were beyond ridiculous; both in longevity & frequency.' ],

In the future sometimes instead of race can there a event where multiple players fight a power boss like dragon and the people are given prizes depending on there rank and they have to do a certain amount of damage to get the rewards instead of just letting them get it without trying',
       'Don\'t waste your time with this game. It started out as a really awesome game until I found out that the developers only care about getting your money and after they get your money they don\'t give you what you paid for and you spend a week fighting with the developers to get what you purchase. After you get to a certain level in the game you can either buy the gems so you can continue your progress or stay stuck where you are. I am uninstalling this game and I suggest that you don\'t waste your time with this game.',

Theres so many Heroic dragons and legendaries that are level 30+, and now they all use the right "hits" everytime, and when you don\'t have any "good" dragons, it is very hard to win.

I enter the details, it tells me that I\'ve already logged in, I go back to the game and it just does the same thing over and over..... Anyone know how to solve this issue? Website is no use at all',
       'This game used to be awesome, sadly I have just removed it due to the star issue. I used to be able to play for fun, however, due to the its current standing, one MUST achieve three stars in each level in order to play other levels. Madness! Great job for taking the fun out of a game!',
       'Angry Birds used to be a game you could just tap on and play to your heart\'s content.  Now it\'s gone fee-to-pay (sic) -- you can read the other reviews to see how well that has been received.   Not well is an understatement.  I\'d say more, but you\'ll have to gain 50 more stars to read each new paragraph.  Meanwhile, watch these unskippable half-minute-long ads.',
       'Between ads completely over running gameplay and the new requirement of having to earn stars to proceed, Rovio continues to run this once great game into the ground. **Update** game now freezes randomly requiring a force close. This is beyond ridiculous. I HATE what this franchise has become. Rovio should be ashamed.',
       'Too many ads way too often. I get a few sponsored ads help keep apps free or inexpensive but the frequency here makes the app annoyingly unuseable. Sponsors need to realise that the more we consumers are harassed with unwanted advertising, the LESS we will be interested in their product. I outright boycott or blacklist such companies and products.',
       'I loved the mighty league ... until it forced an update that caused a glitch, and all of a sudden I was back in the Feather league --- and no matter what I did, I couldn\'t get out of it. I waited for update after update --- but to no avail. I was stuck. Not so fun anymore. So I uninstalled and reinstalled --- and lost over 13,000 points.  But at least I got to play again. I built my way back up... only to have it glitch again, sending me back to the Feather league. More frustrating than fun #Fail' ],

     [ 'If you\'ve liked the first game you\'re probably gonna enjoy this one. It\'s more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it\'s built around microtransactions so if you\'re feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don\'t understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it\'s likely you\'re going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren\'t aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don\'t expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!',
       'Free to play games are always the same formula: Starts off addictive, gets more challenging, starts encouraging you to buy gem equivalent, forces you to buy gem equivalent. At least most other games are fair with it though, giving you a chance. PVZ 2 does not. Levels go quickly from fun to I\'m done, and become impossible. I\'d love to see developers or game testers try to complete later levels without gems, especially Big Wave Beach. It\'s a shame, as the first game remains a classic. Buy the first game and Garden Warfare if you like it. Leaf this game alone, it\'s a sprout at best. Oh and remember, if zombies try to break into your house, throw your money at them.',
       'I was unable to launch the game for some stupid reason.....i sent several messages to the developers email seeking help,but everytime i get a same reply,asking me to visit the ea gaamjng website. It doesnt work,and seems like the message the developer replied is auto generated. Does popcap/ea rlly take time to fix it? Pls help me,i dont wanna miss out on speacial events. Thanks',
       'I like this game so much, but after the last update the game is a bit laggy, and I noticed that only the normal level music plays every time no matter what type of level I am playing. For example: the ultimate battle theme and the minigame music are all missing. I am playing on Galaxy A5 2017.',
       'EA doesn\'t care about the problems of the gamers. Im not interested anymore in this game after my profile has gone. 3-4 years of playing and buying stuff and most of my plants are in level 10 plus 4k+ gems, but with one stupid glitch, all of my achievements are lost. the game does not deserve even 1 star. I DONT LIKE TO PLAY FROM SCRATCH AGAIN & AGAIN. STUPID!!! u dont care about our feelings, all u want is money..' ],

     [ 'The Game is unmatched. My issue is in car price changes which id give no star for. Im also becoming abit bored by the game because the cars i have left to by can only be acquired via tokens or cash. Not everyone can afford to pay continuous amounts to get further in a game. Scrap the cash and reward good driving. By the way, this is the best game 🇿🇦I\'ve ever played',
       'I am using samsung note 8 and this game hangs in between....and also ask for wifi or data for update...  I believe thisgame is come to its end...    After recent update game cannot start and crash after gameloft logo.... I played all ashphalts till now but badly stuck with this version....have to download alot of data and cost of this game may goes higher then ma cell....team assphalt do some thing fast....',
       'I\'ve just realized that this game is for people that have gambling addiction trates, people who will keep spending money to advance.  I got a offer to buy a car in the game, limited time offer it said only 10,000 tokens, so I looked up how much that was out of curiosity? $149! Are you for real? Someone must be on drugs to come up with these prices. I just feel sad for the ones that do pay for these so called offers. May Gameloft be cursed until you take away your greed.',
       'Best racing game on Android for me. But It we have to buy credits it the most difficult process. It will be a game-changer and very good turn if We Can sale maxed out cars which we have and get credits in Return. I guess this feature will be awesome. Love this Game',
       'Connection error... Í get that on myscreen when in multiplayer. Í AM anry  I\'ve lost ratings in Multi-player  due to application was suspended error..? Really making me format my 📱 thinking that it would solve it time wasted:( 😠😬',
       'Cannot enter AGE on the game opening screen.  Love the game and the graphic is amazing. Play smooth on phone BUT, cannot play on Mi Box 3, after download 1.65 GB of game data, the screen stuck on "entering age and gender" all stoped and nothing can do with that - gamepad not working, remote not working, cannot go back as it says "you cannot go back at this stage", any help please?' ],

     [ 'Alright, so the game is pretty good. All I ask for is more tricks, and the ability to upgrade some bonuses (coin magnet, feather hover thing, and the third one that I haven\'t grabbed yet.) All in all, if you could do that, it\'d make the game so much greater. Apart from skipping missions and revives there\'s no use for coins.',
       'Good graphics, but can get boring after only like 3 minutes. Also the makers of the game should add a another different mode where your running away from a villager/camper and see how far you can get. You could improve or modify this mode that i have made if you want',
       'The thing that makes this game great is the visuals and the audio. It is absulutley beautiful and the art style works so well with the type of game. Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I\'d very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there\'s a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style',
       'First off, I\'d like to give a big thank you to the developers for this game. It\'s amazing.  However, I\'ve been encountering quite a few bugs lately. One day, picking up a hover feather crashed the game. Today, I can\'t pick up llama horns, and the background blur that happens when you go into the workshop stayed into an actual run. I took this as a challenge and continued playing. I\'m on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 9.7 running Android Marshmallow.  This is just to tip you guys off on some bugs.',
       'This was the must have game- I think, for a while. Then the newest update came out. Now it has ads you must veiw (before totally optional for more coins or an extra run) and added FTP elements. Took from a 5 star classic, to barely 2 stars. Thankfully, the base game play was untouched, and still well worth the advertisements, but I\'m very sad for this move on the part of the dev team.',
       'The game is addictive, but i cannot play it more than 10 minutes at a time, because it gets boring. The awful part is that since 1 week, i dunno why, it crashes while i\'m playing.. Anyway, it\'s addictive because after you start playing, you start thinking about it while you\'re not playing' ],

Need more transport holes or vases and plants to hide behind. So many great comments, it\'s baffling to me.  Wish I  knew the tricks to get as far as a lot of the reviewers do.  Looks like it COULD BE A FUN GAME, but in present form, it\'s too challenging for me.  Bummer. Guess I\'ll have to uninstall it.',

     [ 'I love this game, i\'ve been landed surface in every celestial object few times, included Sun. I also recommendation to other friends in forum to play it.  But, I want suggest to add some simulation like : - Rotation planet. - Perihelion/Aphelion. - Perigee/Apogee.  And also some feature : - List for delete few space trash like empty booster in orbit. - Name rocket every launch (it make fun & realistic).  Thank You',
       'I am so addicted to this game. I love everything about it. I just wish there was a place to donate to you (developer). Also, I would love it if there were more rocket parts. Also, I wish there was a thermosphere you had to get through to get on planets. All in all, I love it! Can\'t get enough!  Edit: Thank you so much for the reply. I\'m sorry I wasn\'t clear on the thermosphere part, but i think the reentry effect would be lovely. I just can\'t stop playing. And I\'m SOOOO excited about rovers and things! Thank you so much again! :)',
       'I absolutely love this game, but I keep having a bug where either the close up or the tragectory map goes completely black so I can\'t see or control what I\'m doing. It started  becoming more frequent after a few days and even after uninstalling and downloading again the problem persists. Please fix this! Everything else is amazing: the gameplay, the allowed creativity and the ease with which one can learn new techniques.',
       'Trajectory in orbit I really love this game you made. It would be cool if you could make the rocket face the direction of it\'s trajectory during orbit. Edit: Can you add re-entry effects when going to other planets? It would be more realistic. Also add heat shields for re entry situations. And when is docking gonna come? Hopefully in the next update.',
       'Very addictive game.  Next version here are some thoughts:  show some flames on re-entry.  Docking clamps so you can put fuel into orbit and pickup additional fuel so you can go to Venus and return to earth.  Put the rest of the planet\'s in there.  Make it so you can take cargo such as rocket parts to moons and other so you can build a rocket there that can go further due to low gravity at launch.  I really liked this game and a lot could be done with it.',
       'I truly enjoy this game. There is a learning curve at the beginning if you\'re going to have a successful mission. However, soon enough you\'ll be traveling the Stars. This game is challenging enough to keep you interested. You are solely in control of all of your missions, which I like because I don\'t feel like I\'m forced to jump through hoops to get to the next level. Very well designed. Now for the real reason why I\'m sending this review... Designers, please move the engine ignition button away from the acceleration bar. Too many accidental engine ignitions while trying to adjust engine power.' ],

     [ 'Love that you can now earn gems from reading.  However part of the fun of games like this is the outfits and personalization of your character. Outfits and style choices should be free to choose the best one that advances you in the story. It\'s not fun playing a game that forces you to fail/have a negative outcome. Big decisions/game altering choices should cost gems that makes it fun spending your savings but ultimately free outfit/style choices please',
       'Love this game! The only part I don\'t like is that all of the best options cost diamonds and you literally have to pay for them. It makes sense for an app, but it happens to often. It ruins the story because I won\'t buy any diamonds. I\'ll rate this 5 stars if they at least change it to not as often.',
       'I like the game but waiting three hours for two passes is terrible.  And we have no other option to get free passes it is either wait or pay. I feel like I\'d we got more than two passes I would be okay with the wait. But waiting three hours knowing I am going to use those two tickets in less than a half hour is crazy.  Then I will lose interest in the story and forget what had happen, it isn\'t okay. But other than the wait for passes I really like this game.',
       'I really like the idea of the whole game.  And the episodes are pretty good in length depending on what story you use. But I think it is completely ridiculous that you have to wait 4 hours for more passes.  Overall,  if you don\'t mind waiting and are a very patient person then I do recommend this app for you.  However if patience is a virtue you don\'t have then you should find a different app.',
       'Great app, just too many of the same type "romance" stories over and over again. It feels like only one person is writing stories on here, when It claims to have over 55,000 different stories. Each time i try to search for a new book to read a new, the same twelve pop up over and over. Fix that please. I very much enjoy supporting community made books but it seems like it\'s just a popularity contest on here, with the same story line and plots being used far too much.',
       'I love the idea of this game. But think it\'s absolutely stupid that everything costs so much gems and it ruins the whole game. You can pick any food choice bc you need 20 if not more gems and it happens so often. Would not reccomd this game TO ANYONE' ],

The button still shows up when i play the game tho. What do i do?',

     [ 'It just lags now. The new update made it to where my chat, my character, and my animations won\'t work. I run about as fast as a turtle, and I am not pregnant. Please fix!!!! I love this game. I have a few questions if you don\'t mind... Can you guys add in multi-player mode, like single player mode, that we can pick up our pups, it would be cool to add that option in the top left menu. Thank you guys so much!! Love the games!!',
       'Most realistic wolf sim I have found out there, with the ability to get a mate, have cubs and your own den in which you can invite players into. There are also multiplayer game servers and an ability to create your own public or private game. You can also play as a wolf, fox or lynx and customize eyes, pelts and add masks/hats and scars/clothing. Its just AMAZING! Also saying that you don\'t have to pay to play and in-game currency is easy to get.',
       'I have only had this game for a few days, so I can\'t write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it\'s up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.',
       'Most awesome wolf simulator game I have ever played! The graphics are absolutely beautiful, and the controls are pretty good. Although getting attacked by several animals at once when you only go for one makes completing missions pretty hard. And you should be able to run from a fight if you\'re losing, instead of having animals come at you until you\'re dead. All in all a great game play experience though. I love it!',
       'Love it but pleeeeeaaaase make it possible to play as a boar or a rabbit or deer. Also I think it would be really nice to have a hunger and thirst bar because there is no real point in drinking. That way if you dont have enough food or water you start to lose health.  Also I don\'t think we really need stamina from the food we eat.  These are just suggestions but I really really love this game.  Best simulator out there.',
       'On one of the quest, I think 11. There ia a syrange new animal and I went to the game menu for information and there wasn\'t any. It looks like a brown rabbit, I tried killing Rabbits squirrels and deer, but It wasn\'t the right animal! Is it in the snow biome?  Anyways hope you can help me and otger quest 11 users. It\'ll be great that when you get the same animal twice it counts as duplicate. For example "Wolf Common Duplicate +(however acorns). Thanks and the update is great!' ],

       'Why bother having an X on the Level Rush notification if it doesn\'t work so you have to press Begin and wait for the animation to finish before you can carry on with claiming the Daily Challenge. Also \'play with friends\' on the tournament never does anything. Otherwise fun.',
       'The game itself is cute and fun. I would give it 5 star if it does have some annoying flaw. First, the ads in this game is EXCESSIVE, unbearable excessive. I\'m OK with ads in free game, but beside the life system, I have to watch ads everytime I win or lose a game, even switch out and back to text or make a phone call? Its just too much. Second, some levels are too easy and some levels are made impossible to beat without use multiple boosts, unbalanced difficulty. Third, the tournament and most quests come with so little reward which just not worth the afford, like pay 25 coin to play a level rewards 5 coin? The only worth while quest is level rush imo.',
       'I have enjoyed this game immensely up until level 240. In this level, rated HARD, there are most often no options to make strings and you\'re stuck with only strings of 3 of just plain air. When you see the game itself changing the color of treats several times during one game to give you a move, you know you\'re not imagining that this level is designed to screw you over into making fruitless purchases to overcome it.' ],

     [ 'Fantastic game! It\'s by Gameloft so it\'s bound to be a good phone game. It\'s not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn\'t hold your hand but it\'s not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you\'re also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it\'s definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I\'m stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)',
       'It\'s a best game on playstore!!! I play it lot of.. and it\'s my favourite game.. but one problem is that when i start multiplayer match it says sercer not found or server overloaded. But it doesent matter for much. I give all 5 star for best graphics, bedt controls, and also bestest weapons. I love this game. Thank you gameloft. We expect that you will keep developing games like modern combat. I am waiting anxiously for next series. Thank you.',
       'I had previously given this game a 1 star but for this update I\'m blown away by the network rectification aspect. The game runs butter smooth even after post FUP data speeds. The game is currently saturated with lvl 140 players with all the prestige weapons, so I\'d request you to bring about a balanced match making in the PvP based on their matching levels and introduce some welcome benefits for the returning players',
       'This probably the best FPS game in the Play Store. Graphics, animations, music, voice actings everything in this game are awesome. 😊  The game runs in my phone in full 60 fps on Ultra-high settings. But sometimes it crashes without any reason and when I run the game again, it starts to verify game data. My phone is not rooted and I do believe the problem is not in my phone, it\'s a bug in the game. 😕  Overall, it\'s a great game. ☺️  Peace out. 🤘',
       'It\'s pretty good for what it is, but the controls suck. It\'s hard to aim and you risk firing instead of moving your aim. Rules of survival has a better fighting setup however it\'s a battle Royale not a traditional fps. A bit sad that they did it better really. Final nail in the coffin is the pay to win aspect. There\'s multiple classes in this game and by far, the paid classes provide incredible perks. I don\'t recommend this game.',
       'This game is awesome.  But plzzzz ban clone paragon  first plzz plzz plzz.  Every match i see 2 or three paragon...  And mc5 is best game so far... One more thing this game turn into pay to win i think so plzzz reduce  the pay to win system and in match give 40 to 50 credit 10 credit is very lowest credit  to unlock items.... So plzzzz ban paragon first and give extra free credit  resources to earn in multilayer match....' ],

This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you\'d have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun',

Let me just so no to 6 different ads in a row as soon as i log in. Ill be sure to not contact your "concierge" and move on to something better. Maybe an app that actually appriciates feedback.',

Barely won a hand since the negative review also. Complete B.S game. I agree with all negative reviews here. 4.5 rating? Haha, most reviews are negative.  Done and done.',

     [ 'I played this a while back and decided to come back and see if anything had changed and it sure did. There have been several updates that I love (the new maps, new sharks, equipment, etc.) and I\'m glad I\'m playing it now. In game currency price for items has been balanced out which I love and the missions system is much better now. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes progression-based time-killing games like Hungry Shark World.',
       'Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it\'s so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I\'ve had to start all over again... but the fun continues!',
       'Do not upgrade your Sharks.  The bigger the shark, the more difficult it is to play.  Big sharks have more drain on health and hunger, causing you to die more frequently. Impassable areas due to size of !! shark and less fishes to eat when health gets low.  Not to mention how slow these big sharks move!  The more you spend on bigger sharks, the less fun you\'ll have.',
       'This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don\'t play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don\'t make us wait foreverrrr!',
       'I\'ve had to start this game all over from the very beginning 3 times. After working hard to get all the way to the top sharks, the app will suddenly refuse to connect to your Facebook account and want you to start a whole new game. Waste of time. Very frustrating. Not enjoyable at all. Find a game that\'s enjoyable. This one is definitely not fun.',
       'It\'s a fun game and I\'m enjoying it. However, I\'ve come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.' ],

       'Should be an option to lock targeting  and then fire, many shots were messed up from lifting my fingure at a very slight angle.  Also check points should last longer than once. Making one mistake at lvl 190+ and then having to go back to zero was so frustrating it was the main reason i uninstalled.  Terrible shame honestly, the game could have been really fun and is an original idea' ],

     [ 'If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It\'s by far the best maze game app I\'ve come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I\'ve tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It\'s the only maze puzzle app I\'ve found worth playing! 😀💜',
       'Time killer. B&W colors are a bit hard on the eyes after awhile. I wish the controls weren\'t so touchy. Even if I\'m using my stylus it\'s easy to move into a wrong corner by accident when you know it\'s not the right direction.',
       'I\'m not far into it, but it\'s fun so far. My eyesight could be why it\'s not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It\'s still a very good game though.',
       'I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven\'t played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I\'ll have to download a separate kid version for her.',
       '5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes',
       'Where is the challenge? This game is as lame as the rest of the maze games. If you would  try make the game more challenging then maybe I would not have deleted it.' ],

I want to rate five stars, I really do, but I cant if there\'s going to be this many ads in a game I think everyone would enjoy. 💛💛💛💛♡ (( pretend the hearts are stars )) I\'ll download the game again once I see less ads in your games, like My Talking Angela, which also has way too many ads. Please take this into consideration! Thank you!',

Though there are many glitches in the game, this is the second time I\'m gonna have to download because it won\'t open. Overall, it\'s a fun game when it\'s not glitching',
       'Garbage game,is now infinitely looping on a challenge tournament. Once I defeat the first opponent the screen goes black and the game freezes. Reopening the game puts me back in the same match and ends in the same endless loop.   Dev team needs to fired and a patrol of lemurs hired instead because they\'d at least be entertaining.',
       'As much as I love Beyblade, this app is really disappointing. The gameplay isn\'t anything special but the worst is the players. There should be a serious punishment for disconnecting. I cannot enjoy the game - I should have won two matches but I got nothing for them because my opponents disconnected the last second. Truly unsatisfying.',

But can you plz update game sothat more players can join 1 room and plz plz plz plz add more possibility\'s like feeding cows can give more cows and then you can sell some of your cows and buy new ones. Or you can build a pig stall and buy/sell pigs and upgrade a farm house or build a horse place. Or paint some buildings. I would spread the game to all my friends and people i know if you add some of those things. Plz add some of them cause I really like the game alot.',

Can you please fix this or I will be forced to contact Google billing to solve this. FYI I have tried the restore button but that doesn\'t work as well. I gave you guys several days to respond and nothing. So I\'m going to have to cancel those charges',

     [ 'I love Beat the Boss 4! But there are some things that I would like to be fixed. For example, when naming your custom boss, the name duplicates. The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can\'t go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.',
       'Game is now unplayable due to ads and KIIP rewards popups. The ads bring up my status bar so I can\'t X out of the ad, and the app hangs when trying to load the KIIP program. I have no interest in trying to play something that shovels ads in your face more often than you can actually play.',
       'I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i\'m asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting',
       'I\'d happily purchase this game but that doesn\'t seem like an option. Tge ads, especially the LOUD BLOW UP EXPLOSIONS game that go on for 30 seconds are especially annoying. I\'ll gladly buy it, if only to not deal with Fing ads all the Fing time!!',
       'Too many ads. It\'s annoying especially when you are connected to the internet. The King Boss is not working and is always saying "Something went wrong, please try again later" and crashes the whole gane. On the other hand it\'s a super addictive and fun game to play.',

With that said, the biggest downside, IMO, is that rewards are few, & far between, and there is no way to get gold bars without paying for them.  These become rather needed the further you get and for certain individual, and more difficult, "puzzles".  It can become too expensive to play (if one really want to get somewhere in this game).',

Come on dev\'s u have had plenty of time to work out the kinks. It shouldn\'t be freezing in the middle of play. Shame on u king dev\'s.',
