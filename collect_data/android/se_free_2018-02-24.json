Now I have nothing to spend apples on.  But here is what i really wanted to say i really like this company and the games you put out to your users. I\'m newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me. I own alot of your games and have spent alot trying to help. I wish I had more to unlock things in time. But Thank you very much.',

       'Deleted all my data with no reason. Had a bunch of Legendaries and Rares that have now been deleted. I put a lot of time into this game, and even bought the ad-free package. If you don\'t want a load of wasted time, don\'t download this app.  Edit- Updated the app and levelled up a bit. The game crashes every time I get a free revive. Still a massive waste of time.',
       'You have to expect some ads in free-to-play games but ads that cause input lag and interrupt gameplay are ridiculous, especially in a game where timing is important. The game also crashes occasionally during the xp increase.',

       'Uh not this',
       'A simple game that\'s like a modern version of an old school racing game I played. It\'s cool for the most part but it is lacking in the department of how to earn money. I wish your developers could add another way to get money than just multiplayer after you complete the career mode. It\'s also incredibly hard to find parts to cars you want without gems. This is mostly a pay to win game, I know but you already have a ton of ads so why make the game less enjoyable by having only two ways to make money? One is temporary and the other is permanent but you earn so little. I still enjoy the game but consider what I had to say, thank you.',
       'Its overall a great game. I like the tracks and the cars. I just wished you could re-earn money by replaying tracks, but put it at half amount that way it gives people that dont want to spend money on the game a chance on singleplayer.  FIX THE LAG because you finish in first and you end up getting second, third or fourth because of the lag.',
       'Game is good. Do not even waste your time paying to get rid of ads. They will rip you off. I paid to get rid of them and you still have to watch videos to claim your money that you won. You have been warned. Would have given five stars if it were not for admin stealing money',
       'Finish race in 1st place. Waiting for rewards. Loading... Sudenly I\'m in 4th place and \'didn\'t finish the race\'. -40 trophies. Simply ridiculous  Also, fix the checkpoints. It\'s frustrating to get thrown back so much when all you did was get a little out of the track.' ,

      'I love this game!  It\'s challenging yet not too complicated.  With some games it gets so difficult to play the higher you go and very dew helps are offered for free. This game is still fun and challenging but the levels are not impossible to beat. They also offer ways to earn helpful tools to assist in beating the levels.  The community is great also. You are able to request and give extra lives to one another very simply with minimal interaction Try it and see for yourself!',
       'At first, this is a fun little puzzle game. The levels are entertaining and simply addicting. But... This game takes quite a turn. I can\'t say for sure when it began, but I\'m on level 85 and it has become hilariously impossible to proceed. The levels become so ridiculously difficult that you need to spend real money to move forward. In other words, simple fun levels to get you hooked, followed by insanely difficult level to get you to pay. Over all, fun for the first 20 - 40 levels. Enjoy it while it lasts.',
       'Very fun and entertaining. I really like slow paced relaxing games and this is just that. There is no time limit so you can play at your own pace. Also there is minimal ads for a free game which is part of what makes this game so great. Such a great game for killing some time in a waiting room or just sitting at home trying to pass the time. This game truly deserves 5 stars. I love it!',
       'It\'s a fun little candy crush clone.  Nothing special but a good time waster.  I rated it as low as I did because of the lie they feed up about  the word random.  Tiles and rocket placement arnt random by any  means.  They say it is but random constitutes moves that work in your favor once and a while.  Ive spent DAYS on single levels.  If you need a rocket to point down, there\'s a good chance it\'ll point left/right.  You want that yellow tile, not happening.  I\'m all for the challenge.  I expect it.  But make it random.',
       'I do enjoy this game but certain levels don\'t give you enough moves to complete the level. The ones you have to match the cubes with the colors makes it impossible to pass when the game doesn\'t give you moves to do so. You waste your moves on areas that doesn\'t give you the opportunity to pass the level and then you don\'t have any moves left before it does give you the moves you need it does get frustrating you get stuck on that level and can\'t pass it. Which will just make you want to unistall the game cause you will never leave that level.',
       'Loved the game ...until I lost all my progress. The game used to sync without linking to Facebook...not the case anymore. I spent quite a bit on extras and lost it all. Was told to link to Facebook.. Facebook book don\'t need to know my game play .. I\'m sure there is some monatary reason these greedy idiots changed this. We\'ll go with God you will NEVER get another dime from me. Hope your greed bankrupts you!' ,

      'I love it very much. I also have some sugjestons to make. I think you should make categories for Thu pictures (animals,people,food,ect) and also have a daily challenge where you have to finish a picture (that you say) and we have to finish it. You would get a prize of a amount of coins and you could save them up to buy new pictures or tools like the bomb. But i really like this game. So even if you don\'t do my sugjestons I will still love it. ❤❤❤',
       'In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it\'s just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.',
       'AMAZING GAME! I am SOOOOOO HAPPY with this game! ITS SOO ADDICTIVE TO PLAY! SOOO MANY PICTURES TO CHOOSE FROM! THERE\'S EVEN A TRUMP ONE(which is EXTREMELY funny)! THIS IS THE-BEST-GAME-EVER THAT I HAVE PLAYED!I LOVE THIS GAME SOOO MUCH THAT YOU, YES YOU, SHOULD GO DOWNLOAD PIXEL  ART RIGHT NOW! YES RIGHT NOW! SO GO AHEAD AND DOWNLOAD IT!!! (also this is the longest thing i have EVER typed on my phone!)',
       'I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It\'s kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.☺',
       'I love this game and both myself n my grandbabies love doing the pics. It would b awsome to have n categories or level of pic. Didn\'t know about the bomb and other help. I would also suggest to move or when u r doing pic for the back button n save button to hide . I\'m always intrupting my pic by hitting the by accident . N also to b able to open the pic at a spot by touches instead of expanding pic. Expecially for more detailed pics. Love it Ty .',
       'Awesome app, its oddly satisfying and can either be really challenging ir really easy. Its constantly update with new pictures to do, and already contains probably hundreds lol, if dont 75+ and in saving the really detailed ones for last. If there even is such a thing. But, i think a counter for how many blocks of each color are left would be a really awesome alteration. There are many strategies to use when you do a color by number. So a counter for how many blocks of the selected number are left, it would be such a life save.this game has taken enough of my life already as is lmao' ,

       'Fun game but way too many advertisements, which happen to blow through data. I\'ve spent about 1 hour playing the game and have gone through 224mb of cellular data. There is a 30 second ad after every single restart. Even if you goof up and get a score of 10. It\'s horrible. I have to turn off data in order to play the game, and then I can\'t do a 2nd chance. You neeeeeeeed to cool the ads' ,

As with all great puzzlers, Six! is great in one minute bursts or hours of emotive fun.In the game you are challenged to interact with a tower block of varying shaped bricks upon which rests a hexagonal block. The aim is to get the hexagon down the tower block to earn points.  You do this by tapping the bricks to make them disappear bringing the hexagon down into the space cleared underneath.It sounds easy, but when the hexagon starts to roll or the tower tilts, and with pressure of high scores you’ll find it’s not as easy as you originally thought. If the removal of the blocks topples the tower  or the hexagon gains momentum and rolls off the screen, then it’s game over and you have to start all over again.  Challenging, emotive and blissfully simple to play. Six! will have you hooked on getting as far down the tower as possible. In keeping with Gram Games’ hits, playing this game is simple and fun, but claiming a spot on the leaderboard and bettering your friends is challenging and rewarding.Key Features●    Easy to learn and fun to master gameplay●    Challenge your friend’s high scores, challenge the world.●    Fun and engaging graphics.●    Engaging and addictive.●    Play for a few minutes or hours at a time.',

      'I love this game and would have rated it a 5 but suddenly the pause feature isn\'t working and I lost a game that was over 8000 points because I had a phone call. After I unpaused it set me back to zero. So aggravating. Also the 30 second ad for 30 stars doesn\'t show up anymore. Not sure what happened to this game in the last 2 weeks.',
       'Sadly, it could\'ve been a fun game if I could actually tap where I wanted to. The tap is off by like a few mm or something. I have to tap above the try again button to actually try again, or else I end up hitting challenges... So during the game play the exact same thing would happen, which makes the game unplayable.',
       'There are way too many advertisements every time I start a game or lose or win a game I instantly get an 30 second ad which I have to waste my time on to skip it until I am finally done. Overall except for the advertisements it is a great game controls and game play is brilliant I recommend this game but you will get a lot of ads. Suggestion: Lower the amount of ads showen',
       'This used to be an awesome game. I played it every day! But after the latest update, the ads at the top cause the game to lag terribly and make the ball fall very slowly and the pieces disappear slowly.  I can\'t adjust as needed due to the lag. I\'m unable to play due to this lag. Interestingly enough, when I turn on Airplane Mode thereby disabling the ads across the top, everything runs smoothly like it used to!! I am all for ads to support the developers  but this type they currently have causes severe lag which has rendered the game useless.',
       'I have paid £2.99 to remove ads and in still getting them. I emailed the developer two weeks ago and have still not had a response. You are forced to watch ads so often the game becomes unplayable and paying the money to remove them does not work. Save your time and do not bother even installing it. If you do install it do not pay the money to remove ads as it does not work!!!',
       'I love it but ever since I installed it ads kept popping up all over my phone. I don\'t know if it was because of this app. I want to uninstall to see if that\'s it but it\'s really addictive and fun.' ,

      'This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don\'t worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you\'ll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!',
       'I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who\'s better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn\'t seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don\'t think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.',
       'This game has no WORLD\'S favourite song  DESPACITO  SO i m hating it tooooo much  when i see this then i think that let\'s download it bcoz it contains despacito song also but when i see all album of this app then i started hated it. So i would request from CHEETAH GAMES that plezz add DESPACITO SONG also in it This is my humble request from CHEETAH GAMES.',
       'It\'s been 4 months since my report that the game has such a major glitch, still NO improvement. I lost so many lives just because the song suddenly slowed down and then as suddenly fast forwarding itself, there\'s no rhythm at all. Why don\'t you just fix the glitch first rather than add more songs.. Now, at 2018, it\'s only getting worse..',
       'I\'m in love with this game. It\'s challenging, you don\'t have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks.',
       'This game is honestly a great time-killer and even has it\'s challenging parts, but from what I\'ve noticed as you get to the higher tier songs they just get slower and slower and are just flat with barely any challenge. I expected more of a challenge with a higher level but now this game is getting horribly boring.' ,

      'Once an ad on an app tries to trick me with a fake virus warning I\'m done with. Even without the fake virus warnings the ads do not give you a chance to say yes or no, you are taken straight to a site the Google Store. I find this extremely rude',
       'I really like the game itself but just now I after hitting the "Get Coins" button a webpage opened up and redirected a bunch of times then I got one of the fake google error pop ups about a "dangerous virus" that i needed to "click the link below NOW". So users please be careful, it looks like the apps advertising partners might be a little dangerous.',
       'This game is fantastic! The style, sounds, and music set a fun and cartoon-ish tone, and the gameplay adds a sense of tension and suspense as the player does not know what the next obstacle will be and cannot stop the character completely as the sausage continues to walk onward. This game is fun to play and hilarious (specifically the sausage\'s dying cries/animations), and the obstacles aren\'t predictable, but the pace is initially too slow, making the game a bit boring at the beginning. I would like to see a game mode that increases the pace right from the start, like a speed mode, and new dying cries/animations and obstacles in future updates. However, as the game is right now, it\'s a lot of fun. Definitely recommend.',
       'Cute and funny, the music is catchy and its a nice touch to make its pitch and tone change when you change sizes. the gameplay is simply and yet the timing makes things challenging. The art style is awesome, i am  reminded of early era nick toons IE Ren and Stimpy, or Rocko\'s modern life. All and all its pretty awesome. The only improvement i would make is a option to pay for removing ads. But hey awesome game. EDIT/UPDATE just noticed that there is the no ads option if you buy the starter pack.',

I både singel- och gruppspel kan du utmana dina motståndare i ett normalläge där varje spelare har 24 timmar på sig att svara, ELLER: Ska det gå undan? Har du bråttom? Kör då ett blixtspel, där man som spelare endast har 15 minuter på sig att svara. Med över 15 000 frågor i databasen, som uppdateras dagligen, i 19 kategorier behöver du använda hela ditt register för att klå din motståndare - och kanske rentav hamna högst upp på topplistan där du kan vinna riktiga priser.Sätt även din egen prägel på Quizedo genom att skriva dina egna frågor - där varje godkänd fråga ger dig en belöning i form av coins som du sedan kan använda i spelet. Med dina coins, som du också kan köpa, kan du sedan handla fördelar som en ny snurr på på kategorihjulet, eller någon av följande livlinor inne i spelet:* 50/50 - Vill du ha lite hjälp på traven, vill du eliminera två svar som är fel? På sätt har du i alla fall 50% chans att kamma hem rätt svar.* Köp mer tid - Har du det på tungan? Behöver du bara liiiite mer tid? Använd dig då av denna livlina så fryses tiden i 10 sekunder.* Skippa fråga - Vad var det där för fråga? Jag vill ha en ny! Så kanske du resonerar. Men gör det då! Strunta i den och ta en annan.Dessutom får du inte bara reda på om du hade rätt eller fel på frågan, utan VARJE fråga är utrustad med en informativ text som förklarar svaret. Så att du inte bara triggar tävlingsmänniskan i dig - utan även lär dig något.Ladda ned frågesportsappen Quizedo helt gratis idag!',

       'It\'s a awsome game I like it.but I am a chrome book user u have knocked people with chrome books out. 1.st the controls. apparently, on Chromebook to roblox you go backwards instead of forward and forward instead of backwards. and the rotate you camra it walks that way. 2.nd aswell, you can not see your mouse when your moving it. and if you hold your moving keys then let go apparently, it moves on it\'s own? I haven\'t play roblox since 2 months and 1 week . please fix this I love roblox and if you fix this it will be full rating from me',
       'I love this game with a passion. ive played it since 2012, but ive made many acc n my official main account was made in 2016, id like if you can get certain games that are used for pc to go on mobile, it would be better',
       'I downloaded Roblox a long time ago, and haven\'t gotten to rate it because I\'m so busy playing it. Anyways, it\'s just really cool that it has millions of different games to choose from. That chat filters sometimes are a little annoying, like saying some words and Roblox chat filters hashtag it, but we find our way around it. Thank you so much for making this game.',
       'I recommended this game to all my friends.  I also recommend this game to everyone who is hesitating to get this game. Really big slection of gmes to play from roleplay games to obbys. Definitely get the game. One thing i dont like is if you don\'t make an account your called a guest and people are mean and bully the guest.',

      'This doesn\'t do the TEKKEN franchise any justice, controls are awful (mash one side of the screen), the layout of the title screen is painful and the fighter unlocks etc are daft. I would rather pay a larger amount for a proper TEKKEN game than this. To add insult on top it\'s just crashed and not given me the fighter it was unlocking.',
       'Progress loss. Try the suggestion I saw from the reply to others coment but only pop up for reopen the app. Please fix the problem or most player won\'t stay no to mention spend on the app.  Even update to the latest version, it still load to the lvl 1 version. But still have previous achievement done in my Google account. It become annoying r o player.  And I can not even register on Bandai for a account to issue a formal complaint.',

Devs, kindly resolve the issue as I loved the game so much...',

Today all of it was reset again and I lost all that progress but my old account was restored! Please let me retrieve my second account, I have gone MUCH further in that account starting second time. I had managed to get 4 Level 2 players and few level 3 shards.. I dont wana start from scratch again...',

I want to choose the new one as the one stays forgood.  I tried to follow the steps i saw on other peoples review but lost at How to communicate the acc/user id? (2nd step)  When i open the link.

      'So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I\'ll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It\'s in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I\'ve ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍',
       'This is better than the browser version for multiple reasons. 1) It doesn\'t lag as much. I played a few rounds a noticed a little bit of lag, but it\'s better than the browser version.  2) You can play against AI if you don\'t want to play against people. I like this because I actually had a chance to win and was able to kill some. 3) You can create your own custom skin, which is awesome. All of this is free as well. I love this version of Slither.io.',
       'The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn\'t make it better at controlling. I don\'t know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌',
       'this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It\'s so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It\'s just so addicting and I can\'t get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the \'play online\' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊',
       'I\'ve recently upgraded from cubot to galaxy s7 and unfortunately the game is not working properly like it did on the old cubot phone. The screen gets stopping and it\'s impossible to play. I\'ve tried uninstalling and changing Wi-Fi settings but nothing worked. Other than that the game is sick! Love it,my kids love it and it\'s fun to play.',
       'Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃' ,

      'Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!',
       'Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm\'s Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!',
       'Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I\'m just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it\'s going to be good.  We\'ll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!',
       'This game is awesome!! Just one thing... You might want to fix Power Trip, because if you miss the gravity pad in the robot part it\'s pretty much an insta-win. I don\'t know if it was meant to be there but if it wasn\'t, you should probably put some spikes there or something.',
       'This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10',
       'I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.' ,

       'The best piano tiles game I have found in the play store, I\'ve tried a lot and this one has a hell of a lot of songs, and you have to be fast with your hands as the songs speed up',
       'Love the game. The only thing i want it to have is being able to put my own music into it. Songs that I have on my phone and being able to play it on the app.',
       'This is an awesome game. The music is also awesome. It\'s the perfect amount of difficulty without being stupidly simple or hard, and the music itself is amazing.',

      'Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it\'s advertised too much, but it\'s definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That\'s slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.',
       'Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I\'ll be playing this for a long time! I\'m working on the living room right now, getting close to level 600. Can\'t wait to see what the new character, Jerry, has in store for us! Thank you Playrix!',
       'I loved the game until the last update. Until then, I found it relaxing and challenging. Since the recent update it\'s just aggravating.  The boosters don\'t act upon the same set of rules since the update. I\'ve been on the same level for nearly a week. I\'m on 280, and looking at the number of tasks coming up makes me feel that I will likely uninstall rather than spend my entire life playing. I wish Playtrix would go back to the older version.',
       'Love it! It just needs some adjustments. Too many levels that are way too hard, that takes you 50 tries to beat when you only have 5 lives in the first place. And it should only be beat one level to unlock one task instead of needed to beat two levels to unlock one task. If it\'s going to take 2 stars to unlock a task it should be something big not 2 stars for unlocking a task for cleaning up a little mess!',
       'I delete it then loaded again 7 months later. No change. Still hard as heck. Can\'t get thru the puzzles even with using 30 lives and no power ups. I can see you don\'t care about people and your gonna lose money. You have to be a freaking genius to play this game. And we ain\'t.',
       'I really like this Game so Far. I will play for awhile to See how it Works & If I like it. Absolutely Love Your Game. Play it ALL THE TIME!!! I Must Admit that I Really Do enjoy this Game! Sometimes I find myself Having a Hard Time With Certain Levels. I Could be On that Level for Days or a Few Weeks. I think with Some Improvement that Would make People Play. This Game More. But I Must Say Hat\'s Off to The Developers' ,

I recomend this game to everyone, i realy love that you can play it offline and with other players! Even if the gamers at school say this ias a stupid game, i think it is fantastic!.I live that you get candy powerups everyday instead of using your gold too!',
       '... endless levels. But the spinning wheel IS A JOKE! JACKPOT CAN NEVER BE REACHED! Besides, the initial loading screen takes about 15s... and then the main game start screen about 20s, while it connects online. Please improve this, very annoying. Thanks.  Update 02/2018: "Tap to Skip" animations after level finished - love it !!!!',
       'The new version with those extra seconds when you start the game after simultaneous wins is horrendous! They keep adding extra seconds to the point that I don\'t think I would want to waste so much time! Will install if that isn\'t retracted',
       'I would really like to be able to sync my kingdom account progress with my Facebook account. I have followed the sync instructions but it says I\'m already synced. When I login with Facebook I have to start from the beginning. Kinda frustrating when I am at level 1183 on my kingdom account! I emailed for help and was sent to a the community site which does not have a solution to my problem anywhere. Please correct this!',
       'I had to take away a star. Ever since the update when I get a color bomb when I go to the next level and I get my free color bomb it\'s like if you use one of them they both get used and I don\'t even use one of them on a striped candy or a wrapped explosive. I thought I was doing that at first but when I look at the board before using it and then use one of them they both get used. It\'s like I\'m getting robbed. I don\'t mind being on a level if I run out of time or moves but don\'t have me stay on there longer than I have too if I can use my special candies to get off a board. Please fix',
       'You\'d think an app so heavily used wouldn\'t crash so much. Time to uninstall. Finally was getting close to completing a super hard level, after struggling for days/weeks. Game crashes and I lose my progress. Will never reinstall.' ,

      'So nice to sit and enjoy a game of challenge. Almost as much fun as chess, but easier to carry. Great way to relax while waiting for the zombie apocalypse or the bus to come. Thank-you and keep up the awesome work.  *UPDATE* 17 FEB 2018.  Have started my friends and family trying to get Top Score. No one is really trying as they are all enjoying playing the app to care. Brought a tear to my eye. Once again, "Thank-you"  for a truly  wonderful game.',
       'Simple tile game with a nice learning curve. Easy enough to be able to relax while playing and challenging enough to not be boring.  Instant gratification for finishing levels, packs, and difficulty ratings.  There are \'rolling points\' that I haven\'t figured out the use for yet. Coins to purchase hints and other stuff. The ball can have different \'skins\' that you unlock as you complete grpups of packs.  TLDR?  I\'m having fun. Maybe you can too.',
       'Great game. Starts easy so you can get your eye in and then gets harder. Fun to play and not so difficult that you give up and uninstal. Ads are over fairly quickly and I like that you can choose to watch some to get extra coins.',
       'I love this game and I just start playing and I already have the iron ball!how cool is that!..........but there is ad after I pass every levels.If you can please fix this thing! :)',
       'This game is awesome,  a great puzzle game. I only had it for about 3 weeks and already on pacgage 20 level 10 on expert. I  will have the game beat in a few days. Thanks for amazing game.',

      'Love it! I play it all the time! You can play online or offline - online gives you a chance to revive. Has course like game play or continuous. No pause which is understandable but kinda sucks. Once you get the hang of the controls it becomes  addicting. Would like to see more land and background options... maybe on the next update??',
       'tl;dr: Good game mechanics.  Ads are the worst ever, and the pay to remove them doesn\'t work. Would recommend if you don\'t mind watching long ads constantly.   Review: The base game is awesome. I love the mechanics and graphics. If you want a solid game, this is it.   However. I REFUSE to give this a good rating for 2 reasons.  1) The amount of ads is outrageous. I get they need to keep the lights on, but come on I don\'t want a 30 second video every time I "die" 2) I was willing to pay for the game to get rid of the ads. Well, don\'t do that. It doesn\'t actually work. I restarted my phone, reinstalled it, and did the force stop to confirm it wasn\'t a minor glitch. If you\'re going to have a pay to remove ad feature, make sure it works. Luckily I was able to get a refund from Google.',
       'W way too many ads, I even paid but I still got relentlessly slammed with ads. Poor game play, their angle is way too picky. If you don\'t hit those hills just right you lose and it\'s time for another ad. Poor knock off of tiny wings. Poorly made game, too many ads. Over all. Suck city',
       'I really like the game actually but I paid to get rid of the dumb ads and yet everyother frickin game more ads. If you pay to get rid of the ads the shouldn\'t be any. NONE So they took my money and gave me nothing for it so to me they kinda stole my money. To me thats not right. How many people are they takimg money from without fulfilling their end.',
       'I wish i could rate 0 stars, when thus game first came out i played it but got bored pretty soon. Alot of people are playing it at my school now so i decided to try it again, well what do you know the game isnt even starting up now. It goes to the voodoo screen and exits out the app. I already tried downloading it some times and from different sources. Not good...',
       'This game is really fun. The only thing is that there is way to many ads. A good tip is to just put your phone or tablet to airplane mode so you get no ads. There is still problems with the game other than just ads. Like no audio and when I\'m playing challenges and it takes back to the the menu. Other wise fun and addictive.' ,

      'Great timewaster! There are a lot of characters to earn and you don\'t need to spend real money to get them, so that\'s a plus. However, rated it a 3 cuz there are sooooo many ads. I get that ads generate the revenue to keep a good game free but an ad populates for literally every action. Win a game=ad, lose a game=ad, go to the settings=ad, change the volume=ad... ok the last one is fictitious but it really seems like that\'s how it works',
       'The game is simple to immediately start playing and fun. I shouldn\'t rate a game based off of this but, these pop up adds are tremendously common. Adds are essential so that the app can support itself but to have an add after every single play and then have an add to open a chest? Really? That\'s a bit much, especially, when the adds are not easily skippable and even force you to the download screen of the add. The game is simple, fun, and has witty, silly, and quirky characters. But the adds are a bit much.',
       'The game is amazing, and the ads help them make money, if you made a game this good would just want to let people play it? No, you would want a reward. The only things I don\'t like is that the land is sometimes unfair, my phone randomly mutes, and on my old phone I had this and there were more characters but not now on this phone',
       'Me and my son have had fun with this game and made an attempt to collect all characters. The game is set up so you can not earn all of the characters but have to buy the last couple in a cash grab. It would be fine if they we\'re only available for real money but the game gives the illusion that you can win them in a chest. One that we have spun over 50 times without success',
       'The game itself is enjoyable and the controls are quite simple. Very intuitive. But Jesus Christ on a frosty log, the ads are way to much. After every round, ad, want your prize? Ad. Wanna do anything in the game? Enjoy the ad. Jesus guys, I don\'t mind ads and I understand that\'s how you make money, but you shouldn\'t have to watch an ad to get your prize for winning... Come on.',
       'Everything else is great, EXCEPT the amount of ads... I love the game, but I don\'t want to keep turning on and off airplane mode so I can actually enjoy it.  Edit: there are ads after I go into settings and more information, which doesn\'t leave the app!? Seriously? And the "messages" are all more ads for other apps too, lol. Bro calm down with the ads. This is why I\'m now uninstalling.' ,

      'So I played it on my iPhone e and loved it. Recently o got a new phone and it\'s am android. I connected to my Nintendo account and loaded it up. My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I\'m not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr',
       'I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',
       'Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I\'m paying £9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn\'t make it worth the price being asked.',
       'Like a big lugger spit in your eye if your a Mario fan. Iv played since the first Mario. For one I very very much hate how u can not control Mario really u just run forward very very annoying. I\'d be OK with this if not for the insane price they ask to move on after the 1st world! Highly disappointed in this. Make it like Mario or get rid of it personally',
       'Super Mario run is a great smartphone game it has the very addicting toad rally and remix ten and the simple, but very rewarding controls. The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars',
       'I beat world 1, and I have to pay for the rest of the game? Really? This is stupid.. If you\'re going to have a game you need to pay for, market it as such, not the ol bait and switch. Very deceitful.. At least make a trial game or demo game not lure someone in and then tell them they need to pay to finish the game' ,

      'This game was great until the most recent update now I dont play as much. Only being able to save 25 cupcakes when before tgere was no limit IS terrible! I\'ve purchased boost to pass a level & several times when I\'ve used them the game freezes so I lose the boost. I contacted customer service got a generic response & no refund but they want me to rate their service 🤔 no thanks! I loved the game before but not so much now!!',
       'Would of gave full marks but on a few cooking appliances when I tap on it doesn\'t work. Second I think it would help if you could carry money over from one country to another and convert currency. Some of the levels are hard to achieve and you don\'t earn enough power ups and spoons to help you through the levels plus restore lives take ages. Customer waiting is to quick.',
       'I LOVED this game before the update .. now it won\'t even let me play it because it keeps telling me to please update it. That wouldn\'t be a problem only that it IS updated ... my phone got the update and is playable but on my tablet it won\'t update and in the app store it says open or uninstall so obviously it\'s updated.. I like playing on my tablet because it\'s bigger and easier to see .. PLEASE FIX THIS !!!',
       'I hate that we don\'t have unlimited lives.  When I double tap my food goes to the trash.  When it should only do that if its burning or tap on the waste bin. Oh and these new challenges are extremely hard why can\'t we get a tutorial on how to make the food 1st?  Other then that great game and addictive',
       'It is a great game and very fun to play but just needs a little more to it. The one thing I can\'t figure out is why do we keep getting coins if we can\'t use them to purchase anything after you get all the upgrades on your ingredients. There should be a use for them or stop giving us coins in the rewards of each day. I wish there more things to buy or if the coins could be transferred to the next level or something. Okay thanks. P.S. I was just enjoying this game until you guys decided to cut my cup cakes down to 25 only so that means I have been saving mine only to know that after I use them up I can only get 25 at a time well that sucks and I hope you change that back if not my time with this game has come to an end.',
       'Was a great,  fun game,  but now with the new Update things will not download.  I\'ve sent emails to them and nothing has change.  I did receive an email back asking to rate their and of course I told them you don\'t want me to rate something I never received!!  Can\'t open game,  this issue has gotten worse!!😡' ,

       'Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it\'s fun because it\'s challenging and there\'s super fun things in GD except hacking because that\'s no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I\'m super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂',
       'Well, I admit, I\'m addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn\'t be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can\'t Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍',
       'The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won\'t annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie',
       'It\'s a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it\'s super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.',
       'So rage inducing! But i am a comete noob at your amazing creations. When o first downloaded it 3 yrs ago i hated it a deleyed after failing the first level before getting halfway. Some how though my abillity for rage cam control itself and yea. So in a way you made a rage game that helped my rage. Huh. Anyways great game might buy full version. Only if i can become a good player though' ,

      'I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It\'s pricey but we\'ll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn\'t need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get',
       'I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.',
       'This game is a bit boring at first since it is really hard to serve your burgers because they take ages to cook.  I, after 1 day,  got totally addicted to it as it gets really fun and especially when it lets you purchase the automatic cooker for just 10 gems it is easy and cool! You will see what I mean when you hopefully download the app as I would definitely recommend it! Thank you for making a fun, addictive app that I enjoy. 😄',
       'Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn\'t need to have the internet on. Don\'t know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.',
       'this is a very well made game with excellent graphics and challenging play. It is however very money focused. The beginning levels are structured to encourage upgrades which at first are reasonable. Each later stage requires more diamonds to complete. The so called \'challenges\' are Impossible to complete without upgrading every implement so are essentially impossible for free play. Players beware!',
       'I love the way this game plays, and it plays like a dream. The grafics are wonderful, but there is just one flaw. The diamonds. You have to either play for a long time to earn more diamonds, and you can, or buy them with real money. And the game causes you to spend more diamonds than you can earn. From the atmosphere itself, to the food, and the appliances. Unless you have a lot of time and patience, or have the money to buy diamonds, this game might grind your nerves.' ,

      'First of all It\'s joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add "Edit and changing names"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱',
       '"Cusion shot on 8 ball" games are great, woukd be cool if one was created at a lower buy-in though.  I think its currently like 8 million needed to play a bank the 8ball game.  I personally like the No Guidline 9ball games,but would love a cheaper bank the 8 game.    Also, well done on adding the upgrade-able cue sticks.  That alone, i think, has made this game much much better.',
       'I realize y\'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don\'t pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I\'m pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It\'s a pretty good app and I\'ve sent many people to download your app.',
       'Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don\'t decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don\'t mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don\'t actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.',
       '8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don\'t win any games until those coins are over and I\'m only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don\'t know why this is happening but it sucks because it\'s putting me off the game.. it\'s like 8 ball is making sure I\'m losing hence the rate 3',
       'This is the most addictive game i have playing since a bought this phone. All the new updates are cool. Need to get rid of those hackers playin along. Also when we get a phonecall the game reopens, its better if you  reconnect it during the tier its self .. very plesent game give lots of happiness.. make sure you work with above mentioned glitches, then 5* is sure.' ,

      'So far it has been interesting. As far as these games go, at least they have missions that allow you to win some diamonds unlike choices, what\'s your story and episodes. With chapters you can watch videos, but that only gives you one diamond, so this is still better . I also love the memory quizzes. The characters faces are a bit odd though, but there is a similar problem with  episodes and choose your story. I am so drawn in by the mystery and fantasy stories that I hardly even notice the faces now. Also I love the aggressive lover options. For me fantasy means getting to do stuff I can\'t do in real life, like aggressively pursuing my love interests',
       'It\'s pretty good. I am going to save this application for now. Right now I am reading the Campus hacker story. I really do like the humor in it but I kind of find the characters rude LOL. I\'m only on the first book so I don\'t want to give up yet. I have four other reading applications and this one honestly is my least favorite as of right now but I would definitely recommend it and give it a shot.',
       'I really hoped that this would be different than Episode, Choices, or Chapters, but nope. This is even worse. The fact that the game doesn\'t even give you any diamonds to start off is bad, but it\'s ridiculous to not even be able to choose the special choices because they require a lot of diamonds... So disappointing. Solmare, for the love of god, please be unique! Give the readers more tickets and diamonds and give us the ability to earn tickets/diamonds through watching videos! Seriously! Don\'t download unless you want to go through a circle of pain.',
       'I really like the game and would have give 5 stars if darkness untold 2 would have been the following of darkness untold 1.... It\'s like the 1,you start from the beginning... But with another with the story taking another way... Very disappointing',
       'I like it so far. I love that you can earn diamonds. I don\'t like however that your selections don\'t get transferred to the next story and you basically have to rebuild the relationships. Untold darkness book 1 and book 2 have completely different relationship from one book to another which is disappointing. At least in campus hacker they stay quite similar. That would be the thing I would like to change. If it\'s meant to be a series than selections should follow. If not different characters names and different book titles should be established.',
       'Everytime I try to read Untold Darkness or any of the other stories... It takes too long and then says it can\'t load.... I\'m using cell phone data that is unlimited so there shouldn\'t be an issue on my end' ,

      'I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I\'d end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!',
       'Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It\'s reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series\' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis\'s and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I\'m offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,',
       'I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It\'s fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn\'t want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.',
       'Wasted up to 200gems in ultimate league so far. When you lose a match, they offer you to keep your progression in exchange of gems, but they put the option on the right side instead of left. I keep pressing it by mistake and waste gems that I\'d much rather use to reset gang fights instead.',
       'Game it self is great and a ton of fun.   But, the system for showing ads is so annoying.  It\'s not just your normal video ad no, they make you watch 3 different ads and a min of 16 or 11 sec each.  After you have watched the minimum time, you have to hit next and repeat again',
       'That stupid balloon weapon has killed and ruined the game for me. Also, supply boxes have gone rubbish recently. Getting the same old rubbish which is always alot less powerful than current level. Not had a decent tank in ages. Was a good game, not anymore.' ,

      'One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.',
       'I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That\'s why if I\'m going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.',
       'Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn\'t get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.',
       'Good game. I initially wrote a one star review because this game was very dependant on microtransactions but it\'s actually pretty fun if you have the patience. Right off the bat you have to wait upwards to 30 minutes or an hour for basic production and warming but as you grow your farm it gets easier to deal with. This definitely isn\'t a game you can play for, like, an hour, consecutively, which kinda sucks but it\'s great for the 10-20 minites you pop in now and then.',
       'Hi Hay Day Creators! I personally love this game, it\'s very relaxing and a nice way to kill time and does not use a lot of data. However I am having issues with watching the trailers to getting free stuff, I have an android operating system and I\'m not the only one having this issue, please fix this.',

      'This "game" is like empty calories. I ingested it ate it up and left hungry.  There is no goal whatsoever to this game. It is a glorified add campaign intended to keep you going on and on with a false feeling of accomplishment in order push ads on you or make you buy perks. Want to double your earnings for 20 seconds? Watch a 30 second ad. Want to improve earnings for four hours. Watch an ad. You get the point. Of course you can buy these perks but why do any of this? The "game" never really does anything whatsoever. No milestones, no real goals, no anything. Well after about 3 hours of game time and the equivalent of add watching time I am off to ingest something with more substance.',
       'AMAZING! I love this game. It is so addicting and a great way to pass time and boredom. I think though for one small improvement you could add a thing where there are like \'mini games\' and you earn coins for that. Using those coins earend in the mini games you spend it on things like watering cans, fences for live stock and more! This was only some suggestions for a bigger game if you can have or make a new game called like farm life or something like that....LOVE IT...',
       'I have seen this as an ad. I thought I should give it a try. It worked out. Before long, I reached level 15. Now I\'m on level 32 and I have 1.092 aa gold! I automated 100% of my farm!  I\'m already making lots of gold with automating potatoes. Potatoes give away so much gold! Good update.  Keep up the good work. Thanks, Idle Farming Empire. What a good replacement for Farm Away.  Idle Farming Empire is like the best simulation for farming. I gave the game 4 stars for a reason. I liked the game! Look under the review! There\'re many people rating the game 5 stars. It should really be rated 4 stars.  Over 97,800 people rated 4 and 5 stars. I like this game. Thanks for everything.',
       'I LOVE THIS GAMEE!! It\'s so addicting and once u get used to it, u can\'t stop playing it! It\'s a great time killer and it auto saves (not of u connected to Facebook.) Again, I love this game and I would recommend this game to EVERYONE because it\'s for all ages (unless u are a very serious person) JK LOL! :D',
       'Like so far But, 2 issues. 1- I don\'t Facebook or do any social media so needs to be a way other than ads for those bonuses. 2- daily rewards Don\'t happen. Shows that they were collected but will not activate unless I have enough diamonds. Please fix. Play offline on tablet and hotspot to get daily reward.',
       'Great and addicting game, but with one major bug. I went to collect my idle money and I watched a video too double it (46 billion total). But when I hit the button to collect it, I never got it. All the money dissapeared and I got nothing. What\'s the point of an idle game, if you don\'t get anything for being idle?' ,

      'Welcome to Idle Farming Empire! Once upon a time you knew us as Farm Away!. But then a bunch of wealthy investors came in and took over - and now they’re ready to make you RICH! So what\'s new?',

      'Good graphics but the character movements are clunky.  I\'m a hardcore FPS gamer and I like to test the limitations of a game.  So tried shooting a shoulder and the bullet went for a headshot instead whereas I clearly know my aim would miss. Glitchy.  Clunky and not so realistic unfortunately.  So not sure why the high ratings.',
       'Is game could be so much more than it is! After a few weeks, PVP becomes a joke when you are up against paying users who have one shot kill guns and a barrage of armour.  Then single player is just rinse and repeat over and over again.',
       'The latest version is so annoying. On the sniper arena, my men get killed immidiatly at the end of the countdown to begin. If i even shoot any sniper he wont die rather it will finish it shoutout and then turn to my soldier and kill it. I hate now i hate d game. Please do something about it.',
       'This was a fun game at first until I got to a mission that is impossible to complete. I have the Target directly in my crosshairs and my shots go right through him. The hint only tells me he\'s too far away but he never gets closer. Also the price for premium is ridiculous. Uninstalling.',
       'Yeah man cool game, however we must ask ourselves if weed is a gateway drug maybe shooting games are a gateway to more sinister things but no one give a hoot about it hahahaha I like playing games. Hi, 5 stars. Food next 2',
       'The basic concept of the game is fun, but like all games these days, micro transactions are rammed down your throat. I would be fine if that was all but then they time gate you with the weapon upgrades you need for missions and lock content out for you unless you\'ve paid for a better level of gun. Avoid this one.' ,

      'My ONLY issue is we have a Pirate, Wizard, & knight "hat", but NO clothes to go with it. Can we PLEASE get those outfits made available?? I\'ve been playing for over 10 YEARS now (I believe) & it\'s been like this since DAY ONE. Also, I\'d LOVE more furniture options. It would be cool if we had a new set for each room for every 100 levels reached. 100, 200, 300, etc bc it\'d keep players having a goal to attain & it\'d make us thrive to achieve it!!! Besides keeping us interested, we LOVE a strong variety & set of options. It rewards us, if we have the ability to purchase it, & we play for reward. Just a thought that I hope you STRONGLY consider & follow through with.  I\'d give 5 stars across the board if these changes were made. THANK YOU!!!',
       'Okay heres the thing,every f game is with money and this game was so much better without those money,i was 1000 lvl and my tom is gone why? Cuz u didnt made that feature back in the days,also u made this stupid diamonds alll for money,and not coins like it was...its not all about money get it? This game was so popularbback in the days and now is trash with all those videos to watch all those money you need to spend on clothes for tom...its ridiculus...sry for my english im just disapointed cuz u turned this game in real money not coins where you can be able to buy everything by playing like i did....',
       'Not good for little ones. Too many buttons leading ads or in app purchases. Might be good for kids 6+ who would know a little better but my 3 year old just clicks everything shiny which of course is ads or in app purchases',
       'Changed my rating from 5 stars to one star because of the incessant ads. I sat through 2 30 second ads which I didn\'t click on. These ads last longer than the actual game time. I\'m not paying to get rid of the ads, nor should I have to sit through them without requesting them..',
       'I think this game is very very fun and addictive! Dont believe people who say talking animal games have people in their eyes, (except maybe Angela) Keep up the good work!',
       'Don\'t get me wrong good game, but most of the adds freeze up the game. Plus it has caused pop ups on my phone. Fix that and i will fix my rating' ,

      'I love this game. Every game I\'ve had, I played for a week or so, and uninstalled. But this one? Ive had for almost 6 months. Been playing every single day. Finally reached legendary 32, I\'ve unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so. Or at least a new adventure spot. Making a modded version of the rally car would be fantastic. Also, an upgrade on the formula car where it doesn\'t almost dead stop after it lands from a big air.',

    description: 'Children\'s doctor - we all love when people around us smile. We become well and happy when someone on the street gives us a smile. But for a smile to be beautiful, you need to take good care of your teeth. This applies to your pets, because in childhood they were for every kid. Like people, they also sometimes need to treat their teeth. This can be done by a special doctor - dentist. We present to your attention an exciting game for children - a dentist (vet clinic). In this entertaining game, your child is a real dentist, under the guidance of which there is a hospital for animals. The kid is entrusted with a very important and responsible task - the treatment of teeth of his four-footed pups, whose teeth began to ache heavily because of their love for sweets. You have to treat them in a real dental office, use various medical instruments, such as tongs, scalpels, Burmashin and many others, to clean your four-legged friends of teeth from plaque, align them, do operations, remove cavities and fill them. After all, they all just need your help. For her, the animals will be grateful to you and very grateful. Developing games for children, such as a veterinarian, contribute to the overall development of your child. They help to develop fine motor skills, coordination of movements, visual perception, attentiveness and observation, will show the baby how to treat animals, take care of them. Our games for kids, such as a dentist, will teach them not only to treat their pets with love and care, but also to protect their own teeth, do not forget to clean them several times a day, because going to the dentist is not the most pleasant pastime. For the purpose of comprehensive development of the child, we create applications and educational games for children that are aimed to help boys and girls develop basic motor and other skills, and also have fun, fun and useful to spend their free time. All you need is to download games, install and start playing, and in the future your child can choose one of the most needed professions in the world - the dentist Be sure to visit our http://yovogames.com and also we are at:Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZruadkJJTuD4Bgb1F6pa3ATwitter: https://twitter.com/YOVOstudioFacebook: https://facebook.com/yovogames',

       'My 3 year old loves it but she can\'t play it by herself because of  the constant full screen ads that she can\'t dismiss without my help. Useless',

       'It should say the name of each tool when its picked up. So the kids can learn. My daughter likes the came but she also wants to know the name of each tool.' ,

      'Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death',
       'Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I\'ll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.',
       'This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can\'t seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn\'t be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it\'s not something you have to add, it\'s just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven\'t seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it\'s an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘',
       'This game would be great if it wasn\'t so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn\'t slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.',
       'Love it. Only thing is there is a glitch when you watch an ad for 200 thingy things you get a menu that lets you get 200 more. Than again, than again. Its better on our side than yours but it would be a good fox so you have to earn them! I love all your games, wish I had all of them but I have limited storage!',
       'Good game I figured out why I couldn\'t buy the bikes anymore😹 Anyway sometimes it gets a bit laggy but it doesn\'t last for to long. I told my friends about it and they love it it\'s fun to play when you\'re bored. All in all a good game:) Edit: Game:Score between 54 and 58 me: *scores 54* yes! *waiting* Game: doesn\'t count Me: great.' ,

      'The game itself is very well thought of, highly addictive and is a great time killer. Plus, there are almost no ads in this game. However, there are just too many animations. It\'s almost impossible to play this hame st a consistent frame rate. Maybe add an ability to downscale the resolution or tone down the animations?  Edit: after the new update they fixed it. The game runs buttery smooth',

       'This game is very addictive but it just seems like an ad watching game. All the company cares about is money so they spam ads on to the game. Why play mini games for Golden Apples when you could just watch ads for Golden Apples since they let you watch infinite ads. Why play Classic, Zen or Arcade for Starfruit when you could just watch ads.',
       'Gutted, fantastic game but the stupid ads are way too much, you can\'t skip em n they seem go on for ages, would be five star if it was just pop ups or not an ad after every bloody round, uninstall' ,

      'This game is good for a good time waster, but eventually it gets boring. The only thing really fun is trying to beat your high score. I think a way to help improve the game is have a high score chart around the  world. So we are going against everyone and trying to beat their high score as well as our own.  You can have many charts. A weekly, monthly, daily, and overall.  And with that being said I think you should incorporate prizes. Which can just be skins for the blocks. Trying to collect all of the skins.    Just a thought and idea. Because there comes a time where it\'s gets boring competing against yourself.',
       'Love the game. I hate that there is a ad after every end. If you have to restart, you\'ll get any ad before you can continue. Outta frustrating Ann\'s makes me not want to play.',
       'The ads are so Terrible they interrupt gameplay now so if you were placing a block forget it it just placed itself because it registers that you let it go. Good game but not worth the annoyance.',
       'Really you have no idea what\'s coming next, so you can\'t plan on your next strategic move. Its all luck if you make it to the next round or not. So theres no challenge. I do appreciate the fact it has no ads.',
       'It would be better if the adverts didn\'t stop you playing the game. Also asking for the rating every five mins pisses me off',
       'It needs an undo option or needs to show two of the next set of 3...maybe even give an option to pick which set you want to play. It\'s frustratingly fun...I get mad and stop playing, but like an addict, I come back. And for those that don\'t like the ads. Turn your phone to airplane mode while playing.' ,

      'This is by far the best chess "trainer" for me.  It\'s got a nice flow and the game isn\'t "stupid" like most other chess apps/games I\'ve played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I\'m making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.',
       'I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn\'t show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.',
       'For the non experts, let me tell you that 5his game cheats. I sat with a real chessboard to analyse why wasn\'t I  able to crack master level.   And what i observed was it didn\'t allow you to make actual moves when you show high levels of intell8gence. Sometimes it makes moves which are faulty. I think there is some mistakes in coding, perhaps deliberately made.  So not a fair play but a foul play.',
       'it\'s just a chess game yea, but it actually looks nice for a change. most chess games are really boring because all they have are symbols and very rarely, possibly sound. when you think it\'s boring that means you don\'t like chess, but not the app. what do you expect? guns and explosions? didn\'t think so.',
       'So far it\'s o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It\'s not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game',
       'The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.' ,

      'Would of gaven 5 stars. But there some bugs that need to be worked out. Like connection and handling. But other then that this game is really close to PUGB for the phone. Massive open world. COULD do little better on the mechanic of the game but nothing to major. Would like to have a better money earn system like small amout per kill or something. This game is well dont. Ive played almsot all games on gogole play and when i say this game is fun I MEAN IT!!..',
       'Thank you for constantly improving the game. Id say at this point not to add more but to fix and adjust what you already have. Fine tuning before more additions would be great. Optimizing sounds, movements, vehicles, rendering, scoping, responses, all that good stuff would be great. Its a little laggy but thats just what you get for a giant game and 100 million+ players. Love it either way.',
       'Why is there no controller support!!!!! For a game like this it is imperative for good controls. Playing on a touch screen is alright but I would like to be able to use a controller and considering controller support has been out sense android 4.0 this wouldn\'t even limit your customer base as I doubt any 4 year old phones can even play your game above 10fps. It seems like it is deliberately being left out and it is baffling me. Please can we use our controllers it\'s such a simple api to implement!!!! Seriously I think monkeys can implement controllers in games quicker then you guys what the hell!!',
       'Fun game, especially since it\'s free. But I saw that this game supports controllers so I tried to use my pro switch controller with it and so far only 2 buttons seem to work, as well as a huge delay from input to actual action. And I can\'t seem to customize the controller layout, so I\'m just stuck with the Ability to walk and crouch/lay down with said controller. Can\'t aim or shoot.',
       'The game has so much potential they just need to make it easier to see other players and easier to shoot people close to you. Also the game doesn\'t need to look realistic they should make it more like fortnite graphics and gameplay wise.  My main point is that it is too hard to see others in the game. still a good game though',
       'honestly a great game. but dont get diamonds to buy their packs. not only are they really expensive but the chance of actually getting their special clothes is so small I bought 10 packs of the monkey king and I got the same 2 grey items from all 10 packs.... like wth???' ,

      'It\'s a great game, you can have fun while also learning a lot of interesting facts about the world. You actually can play without paying, you can watch ads to get tickets for example, I have 200 tickets even tho I haven\'t paid a cent. The only thing that I don\'t get is the new content community, it would\'ve been great if we\'d gotten some clarification on that, but oh well.',
       'I was super enjoying this game. It\'s interesting and you definitely feel like you\'re learning. The trivia is great and the format really works but for some reason I\'ve just lost like 20 of the brown tickets which I was saving. That\'s annoying and the kind of thing I delete games for unfortunately.',
       'I\'m So Sad! Once you get into the game and Really Like it! They trap you... You have to purchase "money" to travel to different cities. Not good. I\'m uninstalling. ☹️',
       'I love the game lots of fun! The only thing is it keeps freezing up on me on some of the questions. I then have to restart it and I get penalized as if I didn\'t know that block of questions. Other than that it is a really fun game and I am enjoying it.',
       'Loved thus game until the upgrade. Now it freezes, tells me I am offline. I have to reboot and lose progress and tickets. How can I go back to the old version?',
       'The game won\'t let me start the first step. It basically freezes. The music plays but after hitting the first question mark like it directs you to do nothing happens but a few more of those question marks pop up but I can\'t select them or move around the screen.' ,

       'Love this game but it would be really awesome if the theme background would change instead of always driving in the street. Perhaps have a park theme and other areas maybe a beach theme and they ride on jetskis and collect coins jumping over obstacles etc. Make it more diverse and less of the same thing. And more fun characters 😀',
       'This is so hilarious because it\'s retarded! The face the face they make when they crash is stupid.  Love the Guavian Death Gang! I rate it a good game :)',
       'It is so boring  and its nothing to do it just choose  which  lego   friend  to use and you need to  drive  the car so i think  i am going to erase  the game' ,

       'The gameplay is of course billion perfect and also the graphics!!! If any 1 wanted to play any interesting game....THIS IS THE ANSWER: goat simulator!! But when I was in a house in the game, I found a hilarious thing ..... Doritos the chips, hahaha it was really funny! Also when I went to the supermarket in goat simulator I found lays, Doritos and Oreos..can u imagine??!!!?!?!? Then I hit a girl and a boy with a gas car but they didn\'t die??!!! and that\'s a little bit creepy and weird. If u r asking a question why goat simulator got all of those downloads the 500 million I will answer u, cuz it\'s perfect and no 1 can do a game better than this. The graphics and gameplay and costumes!!',
       'Most rediculous game ever and I love it! But could you at least expand goatville (put more stuff in it and make it bigger) since you can\'t play in the other levels without buying them and a lot of people can\'t?',
       'Guys it\'s a great game but when I start playing the first level the controls don\'t work plz work this out. Otherwise it\'s a really good game with great graphics! Plz fix the problem.',
       'Well just tried goat simulator for the first time ever and man it\'s one funny game and it plays flawless on my oppo a57 smartphone which is good,  really good game,  ridiculous but fun.',
       'Its ok but...You have to pay to buy the place like buck to school Etc And i don\'t want to Buy that before it was free,now its not i dont really like it anymore cause of that' ,

      'Amazing game... Loved it...😍 The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it\'ll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it\'s okay 😊',
       'This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn\'t as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn\'t there but now it\'s forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.',
       'I really wish you guys didn\'t update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can\'t listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!',
       'It\'s an amazing game. Sure I run around my bedroom screening every time I fail next to the end.... but there is something about this game that makes you happy. Is it the music? Maybe. Is it the back ground and the way it moves?possibly. It\'s all of those things plus more   In a nut shell I really really really really really really really really really love this game :p',
       'The gameplay is unique, but one thing I notice that is so hard to get the highest level as we totaly have no idea about the beat from music while we play it. Need to play the same level on and on until I become familiar with every single beat from it. Anyway, use your best headphone. They come with so much beautiful musics you\'ll ever heard',
       'Seems like controls tend to be problematic, and synchronisation has to be adjusted for every song. However the game is wonderful, precise, compelling and worth spending time on! Everything is well thought, new levels and lines are frequently added. So far my favourite app ever, looking forward to playing some new levels and the match option.' ,

      'Most of the controls are excellent, I love the snap-to by selecting a ball, and the fine tune dial, however the "spin" mechanic is terrible to the point of being broken. No matter where you put the contact spot on the cue it is always maximum front spin or back spin, there is no diagonal spin or English, and no gentle spin of any kind. Fix this and you have a perfect pool game.',
       'I played without sound for a long time. After Upgrading my tablet, the sound won\'t turn OFF!   I have it off in the settings but am still getting sound after sinking a shot and at the end of a game.  I am very dissappointed that i wont be able to play this app anymore.',
       'It\'s not horrible by any means but it\'s basically the children\'s version of what the game should be. Way to basic way too easy and no points and buying system or any sort of upgrades every level just diffs with amount of balls and placement not difficulty Thanks',
       'Was disappointed when I reached level 816 and found no more game. Also, game could use some kind of "side game" to avoid boredom.  But still good time killer.',
       'I enjoy playing this game. I already reach level 400 but i don\'t know how many levels this game have. Do you increase the levels every time you update this game until it reach to never ending levels so that no one will stop playing this game because of the never ending levels. This game is fun and challenging.',
       '1st there are ads in between each play which is ridiculous.. I dont know how high the game goes up but there are NO hints or instructions on what exactly the goal is besides potting balls.. it\'s ADDICTIVE and fun BUT if this is all there is to it I won\'t keep game long' ,

      'I\'m 11 and i love it so much.I have some Ideas for a toca kitchen 3. You can be able to make sandwiches and soups or stews. And more ingredients, more people. And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.',
       'I want YOU to read this Toca Boca I love it! But I have to ask, Why is there bread if you can\'t make a sandwich? Also can you make there a way to make soup? I really like your games but I am only 10,how do you expect me to pay for the games. At make 5 free like this!',
       'I like how I can give the guests disgusting drinks and food a see and hear their really funny reaction! Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!😆😆 I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!',
       'Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I\'m sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP',
       'I\'m giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won\'t make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least',
       'This is the best game ever it is also funny because I was giving the girl food and I gave her some strawberries and I put a lot of lemon, hot sauce, Barbiecu sauce,Manas,keckup,salt, and pepper... SO funny, it also sounds just like a kid is playing with the food, that I\'m eating grapes right now,😂😂😂😂😁😀😊☺🙂😐' ,

      'This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you\'re willing to go broke',
       'Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.',
       'This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!',
       'Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses.',
       'I have a significant concern with how easy it is to accidentally spend the gems. It has happened at least once, though I\'m assuming it happened a second time while I was quickly clicking building a building, since fifteen gems are now unaccounted for. I cannot feel comfortable with this game if at any given moment, all my gems might get spent because of one misclick.',
       'I really like this game it is very fun. The only thing is, how do you wave, I dont know but I play it on PC so I am not very sure how to wave so please tell me if you can do it on PC. Also can you maybe update is so you can use it on PC with w a s d because I am used to it. Anyway love the game good job!' ,

      'I really like the game, but as soon as I played multiplayer my phone crashes. I know it\'s not my phone itself but the program because my phone never crashes to anything. Please fix the multiplayer mode! It\'s really nice but constantly crashes!!! Only because of that, I\'m giveng it one star. As soon as it\'s fixed I\'ll be sure to give it 5 star and share it with my friends.',
       '1. The online mode isn\'t letting join a match 2. There should be special moves, like when you fall down, if you press the slide button, you won\'t lose speed (like in Mirrors edge) 3. The courses/levels are too easy, make it more harder',
       'The single player mode is amazing but the online mode isnt to great, i know its in beta. Either the game crashed, or the other player just can walk through walls on my screen and they win no matter what',
       'Some of the player crashing in the game pls fix so they can\'t cheat no more and when you do that I can give you 5star',
       'The multiplayer option closes the app at random. I know it\'s a new feature so I expect it will be addressed. Otherwise the game as a whole is ok. Could use more flipping it seems to me.',
       'So I turned on the game and I did some steps, maybe 30 passed and I laughed, I turned it off and I uninstalled it.  It is without a doubt hilarious.' ,

      'As I sat down on a bench with my drink I realised something. My bepsi didn\'t taste like bepsi. It was...CONK!? I succ on my thumb just thinking about this memory. I was ANGERY. I wanted to go back in time and tell myself "boi. That\'s CONK! Not bepsi!" And then succ all of the conk bottles up so nobody has to deal with it.',
       'It\'s awesome very addictive, my game likes to freeze or glitch sometimes and I crash or die but it\'s a free game so not overly concerned about it. Overall great game when they game out with the sequel it addressed the main problem with this one mainly no other maps and you have to pay to get the female character',
       'I think this  game is so interesting  that I play it all day , and somtimes  it tell you that you  should  never ever  steal any thing  from a dangerous  place where nobody  is there, it is really  difficult.  Good luck  and be  safe',
       'It\'s a great game to spend time playing on but I would like the controls to change, their to annoying when I jump I die and am like WOAH... I JUMPED, THOUGH!!! otherwise. Great game.',
       'The game is cool but there\'s a few things that have gone wrong because when my 10 and 5 year old grandchildren  play they say when we try to jump it won\'t let us so it would mean a lot if you changed it a bit',
       'I did it I mean I get my high score and then I died makes no sense right snow total stands but not mad at this game because like I can definitely not beat it it\'s like a fun and active game I would give it like a 5 of I didn\'t die like the heck' ,

      'It\'s fun because I  git to play with school friends, and the gaming is amazing so keep up the good work! But I hate the new update with levels to upgrade you wepons! On upgrade costs more than the gun! Not   every one in the game is rich you know!',
       'I really like it. It\'s fun and entertaining, a highly suggested game in my opinion. Although i would like it if the sandbox mini game had more maps, and more freedom to choose those maps as well. It would also be very appreciated if we could play games with lower leveled players because i really wanna play co-op games with my friend, but she just started the game and it says insufficient levels. It would also be nice if the options of private servers were back in sandbox and you could choose what teams you wanna join in team fight. But otherwise, it\'s really great and easy to play 😄',
       'This game is the best I have ever played on a phone tons of maps, game modes, hundreds of guns, different tools, gear, and lots of skins. There is just so many things you can do. I also like it because it is a challenge something I would play. That\'s why I rated this game 5 stars.',
       'Don\'t restrict players by taking away added ability from weapons, gear, and wear in siege mode. The game should be a lot more flexible with the payouts... players not winning anything worth the time wasted playing a game that wants you to buy items that don\'t bring anything for the purchase. Like, reward players with trophies for purchases. Or create a new league for players that have accumulated enough points strictly for the new league. With more unlockable items and arenas...',
       'This game sucks becuz the update and u need alot off gem and coins and the update is sucks very much I can\'t even use the anti hero rifli and I need alot of gems to upgrade your game sucks no body like your game if u fix this update and u need to be batter game I think Minecraft are batter becuz Minecraft had mods and I comment in Twitter you won\'t chat back and fix I got cheat detected without any reason I don had alot of gems and coins and I had 1,678 coins and 356 gems and I just keep it then cheat detected. And now I want to hack becuz of you and I hate your app',
       'The reason why I gave 3 stars is beacause i want the renting to be more than just 2 matches maybe like 4 so they know how to use it. And when i was making my skin like some kind of bug showed up. And the bug reseted my hard work' ,

      'I played Game of War for appx 3 years.  The game started out great, everyone was on a somewhat even playing field. The game advanced to quick and left thousands of players behind. Other Players and I felt we could never keep up.  I hope this game advances at much more slower rate.  We all spend money to enjoy the game!    Don\'t be gready like GOW.  Thank you in advance.  Kirk',
       'Overall great game, however to play and be competitive ait is important to spend. In fact just to unlock some features you must spend at least .99 which is fine by me since I love to spend on this game anyways. I have been playing koa from the start and when this game came out I jumped on the bandwagon in the first 50 kingdom servers. So with that said yes it is LOTS of fun, I love my GoG family and definitely addicting LOL see you on the burning war field ;)',
       'It is a fun game and is the most indepth game I\'ve ever played. That all being said, unless you have a ton of money and a lot of time there is no way this game is worth it. I\'ve spend over $100 and play multiple times per day and I still find it hard to level up my estate. Even in an alliance unless they\'re all very high level it isn\'t much help. I\'m sure they\'re are much better games in this genre then Guns of Glory. To me it seems like a game for wealthy people and made by a company to just make money.',
       'What a great game!  Need to have introductory levels for newcomers, though.  You build your kingdom up and larger kingdom\'s just rush in and destroy you.  When you recover, they come right back.  Level into the attack mode, so people will enjoy the game more.  I am uninstalling after 6 weeks of running an Alliance, because it\'s just not worth the trouble.  Great concept, fantastic graphics!',
       'Love this game! Very entertaining, never boring. My only complaint is with some of the collecting events. You have to do certain things to obtain the necessary items to put together, but for some reason with the current one you don\'t get enough of one item, and too much of another. It would be great if you could trade within your alliance for things like this.',
       'It\'s an interesting game of strategy.  You make allies in order for your alliance to grow. At the same time always on your guard knowing at any time your allies can instantly become enemies to prevent you on your way to becoming the strongest alliance in the kingdom. There are new quests to complete weekly. Each with different rewards that help you to achieve power.There are many kingdoms on the map which is great. The only downside is you have to leave one kingdom and join another to enter it and play the game in it. Not sure if you get to keep the same level and strength you achieved. But I\'m sure that the developers will one day have it to where kingdom will be able to attack kingdom and there\'s a lot of kingdoms. The game would definitely become very intense and even more exciting then. It would also become one of the best of the best strategic games there is.' ,

      'Ive been playing for the better part of a year, and this game started out great for a long while. But IGG not only panders and gives better deals to Chinese people, cheaper packs etc. But literally 99% of all mega guilds and players are Chinese or Vietnamese. If your not asain don\'t play this game  you\'ll end up like me playing forever just to quit because of the obvious discrimination IGG holds with its playerbase',
       'Do NOT go for high level military research without searching monster hunting, and Do NOT go for T4 if you not going to spent thousands of dollars. Even if you don\'t mind to wait 200 days, you will not able to afford it (lvl 10 military Def, Atk, Health cost 100m gold each). DO NOT GO FOR HIGH MILITARY AND T4 WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE GAME.',
       'This game is fun but be prepared for the mother of all Pay2win games.  These folks at IGG are experts at crafting new and exciting ways at fleecing their customers of every cent they can.  You CANNOT compete if u dont pay and pay often.  Players here ...just regular people... dump hundreds of rl $$$ regularly.  You have been warned.',
       'If you like spending mad money to be an Internet tough guy this is the game for you.  Of you have tons of time to kill to be a punching bag for pay to play Internet tough guys it may also be the game for you.  If the computer random stuff kills off your troops don\'t expect to get tech support, it will always be reviewed in 1-3 days, even the next time you ask, another 1-3 days.',
       'Game Sucks! Super high levels can come in wipe you out, seems like if they had a level limit, let\'s say 5 levels above you they can\'t attack, but O NO!!  Every day I come in to find I have been attack by a level 25 and I\'m only a level 14. It takes days to rebuild, so yeah everyday same thing, about to uninstall this game not worth it to me...',
       'Gameplay is good, not a lot to complain about. As far as purchasing via in-app, BE CAUTIOUS AS THEY HAVE LITTLE TO NO CARE ABOUT THE QUALITY OR THE QUANTITY OF THE SUPPLIES YOU PURCHASE FROM WHAT WAS ADVERTISED TO YOU. YOU WILL NOT SEE REIMBURSEMENT.' ,

      'Honestly i really enjoy the game thus far thank you for all the recent updates niantic... but there is one thing that has been bothering me and that is 1v1 with friends and trading... both features were shown in the original trailer... yet again i love the care your giving the game niantic i truly praise it but i would like to know whats happening with my 2 listed thoughts',
       'The game has been majorly revamped and has benefited from it. It\'s so much better to see that content and events are happening more often. Hopefully we\'ll see the first wave of gen 4 by April or May and a nice egg event will happen to get a higher chance of a baby Pokemon from gen 4. Keep up the great work only downside is legendaries. I can\'t get them as not enough people in my area play Pokemon go and I\'m not travelling for a Pokemon. Can we have a legendary event for one week you can get 3* legendary raids? That would make it easier.',
       'I like the game, I was a bit worried to get it when it came out at first, but after installing it and learning how it generally works I like it a lot. I would love to see more pokemon added and maybe even some PvP/ being able to challenge other people around you some day. So far it\'s been great, I\'m not really sure why so many people have been so upset about it, but it\'s definitely a 5/5 for me so far.',
       'Constantly saying GPS not found (11). She jumps to random places and takes forever to even move. Its basically useless.. I was going to get a new phone to play this thinking it would work better but even after the update it hasn\'t changed. Waste all my data trying to play. Not happy. Disappointed.',
       'I\'m an android user and also on a budget so I can\'t get the latest and greatest ever really. And every phone I\'ve ever had cannot run this stupid game. The developers really need to work with the lower quality phones to get it to be able to detect the GPS in them because it will load the character model, and the UI. Nothing else though. As soon as it starts loading it just says GPS signal not found and it can\'t ever find it  total garbage',
       'Pokemon keep disappearing from my backpack. They are in there after I catch them but disappear later.  They appear in pokedex as one\'s caught. Never had this problem before. Wasting money for balls when it doesn\'t count. Will never purchase balls again.  Rating would go up if bugs were fixed regularly.' ,

      'Earn.Unlimited👇 łnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enter (DARA) to Start Earnings So far so good. Fun way to get Money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. Uno points equals uno instead of like some of the others where it takes uno points to reach uc etc....Also, TOYOCASH App is very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyo. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to waIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for adding some fun to my day.',
       'Very fun and time killing. I play with my bf and 2 friends and we all try to beat eachothers high scores. It can be pretty competitive. Im prob gonna try to get more ppl to play with me too lol. There could be more variety in the blocks, and there should be like different modes, just an idea',
       'Its cool and all but needs some extra features.  Maybe a way to store 1 brick for later or some level advancement.  Maybe challenges or a power up system. The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.',
       'What they show on the preview and what it gives you in game don\'t even match. They make it look like it so easy. You cannot rotate the pieces. The pieces they give are so random, and most games you can barely get past a couple of turns before you can\'t place anymore and you lose.',
       'This is very deceiving. It looks like it\'s Tetris, but it\'s not. The pieces don\'t come down like the pictures show. I hate apps like this who deceive people to believe its a certain game when it\'s not just to get people to download. Will never download a game from this developer again.',
       'This app would score a lot better if there was an option to get rid of the adds. If gladly pay to have them gone but that isn\'t an option for some reason. They\'re so intrusive and far too frequent even for a free game. Uninstalling and won\'t be coming back' ,

       'Its so super expensive to buy a fucshia tiara, please when i unlock it please reccomend 1999 coins again and my pou so super preety pink and so beautiful. Update: please when i unlock it it must be 999 coins per item and please make it cheaper and please make it more beautiful like adding sparkles in tiaras and make more minigames and specials!                                   Problem: i can\'t raise enough money and food and please make the tiara cheaper so i can save lots of money.     Note:It must be made when January 1 2018 thank you!                                             Email:knoxdune 2014 com. Nickname:Ichiko /Love it very much thank you! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤',
       'It\'s been more than a year that you haven\'t added any mini game in any update. You\'ve written on "What\'s New" section that "We\'re working on something big" but you .haven\'t shown that big work yet😅..At least add more mini games...And I\'ll rate 5.',
       'I played Pou once before. But now I will go back on taking care of him. The things I remember are, The mini games, Pou is becoming fat and a lot of things that I can\'t remember. I\'ll play this now for good :D... BTW, awesome game!',
       'I wish you didn\'t have to wait for a long time for a item. Like, for example, if a hat was level 60. Then you have to wait for a long time. Please instead of doing levels. Please just make them expensive. Because you need to wait.',
       'After I posted my recent comment, there were some angry comments pointed out at me. I apologise for that. I mean, this game in great! There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars. For someone who says "too many notifications", go to the settings and turn off that notifications button. Thank you for those hate critics you guys made. It really teached me a lesson.' ,

      'It stopped working on my One plus! Help! I was excited about the side games! *********************************** Excellent, addictive fun. I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn\'t level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can\'t progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.',
       'Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It\'s nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don\'t want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn\'t get a key.',
       'Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion.',
       'Fun game but takes forever to get gold to upgrade. The cost to pay for the gems to buy so you can buy gold is really expensive. Not much dynamic to the game. Same stuff on each level just takes longer to bet enemies cause of higher HP.',
       'I wish I read the reviews before I downloaded this "game". Absolutely awful. Seriously, don\'t waste your time. If you like a stupid amount of ads and you are a fan of being bored then go for it.',
       'This game is simple. So simple that it is stupidly addictive at times when my mental and physical ability equates to a bowl of fruit. Nothing in this game brings me more satisfaction than the immensity of lag when bolts are caught in rapid bounce in a confined space. I say that with the utmost sincerity, no sarcasm at all. The lag is so intense, so joyful to watch. Please don\'t take it away from me. It is beautiful.' ,

      'Very much a top game, graphics are in your face with colours and speed. It\'s a" please don\'t stop playing me mi kind of game" Thank you. 😱 Wicked game. Top buzz. For some unknown reason, the creatures aren\'t rolling. Still good. One of the most enjoyable games you can play with 1 finger. Thanks again. Not working is the bonuses you get playing everyday. Brilliant wicked. Excellent. Top one digit game. 👆 Great. Can\'t stop playing the game. Bravo. Thanks again. Wicked. Great. Funtastic. Brilliant',
       'No Wi-Fi needed.   Keeps getting better. Can unlock more characters as you play. Free to play style which mean you buy what you want. Looks like the game is always being worked on. Which in my opinion more new stuff or improvements to come later on ; as the game gets older and people keep playing. Which has been proven in more then one occasion.',
       'It\'s a good game to kill time with, though it doesn\'t offer much. Touch controls work well although a bit finicky, and it hits the difficulty spike a bit sooner than expected. It might have you buying some upgrades through micro transactions. I\'ve also experienced some lag that caused some unfair moments to happen. Still, it won\'t stop you from trying to beat your or your friends\' high score every once in a while. Overall, it\'s fast paced fun (Pun intended).',
       '5 stars its so good! I think its perfecto and I want you to play the game because it is so important to video games video games would not have made it this far without sonic dash and I like the paacman event right now',
       'This game is a really good game. And I think this game deserve\'s a 10/10 rating. And pacman in Sonic Dash and sonic in PAC-MAN is a really cool thing',
       'Like the game. Fun and good time waster. Wish that you didn\'t need as many Red rings to buy characters and that you didn\'t need the pay money to get Classic Sonic.' ,

      'This is an awesome game that gives you daily and weekly quest\'s and offers treasure chests. Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven\'t tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.',
       'Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a "slide," I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don\'t compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.',
       'Nice, good, adventure game.but some times your team irritating who one completed thirteen level they will easily get diamond  your giving master challenge ( now the challenge Chinese New year )who one complete your giving thirty diamond only.this offer will useful only for entry level gamers. Most of players finished fourteen level so they no need diamonds.so think about genius players.',
       'I love all the graphics it\'s a bit like the        piano tiles it test\'s your fast skills but except it is temple run 2 love it. Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.',
       'I love this game, very addicting. And I love that it has the daily, weekly and global challenges. As well as objectives and the daily chest challenges. Lots of things to work for and win. Makes the game more fun. Plus, so far, I haven\'t come across anything that I\'ve had to spend money on in order to advance in the game',
       'Temple run 2 is a good game I like it to a lot could be better as always seem to have trouble with play services an so some features won\'t load e.g maps or have trouble getting the characters to slide windows for the selection takes a few attempts of start up. I think when it works it\'s a great game there is just know way to get the bugs out iv tried everything. G8UM8' ,

      'Well I like the game. It\'s fun and it is really tempting to open a really good chest because you can get a legendary. I have minor inferno dragon lava hound mega knight sparky and lumberjack. For example pretend your friend says don\'t open that ledendary chest wait until tomorrow . You just gotta open it. And Supercell it would be nice if I could get night witch.',
       'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'I m lucky enough!!!!!  I just started playing 8 months ago and now I earn 7 legendaries in total and 2 of them are lvl2 where as my friend is playing since more than a year he owes only 6 legendaries and 1 of them is lvl 2..... So plz do something about this we(gamers) expect better from u  Plz don\'t disappoint them who has low no.s of legendaries....... This is request from all guys who have not got luck in this game I guess...',
       'Well after playing it for so many months. It now has not let me play for about a  week out of no where, it loads to 50% and then it asks to try again later I have uninstalled it many times and retried time after time. All of my other games work just not this one. Don\'t really know what to do. It sucks because this is my favorite game too.',
       'This is  the best game ever. And supercell, can u add google + sign in so that people who don\'t use facebook can also have friends.. Also I have like 8 leggie right now and I am so happy. And the new clan battle is awesome, it is the best. I wish it is permanent. Anyways clan battle is so fun to play and who ever created it.. U r awesome. Keep up the good work Supercell. Love you so much and ur games.😙😙😙❤❤❤❤😀😁😁😊😊😊' ,

      'The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen',
       'RSYFJH Great game very addictive, and I don\'t know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats\'s kind of ridiculous. That\'s the only bad thing I have to say about this game.',
       'BEST GAME EVER! It\'s my biggest game but even though I have an old phone the game still runs really smoothly. There\'s always something to do, it never gets boring. I\'ve been playing for 8 months. Super easy to use and learn. It\'s addictive. You also don\'t feel pressured to make purchases like other games.',
       'I love this game. Amazing sound effects, graphics. You guys did a great job that\'s for sure! But still couldn\'t give it a five star because of the lastest update. The entire screen goes black after playing the game for 5-6 minutes. That\'s pretty irritating not to mention how much slower the phone gets as well. Didn\'t have these issues with the last update. Fix it please!',
       'This game is very nice and the best game I have ever played. If you have a chance to download this game dont let this chance to pass by. I prefer you to download this game. In this game you have a small place to decorate but there is more place which you have to buy. There is a guide in this game called Ernie who has the most beautiful town ever. You can visit his town any time you like and also make friends with anyone else. Me and my all sisters ( I dont have a brother )play this all day long and have much fun. This is the best game ever.',
       'This game is sooooo addictive,  it\'s like 4get cooking,  cleaning once you start it\'s hard to stop lol.  Lots of fun races,  prizes,  co-ops to help each other & make friends and have a great time.  But be forwarned this game can cause you to lose track of time.  Oh I will play for couple hours & next thing you know it\'s 1 am lol.  Hmmm few more mins bam it\'s 4 am.' ,

       'Parts of this game are really confusing. I built all the materials to make a ship and they\'re not usable in any way. The quests are also really messed up and once you have nets collecting materials there\'s nothing left to do. Seems like most of the issues with this game would be simple to fix but the developers obviously aren\'t interested in making the game better, just in getting people to click ads. Shame because it could\'ve been a fun game.' ,

      'This is a great game but it has it\'s draw backs. Due to a glitch in the game I had some coins and trophies taken from me in a game that never loaded. The biggest issue with this game is there is no offline solo play. A solo or practice mode would be great to allow people to get a feel for the game and be able to make tweaks in certain scenarios when playing with others. Easily worth 5+ stars if some adjustments can be made. Very addictive, very fun and suspenseful, and a great time killer.',
       'Game seems fine as long as you DO NOT BUY ANYTHING!!. Game is so rigged and its about the most obvious Ive ever seen. Just before tourney time, you will not make a shot and you will be reduced to ZERO coins, balls and trophies. I have over 10,000 matches so I know the game and support very well. DO NOT BUY BALLS, COINS HEARTS OR ANYTHING ELSE FROM PLAYDEMIC.',
       'I think that you should win the balls all so instead of just trophies!! You pay so much money to qualify for a tournament and you got to pay a 10,000 dollar entry fee and then 1000 ever hole!! The game is coming to how much you can spend instead of how good you are you shouldn\'t be able to enter a rookie tournament if you have over a thousand trophies!! Maybe it shouldn\'t cost so much to be able to get into the tournament!!! Besides if you spend a lot of money the people who can\'t spend as much!! I enjoy this game a lot I play it all the time I believe that it should be cheaper to qualify for the tournament!! And when you lose your game that you should loose the ball your playing with!! I really appreciate your time in listening to my opinion!! Hopefully this might make it a little more fair to the people who can\'t spend the money they would like!! Sincerely a Huge fan of the game!!! Thanks Joseph',
       'Awesome game. The only thing I don\'t care for is, why am I playing people that have 80 trophies but have played 2,000 games? I mean I\'m working with starter clubs and they are playing me with so much better clubs.. I just don\'t think that\'s very fare. And is there any other way possible to receive extra gems and coins or get extra clubs higher-ranking clubs? Thank you for your time and thank you for coming out with this game it is awesome',
       'I haven\'t been able to use the app since I updated the app a few days ago. So apparently they haven\'t worked out all the bugs.... it will load all the way to 100%, then it goes to a 2nd download screen and it only makes it to 50 %  before it stops downloading. So it was great up until that point',
       'Fun and entertaining game for sure. I wish there was more variety of courses, but I enjoy the competition in this a lot. They update frequently, and have very helpful customer service. One small change I\'d make, on shootouts, if it could show your distance from the pin next to your name or vice versa. I\'d like to see different clubs available for purchase as well.' ,

       'Best color by number pixel art I have played. Beautiful art, reasonable controls (would be better if you could click and drag without pressing and holding first, but the only one that does that has such awful art that it doesn\'t matter), it\'s fun. Thanks for making this.',

My daughter has been using this app since 7th grade and now is a junior in high-school. She suggested that I try it because I am always stressed after work. I did. I love who ever created this game and a BIG THANKS FOR THIS GAME',
       'I love the gameplay, graphics and controls and this is just so relaxing to play! I love this compared to other sandbox games because of the controls are way better! Also when you take a pic and colour it in can you have a palette so you can colour it in different colours to the image that would be great if you could kinda edit photos by using different colours.',
       'Amazing! The only problem is that I might accidentally touch a number I already coloured and undo it. To fix this problem I suggest you make it so if you have completed a number it cannot be changed.',

      'At first, the game was good. But after time passed, there is a little gameplay between advertisements.  The game has been sold to advertisements where ads even come in between while you are playing. Very annoying.  Disappointed.   Uninstalling.',
       'Hi everyone!  I\'m really not a fan of this game, I mean it\'s ok I\'m not going to lie but is very boring. The graphics are ok but it is repetitive. I suppose it is quite addictive but I lost interest after a few goes. It wasn\'t my cup of tea so to speak. I hope this review was helpful and remember to give it a big thumbs up!!! Be sure to look out for my trade mark "Xxx" and I\'ll see you next time!! Bye! Xxx. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍',
       'Was super fun until you introduced balls achieved by watching ads and a luck based ball/challenge system. The devs got greedy and ruined this great time waster',
       'game is fun and simple but gets a bit \'samemy\'.  Maybe I have yet to progress to the surprises but just balls and hoops thus far.  Please guys add something unexpected to keep us playing',
       'I like this game. I purchased it because it deserves, also I want to remove ads. 3,50 € and ads are not removed completely. I\'m disappointed, expecially for the "restore purchase" button that not works. Despite this I think that as a game is fun but monotonous in the long run, defect of 90% of apps of this kind. I hope developers will add something with updates that are not other challenges that ofter go to luck (and waiting time should e removed also). Sometimes there are some bugs but irrilevant for gameplay. The development house has made other interesting apps too. Sorry for errors, is not my first language.',

      'Uninstalled and reinstalled app because the update made it to where the game was unplayable. Went to login, using Facebook credentials. It says it failed because I would not allow them access to my friends list. Something doesn\'t seem right about that. Never had a game NOT allow me to login, after denying access to my friends list. Sorry, would prefer you not send messages to all my friends with my name tagged on it.',
       'There is a bug in your game I went first of my league, supposingly I am entitled to 350 cash, but it wasn\'t there.  How could you make it so unfair for someone. Why bother having a prizes if not given to the right person.',
       'I am in love with this game.. But the only bad thing happened today and I\'m very disappointed. I won carnival cup so I should get the announced price which includes 2 VIP  cards also. I didn\'t get my prize and I\'m really very upset. I have a screenshot of winning cup also.. I hope miniclip will help me. I\'m expecting my prize from you. I really love this game.',
       'Great game however, there\'s this one very strange bug the comes up every so often. The bottom part of my screen doesn\'t work on the game so it\'s hard to swipe in game/ click on chests. I know it\'s not my devices fault because it works fine on everything else. Anybody else have same bug?',
       'Uncanny how the opponent in shooting race goes for the same target as me more often than not and is generally quicker. Seems similarly biased in free kick mode. It\'s almost as if you aren\'t allowed to progress unless you spend a load of money.',
       'Used to be able to control the speed of the kick. Now no mater how fast or low I swipe it\'s either super fast or super slow. And it seems to be at random. I swipe the exact same speed yet the first time it\'s 200km/h and the second time it\'s 50km/h. Getting frustrating as it used to work so well. Can\'t remember the last time it just went in the middle.' ,

      'Quite Addictive. Played nonstop 6/7 hours and unlocked 40%. what u just need is time behind it. There\'s a rule of Fibonaceae in mathematics and if u follow the rule in the game you will make it in the minimum time. But the amount making system is quite sick. U don\'t  need that critical numeric use of currency just keep it low in the gameplay. Otherwise the game is good.',
       'Gave 2 stars more than last time...  Now i have all the mines but i think that i will delete this game..... Too much frustrating because of the instability of the game.... The game always shut down either i\'m watching an ad or just upgrading my miners.... When it happens on an ad it\'s thw worst!!!! sometimesi have to redo the same boosting to 3-4 times until it works once... So instead of losing 30-45 sec of my life for a game a lose 3 minutes in all!!!!',
       'Was fun to play but I suddenly got the same issue alot of people are having. My game won\'t load past 42% on the boot up screen, was working fine last night, went to bed and hasn\'t worked since I woke up. Y\'all seriously need to figure out the problem since I have many people complain bout it',
       'I like this game a lot. There was a problem with one particular ad causing the game to have to be restarted, but they seem to have gotten rid of it.  Developer responded to my unhappiness.  Isn\'t that a good Developer? I think so.  Their game, Idle Factory Tycoon is really good also.',
       'Well although I like the game, I have to give such a low rating, due to the prices. I think the devs used the wrong currency. Otherwise it\'s hard to explain prices over 20€ for 1 chest or a boost for only a few hours. But that\'s the games we have to deal nowadays. Do nothing and pay a fortune for it.',
       'The in app purchases are a little overboard. I normally wouldn\'t pay for stuff in an app but for this game I would definitely not even consider it. Nothing should cost more than $50, but there are packages in this app costing $100... that\'s way too much and I really don\'t like it. The only thing I want to see in the game is the ability to upgrade things with a percent amount of money. (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and obviously max which already exists)' ,

      'Just good. This game is great. The controls are completely customizable so you can make it work the way you want it to. Graphics are on point, better than 2nd Gen consoles, lesser than 3rd gen. If this game came out in the age of the PS2 I would have bought it. Also, buy a box because this game couldn\'t have been cheap to make. This game should cost like $25.',
       'It was a great game. Until you guys updated it. It\'s now extremely laggy. It causes there\'s if my phone to lag. I personally don\'t like the newly revamped maps. Im really good at this game, but I\'m on a six game losing streak due to lag. Please fix . Thanks',
       'Great game honestly you guys are doing a great job but some things need to be fixed. 1. Way to much lag of all kinds. Needs to be fixed that should be your first priority.2.the update to the brewery map was awesome but not what we wanted.there are are lots of places that look like you can get to but can\'t. (ie the fire escape stairs and more). 3. Get rid of the SG557, it\'s over powered and it isn\'t fun when other people are using it so either balance it out or get rid of it completely.(M14 could be tweaked a little to). 4. Graphics are okay but could be much better. Other than that it\'s a great game that you should download if you want to play an for game on your phone. Thanks!',
       'VERY *ADDICTIVE*!!!! The only reason i would tell you not to get the game is because YOU WILL PLAY THIS GAME 24/7! 😂 GREAT GAME but 1 complaint, please could you make a seperate brewery which was the old one because myself and EVERYONE I ask like the original. Please take this into account and keep up the good work 😀',
       'So...I have Bug that i think its only on my phone that every so often my phone freeze for half-min. i would love if u guys could do some work on that if other are having the same problem like me...',
       'this was the best game before the update... but now its the worst evr game i hv played... lags a lot. Now i hate this game.. hope u get a new update resolving these probs.' ,

      'It\'s ok...not something I am going to keep. Good for like 5 min then the adds getting a bit much after every other at bat. I understand making revenue but a bit much after 1 or 2 hits. Plus I don\'t know if it was my device but the only sound I got from this game was the adds. No hit sounds or music or even hearing the sound of the ball hitting anything. Good concept, could have been designed and presented better.',
       'The game is decent but this game developer loads all of their games with like 4x the ads of any other game developer. They are money hungry. And one of the other games they made called "Dune!" When you pay for the ads to be removed it doesn\'t even remove them. That game has just as many ads as this one. It\'s quite sad. Also when you request a refund they don\'t reply and Google will decline your refund request.',
       'Way too many adds. The game its self looks rather fun. But after 5 minutes in the game, and spending 3  minutes of them watching ads it was time to delete. I have no issues in watching a couple of ads to help the developers, but this was way over the top. Other than the ad frequency though, looks like it could be fun.',
       'Fab little game, but can you speed up the ball after it hits the ground the first time? It can be so slow & tedious lol  Oh & people need to STOP complaining about the ads & just turn off their wifi/data ffs! Ads are needed to pay for the app that YOU GOT FOR FREE!',
       'This game is incredibly fun. Until you get hit with a million ads just to play the next round and cost nearly 4 bucks to get rid of them. Shouldn\'t have ads that go for longer then the actual gameplay, its borderline ridiculous.',
       'It\'s ok. The game is fun, but they didn\'t give it any substance. I\'m not a developer yet I see so many missed opportunities. Would be better if you could get powerups, say to make the ball really bouncy. Another thing is houses. I don\'t think you can break windows with the ball. That\'s disappointing. You should be able to and get some sort of bonus. Fun little idea, but lacks real substance. Also way too many ads christ' ,

       'I am really surprised. The amount of new mazes I\'ve never seen before just blows me away. Of course you can just play the classic version thats why I downloaded it but wow love this game. And you don\'t have to spend money unless you want to its very kick back. Adds of course but whats a dollar to you?',

       'Love the game, and it\'s great that it has gamepad support, but can you please add in a landscape mode? My Moto Gamepad mod doesn\'t support portrait mode.',
       'i love the game of pacman since i was four on 2012 but i couldnt find one on play store since 2013 but i saw this thx bandai and for gundam',
       'Great. Just like the arcade game, from the 80s!   One caveat: I purchased the \'No Ads Forever\' option, as an in-app purchase, but I was still getting ads, even after restarting the app.  I ended up contacting their customer service department, in order to effectively get the ads removed.  Also, you can use it with a gamepad, which really makes it that much more enjoyable.' ,

      'Great, addictive game! However, real fast, I was wondering how the free box worked. I always hope for something real good but ALWAYS end up with either raw materials or ONE coin. Now don\'t get me wrong, I LOVE getting free stuff, it just seems like the "spinner" purposefully chooses raw materials. Like, it\'s not random like it seems; it never chooses anything close to a weapon! In any case, I cannot play this game enough, very very fun!',
       'This was one of my favorite games... until like many others I lost all progress with the big patch about 6 weeks ago.   Numerous tickets have been submitted over those 6 weeks with zero response, except here on Google play to help them save face.  A lot of my time and money has been robbed.  Proceed with extreme caution.',
       'Honestly ive been waiting for close to 2 months. This game was like crack for me until the update left me no nice place, no hard earned stuff. I dont mind starting from the bottom again but at least give me some perks. This game is worth every cent and time. But until i get my account back or my stuff back im leaving 2 stars when really this game should be 5 stars all the time. I wont be playing this game til then. Thanks for the good times.',
       'The game doesn\'t load!!! 1.) There\'s nothing wrong with my internet connection! I don\'t have any problems playing RIFT, LOTRO, Neverwinter, Aura Kingdom, Allods Online, etc. or any of my other Google Play apps on my internet connection! 2.) Using Task Manager doesn\'t work! 3.) My device has way more than 200 MB of free space on it! 4.) I haven\'t been able to play for 14 days now!!! 5.) Jurassic Survival looks more promising since there are no loading problems!!!! >:(',
       '**UPDATE** Was an awesome game. Could use a few more perks (ie. Weapons and hard to get items) in drop boxes and yellow zones.Now the down side is if you die in a level your last position is no longer there to try and recoup some of your items. Players killing you as you open trunks in inventory screen. With that I think I am done with this game. Oh ya and the free spin box...give random prizes instead of coins and rope. People will get really into it if perks are awesome.',
       'I love the game. It\'s awesome. But I do have a few questions. Why are the bunker cards so extremely difficult to find? I\'ve been looking for days killing every zombie possible and looking through every crate without finding the cards. Also. Why isn\'t there a disclaimer that says if you die in the game, everything you purchased will be lost? I think that would be extremely necessary so no one over spends their money. Other than that, absolutely smooth running, fantastic graphics, and realistic deaths. I love every aspect except I can\'t find these darn bunker key cards.' ,

I hope my tears will help u guys. :)',
       'Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it\'s just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............',
       'Its a very good game without any tension of wining any difficult task...I like it very much and its not much addicting I have played many games but its very different. controls are also good but this game needs some practice . I am enjoying this game because the tasks are not very difficult but at the same time not very easy its a perfect game and the main character of the game is very funny he always sleeps in the vehicle.....so finally.... I like this game very much',
       'Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!',
       'Plez put some changes in upgrading options..... Like..when we upgrade our vehicles...... Vehicles should look different...and..some added things like....nitros.,new wheels and etc.... By this changes this game will be liked and can be played by more and more people',
       'At first I wasn\'t sure how good the game was but after playing it several times on Android and Windows 8.1 phone, I like it.  It doesn\'t weigh down on the phone\'s processing power. A very addictive game!! Give it go.' ,

      'I think there should be option of chatting with guild members and other players not voice chatting but message ones.  There should be some research option in every guild or either there should be some Commander talent points by which we can increase some of the tactics of team & player.  Main Idea :  I think there should be some event in which 2 guilds can fight with each other & there should be option of ally & others.  I know it\'s kinda different game but it will make fun to game.   Overall this game is best and addictive,  Thanks for making this game.  Great effort by dev team.  Love you.',
       'Hi,there my players name is cammanderDJR and I won death match like 3 times even though my level is 9 and I have no experience in survival games but this is like the best game I\'ve ever played. I still have a few idea\'s on how to make it better and that\'s the graphics please improve it. Love the game way better than Rules of Survival.',
       'The game itself is awesome, the gameplay is awesome. However I\'d suggest to make the following changes to make the game better. First I\'d add an event each week which would allow players to play different matches like training with bots or zombie apocalypse and many more. I know his might be hard but I\'m also recording free fire  for my YouTube channel ( Natan Prokop ) and trying hard with it. So it would be nice if you also added ladders and so you could climb to like buildings and towers. I\'d  also add revolvers, at least one type. Please sub to my channel and if you could add the things above that\'d be great',
       'This game is good fun but pls can u stop peoee from running u over as when 8 get in top 3 some keeps running me over. It\'s still and amazing games but when people run u over its boring and wish u could stop people from doing this   is th8nkthere u should maybe be able to drive places but when u want to fight they have to get out and shoot and have a proper gun fight . Overall this is a great game my favourite mobile game and it\'s really enjoyable. But pls can u make people not being able to do this. Thankyou',
       'I\'ve been facing a new issue. I always used to get a ping of around 140 - 180 ms with my Jio until day before yesterday. But, since then, I\'m always getting a ping of 300+ ms. This is really annoying. Close combats are pretty impossible. I\'ve checked everything. My network is fine. I get a better ping in other online games which I play. My friends have been facing this issue as well. So, it has become harder to play squad and duo matches as well. Please do something about this Garena. I would definitely drop a 5 star then.',
       'This game is so good! I love it but could you add some binding account so account will not be loss. Im in a high level almost level 37 and I accidentally delete the app then when I download the game again I cant play my old account! That\'s horrible try to fix it admin or whoever. And last thing try to put some servers country by country so we could play against other countries. Try to do this admin. I assure you that after you made this comments or suggestions this game will be the best ever!' ,

      'It\'s a really fun game, but sometimes you\'ll play a video to revive your shark and the video will play but you don\'t get another life afterwards. It\'s hard to believe that it is a WiFi problem because if it was an ad wouldn\'t be able to load at all. Also, I have paused the game before and come back minutes later and the game had kicked me out and not saved any coins/gems gained from that round. They clearly have a few bugs to work out.',
       'IT IS SO GOOD, YOU HAVE TO BUY IT!Every level you get a new shark,though,you have to pay for them.But the good thing is you still have your old shark! You will be challenged throughout the levels! AND WHATEVER YOU DO,DO NOT SPEND YOUR JEMS!!!! You barely can get any jems,besides the five you get for downloading it.Anyway all I want to say is have fun be cool and be one with the shark! Bye,rsvp!',
       'OMG! I love the gameplay in this arcade game I love everything about it. It is very cool that you can evolve sharks that can eat more stuff. Keep the updates coming it would be better if you added more sharks in this game . I recommend downloading this game if you want something to do in a long amount of time. This is so addictive I can\'t stop playing it!',
       'My apologies for the negative review lately. But to be honest, I have to use VPN just to log-in in Google Play and enable cloud sync or else, I wouldn\'t be able to sync my progress. Just a little request, can you make the gameplay smoother for lower end devices, such as devices with 1GB RAM? It lags frequently during gameplay. Thanks a lot!',
       'Amazing game. I completed this game in 48 minutes Hahaha! Because I used luckypatcher :) I downloaded the luckypatcher in Googlechrome But it can harm your Device..... And the last shark is Moby dick His baby is as big as Megalodon.',
       'The is the most intense game ever.When you think you\'ve got it ,it\'s gone. Can\'t figure out how to boost. Controls aren\'t the best.Rhis game could improve. Oth er than that it\'s fine I guess.Too many pop up ads. Really frustrating. I want to play the game not look at ads. Sometimes  you can\'t back out of the ad.' ,

      'I can\'t say I love it,maybe I can. But any way, this would have to be in one of top hundred games😀. There are a few things I would like added though. Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed this😀😁😀😁😀😁.',
       'I think you guys have messed up your game in the past few updates. Seems like there is some memory leak or something. After a while the steering wheel lags so much. Only the input. Graphics don\'t lag at all. Please fix. Also would be great if you could add some button to start and stop a timer in free mode so we can set time challenges for ourselves. I like the game but it is unplayable after a few minutes after the recent updates',
       'This has to be like, my 5th or 6th reinstallment of this game since there\'s no ingame reset, but darn well worth the data(little bytes). I usually like more realistic car games, but even the "extreme" warp in physics in the gameplay doesn\'t distract from the fun. These are the cars you\'d want if you\'re trying to beat the traffic, run from the cops, or solve a parking dillemma. Great fun time killer! One thing though, the other reviewers are correct in their complaints about how often and when ads pop up. That shouldn\'t happen smack dab in the middle of a maneuver.',
       'What you should improve is that YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ADD\'s I MEAN SERIOUSLY I WATCH MORE ADDS THAN THE GAMEPLAY. I ONLY PLAY FOR A LITTLE THEN MOST OF ADDS SHOW UP. I WQ5CH ADDS THAN PLAY8NG THE GAME FOR CRYING OT LOUD!!',
       'This game was just really really good! But please please make the exact same game but instead, if you do something illegal like crash into another car, the cops start chasing you. If you do do this I will comment on every single game that comes up on the adds. But, there is a tiny bit to much adds. Anyways, AMAZING fame!!!😊',
       'The cars are totally good and pls add some more. The traffic is really bad. Because they are inconsiderate and doesn\'t care about other cars. How come some of your games has the traffic considerate, Axesinmotion?🤔🤔 In other words, I hope u will do the things above that is mentioned.' ,

      'Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I\'m 20 just..😉😉 I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I\'m in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️',
       'Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn\'t respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I\'m willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.',
       'Definitely a fun short game. No real incentives to keep on playing though. The eye candy is not good enough and the music is repetitive.  Needs something more than the simple leveling system and the music either needs to be in beat with the obstacles or have more variety.',
       'Fun little time killer. My only problem is that daily rewards fail to show up most days. It could be a problem on my end, but I don\'t know, and it\'s a pretty small issue so I don\'t really care.',
       'I\'ve noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don\'t think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying.',
       'This is the most addictive game i have ever played. I always play it when am bored and you can play it when your offline. Totally recommend it but pls answer this question..what is the world highest score?' ,

      'It\'s a pretty amazing game, like league of legends but what makes it amazing is that you can play it on your phone. The only problem is the prices of the heroes and skins. Most of the heroes are 32k battle points.. So it would be fair if it was at least 5k cheaper than that. Also the game lags sometimes which interups gameplay which can cause you to unexpectedly die.  For anyone who is reading this, I highly recommend this game to anyone.  It\'s amazing and extremely addictive!!',
       'I think this game is great! I play It Almost Everyday And My Mum Always Has To Scold Me For Playing Too Much! Its Addictive And Fun To Play! Just A Few Things You Guys Could Work On. 1)I Hope That You Guys Will Let Us BE ABLE To Sell Hereos And I Bet Others Agree. 2)I Also Hope You Guys MAKE IT EASIER For Us To Get BP\'S I Really Really Hope You Guys Get To Fulfill My Request! Its a good game!',
       'Not enough with unskippable tutorials now you want us to level up till lvl 8 to be able to change account? Here\'s some suggestion, make a button just before the tutorial, for login purposes for those who have old accounts. I mean, people sometimes reset their phone and you want us to play till level 8 again just so we can play old account? Be realistic developers.',
       'Quite simply a super fun game. This game does exactly what it is supposed to, which is provide a fun portable moba experience condensed into short bursts of fun. This is one of the few games where even losing is a fun experience for me. Pros - wide range of heroes, fun over the top cartoon graphics, multiple game modes, great community and incredible speed of matchmaking that still some how retains quality of matchups. Cons - I am personally not a fan of the joystick based control system, the heroes require quite a bit of time playing before you can get enough in game currency to unlock them. So if you haven\'t already started playing this game then you are definitely missing out',
       'Being Honest this game hasnt really been up to date with others competitors. One thing I think would be lovely is a training camp/single player bot practices to do with new heros. Maybe a small revamp to the art style like 5% realism. And to decrease the amount of gold heros cost, really turns down the tone to play more for new heros',
       'Edit from my earlier review.  I re-downloaded this game after giving yall some time to work through some issues Id been having.  Lo and behold... All of my progress is gone. I was a high level with numerous heroes and skins I cant get anymore. Yet when I relog in from my google account and my FB account, it still has me at this new level with none of my stuff. What the heck yall.' ,

      'Whenever you die in the game you start completely over again. And after each game an advertisement plays. Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It\'s a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It\'s very competitive!!! I swear my husband can\'t beat my score no one has lol',
       'It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone\'s or tablets I find it hard to control I don\'t know if anyone else thinks so but that\'s my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company',
       'It\'s good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it\'s my opinion so don\'t get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don\'t have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn\'t play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀',
       'Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface',
       'Worst game played ever . Too irritating , so many adds . Very disappointed . I was just seeing the ratings and I thought it will be good but after that I got very much angry. PLEASE NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. Slither.io is much better game than this one. Worst game controls',
       'Addictive When my internet is streaming I can\'t play as the lag is too bad. The adverts are a little irritating but out of peak times are few and far between. Other than that I freaking love this game : )' ,

      'It\'s nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it\'s not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It\'s just not fair.',

Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs',
       'Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.',
       'Fantastic game. Real addiction game I\'d say. It\'s an awesome time killer. Different types of levels never make the game boring. Graphics is okay. Number of ads for a free to play game is less compared to other games out in the market which is a relief.Overall I would give 4.5/5',

      'This game is AMAZING I think its  suitable for any age because its entertaining and it doesn\'t have a lot of adds which is really cool since this game is free. It also has a variation of different puzzles to keep u entertained. I think that if u r reading this right now then DOWNLOAD IT NOW.',
       'I abseloutly love this game. The controls are amazing the games are great and it is so stress relieving and I would play this in every second of my spare time. I would totally reccomend this for kids and adults!!! Go and get this free app that I am addicted to 😀😍',
       'This is a nice hodgepodge of puzzle games. They have a great selection, and I like the mental workout that I get when I play. If you\'re on the fence, download it, and at least try it out because it really is a great app. It can get quite challenging though, so be aware of that, and don\'t give up!  Update: I took away one star because I was concentrating hard on a puzzle, and an ad popped up which totally ruined my concentration. I actually stopped playing the app because I was so pissed.',
       'I\'ve only had this game for a day, but I\'ve been addicted! I\'ve played for hours and hours and it\'s a real brain twister. I\'ve done several puzzles after those hours and i found out in growing faster! This really Helps my puzzle solving skills. Thanks!',
       'This is actually quite addictive & enjoyable. Definitely distracts you & helps kill time or zone out when your brain is too busy. My daughters, (16 yrs & 5 yrs) along w my son (12 yrs) play w me, and we try to race each other thru the levels. I would give this wee game 5 stars if it weren\'t for the amount of ads & the length of time the ads play. If the ads were adjusted a wee bit it would be easier to do the side by side races. Hope y\'all 👍 it.',
       'It\'s an amazing app with great puzzles. Though there\'s so many ads and recently the app started crashing every time I try open the app and try to do a puzzle. I hope this problem is fixable without having to reinstall and start over.' ,

      'Awesome game!  Earning money is easy especially with online play and watching ads.  ONLY downfall is earning gold can be a pain,  seem like the only way to get gold is by beating a boss, buying gold with real cash and levelling up which can take some time.  Other then that it\'s a very addictive game if you love BMX that is.  Folloq me on instagram @evans_customz',
       'Very good game but I wish there was a better way of getting gold without having to pay out of your hard working money. Since when did games start asking for cash? I would pay to buy the game but buying gold is stupid as hell.. either way very good game',
       'Great game that I would really enjoy putting some time in but it constantly starts to shutter and the frame rate slow way down and makes it impossible to hit your marks. I had a subscription but decided to cancel it because the game is unplayable. Please fix and Its a 5 star game and worth the subscription. (Galaxy Note8)',
       'Cool little game with very few ads. The only downside is you have to buy gold to upgrade your bicycles so if you don\'t pay to win that\'s just a great time killer.',
       'Good game and concept overall. The problem is it gets to a point you are forced to buy gold to upgrade your bike. You can earn all the cash you want but cannot use it to exchange for gold. For the simple fact I have to pay out of pocket to advance at all in the game I give it 2 stars.',
       'I really do enjoy this game as an ex bmxer it\'s really exciting to play I wish there was more of a practice mode so you can get more accustomed to tracks before you race against players that are better than you otherwise and all-around good game still figuring out everything' ,

      'This is my favorite game. Absolutely love playing it whenever I can. However, why did the the flower growing from beating levels suddenly switch from starting on Friday, so we can enjoy it over the weekend to starting during the beginning of the week. Did not get to use my 6 hours of unlimited lives like I have been since this started. I would very much like if it could be switched back to the original timeline. Enjoy unlimited lives and contests over the weekend when it\'s more likely more users will have the time.',
       'I think that we should get more  coins for winning the levels. I find that the game can cost me money that I don\'t have, so I will spend less time playing your game. I love this game alot but why play if you are not getting enjoyment because it costs to much to play. (Otherwise I love the game) I also never got my horse, please give me my horse, I really need that horse btw. I already had a name for her to. I was going to call her daisy. The name goes great with the garden theme. (If you hadnt realized thst already) Please please send me daisy, I love her already. Peace.',
       'Playrix games are all generally the same.. They\'re good. But well designed to ensure and encourage the use of real money to play. Think of old arcade machine style of game mechanics and you\'ve got a general idea of what you can expect from any of their titles.  The only thing truely different is how quickly each game decides it wants to dig for your wallet.  Disappointing.',
       'It was a lot of fun the first few "days" but got very hard very fast. Don\'t bother with power-ups as it doesn\'t really make a difference. The only way to win is to get lucky with a big bomb. That\'s it. It\'s a shame because the game is nice, I just progress way too slowly now for it to be worth playing.',
       'I enjoy playing this game but I think 900 coins is crazy for 5 extra lives. There are other games I play that offer less coins and a boost for a smaller price. On one game I play it\'s 65 coins for 10 extra moves and a boost, on a different one it\'s 25 coins for 5 extra moves. I also think that stars for each level should vary too. For harder levels it should be 3 stars, for medium levels it should be 2 stars, and for easy levels 1 star. I\'ll continue to play no matter what, it\'s fun, challenging and strategical!',
       'The first thing that comes to mind is that you guys have gone above and beyond on this one!! It\'s so much fun!! From the interactions of restoring the grounds, to decorating them (custom, might I add !!)    To the actual sounds the game makes while playing.. I can\'t stay off of it. And yes I\'m constantly tempted to purchase coins when I can\'t beat a level, for like the 7th time!!  Haha 😂 Great game guys!! We would ALL appreciate more gifts than currently available. Especially for your daily addicts, 😁 Forever a gamer.     Xx' ,

      'The heroes should be for all players from the lower level. They can make their own choice to choose the hero or switch them. If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy? It\'s the strategy game, not for only the big or strong players. Thanks!!...',
       'Coc is on the first place in my games list. It is very addictive and enjoyable. I am looking forward till the day town hall 12 comes. I am not much happy with SUPERCELL ID thing. Because it is not much easy to use. I recommend using the normal GOOGLE PLAY sign in method because it is much more appropriate for me. Overall COC have become my life. I also recoomend to have a time limit for coc, like coc automatically switch off if the user plays coc more than 1 hour. Long Live COC!',
       'Awesome strategic game, love it. But I have one request to Clash of clans creators that pls update clan castle of coc village that there would be an option that how much treasury do you want to Transfer to your storage. I think all coc players would be love this option and it would be great idea because you can transfer required amount of treasury to your storage and the rest of it will remains safe in clan Castel. If you like this idea and will work on it then pls reply me. I would be thankful to all Coc creators if that happens.. 😊',
       'NICE GAME, NICE GRAPHICS,NICE GAMEPLAY.. Been Playing Since 2015 and I See A Lot Of Changes..  I Wish new content would Be Added More Frequently and I HOPE The Village must Have Village Houses! Cause A Village Is Not A Village Wihout Houses SUPERCELL. There should be houses that has different colors and traits, some which raises stats of barbs and valks, or reduces time to produce troops and spells like in Builder Base,there should be houses which raises defense or offense and houses which reduces building production. This May Give Clash Of Clans A New Spark and Would Be More Strategic than usual. Thanks For Reading Devs Godbless.',
       'it\'s a good game and challenging. Strategy is needed on going through battles, Arranging your defenses is very tough to manage lol..... You want to keep away the enemies from your lawn though........ and I love the "Builder hall" when I\'m done on my "Town hall" I manage the second camp.... although the loot in Builder hall is limited it\'s fun and addictive a real time killer........ keep up the good work developers........ have a good day.... ^_¤',

       'I am a 76 O.A.P. & have paid £1.79 for ADS FREE, but I am still having to sit through 30 second ads. This is unlawful advertising, I have sent the Play Store an email explaining the situation with the so called ADS FREE. A neighbour of mine has also paid £1.79 but still having to watch 30 second videos, she is 75years. I have looked through the reviews & I have found numerous other people who are complaining about paying money for nothing. A few have even mentioned the word ripoff. How right they are. Still waiting to see if the Play Store replies to my email, for I sent 3 emails to the developers without reply. If they are not going to remove the ads then they should return our money, someone somewhere needs to do something about this wrong doing.',

      'I just bought the level 4 crates. Some were delivered, then it reverted to level 3. I have a screen shot showing that I already had level 4. I cannot find a bug report feature in this game. Please fix this in my account. Otherwise, I love the game. Remember to buy something to fix the ads.  Edit: I sent customer support an email with a screen shot a month ago. There has been no response.',
       'Stay away unless you plan on paying money.  The devs force ads in almost everything you do, and I\'m pretty sure they aren\'t vetted as one of them seemed to take control of my screen. Great potential way to serve up malware to your customers.',
       'I like merging games, but this one has a huge ad issue that makes the game somewhat frustraiting to play. I\'ll click the store to buy a house and it will auto start an ad video. It\'s lacking a bit in the story line department too. For a base merging game it\'s simple and fun, but definitely needs some work.',
       'Ever wanted to be Mayor? Ever wanted to run a town, develop the land, and see a metropolis grow? Well, look no further than Animal Crossing cuz this game does none of those things. You just merge buildings into better buildings. It is fun, if you spend money so that you\'re not bombarded with ads. But then you run the risk of being unable to watch ads when you want to to do things like double your earnings or unlock a better building from the mystery box.',
       'When opening the game it loads fine Nd does its idle thing, but I can\'t tap on anything. Completely 100%unrespomsive. After multiple attempts. Will change rating if game becomes playable before I forget about this review.',

       'It was good but then this happened. I was playing just like any other day. My phone had died while I was playing, so I charged it and left it untouched for about an hour or two. When I signed in, all off my progress was erased! Please respond and tell me what happened.',
       'The game was great than EA got to it with there sticky fingers and put adds everywhere, it isn\'t the same game I enjoyed ages ago. It\'s just another add infested game now, even if you do pay for it l. The charm is gone',
       'Irritating. At first it gives you an option of playing a video to receive additional help. Which works only for the first time. Next time onwards no way to cancel the video in case you don\'t want to install it. It is so frustrating. Either allows to cancel or tell the users what to do next. Worst way of promoting other apps.',
       'Why ask people to pay to have ads removed and still have so many features that you need to watch ads for? It just seems like a rip off to me very disappointed in this purchase',
       'I had to update it so I did and when I wanted to play after that, it says "watch video to get extra seed slot" WHICH I ALREADY PAID FOR WITH THE COINS I COLLECTED ALL THESE TIMES. Even before the update, it has so many ads but this is much worse. Definitely not happy with the update.' ,

      'I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.',
       'This game has potential to be fun but it\'s completely ruined because IT\'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don\'t get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it\'s full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it\'s a complete money bucket!',
       'This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.',
       'The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it\'s free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15',
       'I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my "family"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we\'re like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I\'m from Michigan,we\'re both married ,but there\'s nothing I wouldn\'t do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!! Lifelong friends/family!!! 💜',
       'This game is great and will make you feel tho go all out. It challenges you in a healthy way and keeps you on your toes. Join a guild, trust me. You can do a lot by yourself but joining a guild in this game is actually fun. I haven\'t experienced anything toxic, yet. I\'ve been playing for about a week and it\'s really great' ,

      'Nice game. I like the concept of rebuilding but this game was meant to kill time, I hope so. Keep adding characters and what we require is a hell lot of mini games so that they may keep coming and coming and coming. I do not intend to harass you but try to add more and more mini games after each update. I\'m sure that in the course of  time you may be able to compete with the best games ever created but do not make the game larger than DWTD 2. Add more new locations too otherwise we will not be able to consume the tokens. The game is nice because you do not have to consume money for characters and get them through gifts instead. It is also nice because tokens can be collected easily. Please think about my opinions. I❤ this game.',
       'The character models are cute and all, but the games are getting a bit repetitive. WAY too many ads. Like, ridiculously too many. The app forces a couple right after you finish some of the minigames. You have enough to offer us - forcing even more ads on top of that is tiresome. Get rid of them.',
       'Best game of all time I mean you have to try this or else your life could be boring and lonely the 1st and 2nd are also really good check em out and you can\'t live with out this game. My point is best game ever',
       'Dumb ways to die 3 gets 3 stars. No, seriously, I loved the first 2, but this one is not good. Only 4 minigames, not really different each from another. Remember FASTER FASTER FASTER ? It disappeared (I miss it), and is now ADS ADS ADS. The goal here is just to use money and play as often as you can for ADS ADS ADS. The main thing here ? Minigames ? Nooooo, just getting (or buying) tokens and use them to repair houses (no impact on gameplay). Why would this game be nice ? The graphics are still good. Yes, that\'s all. Have a nice day. ADS ADS ADS',
       'It has only 4 mini games, compared to the previous version, not the best',
       'Best Game Ever And After just adding Dippy and Pillock I finished all the characters even though before I got the update I finished collecting all characters by getting Dunce then I went to play it through app stores and update it And now I have All the characters again I love your really wonderful  games and they started off as an advert about being safe around trains my favourite song the games are my favourite games ever as well Thanks so much for brightening my day Metro.' ,

       'I think it worst because in level 1 last object is not free and in part 6 also this is happened with me plz help me and i like your game but this is the only problem',
       'Really like this game I give it only three stars or two just because on the 6th or 7th or 5th it gets really hard because I think on this six you have to play a game and the arrows weren\'t showing up and then I think on the 7th it gets harder because they\'re the sky and it\'s a circle and Eric trying to get to Mia but he can\'t do that dress because the guys keep on knocking into the guy Eric keeps on knocking into the guy but that\'s not his fault because the guy keeps on coming for him which that\'s not what it was supposed to be it said is going to just guard me if I don\'t give it a zero from 1 to 10 5 from 1 to 10 because 5% of that I hate it by a person of it I like it I don\'t even love it I don\'t even want to say love in this one because it\'s not that good of a game so I want to play it and if you\'re wondering why I rate this game is because I\'m on the like 6 or 7th and it\'s really hard so I would I wouldn\'t play this game if you want a hard game that will that is just making that guy win you\'ll keep on having to do it and do it and do it and do it and do it and do it and do it but you\'ll never win because the guy always wins he has a hoodie on and on his shirt if I were to if I were to do this on a mermaid secret seven.',
       'Annoying ads. Can\'t get past the car level. Boring after level 2. Sensitive.',

      'Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn\'t really feel like you\'re getting anywhere.',
       'Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it\'s only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that\'s bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it\'s a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I\'ll rate 5 star$',
       'Money trap. They don\'t even offer the option to watch videos to recharge the fuel to be able to play. So unless you spend money on this game you\'ll be stuck and having to wait hours to be able to play again. Such a shame given the game is so much fun. I was really enjoying it until i ran out of fuel and had to either wait or spend diamonds, which are hard to come by if you don\'t buy them. Very disappointing.',
       'Should be able to start of where you get destroyed.  Not start of the beginning of the level. Also I agree with some of the reviews. There are times where there are too many rockets and roadblocks. Need to cut back a bit. Also. With all the fire power. I can\'t destroy a rocket or roadblock?',

      'Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don\'t ever plan to, but here you also don\'t really need to. I\'ve won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you\'re not forced to watch them. It\'s not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.',
       'Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I\'ll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily "less than 20 coins" reward. Sooooooo cheap!',
       'It\'s just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that\'s a good question.',
       'Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don\'t terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.',
       'Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don\'t even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.',
       'Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn\'t be putting people in the "club" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this "club" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they\'re INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game' ,

      'I am not getting shields...  Whats the problem..  Either it gave me just 1 shield in 50spins or no shield in 50spins...  I am stucked on 1farm i have completed many times the same constructions but as i dont have shields neithr i get them people come and attack on my field again and again. Please fix!!',
       'I love this game. But please increase the numbers of spins every hour. And I also have come across one more problem- I get notifications saying that I have won spins and coins but when I open the app there is nothing or no way to collect my reward. I don\'t know what to do?',
       'Game requires you purchase junk to proceed. There comes a point where the casual gameplay is passed by the amount required to progress further; either watching hundreds of adds to collect enough coins to move on, or simply emptying your wallet. Good for a few levels, that is it.',
       'how awful. need to buy building upgrades. building upgrades do nothing. buildings do nothing. literally do nothing. how do you get money? spin a slot machine. Thats the only way. There is no actual game here. And what happens when you run out of spins and realize you still need millions more money to upgrade worthless buildings? give them real money. this game is so lazy it might as well be classified as a scam.',
       'In a sea of idle and casual games, it\'s easy to find mechanics that are fun and engaging. That makes the utter failure of this game to be even slightly enjoyable while still asking for money minutes after installation somewhat impressive. It takes real effort to make something so terrible, but this company wasted no effort in creating something with no redeeming value whatsoever.',
       'Love the game but it restarts every time I try and watch a video for spins/coins. Also restarts when I try and invite friends to play , and trying to gift send or accept. Might have to delete and find a new game' ,

       'I like playing this game although i find that male characters do not have many long hair/ girl hair options available to buy unless you are vip or have diamonds. I think i speak for many people when i say that boys and girls should have more hair options from the opposite sex, for starcoins, as some people may take offense if they are strictly only allowed "boys hair"/ "girls hair" unlsss they are paying for it. I think you could inmprove further by making it easier to earn starcoins and another way to earn diamonds because many people do not want to/ cannot afford to BUY items in a fictional world.. Overall, i think this is a well rounded game, with a few improvement points, however i enjoy being able to have my own unique style in a virtual world :)',

       'Its a fun game however there are hackers,scammers ,glitches and its really annoying when the game freezes. Also when people post art books they can be really inappropriate. I think you should be at least  13 to play this game because of the inappropriate art books. I think the new update is great but I would like it if we would make n buy wish list on tablet and  on phone. Its a fun game but you reply need to think about who you can trust because many people just ply with your feelings.',

      'Yes this is addictive, yes it\'s fun, and it\'s great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don\'t have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it\'s not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it\'s clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.',
       'Way way WAYYY too laggy. It\'s an easy casual game though. I wouldn\'t say it\'s "fun" but it does pass the time and make you want to achieve the little goals. Only goal, make more money in game. That\'s it and you achieve that by not even playing the game so there\'s no challenge whatsoever. Uninstalled after first day reaching about 500 Trillion and force closing 100 times.',
       'I really liked the game but I hate the pay to win more stuff and all the ads and incentives to go download and play other games. I know that\'s what mobile games have become but I want to just enjoy a simple clicker game in peace without a thousand tie ins and adds ruining my sense of immersion. Oh vanilla cookie clicker how I miss you. The game itself is great.

      'A really fun, simple game! Allows you to build up your roster of heroes or compete in PvP matches. Also has a global chat and the ability to form alliances for access to more powerful characters and items.',
       'Fun game that\'s easy to learn. Only issue is that while you CAN get everything for free in the game, it is nearly impossible to have a full legendary team without buying gems.',
       'You are held hostage by ridiculously long wait times, impossibly rare items, every update is worse and only those that spend a fortune in micro transactions to gamble for characters can ever expect to have a decent account.',
       'Great game but some needed progression items are extremely difficult to locate and some battles are obviously rigged for spending to continue to play.',
       'And for those who\'d like to understand more of this type of game, why couldn\'t things be explained a bit more? You never know unless you\'re in an alliance. And can\'t do that until you\'ve reached a certain XP level. AND in tutorial mode. It\'s just brief and limited on a small scale. Also, while gaining more heroes, sometimes they\'re cloned heroes, and so you\'re stuck with them. No variety, or way to at least either trade them, or anything. I\'ve never gotten any hero past 2 * except one. And I\'m afraid I\'m not going to spend outrageous amount of $ just to Hope by chance, I get a better strength HERO etc. . If things are changed up a bit, maybe I\'ll go up in star ratings. I do love the people who are and have been real helpful. An Alliance with great helpful and strong support, those who help you progress is the best part of this game. The kind of hero\'s I\'ve been getting in summon gate are too pathetic to even bother with a token! Do not like being forced to pay for things like this, which ends up removing any possible hope for having fun because it then becomes an investment with not many perks. Smh.',

      'lnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'First, I don\'t like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don\'t like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you\'re just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!',
       'I like everything about this game no questions asked but i do find a few things annoying the main one is selling items in you inventory 1 at a time i wish there was a sell all for an item that would make this less annoying  to sell after house building and such. Please add a sell all oh and when do you think you can make more quests i really like doing them.',
       'For the fact that we can\'t sell multiple items at once is a big downer. I have accumulated so many windows, computers, chairs etc with watching the daily news ads and it\'s a complete pain to delete 30, 50, 70 or even more! items one by one. Please consider adding this function in the app as it\'s in the real The Sims games.',
       'Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools "playable",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it\'d be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.',
       'Love it addictive,if u like the sims on the pc you will like this.If you are a patient person you don\'t need to spend money either. Update it has lost stars as I don\'t want to spend money and now you need vip to get to the next stages of things. Disappointed with this. If you didn\'t have to pay for anything it would be 5 stars.' ,

      'Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?',
       'I hate this game it makes me so stressed and the AI is rigged also the David and Goliath mission i try to win they win 5 out of 5 of the first 5 matches and I\'m afk they win 4 out of the first 5 matches this is f@#$ing stupid P.S impossible to get new cars the machines just gobble up your coins like the game where you try to grab a plush toy but it always fails because it\'s rigged',
       'Ok. I admit this game is pretty fun. But the missions, especially the hardcore ones, are ridiculously hard. So if you want a challenge, I recommend this game. But if you rage over really dumb things like me, then I definitely do not recommend it.',
       'It WAS good, I spent 5 dollars and   so many hours on this game. In the new update what do I see? IT\'S ALL GONE every vehicle, head, and map, GONE! Was an amazing game after this I\'m done for a long time.',

      'I like this game but there\'s so much cheating going on. It doesn\'t resister some of the moves you make or it\'s lagging and when you smash the minions they should fly away and not stick to the screen for ten seconds so you can\'t see what\'s coming next. Just stop cheating! Don\'t take 20hours to give the necessary tools when doing a double task in the jelly lab.',
       'I have a Xiaomi Redmi 4 mobile with 3 GB RAM, 1.4 GHz Octa Core. Still Game hangs, Speed enhanced with a jerk every time and then it dies. I have reset my mobile and reinstalled it but the problem still there. It\'s very annoying. Otherwise I love this game. It\'s very addictive.',
       'The game used to be fun, but not anymore.  More than that, after i did a factory reset on my phone, I\'ve reinstalled the game, but surprise... I couldn\'t sync the game to my Google account. All my progress in game was lost. All the money invested in this game was lost. I have sent them emails, tickets about it but no answer what so ever. The result is ---&gt; uninstall',
       'This game is awesome and funny I guess. I\'m trying to think of something to complain about (I love complaining) but I can\'t!! Oh wait........... You could make things like characters and stuff less expensive. It\'s  Ike....I go on SHOP and it says stuff like (random minion) 1234 tokens!!  Dats 2many bro!',
       'I realy like the game. I like the graphics too and what i mostly like is that is a running game but with minions. But my only complain is the lag. That is what i think of the game',

      'Game is getting better with being fair. Free to play people can actually roll decent heroes after a while with persistence. IGG is still unbelievably money hungry for their newest released things - but I guess it\'s better to wait for everything or pay for it upfront. I chose option 1. Thank you IGG for making rolling a little more fair.',
       'nice game for the others saying that this is a copy of coc it has a lot of difference this game is more easy to play than coc. coc is a hard game more time o upgrade more time on things in this in only 5 m its fast becouse it is free and you already have a hero if you start the game in coc you ned to be th lvl 7 to get it or 8 idk but dont say that coc an cc is the same becouse your wrong of saying that they are the same (^_^)',
       'What stands out the most from other games of this type for me is that you get heroes and that you don\'t lose fighters in battle unless they die whereas in other games like clash of clans you lose all you fight with regardless. Plus it\'s just an incredibly addictive game that you can do well with even if you don\'t spend any money.',
       'I\'ve been playing for almost 4 years and CC used to be better before you could purchase top level heroes. IGG really sucked what little competitive nature was left in the game out with pay to win. If you want to spend money on a game and still be competitive, play Summoners War instead.',
       'OMG This app is annoying in all ways... And on Certain hack things I play this for 30 seconds but still don\'t get a pass! Tell CoTops to give me my credits',
       'Very unfair. D\'ont download it unless you want to spend a fortune. After four years of playing, the new op heroes available for cash, will crash your in a second. Be aware !!!' ,

      'If you\'ve liked the first game you\'re probably gonna enjoy this one. It\'s more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it\'s built around microtransactions so if you\'re feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don\'t understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it\'s likely you\'re going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren\'t aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don\'t expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!',
       'I was unable to launch the game for some stupid reason.....i sent several messages to the developers email seeking help,but everytime i get a same reply,asking me to visit the ea gaamjng website. It doesnt work,and seems like the message the developer replied is auto generated. Does popcap/ea rlly take time to fix it? Pls help me,i dont wanna miss out on speacial events. Thanks',
       'I like this game so much, but after the last update the game is a bit laggy, and I noticed that only the normal level music plays every time no matter what type of level I am playing. For example: the ultimate battle theme and the minigame music are all missing. I am playing on Galaxy A5 2017.',
       'EA doesn\'t care about the problems of the gamers. Im not interested anymore in this game after my profile has gone. 3-4 years of playing and buying stuff and most of my plants are in level 10 plus 4k+ gems, but with one stupid glitch, all of my achievements are lost. the game does not deserve even 1 star. I DONT LIKE TO PLAY FROM SCRATCH AGAIN & AGAIN. STUPID!!! u dont care about our feelings, all u want is money..',
       'Latest update caused the game to hang on the \'starting...\' screen. I had to re-install the game. Luckily my save had synced (this time). (Playing on Samsung Galaxy S7 edge). Besides that problem, I love this game! It\'s one of the best \'freemium\' games about. The amount of content that is free is consistantly awesome and expands all the time. I also love that, unlike other freemium games, not making purchases has no major detriment to the playability. Keep up the good work EA!' ,

      'wouldve given 5 star. but because i stated my mind and what other players have thought ab that weird guy ironangel. i was silenced. for stating my mind. i have spent a load of money om this game and tech support doesnt respond at all much anymore. when you stop persuading ppl to pay money and then ban them from the game then 5 stars woll be awarded.',
       'It feels like you have destroyed the loot given buy the golden chests. I used to frequently get hero\'s or 30 shards. Now I get 3 shards for a 100 shard character... not worth spending 400 quid to get op hero\'s',
       'Good game, but so far diamond rewards are small. Gold and party experience/skill points, although come in bunches, are expensive builds. Good game, but other games give more  (in the early levels) than this one.',
       'PQ has gone from being a fun and honest game to hardcore pay to play. If you\'re not prepared to shell at least $100 a month then don\'t bother.  Even worse there is no technical support. There\'s this robot called Iron Angel who either insults your intelligence or gives you the we hate bugs to reply that doesn\'t do much to help players. They also have company trolls on their forums so don\'t bother complaining there.',
       'Game is great, but the support team never responds to emails and free offers are like Russian roulette. Deserve better than to get ignored after spending 150 on this game',

      'Pretty cool! I hate that there is not enough reward to play more.. at least victory chests should be always available or an option to erase a chest so you can use the slot to win a more powerful chest. Idea of the game is good, but for the player becomes more frustrating than enjoyable. You wait for all cards to load then you can\'t use them, only one.. the rest need another reloading.. crappy gameplay.',
       'Don\'t bother playing unless you\'re made of money.  If you play without paying a lot of money you will lose a lot and never win a tournament.  The lag is terrible which also causes you to lose a lot. When you decide to pay for some gems watch out cause they will charge up to 4x the amount, then you get to go through the process of emailing idiots and taking days to get your money back. Plus they don\'t match you to your equal the person could be the champ and you\'ll never win against someone that has played it years longer than you. Well best of luck to those that this review didn\'t scare off.',
       'If u don\'t spend money you will never be a big winner! Everytime a new card comes out everyone buys them up and you can\'t win. That makes this beautiful fun game suck turds!!!!',
       'It\'s a fun game, but don\'t waste you\'re money. If you\'re going to charge $25 for a chest at least give someone a legendary character. Waste of cash, never again!.',

      'Lost all of my bikes when I re-download the app. It shows the 500+ wins I have, but I don\'t even see a way to get the basic ones unlocked again without paying for their stupid VIP package. It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven\'t bothered to update this in years.',
       'Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can\'t stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn\'t happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can\'t buy any of the bikes.',
       'It\'s a fun little game at first, but has many, many flaws. You have to link it to your Facebook account if you wanna play all maps. There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can\'t play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That\'s just ridiculous. Not to mention it\'s very buggy. Sometimes you\'re racing someone who\'s in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it\'s just stupid.',
       'Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you\'re racing friends.',
       'Bugs and Glitches... Multiplayer links are not being sent back and forth properly. Some games keep giving me desert level 1 and not showing any replays or ghost bikes are doing a different levels then the one I am suppose to be racing against. Please Fix!!!',
       'I love playing this game but id give it no stars seeming that there are so many ads and when I collected enough stars for a ghost bike I DIDNT GET IT!! HORRIBLE!! unless you can fix this, you\'re not getting a good review on my hand. Oh and also, for anyone wanting to know, it\'s 21 dollars a month for some bikes. Not in real life. Wow such a great deal... No really a great deal.' ,

Sometime when I run the game it\'s not response (all animation are moving, but it isn\'t resopnse when I press the screen) , so I have to close it and run it again many times till it response. Hopefully you will fix this problem ASAP. Thanks!',

      'I really want to love this game but the time mechanics in it are just too much. An hour for one game token and most of the maps after the tutorials cost more than one token to play. I have to wait 3 hours to play one round? I really like this game, the merging mechanics are addicting and fun! I find my self between kicking myself for popping something early and getting excited for getting close to going just one more level up, but I almost have to literally forget about the game in order to get any sort of meaningful play time out of this game.',
       'Don\'t get me wrong, I love the game. It has a nice idea, gameplay is great, and it\'s addictive. Or, it WOULD be addictive if it didn\'t take me 3 hours to get enough chalices to play 1 level.   It\'s no fun if I have to stop, then play, then stop, then play. Before, I had a limit of 7 chalices (1 chalice every 10 minutes, I think) and each level cost 1 chalice for first play. Now I still have a limit of 7 chalices (1 chalice every 30 minutes???) And each level costs 6 chalices. 6 CHALICES!  It doesn\'t add up! Do you want me to play your game or not? I would honestly give this game 5 stars if it had reasonable timing. I don\'t like this update.',
       'Reason I changed from 5 star rating to 4 stars is before a recent update, you only needed 1 dragon chalice to play any level. Got changed to needing more than 1 on most levels, which wouldn\'t be so bad if they didn\'t make you wait 1 hour to get 1 dragon chalice back. Used to only be a 15 minute wait between chalice\'s. If it goes back to old way......5 stars again! Still a great game',
       'After reaching level 39 my camp game completely erased and I\'m back to level 2. wasted so much time making hearts. .update. I tried to play again. I even have cloud saving my game again. I reached level 30. Suddenly all my dragons are gone. Again. What the hell game! Update: once again  the updated and all my progress is gone. This time om at level 53. I\'m done. The creators don\'t even reply or show that they are listening to the players to come to a solution. I\'m not playing this game again. WASTE OF TIME!',
       'Purchased the 30 day gem subscription. Got the first few days then it stopped. No way to contact support from inside the game, help menu continually crashed. Emailed support from outside the game and received no reply. Hoping Paypal can get my money back. Cute  time wasting game but don\'t spend real money on it.',
       'Love the idea. Would love to have getting gems be a little bit easier without spending money, watch ads or something for gems, since they are required to complete some quests. Also, mine all of the sudden stopped working. Said the hardware in my phone couldn\'t support it anymore. Same phone. So, now I can also no longer play. Bit bummed about that.' ,

It\'s become annoying beyond the point for me to continue. Otherwise, great game.',

       'By is adorable',
       'Wow how do u make it soooo incredibly cute? Even the icons r cute, the outfits r cute as well , cutest bunny pet game ive ever seen. Plz add more games...so far i dont hav a prob witt it n i cant wait for my lil cutey to grow up. I love it to the max thanks',
       'IT\'S SO CUTE! I LOVE IT! I JUST HAVE 3 SUGGESTIONS.  1. CAN YOU ADD A BOOKSHELF INTO THE BED ROOM SO WE CAN READ TO OUR BUNNY? 2. WHEN RUBBING THE BUNNY IT PURRS LIKE A CAT? PLEASE CHANGE IT( I\'M GUESSING YOU GOT THE PURRING IDEA FROM MY TALKING ANGELA).3.I CAN\'T BRUSH HER TEETH ONLY USE THAT SUCTION THING PLEASE FIX THIS!  BUT OVERALL A VERY CUTE AND FUN GAME TO KILL TIME!',
       'It\'s so cute. I cant even describe how great it feels when youve been gone for a long time, then you come back to the app and see you have like 30 likes or so. It just makes you feel acomplished. I also enjoy how its not a pay to win game.',
       'Well, it\'s really a pretty game, and quite similar to Angela and Tom the cats, but it has unique mini games and a map and this is a plus, but a disadvantage is in the work of game. There is always bags! A lot of them. For example I choose white hair colour, but next time I\'m into the game it\'s changed into blue! It happened every time. Mini games are running not as smooth as in the beginning, so you can\'t continue to play. Sometimes, when you get new items of clothes and try them on, there is now bunny to see them on her, and then there is only the white screen and game closed. Please, fix it, and I\'ll instal this app with pleasure one more time.' ,

Yes I understand that you\'ll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I\'m playing the game??!! It\'s too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.',

       'I dont know why people are rating Ketchapp games below 4 stars... I agree games are difficult but one of the unique one\'s in every launch. Their creativity is awesome... Love to play each of their games. Kind of more chanlenging and unique ones',
       'This is an amazing game! But there\'s a tiny problem with the controls: they are hard to be used. In addition, there are so many advertisments and that\'s the only reason I gave 4/5 Stars',
       'Nice game but became boring in just one day! 2 options of controls: Spin (Steering Wheel) and Tap. Tap option is easier than spin. You have to complete the damn missions but the coins are only available in Normal mode they aren\'t available in arena mode. For making easy highscore follow this!! 1. Switch your controls to tap mode. 2. Open Arena mode. 3. In the beginning take the U-turn. 4. Keep driving in the middle line i.e in between of lane 1 and lane 2. 5. Just keep driving on that small line dividing both lanes and you\'ll get your highscore until and unless you get tired, I\'ve made it to 3,887.  Normal mode is quite harder than the Arena but it provides coins and you\'ve to play it for getting your missions accomplished!  Thanks' ,

      'Dear EA Sports: We really want to get the icon Ronaldinho but its changed and its very hard. Before we were required to have an 89 ovr+ team with atleast 5 Brazilian players but now it has completely changed. Now we are required to have a 98 ovr+ team with atleast 6 Brazilian players. I hope you make the icons a bit more easier. Thanks☺',
       'Fut can not be developed with this building team. Football is one of the most attractive games but how this fut goes? In Vs attack mode, what the hell meaning do chances have? Players must creat chances by themselves not the game. You must let them play whole game and create the chances by themselves. EA is a big builder in football games and develop a lot but have you ever thought how your fut only stands at this place?',
       'The game is nice for every football fan.... Nice controls and good graphics...events are awesome... There r different game modes.. the only thing that I don\'t like after the recent update is that while playing campaign mode there are many stages which requires u to be in certain lvl in VS mode.... I think both the modes should be independent.. otherwise it\'s a fabulous game... The most awesome football game in play store right now.',
       'overall its an awesome game great experience. but Its hard for free to play players to complete and go through the events..... the icons are too difficult to get please make them a bit earlier to get, it will be awesome to have them in the team.... its difficult to get elite players in a pack of 500 fp totw pack n few others packs too... the vs attack mode is great.... EA please make sure that the free to play players to get a good experience of getting new and better players....',
       'Ya this is sure that this game is awesome but please make the gameplay same as real FIFA such as at a time 2players can play in a team and can control a team. One more request is that, that you should change the graphics because players in this game are not looking as the real one. I am waiting for the next version if this eagerly hope you make this changes in this game',
       'Can you please make the following improvements then your game will rule the playstore. 1) Make your graphics good. Sometimes one can\'t even recognise the player. 2) Add  real referee there on the pitch. 3) Add a feature of commentary in all languages. 4) Add an option of the records of every individual player\'s stats, goals, assists and all. 5) Add some weather conditions,night mode, attendance. 5) Add a number of more celebrations and especially player\'s signature celebration.  Please take a look on my review and make the game more beautiful.' ,

      'Awsome game. Completed all levels without any hack jzt waited  for hope   ( the lives ) evrbdy shld try this. Sry i gonna uninstall this app only bcoz i finished all levels. Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.',
       'The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don\'t get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new "enemies". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you\'ve lost some lives. But that\'s not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.',
       'I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It\'s more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.',
       'Completed all but just couldn\'t get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I\'ve ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.',
       'I love this game 😍😍 it is my favourite but.... I don\'t like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it\'s a great idea😋😋 btw i loved it 😍😍😍 ill give it 5 stars then😊😊',
       'Game is great, but when you lose all your lives it takes some minutes for you to be able to play again, or you can buy the pro version but who wants that? I just wanted to play whenever I wanted to without paying extra for it... You maybe could allow us to play without achieving anything without the need for lives...' ,

      'Hey guys, love the game. Fun to idle as well as actively play. Keeps you busy and addiction hits quickly for this one. PROBLEM I\'ve used the machine for new train parts 8 times and received the taco car EVERY time... Don\'t get me wrong that\'s effin epic, my train is alllll taco cars. But I would like to receive different cars, especially if I am to buy the premium currency, I don\'t wanna buy it and just get more taco cars...',
       'Great, retro style game. There are some bugs, mostly involving the day cycle, which doesn\'t seem to update often. Lots of pop culture references, including video game characters pretty much everyone knows!',
       'Great little game this easy to get diamonds and gold good story to it I\'m currently hooked to this game well done guys keep this up (it\'s not pay to win but would quite happily spend a little money to support this game',
       'Kinda refreshing to play this kind of game on my phone.. most games out there are too ordinary and not my taste.. this is good and I wish to get better chance at winning better ones tho 🤔',
       'It\'s an interesting concept, but I didn\'t find it fun or entertaining. It deserves four stars, but it\'s not the game for me.',
       'Good game would give it more stars but every time I click on rewards comes up with the loading screen then goes back to the train which at this time is moving to next station' ,

      'Its perfectly awsomely COOL Im already level 27 and i have all of the ninjas but can u please add more space for the other ninjas? That cant get in even we need them somtimes we play it and we need a ninja and its not in the box to pick a ninja you will jut restart the game. Anyways but i still love it Ninjago is my  favorite have you guys watch the ninjago movie even there episodes. Thank you for creating this game.👍👍👍👍👍👍',
       'I\'m a big fan of lego ninjago♥. Its just hands of time I fight serpentine and when master Wu spoke I saw a timeblade. When I was chilling looking at my mission\'s then Lloyd hacked into Zane\'s computer he said something I just have a bad memory.',
       'I think the controls are horrible because I Am left handed and you\'ve got to use your right hand to go forward and there is not much of fighting or ningargo feeling',
       'No controller support on Android TV. Very buggy playing on a tablet. Character gets stuck behind/in objects and you have to kill the game...',
       'I think if you could add a few extra spaces for more ninja then everybody would be happy .the reason I\'m giving this app a 4 star rating is because you can only have up to five ninja on a mission including your own .if anybody would like that to happen then give this review a thumbs up.',
       'It\'s amazing I love it I like how you can make your own ninja and have any weapons it\'s one of the best games I\'ve ever played I have it on all my devices it always puts my in a good mood a job well done plus I\'ve saw every episode and the movie I\'m a huge fan got lots of the sets (5) stars keep it up' ,

      'Good fun and very addictive. I see people moaning about the adds 😧 but what can you expect from a free game? You get an add pop up after about 5 puzzles and to be honest it is only for a few seconds....just close it if you don\'t want to see them.',
       'This game is outstanding. Love the graphics, simple to understand. Some appear quite easy and then you suddenly get a level that looks like it should be but has you scratching your head for AGES!!! Love it. I can live with the adverts, just wish i could put the phone down.',
       'Saw it advertised and gave it a go. Pretty fun, once you understand the tactics it\'s pretty easy but I still like it. If you want to waste time, but not on a Candy Crush rip off, this is it!',
       'I usually can find something "wrong" with almost any app or game, but this is about as close to perfect as I\'ve played or used. I did not find the ads to be *nearly* as bothersome as most games. Good stuff!!',
       'Simple easy game that just let\'s me stop and focus. I don\'t find the ads too bad, gives me a break between boards. I like the occasional board I can\'t figure out right away.',

      'What is this???? After every 1 or 2 game when the main menu comes I touch screen just frozes I can\'t even touch any button. Neither I can play nor I can go to shop it\'s nothing I can do but just to quit the game. My phone is Samsung S6  Pls do something it\'s really irritating',
       'Good idea, poor execution ok on the mobile version. Constant lag, hard to control, the view is zoomed way in so you never see anyone bigger coming your way, full of adds, and the game constantly crashes and kicks me out. When I try to log back in, it says that I\'m trying to log in to an account I\'m logged into elsewhere. It has potential, but it needs work...',
       'This is a nice idea for a game but needs a lot of work. First of i couldn\'t even understand how the game works. Always saying "connection is slow" every damn time. Controls? Terrible. Before i even learn how to move i get eaten. Please look into these and you might have a good game there.',
       'fix the laaags please. I have high speed internet but still facing lags. I spent a lot in this game and don\'t want to loose it. Still lagging :(. It works with only high speed internet. Can\'t play with the data packages only strong wifi.  You didn\'t fix this in the new edition of the game and the rush mode is not working. The new party is sucks big time. Fix fix fix',
       'Lately I\'ve been lagging ALOT and I have high speed internet. Oh, and when it does somehow load i get eaten repeatedly by teams, so I restart the game and that lobby has teamers too.   On days when I feel like going through all of this I have to go through the constant ads that me have to go through hell and back to exit... So I assume, maybe rush? NOPE rush has teams left to right as well... please fix the lagging problems and find a way to terminate teamers or make lobby\'s smaller so nobody would see a reason to team, and when that\'s done I\'ll rate you 5 stars.',
       'Ok. are you kidding me? i payed my money to get rid of advertisement and all the sudden it reappears again. i purchased some coins to get rid of advertisement and its still there. BEWARE PLAYERS: this is a bait. it wont made the ads go away. ads will also appear out of nowhere during my gameplay. delete it now' ,

      'Bought all the babies when I first downloaded the app. Everything was working great. So when the most recent (3) babies were available for purchase I bought them, but now those babies don\'t work!.... I\'ll give five stars when you get them to work. In the meantime, I think I should get a refund on my money.',
       'I would like to give a better rating, since my 3yld loves this app.  But the newest babies are not working and there is no support on the Disney app page.  Would love to get this issue reported and fixed before they try to screw everyone over with 3 more dolls that freeze the game.',
       'My daughter loves this game and plays it all the time. I just bought her all of the last babies today for her to have them all and the bottle freezes and she can\'t play with her new babies. If someone could fix this for me or refund me that would be great. I just got 6 new babies and she can\'t use any of them which is ashame cause she loves this game.',
       'Bought the game early on, then after an update with new babies they mixed the new babies in.  So you are left with a child constantly wanting the new babies.  A horrible money grab.  Otherwise a fun game.  Shoyld not show the locked babies mixed in with purchased ones.',
       'Dang, I wish the purchases I made on 6 more babies for my daughter would just work! She loves the app, but gets frustrated that the whole app freezes when she clicks to play one of the other babies. Wouldn\'t recommend this app because of that... it\'s just stealing my money..',
       'Downloaded this game for my daughter and we never got to play because the game will not load. It gets stuck on the bottle screen and then has a black screen after that. She has Nabi tablet, so I will keep the app for now and just disable it. Please fix soon!!!' ,

      'An interesting game, it gives the planes a slightly paper feel when viewing them. However, the actual controls are smooth although they can be slightly twitchy at times.

      'The PvP system is super broken. One game might be played with someone at close to your rank and next you might be playing a player with 20,000+ more trophies than you. And along with that the 2 players aren\'t even getting the same waves of enemies to start with so someone with 8 less rank ups than you can beat you by 35,000+ points. This has only happened to me like 15 times a day so please fix it cause game ain\'t worth playing if PvP is broken.',
       'Bland, generic microtransaction-laden mobile version of a good game type. Levels are short and provide very little challenge until the difficulty spikes. Upgrades demand grinding or spending money. It\'s just more of the same trash flooding the mobile market.',
       'Great graphics and controls. Really unbalanced on PvP. So won\'t be bothering with that aspect of the game. Prices on gems is a bit of a rip off. Don\'t get much gems for the $. Will be avoiding that aspect of the game as well. Overall a solid 3 stars. Is fun, but could be so much better!',
       'The game was cool up until you start getting stuck and can\'t level up so the only way to move up you have to spend money to buy coins and hearts. Unfortunately people need to chase money rather than make something cool',
       'Kind of a bummer that the PvP has been under maintenance for soooooo long now.  Once you complete all the missions, the fun thing is getting new ships.  Can\'t get the newest ship without access to PvP.',
       'PVP Only mode.  Taking too long bringing the aliens out to destroy.  Can\'t even get pass the rookie stage.  Very disappointing.  But you not going to do nothing about it.  It is what it is.' ,

      'Hey RobTop, the game is ok, but there is one issue. im used to playing geometry dash with my samsung chromebook 3 (it doesn\'t have touchscreen) and when i press the spacebar on my computer (this is the same issue on geometry dash lite and subzero) it doesn\'t let me jump. And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.',
       'This is really hard. I can\'t buy the full game as I am only 9, but I think I am missing out on a lot. Please add check points to normal mode as some levels are basically impossible',
       'This game stress me out but the next day when I play it I beat the lv in one go and fills my heart up with joy! So what if the control\'s are sensitive? I know they are.. but if you take a day and give it another go you know what happens and you do great!',

(F*** MY LIFE!!)',
       'I love this game just...can you fix one glitch? On the final level final area the wave is bugged ...when I tap it goes down by itself! Can you please fix it? I was trying over 3 hours to make it but I can\' t because of the glitch :( Please fix it.',
       'Got all the way to the end,  and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow,  and ended up having to restart all of the levels,  fix this,  it doesn\'t happen with the other geometry dash games,  just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted...

      'Purchasing the other ponies is worth it. Don\'t know why other people are complaining. It\'s only 5 dollars, you could get a DQ lunch for 5 dollars. Anyways, game is amazing. What\'s cool is that you can reset your progress so you can have fun all over again. Amazing work Budge Studios!',
       'This game is my 5 yr olds favorite thing to do during trips. She loves the music and animation, and the gameplay is entertaining enough to keep her engaged. It\'s definitely worth the few bucks to get the add free version.',
       'Pay to play mechanic. Seems rather predatory for a game targeted for younger CHILDREN. Not to mention the constant barrage of ads that can only be removed by paying for ponies which shouldn\'t be EA\'d. Outside of that the game is enjoyable but the paywall issue is a problem. Devs... you should feel bad about yourself.',
       'Installed it, launched it, after the bungie screen was presented by a full screen ad for some game involving a woman + handcuffs + panties. Not a good look for a game aimed at children, my 6 year old was standing behind me.',
       'Only 3 ponies to play with, or 2 for certain people. If you want them all, you MUST pay $5.00 to defeat the pay wall and continue, otherwise reset the game and play the free levels again, with the SAME ponies, Twilight Sparkle, Fluttershy, and Applejack, for the people who got 3 ponies, for the people who have 2, you have Twilight Sparkle and Fluttershy. The game is fun but the pay wall problem has got to go.',

Funny how it stopped working a couple hours after I paid!!!',

      'I have only had this game for a few days, so I can\'t write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it\'s up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.',
       'On one of the quest, I think 11. There ia a syrange new animal and I went to the game menu for information and there wasn\'t any. It looks like a brown rabbit, I tried killing Rabbits squirrels and deer, but It wasn\'t the right animal! Is it in the snow biome?  Anyways hope you can help me and otger quest 11 users. It\'ll be great that when you get the same animal twice it counts as duplicate. For example "Wolf Common Duplicate +(however acorns). Thanks and the update is great!',
       'Could you add more animals to play as? And a world idea could be a dessert. I love this game, and the others you\'ve made, so I know you will make awesome updates soon! Keep up the good work. If you fixed the glitch were you eat and jump at the same time you fly, if you fixed that can you please put it back. It was fun... XD',
       'It just lags now. The new update made it to where my chat, my character, and my animations won\'t work. I run about as fast as a turtle, and I am not pregnant. Please fix!!!! I love this game. I have a few questions if you don\'t mind... Can you guys add in multi-player mode, like single player mode, that we can pick up our pups, it would be cool to add that option in the top left menu. Thank you guys so much!! Love the games!!',
       'Man i love this game!!! So much better than wolfquest!!! I do hope tht this game soon be added new things like more animal to play as, better in performance. The ad free guys...keep it up!!! Just wondering if there\'s a add as mate system in multiplayer in the future? Anyways....this is the best wolf game tht i played!!! Do hope tht you guys one day add more animals to play as (like a snow leopard for example)',
       'Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you for making this!!! I already installed it and I can\'t wait to play it!! Thank you so much TRG! (Turbo Rocket Games) 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃 oh an one thing.. when your wolf is pregnant could everything be a lot slower & a lot weaker please? That\'d be great Thanks! 😃 Oh, yeah also for the new game seasons, I\'m thinking.. Autumn & Summer! And I like how you can randomize the name! And for dog sim, I\'m thinking.. maybe Samoyed Husky & maybe Chihuahua! 😀😀😀😀' ,

But then it has lots of ads everytime i arrive at the green light and also when purchasing weapon at the weapon shop😣😣 its also difficult to climb up the hill or mountain especially when i accidentally fall into the sea.  Maybe add some extra moves like to able to grabbing thing, and speed up the ability to punch or kick people/thing.',

      'Graphics are awesome, but the game itself is very monotonous. You can fall asleep waiting for something to change and make it more exciting. When a change such as an added bonus does come (bomb or a rainbow bubble) you realize that it wasn\'t worth the 20 or 30 levels you just wasted your time on. Progressive enticing events need to happen more quickly.',
       'On level 19 I scored three stars bit it shows only two. Aside from that, no other complaints... YET. I will say thank you, though, for not aggressively pushing ads, pushing to pay to extend the aim line. So far, its amusing😁',
       'This is a really fun game but my  my concerns are that when I have no balls left, for me it doesn\'t have the option to play a video to earn more but for my brother it does therefore it makes me start all over again. The other concern is that when I use a bomb for the chest it takes away a ball for example I have 12 balls when I use the bomb from the chest, I get 11 balls left which it doesn\'t do that for my brother. I hope you can fix this.',
       'Plays good at first then only gives u balls u dont need like 15 yello balls in a row or how i keep loosing cuz ill ame somewere and it firest were ever it wants or when u click on the chest it fires the ball or how if someone txts u the game has to restart no matter were u are. During the restart u must close 5 adds to play the game agian',
       'I like it other then the fact of every time I got to shoot the ball goes slightly left or right not exactly where I want it. Might be my screen sensitivity?  Other then that I dig it!',
       'It\'s the best! But there are a bit too many ads, but the thing I like about the ads that they are shorter than most ads.' ,

      'Great solitaire game! If you want to play on and on, you need to buy extra credits, which I did because I could not wait+their CS is amazing!! Games are fun to play and challenging... You could still play without buying credits,,, it would just be slower. Highly recommended,! So grateful for fantastic customer service',
       'The game is very fun, but I only get to play one or two hands before I have to wait another hour to get more credits to play. Would be a lot better if you got more credits for wins or had free play. I\'m not spending money to buy credits. Also, it would be great if there was an option to turn off the fancy card movements; I get motion sick from it.',
       'If you like solitaire you will hate this game. This isnt a game of skill or strategy. Its a sort of a matching game and it becomes clear quick that they are going to drain you of your seed currency quick so you can start spending real money. You will just pull card after card that you dont need.',
       'Its great game love that I don\'t need Wi-Fi to play it. But some of levels just get so impossible to beat you spend four day on one level. Make the crops pay out more and levels make them a bit easier make the challenges be the hard ones.',
       'Great game concept, great graphics, however it really sucks that the amount of coins required to play  increases too much and you don\'t get enough coins. I wish it didn\'t cost so much to play, it seems like they just want you to actually buy more coins. No thanks. Will be deleting.',
       'I really like the concept of this game. Unfortunately I am not prepared to even give it one star as it doesn\'t take you long to realize that the only aim from this game is to extract money from all who wish to play. Pitiful really as there are many similar games available which you don\'t have to feel pressure to buy' ,

      'Great game This is a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing aesthetics and highly addictive. Totally worth the $2 for the premium version. I do have one problem though: even though I am pretty decent at the game, Google Play won\'t give me any achievements even though I\'m sure I have earned some. It won\'t even let me open achievements or leaderboard pages. Is anybody else having this issue?',
       'I am going crazy for this game. Great time killer and stress reliever. Graphics, music, and everything else is completely superb. I am totally enthusiastic about purchasing the premium version, however, I could not buy it because I do not have any credit or debit card. Can someone please tell me if there is other ways to purchase, like deducting the fee directly from my SIM balance, perhaps?',
       'Smash Hit Smash hit is awesome because it has a lot of intensity in the game so I get to let my brain work a little.  It kinda let your brain decide if your should hit it or not. I also really like this game because the game is kinda hard so it challenges me a little bit. So who ever made this game I appreciate it. One more thing about Smash Hit is that it brings my family together because we take turns playing the game to let our brain think. Thank You!',
       'BEST GAME EVER... Love this game,  a must have on every phone.. Well worth the price, amazing graphics.. Also bought the VR version truly unbelievable. Just 1 wee problem... When you reach infinity there is not a lot of glass to smash for extra balls which is a must have especially when it goes super fast.  Thankyou and keep up the great work..',
       'I love this game.  It\'s very simple, just go without getting hit by glass or running out of balls, but it is a lot harder than it sounds.  I am forever telling myself I have time for just one more attempt, it is very addicting.  The 3d design on this is amazing and creative.  Up at the top it says to write a SHORT review, so this will end here.',
       'Excellent game. Really superb game. Engaging play and the music works well. Plus fantastic breaking sounds. This game is both addictive and relaxing. Reminds me of the original wipeout. Another cool element is that each level adds interesting new elements. Only thing that would make it better is if my acheivements would track. Im on a galaxy s 7, and they don\'t track. At least my checkpoints save.' ,

      'Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.',
       'I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I\'ve already dumped into this game and the devs didn\'t give me my in game rewards. I\'ve submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.',
       'Wasn\'t sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to "farm gold,xp,mats". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it\'s an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don\'t be jealous, just play your game and have fun.',
       'Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an "annoying add". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It\'s simple, it\'s fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend.',
       'Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I\'ve progressed it\'s just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I\'m not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!',
       'One of the worse cash grabs I have ever seen.  Love the game, but you literally need hundreds of dollars to do any single event and get a decent reward.  Go look at the latest event on their Facebook page.  The reviews are awful, ands it veteran and new players alike.  Game is fun, but they need to cut costs by half to make it worth while.' ,

      'I wanted to give 5 stars but when l reached 16 th level....... It came like if you want to open other levels then watch a video...... I don\'t have problem in this..... Then it came like - video unavailable check your internet connection... Dont know why.. Mobile data is on then also. This is the bad point of this game',
       'The ball is super hard to control. Half the time I\'m swiping over and over again just to make the ball move. The game acts like it is super easy when it is the hardest task to do. I\'m also being spammed with ads because once or twice you restart the level because you lost an ad plays. Plys the ads take me to Google Play without me touching the screen or tapping on download. And since the controls are a nightmare because of lines glitching around the ball, (thus making it not move a single centimeter) I have to watch an ad. or lines just glitching themselves. And finally, this game spams me with notifications to "thumbs up" you and download your other games. I\'m obviously NOT INTERESTED IN PAYING YOU WITH ADS!',
       'Don\'t get me wrong this game is fun and gets your brain thinking but I hate how many adds it has. Plus every time an add comes up it takes me straight to Google play with out me even tapping on it. It gets annoying. Another thing I don\'t like about this game is after a certain amount of levels you have to watch a video (add again) just to unlock more levels. And it does this more than once to. On the flip side it is a good game that gets the brain running and the levels do get more challenging throughout.',
       'The ads are forced onto you, and that is the worse system I\'ve seen yet. The controls are pretty good if you have an s pen. Most puzzles are way to easy.',
       'Too many ads and it glitches like crazy. Needs more levels, other than that it was a good game.',
       'I hate it. It won\'t let me hit any buttons' ,

      'A great game, but WAAAAY  too many ads. Its the same thing after each level: AN AD. The game is fun, but its hard to enjoy when you\'re watching ads every second. And Im getting the same ads over and over! I want to rate five stars, I really do, but I cant if there\'s going to be this many ads in a game I think everyone would enjoy. 💛💛💛💛♡ (( pretend the hearts are stars )) I\'ll download the game again once I see less ads in your games, like My Talking Angela, which also has way too many ads. Please take this into consideration! Thank you!',
       'The game was great until they put the ads on there, there are too many and 90% of the time I try to "x" out of one, it takes me to the play store anyway, and the game freezes a lot more now. It\'s also frustrating you can\'t alter the decorations. Game needs some improvements, and I hope they address them because it\'s quite fun to play.',
       'I am so disappointed in this game due to the fact my 3 year old somehow bypassed my password and spent 79.99 on coins!!! I sent a message immediately to Google play and the developer and I was told it doesn\'t meet the refund requirements. WTH?!! So frustrating! 😡',
       'This game would be a whole lot of fun IF there weren\'t so many ads! My niece is not patient enough to wait for stupid ads to finish, and u can\'t play the game until the ad is finished! Very disappointed!',
       'Love this game. Super fun but how do you get rid of ads? I paid for coins yet i still have ads. This is highly annoying especially if i can\'t skip them. Still love the game just not the ads :(',
       'I hate this game cause one, you can\'t even change the decorations or visitors. Two, you can\'t even get coins for completing a level and the daily wheel is rigged cause you can\'t get anything good. Three, if you watch a video for a reward or life, it never gives you anything. And four, they don\'t give you enough moves for each level, there are too many ads and everything\'s so overpriced. Hate this bullcrap game😡' ,

      'Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!',
       'In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it\'s newer it\'s boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star',
       'Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can\'t just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can\'t advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it\'s basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.',
       'This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said "add break". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them.',
       'The game desparately needs to offer more coins as skill level increases.  The frequency of coins remains the same while the skill level demands more and more coins (in the thousands).  Watching ads helps, but the player finds themselves doing that exclusively, which defeats the purpose of the game.  Physics, graphics and gameplay are good.',
       'One Of My Favorite Games  So. Let me start of by saying I LOVE it! So I like very few games, in fact nearly no games. But this  game is epic! It\'s interactive, fun, motivate and time killing. But there is one problem and that\'s there are to many adds and most of them are inappropriate' ,

ToyoCash is perfect for anyone in anywhere, who has free time but doesn\'t want to waste it, you can use this app while working, studying.. simply earning points by watching advertisements!!!',
       'Used to be my favorite game.  The latest update completely changed the character of the game.  The ball is faster, bouncier, and everything is smaller, and it all adds to just randomness.  The AI got worse at the same time, so it\'s not really harder... just more random.  I now find that this game stresses me out instead of helping me relax, so I have to give it up.',
       'This game is really bored! I\'m so stress! I lose and second you lose again why Glow Hockey is bored a bored game! But like it. I\'m nervous to play because you lose... but I\'m happy..',

      'The car will control itself... If you hold left it will turn left for a period but will start to try and straighten up... To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed',
       'I hope in the new update you can upgrade the engine and body kits as well. That would bring back the fast and the furious Season 7 track 6 nexts to be check it says three lap but you are basicly doing lap 2 twice and it says wrong way. Third lap starts when u finish three laps and doing 4th lap counts as 3rd lap. Needs to be looked at this is cheating  u guys are doing',
       'I have a one plus 5T with 8 GB ram still the game hangs at the finish line and all my progress is lost. I have to restart the game to get it going. Please fix this I can sent you the screenshot is you want. I love your game and it would be great if these small thing is fixed swiftly !',
       'Fix the detection when you touch/hit in perfect drift mode. There\'s been hundreds of times where ive definately not hit and yet it ends. So Infuriating, love the game but that one detail could definitely be optimized better. The drift should not end unless you actually hit and it screws up your direction. 4/5',
       'Game is really good. Best drift game I\'ve ever played on the phone. But there are small bugs in the game such as season 7 second perfect drift track (should be Turin) the race is not 3 laps. Even though I finish 3 laps it didn\'t finish the race and it gives the "wrong way" warning Everytime I pass from start/finish line. I hope you can fix this.',
       'I love this game and so do all my mates. It dose have a few light glitches as most games do. I would love a night track of some kind in the future but other wise great game all together. Also out of all the drifting games this is the best one at of all of them.' ,

      'Why I liked it? Because it\'s a simple game that doesn\'t make you addicted to phone but rather enjoy going forward focusing your attention entirely on your finger. What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven\'t listened to this game\'s. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I\'m entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.',
       'I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it\'s meant to be "skillfull" but thats harder than skillfull, you can\'t even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don\'t care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.',
       'This is game is ok if you are bored and don\'t know what to do.... however it becomes irritating after playing for a while.... overall its a nice game',
       'I would like to report a bug. When you pause the game, moving obstacles keep moving. Someone would use this as a cheat',
       'This is the best game to relax. But i have a problem i do i change the music there are some music that i like and i want only that to play so i request ro put a music option  Thank you',
       'Awesome game but it gets on your nerves a lot and sometimes it\'s way to sensitive, but apart from that I really like the game and it\'s very tense when your playing it as well😘 I love it.🤑' ,

      'Finally! For the the longest time I\'ve been waited, the gaming performance has been improved! No more annoying lag and the gameplay feel a lot smoother now and I am so happy about it. But the graphics still needs to be improved because it doesn\'t look too good and some minor bug needs to be fixed.',
       'Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it\'s so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I\'ve had to start all over again... but the fun continues!',
       'This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don\'t play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don\'t make us wait foreverrrr!',
       'I\'ve had to start this game all over from the very beginning 3 times. After working hard to get all the way to the top sharks, the app will suddenly refuse to connect to your Facebook account and want you to start a whole new game. Waste of time. Very frustrating. Not enjoyable at all. Find a game that\'s enjoyable. This one is definitely not fun.',
       'It\'s a fun game and I\'m enjoying it. However, I\'ve come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.',
       'Do not upgrade your Sharks.  The bigger the shark, the more difficult it is to play.  Big sharks have more drain on health and hunger, causing you to die more frequently. Impassable areas due to size of !! shark and less fishes to eat when health gets low.  Not to mention how slow these big sharks move!  The more you spend on bigger sharks, the less fun you\'ll have.' ,

      'Wonderful! Game by first touch   But I can\'t wait till the hearts 💚 are filled!  So Reduce the time. Improve this game more and more and create a new exciting games.  I have finished 390 levels. And I have a doubt what is the last level and what happens after it? All the best for ur future and I\'m a biiiiiiig fans of u guys!!  Hands off',
       'This now a prize example of a freemium game that needs a premium option. I would gladly pay £10 as a one off purchase to do away with the need to say for lives. In the past games worthy of a one-off fee would offer it and this issue such game that should consider it. I will never pay for any in app purchases on any game and I am sure I am not alone. This has 5* written all over it but the long wait times and exorbitant cost of energy replenishing means this doesn\'t get anything higher than average.',
       'Loved the game but if the life was free this waiting for minutes to play again is not cool. Also noticed if you have to score more than 1 goal and you make a mistake you have to start from the same goal you already scored. If we can get the requirements before each challenge that would make it much more fun otherwise I love this game a lot keep updating for more seasons. Thank you. I am on Level 560 with 1257 stars I am awaiting Season 29. If you can also create a full football game with same concept. This is a Great game!!! Thank you developers keep developing Great games like these!!!',
       'SCORE  HERO RULES This game is so sick dudes. It so cool that this gives us idea that how to play soccer or football. Gameplay is so smooth . They players show us some epic skills . It has an commentary. The worst part was the heart. I can\'t wait till it get refilled ❤❤❤❤❤ this. Graphics are great . Just reduce the time of refilling the energy . Overall this game cool. Thanks for the game FTG.',
       'Most irritating game plan.  Have any one ever seen in real game that if a player miss a goal then all the previous goals are cancelled? But in this game such thing is happening. You should not cancel all the goals scored only for a miss or loss of a ball. Goals should be saved and to be started from where it stopped for missing a goal or losing a ball. Developer should take it into his consideration.',
       'Do you know what? This game is really bad. If you\'re calling this game really good, then you must be blind. The graphics are really bad, it is really laggy and whenever someone puts in a review, you don\'t fix it. You never do any updates to impove this game also. And the fact that you have to wait for your hearts to regen is so annoying. You should remove the hearts *now*. That is why I think this game is so bad and that I rate this game 1☆.' ,

      'This game is fun and entertaining and time will pass by you playing this. The only downfall is you only get so many chests locations on main screen and take hrs to open them up. So you have to decide if you want to play or wait the hrs. You can free up those chests by using your gold that you have but if you run out then you have to buy more with real money.',
       'It always seems that luck favors your opponent and gold is extremely hard to come by. Wind totally inconsistent, almost like it screws you purposely.  It would be nice if they gave you gold rewards for achievements but that\'s where their money grab is. Some courses have bugs and it\'s extremely frustrating, Win or lose money always seems to be pretty tight.',
       'It\'s a great game but I was up against one person and it usually gives the other person a chance to hit but this time I would have won but it didn\'t give me a chance to go another round. Don\'t know if this is a glitch or part of the game but it irritated me',
       'It has a few bugs of late, Ive cleared the 2nd courses twice already but still it says 46/50 so my progress doesnt always sync well since the last update but its still the best MINI GOLF game you will find on here! It is a mini version of Golf Clash except for the set up of the controls but they are great too which is the best regular golf game I\'ve found on here...',
       'Games rotten everytime i go to play the big money games it says iv lost connection. iv got the best wifi on the market so nah dont think so. very annoying dont instal',
       'I got hit with the rocket and both times they hit my ball and their ball went straight into the hole. I\'ve gotten it 3 times and each time, it bounced me backwards and always put their ball in the best position. I\'ve lost over 6,000 coins for just those instances. Why is it when they get it, it always works out? And when I get it, it messes me up?' ,

      'Angry Birds used to be a game you could just tap on and play to your heart\'s content.  Now it\'s gone fee-to-pay (sic) -- you can read the other reviews to see how well that has been received.   Not well is an understatement.  I\'d say more, but you\'ll have to gain 50 more stars to read each new paragraph.  Meanwhile, watch these unskippable half-minute-long ads.',
       'Between ads completely over running gameplay and the new requirement of having to earn stars to proceed, Rovio continues to run this once great game into the ground. **Update** game now freezes randomly requiring a force close. This is beyond ridiculous. I HATE what this franchise has become. Rovio should be ashamed.',
       'This game used to be awesome, sadly I have just removed it due to the star issue. I used to be able to play for fun, however, due to the its current standing, one MUST achieve three stars in each level in order to play other levels. Madness! Great job for taking the fun out of a game!',
       'Love this game but keeps freezing, a lot! It\'s more frustrating since the update where it costs 30 coins for the telescope but only get 5 minutes instead of 10 now and half the time my games frozen and the time runs out FIXXX',
       'This latest update keeps freezing up. I have to close it out completely and restart it. I lose any powerups I was using when it freezes, too. I cannot even finish playing the mighty levels the last few days because of this issue. Very annoyed.',
       'Wth ! Game gets hanged, as soon as you use mighty scope in mighty league. Not one time, or occasionally. Everytime since last update. WHAT A MESS ! Above that it repeatedly cannot find internet connection, be it WiFi or DataPack.  GIVING 3STAR, for good old game. If no fix found, will keep downgrading.' ,

      'They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It\'s definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you\'ll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.',
       'Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don\'t be fooled. This is a pay to win game.',
       'I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that\'s cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!',
       'Typical pay for play. Fun in the low levels then it becomes painfully obvious who are paying the big bucks. They will say everything can be obtained for free. While this is true. The amount of time and effort makes it not worth the hassle. To get the better robots you will pay a lot of money. $100 for a robot as a sale price in this game. It shuts off in the middle of the game tech support took their time responding and didn\'t address the problem. They say record and take pictures but they will not upload. In my opinion not worth the time.',
       'I totally like the game and all but there must be balance between different robots especially..... some robots have a big advantage like the haechi with 3 medium slots and its dash ability.. its like u cant even aim at it......  Also please remove the components so that everyone is able to buy newer robots... u can make them available in gold or silver or even workshop points',
       'This game was great until about 5 days ago, that is when it started to take 4 to 5 minutes loading time for each game mode to start. Now my attention span prevents me from waiting that long to play one game. What happened game developers?.... !!UPDATE!! Okay it must have just been the servers. Because they\'re back up and running at 32 seconds loading time for a war. This game is great. I can dig it can you dig it' ,

      'Really fun game. My 2 year old adores Hank. The only thing that I feel is missing is a way to save your progress to the cloud. My phone needed to be reset a couple times and we had to start over. Didn\'t mind so much because hank as a puppy is much cuter.',
       'I like this new update. Hanks now have His own happy meter like Tom and Angela. Nice. Also this is just my suggestion. Can you guys also make My Talking Ben and My Talking Ginger. Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that\'s it. You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It\'s not fair. Lastly good job guys.',
       'Great game, probably best talking animal game out for adults n kids... but sometimes u watch a video so u can spin the wheel n win gems or coins but the wheel not always comes up... ive had approx. 20x it has not happened in last 4 hrs... would like it redeemed n fixed plz...',

Sorry I am re-downloading my talking Tom and start from scratch that only take pics feed and sleep on this game',
       'My three year old grand daughter got around my password and charged $40 of in app purchases and did a monthly subscription, too. I have gone through everything to try to remedy this, with no help from the customer service from the this apps developer.',

      'I played it a long time ago and i stopted like 5 months ago. Then now i reinstalled it and:  1. I could not enter my acc  2. I could not connect to facebook or google play.  3. I had to pay each time i danced wich sucks.  Till that update this game was the best game/app ever. It was so fun and so great that I just wanted to play nonstop.  I mean before this big update u payed for a song and u could dance on it as much as you liked. Now it just ain\'t fun anymore.   Please return to the classic game or your gonna lose much much more players like me.',
       'Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren\'t enough. And one of them didn\'t work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.',
       'I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.',
       'It\'s fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I\'m bored. I love the songs and dance moves it\'s awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it\'s awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don\'t know how to dance then you should download this game it\'s perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.',
       'Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn\'t have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!',
       'I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn\'t make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun.' ,

      'Sometimes it makes no sense. You are coming from quailication as 7th, you jump to 2nd position so surely you cant finish worse than 8th? WRONG. You end up on 16th place which is impossible. There is no in between you either win or you finish 14th or lower. You have 30 pts lead in front of number 2. after 1st round, you slightly fail your 2nd jump, guess what? 18th place for you! If you jump for example 120m on a K90 in Q, you finish first because everyone jumped 20m less, sudennly in 1st round you need 130m to secure your first place because everone managed to jump extra 30m. All in all fun, but still needs a lot.',

Awesome😒 Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don\'t reach the end and fall into a void. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.',

If my son was able to lose his progress and the money we sunk in the game because he was using multiple devices and didn\'t know what Cloud and Local meant which cause him to lose his progress then mabe this game shouldn\'t be labeled E for Everyone. Change the rating to Teen if they have to know what cloud means or risk losing there in app purchases.  Google change the rating on this game.',

      'I used to play this game a long time ago with my brother. I thought since after all these years so many new updates have come, the game must feel different. But it\'s the same. I love the tune that plays as you play it. It\'s so nostalgic. My brother isn\'t anymore with me but playing this game makes me really very happy. It\'s just like I am back in those old days. Specially for me, as it has so many memories, this game is the absolute best.',
       'I have a problem with my account. My punk zombird was maxed out. Level 3. Then when I opened the game, my punk zombird was gone... I obtained that by waiting patiently and gathering 90 diamonds. I had to watch 3 15-30 sec long video for 2 diamonds each. After watching the 3 vids, I had to wait another 8 hours for it to be available again. It took me a month to obtain that bird and then all of a sudden it dissapears?! I obtained it again but I had to start all over again. I uninstalled this app because of that issue.',
       'The game is really addictive. but repeated zombie birds are generated and diamonds are getting wasted. Please change that. One bird one time please. One bird should be at max 3 level not another set. It\'s wasting my internet to watch video to get diamonds for collecting birds',
       'I love this game cause it kills our time when were bored. Yep, we, my mom also is addicted to this game hahaha, shes always getting my phone and play this game whenever im sleeping. Love it, I recommend this game to everyone💖 you\'ll be definitely love this game. MobiGame you slaaaay hahaha',
       'I personally loved this game. First off,  u cant jump for high periods of time cause u to run into the bombs. Secondly, whats sup with these prices? Thats ridiculous. You cant level up with prices that high and u have to buy 💎 gems and coins just to get a level up... But tum... Very great game overall.',
       'i think it\'s really good every single detail of it is the best only yu should add different zombies that give u power -ups and special effects The next thing is what I said yu should add it into the second one yu could make. The last thing is in the 2 one yu should make it so when an amount a zombies yu get yu get special powers,boost, and cool stuff. Plz make what I just said it would me so awesome if yu did. I\'m begging do it it is my first time ever making a short statement If I misspelled anything I\'m so sorry and for how long this is☺.I  love this game do it💖' ,

      'This game is ok. The graphics are good. It\'s my favourite bowling game out there.  However I really don\'t know why this needs access to my phone contacts and other permissions.  As a result it\'s been removed. Apps and games need to sort out their permissions for what it needs to do. If it\'s not required I\'m not installing it. Other than that complaint it\'s actually a nice game for a quick 5 minute time waster.',

       'Needs to have better controls. Sensitivity to the roll, angles to throw while using curves. Maybe a power gauge for the roll, & moving your stylus or finger while giving it a curving flight on it\'s way down to the pins',
       'I have this game on my note, iPad, and computer so it definitely should let you home much I love it.  Not including its wonderful to have when I\'m always at the Dr. for hours.',
       'Not working! Ball freezing during play!  Angry customer!  Going to uninstall! Ball freezing cannot play! If not fixed immediately going to uninstall!  Freezing ball makes it aggravating!  Game freezing during play! Angry!  Ball not rolling right sticking! Ball not rolling at all! Pissed off customer! Angry,',

      'I kind of miss the old version because isn\'t that why they came out with a 2nd game so if we eant more we got it.  Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.',
       'I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I\'m playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can\'t complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍',
       'This game is really good and fun but strate after you lose all 3 of your lives it goes straight onto an add. There are loads of adds and I don\'t think it needs that much adds for a game like dumb ways to die, on the other hand it\'s a grate game and it\'s a laugh and a joke, I think it\'s a really good game☺',
       'This game is both funny as serious it\'s a great way to make kids understand the danger of some things around them. Like trains and wires and different things. As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.',
       'I think that there could be less ads. When I\'m trying to replay he game an ad pops up which is really annoying. What I would say is that this is an excellent game but just less of the ads',
       'A truly wonderful and entertaining game. Very well supported with great updates over the years. Latest version (Valentine\'s) appears to be buggy (animations jerk ahead) ruining the gameplay. I\'m unsure it this is the game or my phone.' ,

      'Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I\'m 32 and play this often so it\'s not just for kids . Give it a try it\'s very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen 😉',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.',
       'Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can\'t do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!',
       'I Loooove Fishdom!!!😁 I\'m absolutely addicted to this wonderfully fun & challenging game. The graphics are very cute & entertaining. The only issue i have is that I\'m up in levels 180+ & there\'s just NO way to make the amount of coins to purchase ALL the decos/plants i earn. Most are priced too high.',
       'I love this game, its very challenging. The only thing I don\'t like is that your aquariums end up way overcrowded with stuff before you can move to the next aquarium. Of course you can move on to the next one as soon as its unlocked, but I won\'t move on until I have all 3 stars. So honestly, I guess this is just my issue. I probably should have given it 5 stars, because my issue is the only reason I didn\'t.',
       'So far I like it. But not on a very high level well see how this progresses. Well now I\'m on a level that I keep losing  by one  or ten mainly bcuz all the graphics  are stationed in the exact space so. And while it\'s true u don\'t need WiFi to play u do need it for ur daily prize which u really need.' ,

      'Overall a great game, there\'s one feature though that I feel lets this game down. Just the small fact that a father can copulate with his daughter, then again with their inbred child if you so wish. I currently have 4 generations of inbred mutants running my castle, if anything the extra fingers actually help with certain tasks such as cleaning. Do you happen to have a designer working on this with the surname Fritzl?',
       'I think the gameplay is good and the caatle building aspect is fun.  However, the level scaling is way off.  You get a point between throne room 4 and 5 and can\'t do a whole lot.  Losing fights when your characters are maxed out in training.  Other than that its pretty solid.',
       'Why in the f**k does this require an internet connection. Fallout shelter is the same thing but doesn\'t need internet. Sure you can use internet for purchases and rewards but it definitely should not be required. Please consider making this offline compatible and I will change my review to 5 stars and a positive actual review of the game. Thank you.',
       'Definitely worth downloading and trying out.. It\'s just like fallout shelter but a little more. You can do a story line and attack other players rather then just sending people out and HOPING to get something good. It\'s a little slow at first but it\'s really quite alot of fun and the creators actually listen to its players.',
       'Good game but when your rank gets high all of a sudden most enemies are too powerful. Then it takes forever to gear up. Solution is to deliberately lose and lower your rank. Not good. Also you will find yourself with a lot of gear after you played a while. Would be nice to able to sort it, not only for your different warriors but also all the production gear. Would be good to be able to more easily compare gear in your stash and what your inhabitants are wearing. It\'s a bit messy now.',
       'Seriously, what gives with the battle system? If you can\'t beat someone 75k below your power rank because they have no real life and spend 20 hrs a day grinding for equipment - what\'s the point? Ofc I could buy that equipment with real money but would I support another pay2win crapp? Uninstalling.' ,

      'I dont know why you chosen Retro style graphic and i hope for a change. There is a lot of IRANIAN players but PING is over 250ms and too much delay. Add iran flag. Google play sign-in is not working. Add more skins. Events are just bunch of objectives and prizes, add more artworks and stuff for events. Other things are good for now. Thanks for the revolutionary IO game. Congratulation on 10million downloads 💝',
       'Since the game is under process - it has a lot of room to improve. The studio is generous for the rewards and daily logins. They listen to the community and it takes time to fix those bumps. Love the game and the art also - unique and tasty! A competetive game that gives you urge to hustle more. Impressive game!   Been a butthurt person before - my apologies! Hope for the best!',
       'YOU GUYS ACTUALLY LISTENED!!! Im so happy right now because when I saw theres a new update, I immediately downloaded it to see if I can play it without crashing. I can actually play it now with my friends! A little bit of framrate drop but still... I can play this wonderful game. Im going to totally recommend this game to my friends. The devs of this game are the best devs in the Google Play Store. Again, Im truely greatful and I thank you guys. :D',
       'simple, fun, addictive gameplay, good graphic with unique animations, great events that keep players active which is good, have great potential. dark adventure loading still takes too long, i already dead when the loading is finished. crashing and some bugs in event tab. talking about awaken system, man atleast dont downgrade the stars or reduce the percentage of downgrade, finding awaken item is already damn hard. this great game need new character and more feature but not p2w. keep the good work barbarq !!',
       'It is the best game I\'ve ever played! With simple graphics and gameplays, you won\'t notice how long you\'ve played! Generous with presents daily and very recommended to spend time. However with the new update, I can\'t connect and it stayed on connecting. Tried to change internet source, but to no avail it\'s still there.  I would like to ask the developers, to reply as soon  as possible, on what should I do to get rid of this problem.',
       'Hello! I\'ve seen this game many times from the ads and I tried installing it and later found that this game was really intertaining and fun. Anyways, I am having problems with the game\'s connectivity to the internet. I am using 4G in playing the game and it seems that it does not connect very well, other online games connect well to the internet. I think that is the only issue I have in mind. Just hoping for more smoothness though.. But I love the game, it is worth the time playing. Thank you!!' ,

      'I recently switched to mobile gaming only, and I have a g stylo phone and a Nvidia shield k1 tablet. On my phone I get network error (I\'m data only) and my tablet says the game isn\'t compatible. It\'s marshmallow OS on the shield tablet and the thing can run borderlands 2 natively so I know it\'s not a hardware issue. This game looks cool. Wish I could find out for sure. And no, I\'m not running a speed test.',
       'The features of the game are cool.. i like all the pvp dungeons.. but most of the dungeons with event goes in certain time and limited.. if i miss them..then i hardly get the purpose of installing this game meaning.. nothing else to do.. it\'s getting boring for player like me who wants to spend hours online but no more rewarding pvp dungeons available overnight.. maybe create some entertaining 24 hours pvp features? I can tell many players tend to be inactive for more than 1 day...so hope for more crowded and better LOD..',
       'I just realized this evening that this game uses the microphone feature to spy on the players and listen to their conversations without their consent. After joining one event I could clearly hear conversations of other players (not about game and I\'m sure without them even knowing that they were being listened to) while I was having my sound turned off, even after leaving that particular event and when having my game in the background the sounds didn\'t stop until I turned off the game. This game should be called Legacy of Spies, nice try 👍🏻',
       'I love playing the game but there are so many updates all the time. And when they do their bimonthly update you have to download new package and then some gameplay features dont work. I have had a couple things not work from last update. I tried to contact support and they havent replied at all. Its been three days now. Im an everyday player who spends real money in game. Would rate higher if someone would help me out..',
       'I Love the Game itself. But the reason I give 4S only is their Support System. It seems that they dont really care about their Players, And also, The game itself is Great from its Interface to its gaming experience. Its all good, but when new updates comes, the game has Always Bugs, and Developers seems so slow to Fix them.',
       'Sorry for giving you low rating. But it\'s been days or weeks idk, it\'s always freezing when I try to open assassins chronicle and soul relic. And it\'s been months I\'m getting messages \'go get your mine\', but no map\'s coming. I can\'t even enter any plunder, for days. Hope you fix that.' ,

       'Listen, gamelot I used to own a gun (Death\'s Angel) and for son reason I\'ve lost it due to the new update, and I can\'t get it back due to I must be a VIP lv 1 to purchase another, so pls give me a refund or the weapon back, and do fix this pls for I LOVE THIS GAME but if this keeps up, I\'ll give it only 2 stars.',
       'The latest update has ruined the game. Before it was an attraction that the 90th day reward was an MC4 . The they have made the 90th day reward a silly gift  a Trendizer now . This update is not appreciated',
       'This game is one of the best games I have ever played. The only thing I don\'t agree with is the whole VIP thing I don\'t think there should be a VIP',
       'I want to craft materials with money not diamonds. Except vip members normal players cannot craft materials with diamonds. Very disappointed GAMELOFT thought it will change in new update but it did not change very bad.',

      'Buyer beware, I purchased the "unlock all manicures" option less than a year ago, not only to unlock options but also to remove Ads for my kids. It\'s less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed.',
       'A really nice game which also got me hooked up! Nevertheles, it frequently and automatically shuts down, deleting what was there.....this really broke my litlle sister\'s heart, even mine. For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....',
       'So, this is an awesome, addictive and fun, satisfying game to play and it is really good if you want to become a nail artist. I would of gave it five stars but it is a bit unreal like you can just rub the nail varnish everywhere but it only appears on the nail but that can stop you from being annoyed because it is not as hard as it is in real life and one of my designs didn\'t go into my album because the game just got stuck and randomly stopped by its self and it went back to my home screen. Also there is too many ads. I am not interested! And you can\'t cross them off unless you download the app! What point is that?! And I cannot move and make the stickers bigger on match this so I can\'t complete it. Help! Sort this out!',
       'I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn\'t get me board everytime i have different desins to do.',
       'Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!',
       'I  am finally at the final last level! Before I thought it was boring but after I reached some levels farther I thought it was awesome! And it is the best game ever! YEAH!!!!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💙💙💚💚💛💛💜💜💗💗❤❤ AND when I was playing my 1st game all things were opened but when I played in my small sister\'s tab all, things were closed! I got everything for free!!

      'This game is the WORST!!! The controls don\'t work and there is not even demonstration on how to play. Also every time I retried to do it a stupid add came up. I AM FURIUS!!!! Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don\'t get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don\'t mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!',
       'Ugh look people if u start playing this game oh wait if u had any sense u wouldn\'t. these adds are outrageous every time I die there an add I\'m not even kidding. My dad rates tones of games and I\'m the one playing some of them and I told my dad that these adds are so horrible I even had to report it. Now here me out great game but the adds. And in the beginning there is no instructions on how to do the game so like I said in the beginning there is a add at the end of every round so in the beginning there are many adds. Now i think there are more adds then game in this game. I\'m not trying to be mean so don\'t go crying😢 to ur boss.',
       'It\'s honestly a fun game, and I\'d love to use it as a stimulating activity (ah, who am I kidding, it\'s just a great time killer), but it makes my head hurt-- and that\'s a problem. I\'m not even the type of person that is negatively affected by fast-paced graphics or rapidly changing colors. It\'d be five stars if it didn\'t give me headaches, but, for now, it gets three; good graphics, smooth gameplay, but no matter how great the app, it isn\'t worth physical discomfort. (Note: if you are looking for something similar, try "Run". It has the same sort of concept, but without the advertisements and headaches.)',
       'tbh it\'s a really good app! The only problem is that it gets a little boaring after a while (obviously that\'s my opinion) And I don\'t know if it\'s just me but there or tons of over 30 second ads.',
       'I like this game  very much cause you dont know what comes in front of you which makes this game more interesting. But 1 problem is there that the second i crash to any obstacle an add popups',
       'This game is AWFUL!! There is no tutorial and every time I fail an unimportant ad comes up. What is wrong with you making games like this? Close this game down it is terrible. Just learn. Who would want to play a game like this you stupid idiot' ,

      'Graphics were generic until now for x86 devices. Thanks for that update. And that moving data to sd card, it is really appreciable since now a days even 32 gb  not sufficient. Hope other game developers get inspiration from this. And downloading just updated part is also an improvement instead of downloading whole data again. 4 stars because this game just wont allow to play older version once it finds out new version is present.',
       'Asphalt 8 airborne is a very exciting game to play. The addition of bikes is mind blowing. Wish all time limited events could be on mobile data rather than wifi. Thumbs up gameloft for an exciting game. After the recent update of this app it keeps crashing with a pop-up message "unfortunately asphalt 8 has stopped working". Please fix this issue.',
       'I\'m addicted to this game, I love it. And with this new story mode update  I\'ve got more excited, I won all the starting races and now waiting for the refill. Only one thing that is negative, it is the upgrades are too much expensive and takes a huge time to gather coins versus the escalating events and this is depressing. I hope that game developers will fix this problem and make it fair enough.',
       'Munich update completely ruined what was previously the best driving experience on mobile. EDIT: Fall Out Boy update basically makes me unable to play the game altogether, with the game constantly freezing at the Gameloft splash screen. Talk about letting the junior devs do all the work unsupervised...',
       'This fallout boy update really sucks. Two stars for past glory but this needs fixed. Wont load multiplayer and takes several tries to launch the app at all. Either a white screen or gameloft logo hanging endlessly. And tbh I dont like the blurry nitro thing. I get it, but hope it goes away in the next update.',
       'As racing games go, this is probably the best. The graphics, sound, gameplay are excellent. Race solo, against friends or the world. The variety of ways to race is big. The selection of cars and now bikes, keeps getting bigger. The only down side is buying something from the shop or on offer. I purchased a special offer and never got it. They got my money, I never got the goods. Trying to get in contact with them is a joke. All replies to my emails were automated responses telling me to do the same thing over and over again.' ,

      'This so freaking awesome, a woo hoo maker! I kept mumbling awesome, awesome, when i passed a car. And this is first time i\'m very exited when i managed to finish a level, even after that, i repeat again till i can surpass it perfectly. Even i haven\'t sleep for 2 days, felt like an alien or zombie, etc. But this game cheers me up alot. Recommended ? Yes! Good job dev, just download it guys. Lu pasti hepi dah! Keren!',
       'Wow... as I was writing this review it suddenly all disappeared as it said unfortunately traffic rider has stopped. Wow.. nice. I cannot even open the game without freezing up my tablet. Real nice. And tbh I love this game! On my phone it works..... 😥😣😈👹',
       'Pretty cool..It was actually a little more than i expected.  The bikes are cool. They seem to be modeled after actual bikes, but perhaps didnt want to pay 4 the licensing to use actual manufacturer names.',
       'One of the best motorcycle game to date, weather conditions are great, bikes are great and handling is great, but the bad ai on higher difficulty level a few times are ridiculous and messes up everything.  Sometimes a truck speeds up to 150km/h just to close off that small gap, where you could slip through, but next time all cars in all lane slow down at once, so you can\'t pass anywhere, even though there\'s nothing in front of them. This is really annoying, when every second counts and there\'s no way to pass them for 4-7 seconds. Apart from this the game is great. The keep changing weather conditions is great too.',
       'There are some idiot missions such as combo overheading. I would give this game 5 stars if not those missions.',
       'I can\'t stop playing this!! The missions are really hard and thats what makes it fun! although i almost threw my phone twice. but this game is amazing! the graphic is good too!' ,

      'I\'m really fond of this game and love the gameplay and quick paced matches. The new update is AMAZING!   There are a few things that would make this game extra perfect for me!   Must have character customisation. This would be of big amazing to me. Char customisation makes me bind more to certain characters. The rings we get don\'t have much value to them except for upgrading the characters.  Could have non-ranked matches. I would love the option to play/practice against rivals or my own friends.   Should have quick chat responses. Would like to communicate before and after the match with simple reactions. Like Good luck and I win, tee-hee!',
       'Thanks for the new update SEGA. It fixed the "I\'m lagging" condition even though I have fast internet connection and what\'s more you also enchance the Point of view on which lane I would go,Lastly please make Infinite a playable character. Keep up the good work :D',
       'There are a lot of stuff in this game that makes me angry but I keep playing so it has something to offer! I\'m happy with the new maps it makes it more skill based rather than just good luck. It rewards better your good play. I say you should remove the old style maps the are named easy but you are very likely to get punished for bad luck! And fix game crashes or when ever they happen don\'t punish me for it\'s your fault.',
       'Guys please fix the bug which closes the app automatically without any crash message. It simply exits out and takes you to your home screen. I really love this game and would have given a 5 * rating if not for the crash.   Update 23 Feb: The game still crashes, for e.g, the battle was about to start, and the audio started as a matter of fact but the screen simply didn\'t change, it froze, a few seconds later, the game restarts, and now when I try to start a new battle, it says that the previous session is still running. So guys please look into it and make this an already superb game better. My system is a Motorola G5 plus, running Android 7.0 Thanks.',
       'If you like Sonic and need a game to play while sitting on the toilet this is a ton of fun to play and pretty addictive once you get the hang of it. I\'ll warn though that this game has micro-transactions, but they aren\'t as in your face as other games.',
       'Fun fun fun! My 5 year old child is a sonic fan and recently I found this game app for him to play before his afternoon nap to calm him down. He loves it.  Pros:  -unlimited racing chances (do no require stamina or energy that limits you to race) -fair chance of getting new characters from chests without needing to spend money -simple controls and gameplay -variety of race course unlocked depending on how many "trophies" you gain -you get chests whether you place 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th so your time is not wasted -has a decent amount of sonic characters that can be unlocked or upgraded  Cons: -Time chests that you gain from racing (silver, gold, etc.) Are limited to count down only ONE at a time. Lowest time for a countdown is 3 hours, so when you have four 3 hour chests to open, you can only open them 1 at a time. This is the biggest drag since you are limited to four time-limit chests at a time. If they are full, you cannot gain more from your wins until you clear a space.  Other then the one con I have, my son is satisfied with everything else.' ,

      'PRACTICALLY AMAZING!!!!! THE BESTEST COCO GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!!! I have played many coco games, (almost all of them) but this one is the bestest of them all (if that\'s a word 😜) mainly because A LOT is unlocked including the SPA!!! (Crazy, right?!?!?!) and there are so many things to do. Plus it also reminds me of subway surfers..... The one thing I love besides the spa, is the restaurant. As far as I know, only fitness girl has that..... So definetly, it\'s a plus..... 👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍😋',

      'It would be a real good app if they didn\'t have so many ads popping up. Budge needs to reevaluate this because it\'s not making my kid want more games...its making her hate this game. It\'s not an effective strategy...and no parent would download another budge game after seeing one ad a minute.',
       'It\'s a good game but I\'m telling you. There are way too many ads. 30 second ads without a skip ad button seriously I spend 80% trying to exit the ad then I do playing the game. I see that everyone else is complaining about the same thing. So Delete the ads Please. And please make all of the Ponies free. Some of the levels required a different pony but you have to buy them. Drag and drop is broken. Please fix it.',
       '"drag and drop the broken bits into the right place" game locks up and little 4 year old girl cries. Now I know why these games get hacked by little sisters older brother. People get pissed. Enjoy your money budge!',
       'My kid loved this game. She got really into it and was loving every moment, but then a part of the game wouldnt let her do anything. It was a boss scene on a pinkie pie level and a drop and drag boss on a rarity level. The game simply wont do anything and hence she cant get any farther. This is frustrating as i paid for all the stuff for it as she enjoyed it so much and its beginning to feel like i paid for my kid to be sad. Please fix!',
       'Let\'s talk about ads. I downloaded this for my kid. She would love it except for the fact that EVERY 30 SECONDS THERE IS AN AD! I realize that\'s how money is made, but that\'s ridiculous. One at the end of each level would be fine, but this 4-5 inside the level is overkill. And they play upside down. She spends more time trying to exit the ad than playing the game.',
       'AMAZING Now don\'t blame me for loving this, I know there is not many levels, too many ads, but this is very active for kids. It can make thier reflex better! Can season 2 just come out already?' ,

      'After months of playing this game I realised  no need to keep gems but to spend them snd rewards are amazing when you got gifts for fulfilling the tasks. So slow pacing. Could have been more exciting but I like this game and I belong to a township that\'s competitive and kind. Awesome game!',
       'I\'m facing a problem. Their is a costumer that wants a statue that costs me 650 diamond and I don\'t have that much of diamonds I only have 5. And he asked it from me like more than 2 weeks ago . So please give me the diamonds. But its a very wonderful game and I like it so much. But please help...',
       'Game is good. Easy to figure out. Not a fan of the spices that cost gems or the whole VIP thing. Also only leaving this in hopes that that one customer always asking me to rate the game will stfu.',
       'When is the next update on the game and how much longer do we have to wait for Bill and Mary to say I do ? It\'s killing me to wait this long ? Oh I am also wondering why haven\'t I got to go on a higher level I have been on level 28 for the longest time so fix the problems now',
       'Great game. Enjoy the different story lines. What happened to the wedding storyline for Bill & Mary? Every time Diego leaves something goes wrong. My township has disappeared.  I had deposited money & spices in the treasury...what\'s joining on.',
       'Moves pretty slow and very repetitive. Also takes forever to open on my phone since the update. I think you should get more spices for the diamond cost as well.' ,

      'This is the best game in the world. srsly if this was the only game on my ipad then i will be happy. As soon as you get onto the game you just cant put it down. The only down side is that the spins cost alot of coins and those coins can be hard to earn. So 4.5 stars i would rate it is that was a option but its not so i rate it a a big fat 5',
       'I love this game a lot. The only problem is that when you do the Dailey spin, you only get like coins. And then with the coins you can buy another spin which is what I do. And I get even more coins. It\'s really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and',
       'this game is the bomb. it is stupid that they asked you is this game beautiful, of course not, people die, and crack their necks, backs, and shoulder blades. This game all in all soooooooo fun and you should totally get it. just say no if you want to write a reaport on this game because it will ask you is this game is beautiful which it is not. GOOD LUCK, good  night, new york city. at late night talk show with stephen colebert......jk',
       'Would rate give starts, but the amount of ads is absolutely ridiculous. I\'m actually thinking about uninstalling please fix that. I know you want players to pay but in all actuality, it\'s quite stupid. Anyway, I do believe the game is quite fun',
       'Whatever they did last update broke the game for me, this is why I never buy anything in these games. No way to contact anyone to resolve any problems.  Game gets boring anyway',
       'It\'s a really good game and works really well. The only thing I don\'t like is how the cost of the daily spin goes up every time. It is quite annoying. Other than that I really enjoy playing this game. Great job guys😀' ,

      'It was fun while it lasted. I was a big fan of the first game and this one was an awesome improvement. Unfortunately my game crashed after months of playing and forced me to play the tutorial again. UPDATE: After reaching out to Pikpok customer service they reset my story progress and gifted me several leveled up weapons that help balance out what I lost. I appreciate their rapid response and look forward to playing more!',
       'After i reach chapter 4, suddenly all my weapons progress are gone,  then i contact the support team,  and they dont restore my previous weapons,  but they give me MORE than what i have before. 😄  I really happy with this,  and i really appreciate this.  You guys should try this game. This is AWESOME. Now it\'s time for me to kill more zombies 😎',
       'I give you guys a 5-star rating. The graphics are amazing. And the weapons are cool. The only thing. I wish we didn\'t have to have the stamina constraints. And it would be awesome if I was able to keep the extra ammo I find so I have it for future levels. And also its a pain in the ass to level up the guns all the damn time',
       'Be better if i dont get all wepons down to a double barrel and pistol after months of gameplay.   Second time this happened so far.  Good game and story but gota work out the bugs.  Cant play level 8 with a level 1 guns.   Uninstalled the game.  Waste good money playin this online',
       'Excellent game. I am totally addicted to it. Developers can you please include a reload button. Also sometimes playing I hit a wall or fence and it becones impossible to move left or right. In that case moving a couple of steps backward coukd save us in the game. Please include these options for making the most out of it. Overall its an excellent game and I highlh recommend it.',

      'I never EVER been so absolutely in love with a app. I only read about 3 stories and spent $82 for gems and tickets because not only I couldn\'t resist it\'s the least I could do for the creaters for creating such a perfect game that seriously was meant for me in every way possible! (And I NEVER spent money on ANY apps so THAT is how much I LOVE this!) This brings me endless amounts of happiness! It\'s EVERYTHING a story lover could love! 😍💓 AND THERE IS NO ISSUE AT ALL ABSOLUTELY NONE! And I am so not lying when I say NO ISSUE! 😁 100/10 game! My only wish is I\'d love for another way to earn gems.',
       'Game is fun. Dont even mind spending money in gens every now and again. But seriously to get the outcome you want, this app is charging waaaaaaay too many gems. Like 50 for one simple choice. And its goes up higher depending on the amount of gems you have. If I pay $5.99 for like 60 gems.. that should get me through and entire story. Not just one chapter. Will delete app if they dont change it. Not gonna spend $40 to finish a story.. Sorry but I think thats outrageous.',
       'This game is really fun! I wish there was a way to restart a story that you are in the middle of or that you could change your appearance or other people\'s appearence at any time. Also when you decide what your character is wearing, sometimes you can\'t see it because dialog is in the way. Also when you choose what you look like. I would prefer it to be against a white background. It\'s hard to see what the darker colors look like.',
       'A lot of the male characters don\'t show up when I\'m playing. The dialogue and speech box will still be there but I can\'t see any of the male characters, and this only happens with the male characters. I have tried all that I can to make it work, but it won\'t and I have to go through the stories without them being there most of the time. Please fix this for me and I will change my rating, and please allow to create a story in Limelight for mobile, I really wanna make my story but all I have is my phone and I LOVE the Limelight versions.',
       'It\'s such a fun game, no matter what genre you prefer. But I think the chapters are really short and the tickets take way to long to load. If there is no way to make the wait time shorter, at least give me more than 3. Other then that I think episode is a great game',
       'I love this app so much. I love all of the stories ive read  and am reading. The only problem is that although they\'ve added more chances of earning gems they Only give us 2 passes now every 4 hrs. That way to much time to wait for only two passes. Before the update they gave 4 passes every 4 hrs. I think that was better coz u got mire passes with that amount of time  11' ,

      'This is a really good game. got a great high score and it\'s good when you don\'t know what to do. But once you have been playing it for bit you get board or at least I do.and to the creators of this game to make it less boring you could put levels or different modes in it or add more  shapes. Please reply or just update. Thank you.',
       'My absolute all time favorite game! I used to have the woodblock version and would play that one ALL the time. The only thing I didn\'t like about it was that I couldn\'t get anything higher than 300 most of the time for the score, no matter what I did. The only time I did was the first time I installed it and played, I easily reached 1,500 points, but anytime I played after I could never come anywhere close, so I decided to look for a different game with the same concept and found this one. Instantly loved it! It\'s got more block room (so easier to get more points), love the sound effects, I don\'t feel cheated or set up like the other one, and it\'s a good way to get your mind working if you\'re someone like me who likes to think it through and plans for future possible block pieces c: plus the colors and looks is a bonus!^-^',
       'Your English is so bad it is insulting.    You need to hire someone to proof read before you post requests for ratings.  A definite turn off to the game which is actually quite fun and challenging.    Requires strategic planning.',
       'The app is fun but it needs a no ads option for purchase. Also if the game is muted the ads should be auto muted as well. Currently the play at full volume whether the game is muted or not. It\'s very frustrating.',
       'My four year old likes it and I feel like it helps him on making decisions. I can actually see him thinking what going to be him next move. I like this game and I love playing with my son. Only thing I hate is that it does have to many ads 😒',
       'I like the game itself, but way too many adds and they pop up in the middle of the game and then your piece you are placing goes wonky.  Do away with the adds in the middle. Whoever thought that was a good idea in a puzzle game was completely misplaced.' ,

      'So I\'ve been playing the game for a couple of months now. i think that there is an awesome game here, with already plenty to do. I do also think that there is lots of room and need to improve upon this. As I have been playing for a while, I do notice it becomes quite challenging to escape orbit with enough fuel to make it to other planets, like mars. i do recommend you add a cheats section that you can enable in the settings, with unlimited fuel, larger build space, indestructable rockets, etc. I also recommend more bits and pieces for building, like bigger and more powerful thrusters, or air vents for turning in space. For later development, a satellite system would be much appreciated, as well as a little spaceman that you can control when docked at a space station, or when you\'re on a planet. Thank you for an awesome game!!!',
       'I landed on the Moon and... I got back to Earth safely on manual control! What\'s with you, you think I\'m expendable?! There is no way to add new destination once the original one is attained. Also it would be great to have a payload that can be carried other then the capsule alone. Other than this is the greatest fun I had in a while.',
       'I am so addicted to this game. I love everything about it. I just wish there was a place to donate to you (developer). Also, I would love it if there were more rocket parts. Also, I wish there was a thermosphere you had to get through to get on planets. All in all, I love it! Can\'t get enough!  Edit: Thank you so much for the reply. I\'m sorry I wasn\'t clear on the thermosphere part, but i think the reentry effect would be lovely. I just can\'t stop playing. And I\'m SOOOO excited about rovers and things! Thank you so much again! :)',
       'I got to the Moon my second launch! Fun game for doing a launch while waiting for the bus etc. It\'s simple and I like it! Couldn\'t figure out how to decouple my boosters simultaneously. Very nice work on this app! It\'s KSP but mobile version very cool! The music is cool too! My suggestion is to add some reentry heat affects, more sounds like parachute opening sound, etc but I\'m sure that\'s on your list.',
       'Bee looking for a game like for my entire years ! this is the best rocket game, I have ever seen in my life travelling to space , I like the sound system , formation of building materials is compatible ,graphics are excellent to the 2D platform . I like the physics of the game. Please keep it , ur the best Space programmer of all times (GOAT). Is it possible to add a space shuttle and moon rover ?    Regards. Please fix up batrrey issues . my phone heats up a lot .',
       'Trajectory in orbit I really love this game you made. It would be cool if you could make the rocket face the direction of it\'s trajectory during orbit. Edit: Can you add re-entry effects when going to other planets? It would be more realistic. Also add heat shields for re entry situations. And when is docking gonna come? Hopefully in the next update.' ,
    recentChanges: 
      'This update brings improvements to the build system.',
       'Parts now smoothly snap to each other.',
       'Parts now try to not be placed one on another.',
       'This an many other small changes I made should make building a LOT easier.',
       'Please keep giving me feedback about the build system, I still read all the reviews.',
       'Added side facing nose cones (under utility).',
       'Fixed performance issues.',
       'Fixed bug that caused some parts to load incorrectly.',
       'Sorry for so many updates, but this are things that I need to fix.' ,

      'I used to love this game, very addictive but recent updates have made the game have too many elements (clubs - who cares???) Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels "fixed" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.',
       'This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.',
       'Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the "boards" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it\'s addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It\'s becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.',
       'I don\'t know if a review is still available  after a game has been deleted. The game was fun to play I\'ll say that. I didn\'t need 5 push notifications coming @ me in the middle of the night however. The one that came through @ 3:17 a.m. was it for me, I\'m out.',
       'I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn\'t really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don\'t know how many more points you need.',
       'Game is good when the app opens, which is not often. Don\'t bother messaging support with any issues. They are useless and just just repeat the same solutions to problems you aren\'t even experiencing. Serious dissapointment. Be prepared to loose lots of coins!' ,

      'It is inexcusable to allow ads to make such noise when both my phone is in silent mode AND I have the sound off in the game settings! I went over other reviews and the developers wanted to know which ads. Seriously?! How about all of them?! They have to be aware yet refuse to fix the problem. Do not download this intrusive app. Also I get a migraine with the annoying "Ready? Let\'s go!" voice when the sound is on.',
       'Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.',
       'Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you\'re given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.',
       'I\'ve reached on level 93 been at it for almost a week now. And it makes absolute no sense no matter which way I go. For example I will shoot a blue colour to burst the same colour and another colour shoots out. Can you fix this? It\'s frustrating. It\'s a game I selected to relax my mind but it quite becoming the opposite. I cannot give a 5*',
       'Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.',

      'I love this game!! "it helps a lot" with my shopping addiction because I feel like I\'m buying real merchandise. I really enjoy the updates and how you guys added more room to be designed!!!! Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))',
       'I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.',
       'The game is fun, but results take 2 and 3 days and if other people are on higher levels they have access to better tableware and vases, pictures etc, so their rooms stand out more and they have a better chance at getting 5 stars. And some items I\'ve purchased don\'t work it gives a message saying they couldn\'t find it in the warehouse. But the game never gave me my gems back and of money. NEED TO FIX IT',
       'O.k. the game has been fun. Love decorating. My gripe is why can\'t I keep the furniture that I have purchased with my own money? And why do I have to repurchase items that I have already bought? And why am I limited on purchasing if I spend my own money.  You guys say that you don\'t enhance the voting process but I tend to differ. Many times rooms that have scored A 5 are all in the same color tones and almost look the same. It has been fun but unless you give me more options to purchase I\'m? out.',
       'Entertaining, enjoyable and inspiring! Brings out  your creativity in utilizing your available resources and in maximizing your limited funds. The game makes you travel around the globe.  Hope to seeing homes from less popular countries. Sad to note that there are times that free diamonds don\'t add up after watching the videos and there are items not found in the warehouse.',
       'I really love this game! It surely brings out my passion in interior designing, nourish my mind as i see others works, getting inspired also to continue want i really love in life, which is designing/art. And it does help me to chill or relax whenever im depressed bcoz it makes me think what to design, and helps me get out of the stress that life brings. It indeed help me with my mental and emotional instability. 5 stars for this! Number 1 app for me. Never failed my expectations. LOVE IT!' ,

      'Perty good Edit: We\'re in the middle of an event and the game won\'t load. Finally says down for maintenance. It would be nice to get a heads up on when that happens. Gonna put a hindrance on the event that\'s over on Friday. Do hope it\'s resolved soon. Still like the game tho, but would like it better if I can play.',
       'Right.  First off, If you are not a fan of Idle games, then don\'t play. This is the epitome of an Idle game.   The Early game is pretty simple. Click, Collect, Make your way to Level 80. You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn\'t bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn\'t been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event\'s are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events\'  All in, pretty good.',
       'Well guess they deleted my last post cause I complained that the game took up 1.8 gig till I uninstalled it and reinstalled it then lost my saves because of bad programming.   Don\'t waste your time or money on this company.',
       'One of the best "tap" games. Love the satirical theme. Who would have thought that politics and money were SO interconnected😁. Just to be clear to some, I AM being sarcastic!!!! Great time waster. And that\'s NOT fake news.',
       'They put so many buttons to purchase things ion the main screen. When tapping as is the nature of the game, it brings up confirmation for your purchases. If you\'re trying to play fast, you could easily spend $20 in mere seconds without noticing. Put all the purchases in one place instead of cheating players.',
       'Good game but you need to fix your ads, half the time they either crash the game or they won\'t load and freeze the game so you have to restart. Also the game will randomly just close sometimes for no reason. Enjoy the game but there are definitely some bugs that need to be worked out.' ,

      'Great game in terms of graphic and gameplay. The only thing that sucks are the paywall in this game. Almost impossible to pass the story mode with weak weapon that we are given. The box drop rate also terrible. The only way to level up is by completing the main story. I will uninstall this game till they fixed this system. Really bad system.',
       'You guys made a really good game honestly. Just one thing that gets me tho, when you win fights you get to fight stronger and stronger opponents that\'s a great idea btw. It\'s just that most of the time I ended up fighting someone that has 800 + power and I\'m at 550. Like bro. Come on.  One more thing. The chess take to long really you guys need to fix that. Other than that it\'s an awesome game. No lie',
       'For the most part, pay to win and the enemies get to the point where they take 40 percent of your health. Another thing is, enemies know your every move and will counter, combo you almost every time. Also, you can only play this like 20 mins a day due to the fact that everything is timed and you have to wait like 4 hours till you can do anything. SF2 is still hands down my favorite.',
       'you didn\'t fix any bugs. you only added them. there are points where you attack the enemy but your weapon goes right through them with no damage. Keep this up, Nekki! You\'re doing great!',
       'Well, maybe batter than the previous game in animation but... its lacking control and the game sometimes laging. I cant progress after cwrtain level, and have to buy with coin/ gem. Its good enough but can be better',
       'Good graphics but sometimes when you are winning, opponents takes your 60% to 70% health in one move. Sometimes cannot clear some levels because difficulty remains impossible nevertheless how many times you upgrade your weapons. Not recommended game' ,

       'FORCED ADS! I loved playing this game for years but had to bring the rating down atleast one star because of the forced ads that I usually refuse to watch in games. So now my sessions playing this game end as soon as an ad shows up. Very disappointed.',

       'The ads are ever increasing, I don\'t pay for games and being forced more and more is a deterrent to continue playing. Turn it down a notch.... edit to developer reply...that doesn\'t explain why more and more ads are popping up. What was wrong with it before?  Getting greedy with get you nowhere.',
       'It\'s a fun game, great for passing the time. That being said it suffers some very problematic connection issues, if I tab away for even half a second it disconnects me and causes and auto loss',
       'I thought it was a really good game and very addictive. I wish that instead of you losing when you\'re connection is down the game should carry on until you join again. I\'ve lost loads of battle\'s that where going really well then lose connection and it won\'t reconnect so I get a loss. Also there are loads of ads.' ,

      'Look, I understand that you have to make money somehow, and ads are how you make money on a free game. But these ads are way too frequent and obnoxious. I listen to podcasts while playing games and every minute or so my sound cuts out completely to prioritize the ad. Earn the ad by giving me a decent amount of playtime before it and stop overriding my audio.',
       'Way too many ads after every time I lose or go onto another level an advert pops up. Verry annoying. But the gameplay is decent.',
       'I like the game itself but when you have 3 adds coming up after one game you hardly can enjoy the game. Super annoying, so if you download it for free be prepared to buy it otherwise it will drive you crazy!',
       'You know what i love this game and people say theres to many ads i egree but i found out a hack just put your phone on flight mode and then  there will be no ads try it if you don\'t believe me',
       'This game should be called, "cut the ads".  Unable to play the game due to excessive ads so I had to delete it soon after downloading. Sad I know. First world problem.',

    description: 'Scooby-Doo and The Gang have discovered a hidden treasure map and a mysterious LEGO key that can be built to unlock any door! Play as Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, or Fred, and help Scooby-Doo find the missing pieces of the LEGO key, recover the lost treasures, unmask the villains, and solve the many mysteries of Haunted Isle.Who is your favourite character?Shaggy might be the hungriest, goofiest, most-fearful member of the group, but the bond he shares with Scooby-Doo sees him through thick and thin. He might run at the first sign of danger, but when it comes to helping his friends, he’s always ready to step in! Fred is the glue that keeps Mystery Inc. together, and his mind is always two or three steps ahead of the monster they’re after. He sees mysteries as a chess match, and nothing makes him happier than planning genius and elaborate traps to catch ghosts, vampires, bogeymen and more!Brave, beautiful and brainy, Daphne is the most enthusiastic member of Mystery Inc. She never leaves home without her camera and her notebook because someday she wants to be either a famous mystery writer or an investigative journalist. Velma is the resident smart kid of Mystery Inc. Her hyper-analytical mind deciphers clues almost as fast as she can say “Jinkies!” Although the group tries to stick together, Velma often ends up wandering off by herself, searching for the next clue. A Great Dane with an even greater appetite, Scooby-Doo reluctantly chases ghosts and ghouls with the rest of Mystery Inc. Although Scooby-Doo is always up for an adventure, he prefers activities that end with an all-you-can-eat buffet. When his friends need him, Scooby-Doo will run to the rescue! His best friend in the whole world is Shaggy, and you can usually find the two of them running away from a monster or snacking on double-decker sandwiches in the back of the Mystery Machine.For app support contact LEGO Consumer Service.

      'Maybe the reason people think its boring. It\'s probably because they are boring and lame. I beat the first level without a problem, they didn\'t because they feel like everything should be easy and they shouldn\'t have to work hard for anything. The game is challenging and fun if you like a challenge. If your a lame, whinny, expect nothing to be hard, and can\'t handle a challenge as tough as making toast, then this game isn\'t for you.',
       'These other reviewers are jerks! Lol. The game is awesome! And my 4 year old can even play it well!  I like it so much, I\'m downloading it onto my phone (4 yr old plays it on my old phone)  just to see how far I can get lol',
       'I would get to the title page and that was it. It won\'t let me go further. I have turned my phone off and back on and I have uninstalled it twice and installed it 3 times. Please fix.',
       'The game controls are very annoying. The character won\'t go where you want him to. During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don\'t want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn\'t want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.',
       'It\'s an disaster game. It doesn\'t even open on my phone...it just stuck all the time.',
       'So, this game is very exciting, but i have problems with defeating the monsters, and after this "update" nothing changed, so next time make new levels! I MEAN, COME ON !! Other than that, game is great.' ,

      'Fun game over all. Only input i have so far is problem getting sub parts/resources to the right spots. Would be nice if there was a way to have dedicated supply routes (these parts only go to this table), or the carriers could be better at balancing where they put supplies (put less where there is a surplus).',
       'I only got it because I love Idle Miner. I don\'t know which one is better Idle Factory is harder but about as good as Idle Miner. I haven\'t rated Idle Miner yet so I will do that now. 5 stars!',

I thought it was my bad driving but it seems I\'m not the only one who disliked this game.so  please make some improvements. I could drag you through all the bad things but I won\'t make you suffer. So I will give it sadly a 👎.',
       'The game is ok at least when I get a chance to play it -there are way too many ads every time i click on a level to play an ad shows up even sometimes during when i play an ad shows up. I strongly recommend that you do not install this app',
       'Th is game sucks! It\'s a total waste of time and it is so boring. This is the worst game ever😡😤 Also there are so many stupid ads! The taxi is so slow and when other cars get in front of you it\'s even slower. I would not recommend this game to anyone!',
       'First if all... Its down right BORING! Also there is adds after every single level! Sometimes the adds are weird and innaproprete! I do NOT reccomend this game, download at your own risk😕',
       'I liked the game and all but there were way to many ads. Every level there was a thirty second video playing and some of them were extremely inappropriate. I got a bit impatient waiting for all the ads to end but I liked the game set-up. I think that was a neat idea. I just think it would be better without all the interruptions',
       'I think it should be a bit more realistic and by that I mean more people on the streets; if you crash into someone, that person would come out of their car angry and cars get damaged when you crash into them. Maybe, to add a bit more reality to the game, you could add the money that they pay you to the levels. Apart from that it is an excellent game. However, some people, when they get in a taxi, chat away to the taxi driver.' ,

      'Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can\'t without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.',
       'First up the images used as what the game looks like are fakes. I saw too many polygons.... (Shudder) Secondly there is no start menu. NOPE! Just some fancy loading screen and boom you\'re in the game without a chance to look at the controls. Plus your first mission is ruined by the tutorial at the worst places on the track.   Bad game knockoff. If you download this just delete it. This game is EXPLICATIVE',
       'Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?',
       'I don\'t know what the game is even like. I couldn\'t even get past the loading part because it won\'t let me tap on the screen.  I find this very irritating because I like trying out new car games. But please promise me you won\'t play this game any further as its a waste of your time.',
       'So many ad\'s, there back to back ad\'s. When I am finally able to select a race, guess what...another ad pops up and takes me to the play store to download it. I go back to the game and I gotta start all over again from the first screen. Ad\'s ad\'s ad\'s I was only able to play on the first day I downloaded it, after that..... Ad\'s ad\'s ad\'s                    "AD\'S!!!".... But i did like the game when I played it',
       'Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that\'s excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.' ,

      'Really liked this when I first started playing. Honestly,there is no point me keeping it now. Can\'t perform my operations,as don\'t have bought staff and ward not on the appropriate level. I can\'t get any new staff,as I don\'t have enough hearts,and once you are at a standstill like this it take FOREVER to earn hearts back. Have loads of cash but nothing to do with it!! Game seems to be designed around getting people hooked initially (as performing operations etc is really fun), but then can\'t continue or progress without purchasing hearts!! Not wasting my time with it any longer.',
       'Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I\'ll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx',
       'I\'m VERY unhappy!! I downloaded the update and the game informed me there was a problem with the download. I then uninstalled and reinstalled the game and ALL my progress was lost. Its back to the beginning. Worst part is I just spent 10 bucks on content...money down the drain. Lesson learned. It\'s a very good game but DON\'T spend money on purchases.',
       'Your new update will not let me, or several people it looks like,  get into the game. I am currently doing the 12 day event and am on level 17 please fix it ASAP! I refuse to lose all my progress. This is the best game I\'ve had on my phone in a very long time.',
       'I downloaded the game, it\'s a great game except for today when I did an update and now won\'t let me get back into the game. Also, really difficult to level up after level 7. Everything is really expensive. Not so much fun when you have to wait along time for money to accumulate. Might delete the game.',
       'While this game is interesting, it doesn\'t really save your progress, so do not attempt to uninstall and then reinstall because you will start from the beginning. Happened to me. There was an issue with the game being unable to download some info after the recent update, so i decided to uninstall and then reinstall. That\'s how I found out.' ,

      'So nearly perfect. I tried several and they all had too many ads... some (others) with startling loud sounds that you couldn\'t turn off! Very upsetting! THIS game, however, has only ONE ad at the start of each game, and allows you to mute the sound "once" for all future ads. It\'s simple to click the ad off before the game commences. *wink* The background is lovely and the graphics are wonderful! So relaxing. The happy little "card dance" animation after each win is nice, as well. Thank You!',
       'I agree with other comments the ads are awful I\'ve tried several of these type games and all are to much ads .. But this one i seem to have higher scores than with the other ones.. It\'s a great pass time and over all a better choice',
       'I grew up with all I had to do so day long was teach myself how to play Solitaire.  It\'s not like I didn\'t have friends but was bored with the ones I had to play with.  I think the game is very realistic.  And completely challenging.',

I\'m very excited to see how creative they are in terms of creating new cards. Also, please add a form of convoy that travels on the water, and maybe even add dark troops only found in dark chests. Just some ideas. Keep up the great work!',
       'Awesome Game!!! I have played a lot of strategic games where we have to attack to get resources but here it is totally different...opposite of coc, boom beach e.t.c... And the interesting thing is upgrading anything does not take time... Loved this game... Appreciate it guys😁😁',
       'This is about as perfect a game I\'ve seen in a very long time.  There isn\'t an overwhelming feeling of developer greed here with ads constantly interrupting the game experience.  The game is polished, smooth, and not too hard on the battery.  I\'ve always wondered what a PVP TD would be like, and it\'s awesome!  This is definitely a developer to watch!',
       'Game is not loading. Installed it agreed to everything still game wouldn\'t load and get stuck at 30% and then show can\'t connect to server. My net is fine and decent speed.  Still I would like to know why do you need to see my emails ? What do you want out of my emails ? Get out of emails.',
       'I really like the game and the gameplay but I hope you\'ll take my suggestion. I hope that we could earn gokd by also attacking other players and not just cargoes. It seemed pointless sometimes if we cant do so. Or perhaps sell some of the cargoes that we looted from other players in xchange for gold. But all in all it\'s a decent game',
       'It\'s highly entertaining! Not very much down time, no stupid energy bars, you can spend money if u want 2, but don\'t. All in all this is a cool little game! Thanks devs.' ,

My kids enjoy playing the game as well I think it\'s much better than boring football. This game is good for hands and eyes cor_dination as well.',
       'Need to fix......I\'ve beaten every level up to 35 on regular hard and crazy but it glitches while loading level 36 and won\'t play. Plus I\'m fully upgraded and when I have my best ship with my best side kicks all the bullets make the game go crazy glitch and screw up. Please fix for a 5 star.....if not I\'ll change to a 1 star and uninstal. Thanks  They never fixed it. Don\'t bother if you want a game you can complete! Last five levels will not load. So hurting! And best sidekick glitches game play too badly for play at all! 😠😠😠',

      'I like it a lot but I hate how the drawings are so linked with pokemon go. I hate pokemon go!!!!! The graphics are okay but I wish they were a bit better quality. It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn\'t like how easy the drawings were and I don\'t think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn\'t recommend this game if you don\'t like colouring. It\'s ok!!!!',
       'I love this app! It\'s sooo good. And its brilliant for when your bored. But its a little hard sometimes to go over the lines with our fingers as the lines are so thin. But overall I think it\'s a fantastic app!',
       'I think there should be more cartoons to draw and color. And it should not always be right colors to trace it in. Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn\'t color the whole background, because what if you didn\'t want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!',
       'It\'s a great app however it keeps crashing and I have to start the drawing all over again. The whole app stops and my drawing starts over and it\'s really annoying. If this gets fixed I will definitely rate 5 stars',
       'I love this game but i don\'t like the characters tho .but it\'s fine . I like the way you can colour it in and then do the glow pen around it and at the end it looks amazing . You just colour and then press the pencil button ontop of the rubber in the pictures right bottom corner and then do the glow pen thing . Some people may don\'t know so that\'s why they don\'t like it . It\'s good when your travelling or when your bored . O THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!I like it',
       'Well the animals are cute and the drawings are cute, but I thought you could use the rainbow color like in the picture,but you can\'t😢you should still get this app and definitely of you like drawing. It\'s still fun though!😆' ,

      'Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can\'t play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.',
       'Brilliant game. I\'ve played this longer than any other free game. You can pay if you want to but it\'s not necessary at all if you join a good guild. The tutorial could be better though, some things aren\'t explained at all e.g. how to awaken characters. But apart from that it\'s really good!',
       'Greed leads to downfall. If you dont like to pay to win, this is NOT the game to play. Not to mention, the customer service is absolute garbage.',
       'All I hate about it..... it is costing me lots of hours of sleep, its EXTREMELY addictive. Thanx to the developers, this is the first game I reallllllly enjoy. Keep the GvG and PvP coming',
       'I love it so much, seriously, this is so much fun! And it\'s one of the only games I\'ve downloaded because of an advertisement and the game was ACTUALLY as fun as the mini ad. No false advertising here!',
       'Love the combination of a upgradeable card match three, but with an added diagonal, multiple move counter, and addition onto the original 3 match gem system.  Amazing, thank you Lord Zazen Egrega' ,

This game says it isn\'t looking for personal data but it is. It\'s not safe and it wants to learn more about people. I don\'t trust this game! Also if someone mentions \'Dr.Wallace" ask them who it is and then you will see what I mean.',

      'Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)',
       'I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn\'t have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it\'s Definitely Not a game you\'d wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!',
       'Overall....Great Game, but with Controls of Shooting & Moving around....It\'s Not Exactly Easy to Around. And when it comes to Movement just in General....my Main Problem, But NOT the Only Problem was the Movement in Exactness of where I\'m Trying to Move my Guy (My/the Shooter) just Stinks!! - The Game itself....I Love It!!!',
       'Too many ads. I just downloaded n was very happy to check this out but first thing that came on my screen was advertisement. It\'s sad that even after so many feedbacks given for excessive advertisements still developers are running with it. I\'m uninstalling this game n not recommending anyone to try it unless you want to watch commercials',
       'Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout',
       'Great game.... but difficult for controle on himeself during shooting  you can get killed during shooting by enemies if you will not move to and fro...' ,

      'I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance',
       'Great simple game with AMAZING colours❤ I love this...dead simple and fun. It took me ages to work out how to unlock the new skins...click on the banner that has the amount of diamonds you\'ve collected and what looks like 3 sheets on top of one another  (it comes up before you press the start key...)',
       'A Great Game For When You\'re Dumpin\'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin\' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I\'m in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren\'t too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I\'m happy to say that. I don\'t like to stay too long. Great game!',
       'So,  basically it\'s a pretty fun app to play when you\'re bored. It\'s a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It\'s a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don\'t really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!',
       'Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn\'t have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic.',
       'Good, with a major flaw I\'ve ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I\'ll tap, and the game won\'t register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I\'m on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I\'ve closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It\'s an issue I\'d like to see fixed.' ,

      'A very fun and addictive game. I make bows all day, but it\'s nice to be able to shoot from my couch at night.  The influence of wind on the arrow is accurate when it comes to drift. A little costly on the upgrades for those that don\'t buy their way to the top, but all games are that way.',
       'Ok game, but bingo mode is a huge pain.  My shots filled out the opponent\'s card better than mine.  Stupid way to lose a lot of progress/coins.',
       'Game was fine. Lately, keeps freezing and somehow opponents are getting 10\'s when I CLEARLY see them hitting nowhere near the middle. Matches are freezing while i\'m ahead, then match ends and says I lost. Somehow i\'ve lost 20 million coins, and not from legit losing either. I also just played a match for 1 million coins, i had over 1 million in the bank. I know sonehow have 0 after I clearly won the match but it said I lost. Either people are using cheats or the game is not functioning properly',

Want to take a break from your mind numbing job? This is equally mind numbing....but hey, play on your bosses time. When you see a picture you can\'t figure out, lower your mental ability to where it makes an amoeba seem like Einstein......from there you will get every puzzle. Enjoy',
       'Ads, ads, and more annoying Ada that can only be removed by using "coin". While I have no issue paying for apps or occasional chunks of content, this was annoying AF. I also didn\'t find it particularly challenging.',
       'It\'s challenging to play and I let my 86 year old grandmother play it as well as my neice s as it\'s great in helping keeping the brain active and also they enjoy it when they guess right',
       'Enjoy having to use my brain to find answers.  Some clues a little off the mark but that is not uncommon in these type of games.',

      'It\'s kinda fun but it\'s definitely "pay to win".  Best gun wins hands down.  Every gun can be earned through play but it takes a while.  Guess the developers gotta get paid.  Also, tons of kill stealing.  All in all, not terrible.  Update after couple weeks:  It\'s been fun but now that I\'m in the top league it is all pay to win.  I can\'t earn cash and gold fast enough to buy competitive guns or level the one I have.  I also can\'t win gun fights with the weapons I have.  It\'s a shame that they set it up this way.',
       'I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn\'t have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn\'t get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren\'t vigilant of their customers and don\'t take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.',
       'I REALY LOVE this game but the only thing is that I\'m on level 10 and when ever I play in a battle and win I only get 200 gun bucks. PLZ can I have money transported to my account.My name is PRO_ADMIN.I would REALY HAPPY if you do😕.By the way this is also for my FAMILY and they would love it if you do ):  . I am only 10 and I know I\'m asking for you to do a big thing but my family would really be happy😊.My brother\'s acount is PROGAMER and he is only 6. PLZ if you don\'t reply or do something then it\'s ok ):  .',
       'Game is really tooo gud, graphics also nice n smooth controls but u guys released only one game mode(Team death match), but in lot of fps games they provided free for all, bomb mode, Flag capture n many more modes.. If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games 😀 n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area.',
       'The best shooting game ever. Lobed each and every single thing about this game but there a little suggestion that we can see the player if they are online or not but how is this if we can see there live going on matches? That concept will be great and games lag sometimes so if you can fix this and add my suggestion in guns of boom that will be hell great!! #the best game',
       'Great game with a lot of potential.... There can be so many more additions to make this fps better. More grenade varieties? A spectator mode? Clan levels that allow more players to join when we reacher higher levels? Gun balancing changes? I feel like the Cerberus should be buffed. It is expensive, and the 3 shots at once doesn\'t allow for many attempts for kills. Adventure mode for more gunbucks? Death match option? Allowing us to pick the map? I understand the game is fairly new, so keep on adding changes and new improvements. Thanks for listening!' ,

      'If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It\'s by far the best maze game app I\'ve come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I\'ve tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It\'s the only maze puzzle app I\'ve found worth playing! 😀💜',
       'Time killer. B&W colors are a bit hard on the eyes after awhile. I wish the controls weren\'t so touchy. Even if I\'m using my stylus it\'s easy to move into a wrong corner by accident when you know it\'s not the right direction.',
       'I\'m not far into it, but it\'s fun so far. My eyesight could be why it\'s not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It\'s still a very good game though.',
       'I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven\'t played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I\'ll have to download a separate kid version for her.',
       '5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes',
       'Where is the challenge? This game is as lame as the rest of the maze games. If you would  try make the game more challenging then maybe I would not have deleted it.' ,

      'łnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (MINA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. VEarn points equals mac instead of like some of the others where it takes McEarn points to reach vac etc....Also, łnstaII \'TOYOPAY\' App Enterr (BCNB) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to Toyopay. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to WaIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'Every time i reach a new level it says I have unlocked a table but when I go to place the table in the restaurant it hasn\'t been unlocked!!! Y\'all ripping us off with these tables because it said unlocked at level 19 then I go to buy the table it say unlock at level 22 SMH I\'m on level 20 & I only got 10 tables... won\'t be spending no more money on this game!',
       'Right now there\'s an annoying glitch that says I skipped the video even after watching it. I have to watch about 5-10 videos to get one that will give me the reward. Please fix!!',
       'This game wants you to spend too much money. I\'ve seen other games like this have better deals for gems. It also takes forever for the food to cook. Gets boring really quick unless you have real money to spend..',
       'Don\'t get too serious about this game. If you miss the game just play,but if you hate waiting too long to get rare ingredients,prepare the dish or else. Just forget it and leave it for couple hours or maybe days....😀 That\'s simple!!',
       'The only thing I don\'t like is that chainsaws are very rare. How do I get them? I will rate 5 when you give more chainsaws, or at least a way to get them.' ,

      'I wish I could post pictures, but the game is too easy. I beat the first 2 levels both on one attempt. Though I am an experienced geometry dash player. But if I can beat a level first try, not knowing the course at all, that\'s some easy stuff. I highly recommend geometry dash sub zero though.',
       'Great fun but needs more levels. I laughed when I saw a review made by an idiot because he said this was a copy of the Impossible Game LOL it\'s the other way around, dumbass.',
       'THIS GAME IS AWESOME PLZ MAKE THE COMING SOON Levels Music kind of more like the seven seas music THANKS and also I rated 5 stars on every thing on this game and P.S. could you please make the coming soon levels more faster dear fellows, thanks',
       'I love every Geometry Dash version! And this one might be the best. But my only downfall is that the music, which is freaking awesome,gets ahead of the actual gameplay and I miss my jumps. Plz fix and I\'ll rate 5 stars! But keep up the good work!',
       'I think this game is going to change your life once you start is going to test you all you know you need to be focused to pass the whole entire thing and make sure you try to get all the coins good luck out there and may the best guy win or woman',
       'Incredible as always. Level design is amazing and the graphics are spot on. However, controls are wanky on mobile and makes a few techniques way harder than they should be. There also should have been more levels.' ,

      'I love Beat the Boss 4! But there are some things that I would like to be fixed. For example, when naming your custom boss, the name duplicates. The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can\'t go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.',
       'I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i\'m asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting',
       'I\'d happily purchase this game but that doesn\'t seem like an option. Tge ads, especially the LOUD BLOW UP EXPLOSIONS game that go on for 30 seconds are especially annoying. I\'ll gladly buy it, if only to not deal with Fing ads all the Fing time!!',
       'Too many ads. It\'s annoying especially when you are connected to the internet. The King Boss is not working and is always saying "Something went wrong, please try again later" and crashes the whole gane. On the other hand it\'s a super addictive and fun game to play.',
       'Game is now unplayable due to ads and KIIP rewards popups. The ads bring up my status bar so I can\'t X out of the ad, and the app hangs when trying to load the KIIP program. I have no interest in trying to play something that shovels ads in your face more often than you can actually play.',
       'Recent updates have made this guy unplayable. Now you have to wait  through a 24 second ad that keeps reoccurring.  Not fun for kids and worse for their parents. Kids loved it before these updates.' ,

      'Pretty good design, but there is a cheater mode which tells you when one is wrong even if it\'s not apparent. So the fastest times are always really fast even for the hard ones. Also the ad bar is right below the numbers so you accidentally hit it when you play. Pretty sure that\'s intentional to get extra clicks, but super annoying.',
       'having lots of fun with the game, especially the daily challenges. But  ads that cannot be skipped pops up way too often, and its quite irritating. Also it would b good if u can ad d something like automatically mark (diff cotour, shade out) the numbers thats already been fully filled so we dont have to check it manually.',
       'The game in itself isn\'t bad but I\'ve completed a puzzle in 10 minutes and for the past half an hour I don\'t know what to do next, does it pop up on the screen \'You have finished\' or do we just move on? I\'ve been looking for any place that I\'ve gone wrong but I haven\'t found any',
       'My wife and I play this game like an old couple as we wait for our son to sleep, sure enough - we all doze off!  This game makes the brain go, sometimes my brain goes so hard that smoke comes out my ears.  Beautiful. Thank you for the gift of this game, we\'ve shared about the light it brings into our lives.   That\'s a good ending.',
       'Really functional sudoku app with a great UI and some nice features. My one issue is the hint button.  I tap it way too often by accident and it permanently reveals a tile, which kind of spoils the puzzle. Otherwise it\'s great',
       'Ads were distracting, especially for the 30 second Angry Birds app, so I just bought the game to skip the ads. Only 3 bucks, I think. Gameplay helps in solving the puzzles.' ,

      'Lemme just say ketchapp your games are soooo good!! And addictive including this one it\'s fun and ever since the first play I\'ve been hooked there are barely any adds and the graphics are phenomenal. I play it all the time plz don\'t change this, if u do your going to loose my five stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟.',
       'Most of my apps are from Ketchapp. Their creativity and style of games have just been wanting me to download more and more! Right now, Ketchapp is one of my most favourite game groups ever! Keep making more! I don\'t have any improvements, which means that their games are top notch!',
       'Patheitc. Being such a fast paced game you cannot have the blocks starting to move a split second before you\'re going to pass it. Makes the game pretty impossible from the first level. For something that was supposed to be fun, is more frustrating. You need severe luck on your side to get a win. Recommended do not download',
       'Its a good concept, but you need to update it, and make sure the blocks no longer move. Right now, it is by far the most luck based skill game. It is impossible to dodge the moving blocks, so if they are to move, they should move much slower',
       'Good, but difficulty is a bit tough. Unless I was a Jedi, it feels like I\'m starting on what should be a hard level. The AI is way too slow as well. I wish you could could change the color of your ball and race online with others in real time.',
       'I think it is a great way for amiee to get design for her Xbox 360 and help her get over with her anger with her sister and to help her to figure out what\'s the matter but what is the most important thing is to be a fantastic family together but why are we so lonely.... Well i think it is a great opportunity to make new friends to life' ,

I enjoy it so much, to help the creator I spend a few bucks now and then. It\'s one of the few games I actually play. Just wish there was actual racing. Or if you could have police chasing you, rather than being the police. Either way, good game. Those would be great to implement. 😁',
       'THIS GAME IS OVERPOWERD I\'ve been finding a game that is  A Leagend Car game. Then i found this cool game and  I PLAYED IT ALOT. But not forever.   🎵THE STORY🎵  When i\'ve played it i saw a !alarm At the gifts then i liked you at facebook Then i subscribed you on youtube  And i liked you at twitter too. Then theres a free luckybucy thing. The free watch and then you will have $500.THANK YOU FOR THE GAME',
       'This game is getting boring. Yah, Next Generation Endless Racing blahblah. But is this all about endless whatever? I think you must put some thrill to this game. This is nothing compared to Traffic Rider which is you also create that game (Yeah. Traffic Rider is one of my fav game.) I HOPE YOU PUT SOMETHING THRILLING LIKE MISSIONS *NOT DAILY MISSION* AND PUT SOME CAR NAMES IN IT. ONE MORE HOPE YOU MAKE THE CARS IN TRAFFIC MORE REALISTIC IT LOOKS LIKE A MOVING BOX... AND I WANT SOME FEEDBACK.',
       'Hello, 😊 I really love this game, my favourite actually! I have play a lot of games, but this one is the best so far! PS.:I never spent real money on games! But in this game you don\'t really have to, so it\'s even better for me and for people who can\'t spend real money in virtual things. I know that there are 1 or 2 cars in the game that you can only buy with real money, but it still is a perfect game in my opinion! 😉',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a long time on a couple devices and it\'s been a lot of fun. There seems to be some variations in scale of one compact car to another. The models themselves don\'t quite seem to be in scale to each other. You might have two hatch backs that should both be small, even very near in size but when you\'re looking at cars to buy you can tell that the model itself just isn\'t quite the right size compared to other similar cars, and then when you get out on the road with it, it looks bigger than it should compared to other vehicles on the road around it. But.. That\'s not too big of a deal. Great game!',
       'Just started playing, so far game seems fun and realistic! The vehicles look real and even use their blinkers and when you honk at the vehicle in front of you, not only do your headlights flash, but it a will actually move out of the way. And it\'s realistic in the fact that you have A..holes that will cut you off just like in the real world! Lol. I also like the fact that if you have minor fender benders the game doesn\'t stop and start over it keeps going. Just wish it had better music, like some good jammin\' driving tunes. 😎' ,

      'I really enjoy this game, but I have found a flaw in the design. The game speeds up as you go and after a point it doesn\'t go faster, but after around 10,000 you notice the ball start to move forward on the screen and after about 20,000 you don\'t even have to move the ball to not die. It just misses the spikes. I know you might be thinking Its not on the leaderboards, but that\'s my next complaint. Im currently 6 on the leaderboards, but I\'ve gotten a better score and it won\'t update. I quite frankly destroyed that score and it doesn\'t show up. Thank you for your time and I hope this helped',
       'Game is great, far too many ads, after each level AND major issues with the videos giving rewards. I watched 4 and only received 1 reward which makes the game unfair and not worth playing.',
       'I HATE the vibration when u die I almost uninstalled the app bcuz of that. I also have a problem with pop up ads. I really like the game though',
       'I think the game is good but the pop up ads make it almost impossible to play as when ever you about to start a new level pop up ads and some where even in the middle of the game and it happens to a lot of their games',
       'Fun game, but occasionally an ad will pop up while I\'m playing, causing me to mess up and die. I was having a really great run when an ad popped up. Not cool.',

      'I know a lot of people seem to not like this game but I actually really enjoy it the only thing I don\'t like is the lack of sound.   It would be nice if there was background music of some kind and a glass breaking sound effect when you went through each barrier something pleasing to the ears  Oh and shorter ads would also probably be good.  It could also use more roads and balls and barriers to work towards. I feel like this game has a lot of potential though hope it keeps being updated.',
       'This is a very addictive game. I don\'t understand why people don\'t like it. Fast paced. As for the adds, you people should turn your internet off and play. It will help.. ##VOODOO## Would you accept a video from me? You can use it for advertising purposes. I thought it might be of great help for you.  Please get back to me by replying. I would be happy to email the video to you..',
       'The game is fine. But OMG the ads....they make you watch an ad every few seconds until you pay for the premium version. This is just sick. I mean games do have ads but the number of ads in this game are unbearable. Very frustrating . So if you are looking for a free game THIS IS NOT IT.',
       'Maybe you could add coins, for example each gate you go through could +1 Coin and you need like 290 Coins to upgrade your airtime by a few seconds or milliseconds, although the sound is not very good due to no sound at all. Very good game although!',
       'Hey Developer! This is Great Job!. But, if there are other players who have the disease "Afraid of Heights", this game will not be suitable for him. You make players Cringe (Afraid), because there is no music. This game like a Dark Theme Games.',
       'The game is very enjoyable, and it\'s pleasing to the eyes. I like that you can fall off course and redeem yourself if you make it back within 5 seconds. The ads are pretty excessive though. I\'m all for supporting a free to play game with advertisements, and at first I didn\'t have a problem with the ads. You get an advertisement after every game but they\'re often just picture ads or skippable after 5 seconds. I draw the line when you go e me an ad after every game and there are 30 second ads that you\'re forced to watch. If you\'re going to make me watch an ad give me an ad every 3 to 5 games at least.' ,

       'Very fun, I love it In this game you can choose your players, Tom or Angela. Then you can ride and you try to get as far as you can throughout the obstacles and challenges. You also try to collect stars along the way. However many stars you collect determines your score. This app will keep your scores and will let you know if you get a high score. When you run into something you have the option to keep going if you watch an advertisement. This app is not boring at all. It works great and doesn\'t take up much space.',

      'After a week of play , I am getting to attack smaller cities , KILL KILL,  grate time filler,  some sexier clothing options for the (ladies) would be nice,  lots to do and manage, clans mates are important, so chose wisely. I am enjoying this immensely.  Edit after (time seems like forever,)  I am really enjoying this,  Negotiated a couple of Peace Treaties, built my crew and strength, I am getting to be a force to reckon with... But there are still bigger fish, frustrating  Would love a feature to hunt the attacker, but then that would backfire too,   Great game...lots of challenges and opportunities for growth,  Highly recommended   *****',
       'So many players have reported on one player that keep spamming the city.  Just because he cant take it when his city got burned .  Check ur report n banned him from playing. Or many others player will start quitting.',
       'It\'s your standard "GOW" clone with a Godfather ripoff motif.  You know the formula: spend money, build fast, get stomped by the kiddies with access to daddy\'s credit card who spend thousands of $$$.    Guaranteed to trigger the easily offended due to scantily clad women.  Hilariously bad "Engrish" text throughout the game.    Just get your currency for whatever other game it is you play as fast as possible and move on.',
       'I think this could possibly be the worst game for GM support ever. If you need help after paying, Don\'t worry someone with broken English will appear, answer a different question then leave. Mind blowingly stupid.',
       'Newbie dont play this game. It\'s was fun at first then you follow the instructions as normal. But at the end of the day you will get stuck and you will run out of supplies.. Their idea is to make you buy.',
       'Nice game. I just thought that the Babe game part should be a bit more easier and less difficult coz its hard to score the chicks when your way up to level 11 and getting to the yatch. But the rest of the gameplay is fun and challenging. Overall... its a Good Fun Game. Awesome.' ,

      'Can one also be able yo take turns??  I dont like it straight all the way to nowere. And brake should be fully efective one should STOP anytime he wants and also dont sale cars it should just be affordable by coins  Its really a gr8 game but only a little more work.',
       'Ok..but needs work No challenge n no real upgrade kinda wasting my time. And what\'s up with this buying the last car, there\'s no horn and way to keep the player interested that is why give it only three stars now if you fix it maybe I\'ll give give stars😶😴😴😴',
       'Spin my ride No more speed, I\'m almost there! Gotta keep cool, now gotta take care. Last car to pass, here I go! As the line of cars are going so slow! 5 star rad! Gotta get back to the game, all. See ya....Speed thrills!',
       'The game itself is very fun to play and very entertaining, however, the points system is a bit off. The reason for that is it not about the distant (which I like about) it about how many overtake you can take in a single game. That is what I dislike about this game. Also the cars... Not a lot of cars (need more). Few questions: Will there be such thing as upgrade speed or car customization? Will there be special event like special map that the highest rank get some kind of reward? And lastly will there be a competition of ranking ?  If all the that happening in the future this game definitely deserved 5 stars .',
       'Basic. You have to over take cars... That\'s it. When they talk about the physics being like simulation they are lieing. Left right go stop. Poor 16bit sound that you will want to turn off. It\'s like a game from the 80s. Uninstall.',
       'The game is very good but I really wish if the score is for the overtakes as well as the high speed that will be a lot better. I swear this game will blow up if you just added the high speed score. Also, I wish if there were more cars. That would be really interesting. I really hope that you listen to me' ,

      'The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I\'d like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.',
       'Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It\'s very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again',
       'The more stuff is added the lagier it gets. Game freezes when buying items, when going over your city, with the chat, loading the flobsl trade, travelling to other cities and basicly everything nowadays. Requires multiple restarts of the game and reboots of my phone regularly to keep jt playable nowadays. It used to be really good and smooth, but it only gets worse each update and no improvement in sight. I only play now because I made some good friends in my club, but the actual fun is long gone. :(',

       'Simply the BEST city building & city management game on the PlayStore.  It\'s great fun and many things to build and do.. Weekly events to keep you occupied. City management so you need to actually think before you do.

      'Such a bad game. Nekki never gets enough of money so they show ads nearly after every fight. You can\'t earn gems from watching videos as it\'s never available. Tapjoy offers have been completed, but never awarded. All the weapons gets worser as you level up. Nekki wants you to BUY the good weapons. Bad game. Shadow fight 3 is worser than this one.',
       'Challenges ruin the experience. Mandatory in order to progress and level up. Some challenges are just ridiculous, and frustrating when you\'re given five tries and having to watch a thirty second ad to get one back every time, even if you make a simple mistake. Other than that it\'s good.',
       'The AI spam SO much! All they do is throw a suriken at you till you die. They won\'t even let you get up! 2 hits and I die yet I hit them like 10 times! There should be unlimited energy who wants to spend $20 for unlimited energy. Plus the controls are trash.',
       'This is a fun action game! I\'m so addicted to it right now and I\'m completely hooked into the game\'s story. The fight animation is just brilliant, unique moves based on real martial arts, fighting styles that vary with each weapon, beautiful background locations, exciting music! It\'s perfect!',
       'Let me just say I don\'t mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high',
       'As much as I like this game, the final boss is unnecessarily difficult. Seriously, what were you thinking when you came up with it? And the game crashes more than I\'d like. But the game is really well done! Flaws and all, it worked out well. Nicely done.' ,

      'I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.',
       'LOVE this game!! Literally, I don\'t think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it\'s just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜',
       'A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it\'s really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it.',
       'This game apparently needs more graphics power than my tablet has. Every time i start to draw, there is a two to three second delay before the line starts moving. The game will lock up momentarily, then skip to where i am in the drawing, leaving out large sections of my solution. And of course, when the game skips ahead, the timer does too. Not a good thing to have happen in a game where every tenth of a second matters.',
       'this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates',
       'The game is addictive. Mediocre ratings are because there is a bug. On all games on all levels I\'m getting a network error and I\'m not connected to a network viewing a hint. I have been connected to numerous networks and reset the phone. This needs to be sorted.' ,

      'I like the game but there is a bug in it.. i have 420 diamonds and i went to the store and there was a button to get 45 more and watch the video so i did and nothing happens. Additional to that i saw therr locked 200 diamonds i clicked one of that and all my 420 diamonds gone and onlu 220 diamonds left and its showing me 2 big circle white and pink.. that\'s not fair....',
       'Found a game called "Infinite Balls" on my friend\'s iPhone, we loved it. This is the best Android alternative we could find, but it\'s not quite as satisfying. Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls. Would be nice to turn off the help lines, too.',
       'Super fun and addicting, the beginning levels are pretty easy but they get to be rather challenging after a while!  The only thing I don\'t like is the frequency of the ads.  Game itself is great though.',
       'Would be good but the most annoying part is if you fail and you get the prompt to watch an ad to continue and you just want to restart it makes you watch a full bloody ad anyway. So whats the point of not continuing. Rubbish concept.',
       'I found a bug. If u are playing offline and game is over, you choose to watch video ad while internet is off, it gives u the life anyways. Without watching ad. May b your developera forgot to call the reward video function on that UI\'s onclick () 😂. Overall a nice gameplay',

      'A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it\'s a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you\'ve done them and reached level 10 on both, there\'s really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.',
       'The game itself is awesome, really awesome. But my god, there is too many ads, It is okay to have ads in a free game, I totally understand, the dev has worked to build a game so it is fair to receive money back for the work.  But here there are too many ads, there is ad in game, there is ad when you lose a match and there are the famous win coins for watching a video.  Couldn\'t find an option to buy the game and remove the ads, hope the developer improve this, because the is really awesome...',
       'Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I\'ve basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I\'ve got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.',
       'Be cool if there is boosts. Example if you get 3 perfect you get a free auto perfect boost or something. Also plz add a line of code to stop people from the date/time bug abuse - save current time to file. Player won\'t get money till that last input time has passed.  Also be cool to spend the coins on boosts',
       'Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot\'s more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn\'t bother me that much. 5 stars for the team',
       'It\'s a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the \'colony\' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you' ,

       'I really like the game. I got hooked on it. I didn\'t like that I had to pay to unlock the other levels especially since the game was so short. I passed every level within 3hrs. It was daeasy and fadt. Wish there were more levels. To unlock the levels it was kind of expensive.',
       'You should be able to earn what it takes to up grade.. You don\'t get very far in the game to even see if you really like it.. Your just stuck',
       'I love this game I love this game and I\'m a boy wow this is so cool like there\'s no like ads and it\'s crazy how it is like you can make lots of treats and you can tell the customers to come up and get their traits and the love it I\'m sure can tell them to come get the tree and they\'re really loud seriously they\'ll be the best traits that ever tasted',
       'This game is really awesome. I would have given it 5 stars. But it includes app purchases and you need to pay for upgrading. That thing I really didn\'t like. Thus I have given it 3 stars',
       'If the other people said that they hated it I\'m just going to say I love it because its a fun game I just whished that I did not have to pay to get a new car for the bumppy road' ,

      'I really like this one. Sometimes the game cheats. But since the last update that seems to be happening less. Update: What happened to my premium clothes? The game changed my look!!! Update: I like the update. Need easier way to get skills. Suggestion: get skills during game play, not just in bags.',
       'Fix the bugs.  everytime is messes up in the middle of a game I have lost the money that I bet.  I want my money back too.  Also that one on one is garbage.  Take it off the game.  I cant pass the 50 level in carrer because I dont want to play one one one and I just losr 25000 again because of your bugs.',
       'Fun game. But constantly asking me to buy something is annoying. Also, good graphics but control are not good enough. It malfunction, player with bad connection has advantage and wins game and money. That\'s problematic.',
       'The new bags won after a win are meant to get you to spend real money to open them up quicker by using gold. It\'s so obvious a money grab for mini games, it\'s sad. Also, the more real money you pay to get a better in game basketball, the more skills you\'ll have to beat anyone. That\'s why so many people scream about cheaters. There aren\'t any cheaters, just those who paid real money to pad the pockets of miniclip and make the game a true pay-to-win clustermuck.',
       'I effing hate the new ways, they just made me pay 25,000 to upgrade my ball when it used to be 2 gs. But other than that this game is badasss',
       'Well... sometimes when I play some people I think mite be hacking the game or cheating. they don\'t miss one shot and I make none or sometimes one or two, that is the only down side but other than that it\'s a good game (suggesten have people by gold or game coins with the money in the game)' ,

      'This game is perfect for anyone who loves magic, fantasy, collecting, and a whole new level of adorable! Dragonvale takes everything to the next level! I highly recommend it, as it is a amazing game, my most played, and I hope everyone else enjoys it just as much as I do. Five stars! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Edit 2: I was re-organizing my islands by Element the other day, and I had just finished the Plant Island. I put down a Oversized Oak Tree, and immediately, a image flashed through my mind: a young girl, sitting on a branch of the oak tree, a book in one hand, a baby Plant dragon sitting next to her. Stretched out in front of them was my Plant Island, the dragons freely soaring, the other islands in the distance. And that sparked a inspiration in my head. I just wanted to ask; can I write a Dragonvale book, which takes place at my park? Please let me know !  :)',
       'Cmon Backflip! Okay look I love Dragonvale, I\'ve been playing it forever. First off I lost my amazing park a while back and that really sucked. But now I am restarting and I go to buy the beginners pack for 9.99 and it says there was an error and i wont be charged...come to find out it did charge me and i didnt receive anything! Please help',
       'I have been playing for a while. After events you get a day to turn in your event specific currency for the prizes, even though the event has ended. Well for Gardenia\'s event, it turned in all my roses before I could exchange them. I had over 25,000 and was so pumped to get the new dragons. Now I don\'t have any roses and 25,000,000 extra coins i don\'t need. Please help. This is a very frustrating bug.',
       'I really love collecting all of the dragons and the fact that you can theme/decorate your park too. But the amount of types of decorations are unbalanced, the majority that you can currently buy in the market are just plant and earth type while there are very few decorations of the other types (such as air, cold, etc).',
       'When I first had it it was super fun. Then I saw a game I wanted so I deleted it I did that before and got it back I could log into facebook and go to my old island. But this time I could not. I was so far and looking forward to seeimg my dragons but it did not let me go to my old island. It left me im tears that I had to do what I did all over again. So I deleted this stupid game and gave this. If I could rate 0 I would',
       'its ok, and you might think you cant li e without it, but trust me.... after a while year of playing, which is what i have waited to wrote this review, the game play becomes very repetitive. sure try it out, its fun, but not something for the rest of your life. dont put money into it, you will regret ir later.' ,

      'Whenever I try to open the app the screen starts flashing black and it\'ll stay like that or keeping turning back to the screen I was on and off, which ends up somewhat strobe-like. The actual game itself is amazing despite having a hard time trying to beat the bacteria level but, what\'s the point of a good game concept, if the game won\'t work properly',
       'I thought the new scenario was a free-trial only like the simian flu. (At least you can unlock it after being a brutal pro at the game) I\'m gonna enjoy playing this a good few times and unlock even MORE scenarios. Keep up the good work! I wanted to make a suggestion, but I just can\'t remember now. Oh well...',
       'Fun game. I wish the rate of death was more consistent. 37,000,000 a day at one point, but waiting 6 months for 100,000 to die towards the end. The disease didn\'t change, the rate of death shouldn\'t decrease just because there are fewer people. Good game otherwise',
       'I didn\'t buy the new plague, i might need to. The first 2 difficulty settings are easy, the 3rd not so much. Good game to me! Just have to read what it is that you spend your DNA points on and you should do just fine',
       'Really annoying ads keep repeating and covering controls.  So annoying. Pity as game is unplayable like this. It never used to happen before. Why can\'t developer just charge for extra content rather than make game unplayable. Will have to remove.',
       'Awesome game! Very addicting! You can replay over and over and it doesn\'t get boring! Just keeps getting better!  There is no need to buy if you don\'t want to.... Just because you suck doesn\'t mean it isn\'t beatable... You shouldn\'t give low stars because it\'s a difficult game! It\'s very beatable without purchase!!!  5 stars!!!!  Just keep trying!  Evolve!' ,

       'Where is support? I have gem confirmation enabled but it\'s just taken 70 gems without warning. I\'ve also done extras to win gems but they haven\'t been added. There needs to be a cancel button like on food etc. Need to say time it will take to hatch eggs etc. When doing challenges it should say exactly what you need to do and spend so you aren\'t guessing. Besides these issues, I am really enjoying this game. It\'s easy and fun. I just wish you didn\'t need to spend so much to get further in the game.' ,

      'To many ads, even if they make the game free.. Pathetic. Conflicts with game when trying to back out of them and even crashes. Inconsistent game play, twitchy controls at times. Unplayable shots where one number on power scale is to hard the next one down is to soft.  Multi player has a feel of being rigged at times.  Potential for a good game but not yet in my books.',
       'Super fun game, but WAY TOO MANY crashes. I\'ve been struggling with a level several times only for the game to crash mid-level and I lose all my progress getting booted back to the beginning. Infuriating!',
       'Some observations: ball does not rebound off rails as they should, especially the back and side rails near the hole, where the ball hits the rail and stops dead. Part of miniature golf mastery is using the rails but not in this game. And when the ball is against a rail a shot is allowed as if the rail was not present. After a shot the screen should automatically rotate close to what the next shot would be expected so as to minimize manual rotation. I was making a long swipe to rotate almost 180° and my finger hit the power slide and an errant shot was made. Most hills are not smoothly sloped but instead very angular. Hitting the bottom of the slope causes the ball to jump in ways unanticipated rather than roll. This is golf, not basketball. I uninstalled the game because it just wasn\'t as fun and realistic as I had hoped.',

      'This is a great game and is challenging it definitely requires some focus and concentration. There is a bug that needs to be fixed it is on the gold game mode and it\'s the game that asks you to select which colours are more prominent out of all the squares but the coloured squares don\'t appear. Please fix this as soon as possible because I really enjoy this game.',
       'Very great game, I can pic some logic questions here and ask it on my friends ang classmates. It really gives me a brain exercise. Wheneve I feel bored, this game takes my bored away',
       'I really lived thus game because it isn\'t just tapping something but it\'s actually training your brand and improving your attention, memory, logic and your mind in general. If you need help in any of those subjects (or you just like a bit of fun ) I would dwfinately say this is the game for you.',
       'Simple but fun. These games are challenging and do make you use your brain without taking much time. You can play a few levels in just a few minutes easily. Ads are not too bad either, not too obtrusive and are sporadic enough.',
       'the memory mahjong doesn\'t work for me. even after I updated the app, the mahjong pieces do not flip when I\'m supposed to memorize them, they just disappear. and I don\'t want to reinstall the game, bc I don\'t want to lose my progress. I wish you could somehow fix it. thanks',
       'Fast game play,  you can train for a few minutes, or as hour, depending on what you have time for.  Auto saves your progress. Ads are not intrusive,  and can be skipped easily. The games do get a bit repetitive.' ,

      'Its a fun game, really, however in my opinion its too easy. I got 150 First try and 346  my second. and maybe consider adding things to unlock like different balls or hoops. other than that its a fun game to kill time',
       'The first time I played I easily got over 800, now I swear the game upped it\'s difficulty like crazy, I can\'t get past the 200s. Not sure if it\'s a bug, an Easter egg feature or what, or if it\'s because I completed challenges but I don\'t appreciate the inconsistency especially when playing against friends and I don\'t feel evenly matched :(',
       'I like the game and the idea of it, but the only problem I have with it, its the ads. Dear God there is a lot of ads, even when I\'m in the middle of a game, an ad pops up from the bottom. Just try to lower the amount of ads especially on the challenges, I hate to be asked and forced to watch an ad everytime I fail a challenge or complete it',
       'When I try to continue, the game after watching the ad, the game doesn\'t keep counting my score. The challenges are really hard, but fun. Good Game!!',
       'The problem is that every time it asks me if I would like to continue I say yes and then kicks me out of the game',
       'So many words but after u got all the  things there is nothing to do bar from play on it but it a  really good game love it soooooo much' ,

      'this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It\'s a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that\'s it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame',
       'I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.',
       'Great game, addictive, in a good way. This is one of the few games that is addictive, but does not take up a large amount of your day, unlike some game (Clash Royale), I feel it\'s not Pay to Win. Great job guys, thanks for making an entertaining, relaxing, non time consuming, free to play and win game. Graphics can be bested.',
       'Funny characters, endearing cartoon aesthetic and enjoyable game play, but after a couple hunts forces you to wait over 8 minutes before you can actually play again (in order to entice you to pay to make the wait times go away). What kind of game compels you to QUIT out of BOREDOM after playing it for 5 minutes?',
       'Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn\'t came in two years it probably isn\'t. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don\'t pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges.',
       'Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.' ,

      'Great game for its genre. However it desperately needs some events maybe a daily login bonus and some form of vip ladder. I like the nostalgic of the old game but I feel like the developers made the game and just walked away from it. Please for love of games add new stuff and throw some events to us who are almost maxed out. This happens and I\'m totally cool with a 5 star rating',
       'Pretty fun. But I don\'t think drivers or taxi drivers should drive like that, let alone be rewarded for hitting other cars like they do... Lol in the car it\'s cool but I wouldn\'t want to be physically in the game. It\'d hurt and be scary. Lol',
       'This is one of thee worse remakes of a classic I\'ve ever seen. To have a iconic game such as this and reduce it to a one tap game as oppose to actually driving and controlling the cab is ridiculous luckily it was free. So now I don\'t feel bad deleting it.',
       'Fun game, cool animations and graphics. Good music and sound effects. Can you help with diamonds and sell out features just a tad bit more. I enjoy the game. Awesome job developers and programmers. Nice twist on the classic crazy taxi game',
       'Great game, it\'s fun to play. Would rate it higher, but it often crashes when I\'m trying refuel or double my earnings by watching ads. Then the game restarts, and I can\'t refuel for awhile, or I list the bonus earnings. FRUSTRATING!!',
       'The game starts off really cool. At first I like the way the stunts are and the way you would have case only hit the camera with a vehicle. What gets really old is not being able to turn that off and happen to deal with it constantly with no way to turn it off. Unlocking drivers is annoying and takes forever. The in-game currency real money ratio is way disproportionate to what you actually get. It\'s a good game to play for a couple games but has no long-term fun' ,

      'I love this game. I truly do. That\'s why this hurts. With the Adam Warlock update, I knew I had to be ready to save up crystals, though I did intend to spend a few for new uniforms, but hiding the one for the update\'s protagonist behind 5.5k crystals is a new low, and you haven\'t even soothed the slap on our faces from the Ultimates\' update. I was prepared to buy a new subscription for crystals or bios, but not anymore.  Netmarble, I thought you better than this. You had a good, committed following, yet you abuse us like this.',
       'An amazingly, beautiful made Game, which is a true gem for Marvel fans. Hats off to you guys. I didn\'t thought that android platform will be that big in gaming areas. I am a Hardcore gamer and i know what gaming should look like...and that\'s what it looks like - Future Fight. I hope you guys will improve the game from time-to-time so that we can\'t get bored of it.',
       'Updates? Updating means improving something, you\'re just digging a bigger hole NM.. I used to spend £10 a month on this, now it\'s not even enough to unlock the new characters... Many of my free to play friends stopped playing, and I\'m 1 update of following them.. Just can\'t be bothered with the grind, and the other option is pumping money into it. That\'s not gonna happen anymore.',
       'Do not even download this game. It is an absolute scam. At one point it was a good game but you will quickly find all the good characters are locked behind thousands of dollars of paywall. Much of the game is based on RNG and so a lot of the resources you can actually grind for go up in smoke. If you don\'t already have this, stay away.',
       'Look I downloaded this game not too long after installation I expect to play the game then I was notified that I can\'t play offline no problem with that but my problem was downloading the update info which also cost 522.36 mb. All this should not b necessary I think it should be like this when downloading the game there should be an additional file which should be the update info.I feel it will be easy for those who are downloading this game (like me) to start the game instead of downloading "update info" before starting the game. And I hope make u of this advice because it will be beneficial for those who are downloading the game and for you.',
       'This game is fun and a great phone game. If you are looking for a game with leveling that will occupy time and love comic books this is the best. It has been plagued the last few updates with customer relation problems due to what has been viewed as cash grab maneuvers. The developers need to go back to what was making the game successful. The increasing of prices every few updates will destroy consumer confidence. I do feel that they listen to their customers and make adjustments accordingly.' ,

       'Love the concept but ads after every round? And to make it worse.. Bloody too blast ad 4 in a row. Lower  your ads, get rid of the too blast ad and I\'ll uprated 10 fold. Also you could make the game better with a timer ;)',
       'I really like this puzzle game! Ads aren\'t annoying because you can close them in 5 seconds and then reward you for watching with hints. Game play is engaging and addictive.',
       'Since the update on the game I can not get the ads to go away. You have to completely exit the game then go back into it in order to go to the next level. Little frustrating, aside from that I really enjoy the game itself.',
       'DO NOT INSTALL!! Way too many ads they expect you to sit through, the ads are way too long, even trying to skip them early takes way too long. Just a never ending commercial pretending to be an app. The developers only want money and ought to be ashamed of themselves for this ad bloated app.',
       'The update is not good. This is not working on oppo. When we trying to open this game. Mobile is hanging and It is automatically close. Before update there is no any problems' ,

      'Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.',
       'Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don\'t get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a "Create a Player" option under \'My Club\' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It\'d be so nice if you add that.',
       'I will love it if i can send players on loan and be paid some coins instead of directly selling them off. Also switching players for a few or no coins will be great. Since players like pogba likes changing his hairstyles, it will also be great to effect some changes in some players hairstyle. More leagues are needed, if possible, German,  Chinese, Nigerian and south African league. Lastly, commentators find it difficult to call the name of a created player, work on these and this game will be perfect.  Thanks',
       'This Game is what all soccer fans around the world have been waiting for. It is fun and easy to play once you master the controls. The graphics are exciting and the gameplay fantastic. However there are some things i would like the dream league team to improve.  Rate at which coins accumulate is way to slow for the games played. Reward players with a free secret player for every division completed. Make the game slightly more difficult and improve Goal keepers.  Include some legendary teams like invicibles in the Elite division challenges. Overall great game.',
       'Very good game. There are lots of players but Manuel Neuer is missing. Some extra things need to be done for this game to become the top football game. German Clubs and many clubs of other countries like those of Poland, Denmark, etc. are missing. If these clubs are added, then the game becomes complete. Hope this changes are done by the "First Touch" as fast as possible.',
       'Great game. Controls could seize to work at times (not very often though) but as a whole, it is a fantastic game. Quality graphics and game play. It would be nice if the game could auto-update(with internet connection) so teams could be updated and players could be at their current clubs e.g Coutinho (Barca), Alexis (Man utd ), Mkhritaryan(Arsenal)etc. Love this game' ,

I still like game though I just hope u add that',
       'UNINSTALED   Need alot of gold (money to get it) to finish special even its true...!!! you can\'t finished that even if don\'t have it. yes it\'s a MONEY MAKING GAME..!!! actually, it\'s pretty good game but you need to improve your server, it\'s fu**ng so long... need 5 minutes to enter the game. please even if  I got a good internet, still to long long time to enter the game. please​ fix it up.',
       'Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won\'t reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.',
       'The game starts off good in the first couple levels. But once you start getting to the faster cars, it becomes way harder to keep up with the cars PR points, to get to better races. Unless you spend real money to get the parts. One question I do have. Is about the blackridge rivals. Why put some one with a car at a way higher level against a person who\'s car isn\'t even close to the car at a high level, and one more thing... make the races longer. 20 seconds a race isn\'t fun at all. Thinking with the name "Need For Speed". You guys would of done a lot better. The only thing that I seem to like are the  graphics... But that\'s about it...',
       'Goog game, adddictive infact. But I don\'t understand the concept of PATANJALI adds. Whenever i choose to see adds to reduce the waiting time, you comeup with Patanjali adds of 10 and 20 seconds and the irritating part is the time doesn\'t gets reduced even after watching the whole add. Please fix this. When you say reduce wait time by watching add, you need to actually reduce the waiting time after the add instead of insisting to watch the add again and again.',
       'When I started playing this game I really enjoyed it. But now I realise that in order to progress, you MUST spend REAL money. I am a family man, with a wife and 6 children, I just wanted a game that I could play when kids are in bed and wife is in bath, I don\'t have cash to spend on games, the worst thing is the 7 Day events, you cannot beat them without spending money. Very disappointed. Good game but don\'t expect to progress very far if you don\'t want to spend money.' ,

      'First of all, clearly stolen from Google Chrome. Second of all, why waste time with the ads on the game if you could play it on no-wifi Chrome with no ads? Why even waste storage on your device? Don\'t bother!',
       'Can u make the Dino long jump if u long press the screen and quick jump if u press it quickly? it so hard to avoid obstacles in late game because the jump is too long and the obstacles going faster and faster . Sorry for my bad English, thanks.',
       'This game is a rip off. The original is on Google. When ur offline and you go to a visited page, this shows up. Don\'t download this and waste your time.',

      'I never had to pay a single cent for this game, and it\'s working out perfectly fine for me. Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don\'t like my non-responsive faction members and I\'m worried once I leave my faction I couldn\'t join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.',
       'This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn\'t make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!',
       'Do not pull for characters! Trust me. After a few pulls, it is a scam. Choice truly lacks in this game. 30.00 a pull? Omg !!! Not worth it!   I pulled 6 times in a row with no luck. If you want to enjoy this game, don\'t drop a dime. Be patient you get free characters that are better than your pulls.  This is the first game I ever played where you get scammed by characters.  They have a lot of work to do.  Wars last too long,  events don\'t give decent rewards for time you put in.  However, if you can be patient and accept free characters,  you will do ok.  ATTN: big con; you don\'t get characters you want. I.will edit this review on as I play from my experience in the game. Remember,  no one wants to play games with no choice',
       'The last update has caused it to have to load every few times I log in. It takes 4 to 5 minutes each time. Never had this problem before! Can\'t get past prestige rewards screen... I have uninstalled and reinstalled... not happy',
       'No one from the support team will respond. My game was unistalled and reinstall and I lost 2 years worth of data. Can\'t remember sync it and I know scopely can do it for me. I\'ve provided everything they need and still nothing via email or in-game support. Will change my rating if this is sorted',
       'I love the game it\'s really epic. But one thing that pisses me off is during the tournament for survival after completing a level with 3 stars there is this part where u have to claim tokens ND after claiming the game crashes  ND starts again. So could u please fix that would mean a lot.. otherwise I got no other problems' ,

    description: 'Last Battleground: Survival is a survival shooter game. Each match takes 40 players and puts them on a deserted island.

Players and teams will be ranked for the match in the order they are eliminated.The safe zone changes randomly in each match, providing players with a fresher, more intense experience each time.Remember, find a weapon and supplies as quickly as you can and then move to the island’s safe zone.This is not just a game, this is battle for survival!!!PLEASE NOTE!

      'Great game if you wanna run low graphics for a smoother gameplay on your phone. 40 instead of 100 is great for mobile games as well. Maybe make the controls a tad bit larger for default size. Otherwise really fun. Maybe add a first person mode? Unless I haven\'t found out how to haha. Great game. I seemed to like this one out of all the others tbh.',
       'Good game, but after the last update the game game is riddled with bugs and glitches, making the game next to unplayable. Will often come up with queue error and kick me from the game and the screen constantly freezes. I can move, but I can\'t pick anything up and my teammate position is also frozen. Pls fix or I will uninstall. Also, you got rid of the aim button which sucks. Was way better before the update. You\'ve ruined the game for me😭😭😭',
       'Well I love the potential. Has a lot of bugs. Dual or quad mode doesn\'t work and overall it takes too long to wait. I waited 10 minutes for quad and then it just stopped and put me back to choosing game modes. I think thi s game can be the best if it had more work put into it.',
       'I honestly liked the game better before the update. You got rid of the aim button, the game is full of glitches like taking damage inside the safe zone, and I get lagged out all the time even though I have a pretty good Wi-Fi connection. To be honest,  you kinda ruined the game.',
       'Good game. Takes a bit to get used to controlling but after a while it\'s OK. I think it has a great potential if devs will keep working on it. There are some minor glitches in graphics and gameplay which hopefully will get fixed over time but apart from that it\'s good game. And you could add voicechat. That would improve it  a lot. Keep up the good job.',
       'This game is good and very challenging but i dont like the new update. My overall Stats have stopped working and im still dyeing even when im in circle and the aim button needs to come back it is so hard to play without it.  But overall a good game it just needs a few adjustments.' ,

Also i dont like having to pay to get the thinks and to many thinks are whach a vidio to get the thinks it takes to long so i dont l0play it that often. I hope u understand what I\'m going through please fix the game up a bit 😄',
       'What a nice game coco made, love the pair mode. Amazing ice skating moves too. But what i don\'t see from the app picture is the holiday (Christmas) items in the game? Other than that, make more gamez of this...😄😉👍👌💙',
       'Very dissatisfied... I unlocked almost everything I could through watching videos yesterday, and I open the game today and NOTHING is unlocked! So EVERY time you close the game you have to start over? No thanks! Good bye! YOU SUCK with your ad ridden games! Will not be downloading another of yours!',
       'Ok lmy phone then I fell asleep guess what they did they put the game a start over then what!!! Nope I ilwill not play one of games I will play Roblox and Roblox good fame but I still have cocoa and the point is that I can\'t delete it bye bye Coco',
       'I like the game but the ads are annoying and i dont like the face rhat we actually have to buy stuff for the game and put real money into something we are probably going to delete within the same month we got it. I think its a waste of money but the game is good i guess.',
       'This is clearly a game for young girls around 9-13 years of age. What money will the developer make from 9-13 year olds with no job? Nothing, hence the ads! Makes sence to me! The game play is good for this age group. If you find it boring then you are probably too old for this game.' ,

Waiting for more mission but could not find any so now uninstalling it... Ya it is quite a fun to play but quite difficult to handle the controls if ur new to this kind of game...',
       'Major problems with the Rope Hero games. ALL OF THEM. First problem: Leaving the game at all shuts it down completely; any quests you may have been in the middle of, will be dropped. Second: By tapping any of their many ads, you leave the game. Which in turn, shuts it down, and whatever you were in the middle of. Third: there are far too many ads. Anything you do? There will be an ad. Fourth: There are major grammar problems in any speech within the game. This shows a great neglect during the creation of the game.',
       'It\'s fun but you should offer a paid version and Bluetooth controller support. If you did I\'d buy it but since I doubt this will happen I\'m uninstalling. Looks fun but too many ads and touch-screen controls for these games suck.' ,

      'I hate it! There is only three looks to do, and the make up! Literally you have to click on it a thousand times until you get the one you like. The cloths aren\'t that bad, but they can be a little more pretty. They should make it for boys and girls, so you can dress up boys, and maybe the boys can take a girl on a date so, they could get married and then they can have children but, it would be a life cycle! They would start out as babies and grow on and get married!!! Hope you like my feedback!! P.S. Plz update the game!!!',
       'I gave you 4/5 star\'s, if you make a second version then i will install it again and play it then make it 5/5 star\'s, if not i will move on to more dress up game\'s and other types of games',
       'Really! you could only do their makeup and dress them up! BORING! Hmmph!',
       'this is a good game. even if you only have three looks it is still fun to make up different looks each time you play. invent and try out new styles x',

      'Honestly I think it\'s amazing that they sell this game for free because it is one of the best games I\'ve ever played in my life. It doesn\'t take any internet and the animals in details so good and the graphics. If you\'re ever bored you should download this game and play it all the time.',
       'Sometimes it feels like the difficulty of the levels is way off. Levels labeled "hard" or "super hard" are many times much easier than standard levels. I do enjoy the amount of unlimited lives given, and the speed at which lives are replenished, however. Overall, a good time-passer',
       'Guys, you have a glitch that needs fixed. Side game (right now the ignite game) causes app to close every time. Also... Inserting the gold in the piggy bank takes way too long. Speeding up that process or allowing a skip feature would be nice.',
       'It\'s been at least 3 or 4 weeks since I\'ve been able to accept any lives given by friends. For a game that has so many downloads, developers sure have an issue addressing mad fixing it. I\'ve list roughly 100 lives to this issue. Please fix it!!!',
       'I adore this game. However, I have had 7 gold bars for over a year and every time I win a level that awards lots of gold bars the game tells me my bank is full... even though everything costs at least 9 gold bars. According to my math I should have over 100 bars. I would settle for two at this point.',
       'Highly addictive. I love this game but there is one fault that it doesn\'t allow your device to enter sleep mode. I have ruined 2 phone screens with burnt in images because of this. I would fall asleep playing the game and when I wake up it\'s still on the screen.  I also don\'t understand why the special games are not offered on the Facebook game.' ,

I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!',
       'Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don\'t like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option',
       'Great game, I totally love it. I don\'t mind the ad but I get annoyed of too many questions of Selena Gomez/Taylor Swift/Beyonce/Ariana Grande etc top hits. How about the legends..like David Bowie, Prince, Foo fighters, Guns n roses, Smashing pumpkins.. other than that, u all admins really rock!!  Edit: So I finally get questions like hits by David Bowie, Oasis..so cool. Well done fight list!! And they do consider our suggested answers!!❤❤❤',
       'It\'s fun. It\'s actually more informative that I thought it would be. It kind of opens up you mind and is an amazing pass time stimulate. However I feel it would be more beneficial in and educational sense if you had more of an opportunity to review the answer list through the app. It\'s actually something I look forward to when the round is over.  So you\'re not just learning something from what you and your challenger have contributed as far as answers, but the game itself has also done it\'s part. Other than that, totally awesome.',
       'Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it\'s good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can\'t take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren\'t recognised either. I\'d enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.',

      'It\'s like Cooking Mama from the Wii, but you don\'t have to be accurate at all. There are SO many ads. I mean... They send you an ad like every 30 seconds or so! It\'s a lot. Good game four a you get crowd I think I because it\'s not really a strategy cooking game where you have to time manage and things. It had a decorating feature that I think kids would enjoy. Also, with that feature, a tablet would be better. Or if on a mobile, a stylis.',
       'Nice game... everyone who love cooking should download it. But there is only one problem that the things which are the main are locked and we have to pay the real money or watch s 40 ad. For ex:- In the doll cake we don\'t have the doll so how are we going to bake it.Please fix this problem, otherwise the game is nice.',
       'At first, I was pleasantly suprised this came from TabTales. The lack of pay walls at the beginning is wonderful for their games. Though I\'m not very creative, the game demands it for making food. The graphics look great, gameplay is realistic. I was sad to see a paywal at the princess cake though. If you have 10 dollars and a young girl who loves to cook and bake, by all means buy it for her.',
       'This game is awesome!!!! It makes me go hungry every time I play it!!! The graphics are awesome and very realistic. I luv the fact that it is automatic so you don\'t have to waste your time in perfection... Please keep it automatic like this forever. P.S, for those who are worried about unlocking other stuff like the princess cake, etc. Well, don\'t be, you will get a chance to play it when you unlock the other new bakeries and when you also compete in the competitions.... 😉',
       'Most of the things r automatic so I rate it 3 or 4 stars. Pls guys pls,pls I want u to make it nonautomatic so that we can play it properly .that\'s all I want to say about this game and most and things are locked these r the two things which I did not like about this game. So guys pls make it properly. Then I will rate it 5 stars for sure. One of the best game I have ever played. Thank u so much',

      'Ok I get it but why do the army kill you for no reason? I like this game because you can do roleplay and I\'m a girl and there is girl skins which is amazing but can you start with a girl skin and a boy skin to be fair with the girls  Pls do these. Love your company :-) but can you add a roleplay mode that would be great DO MORE:-) but now on my new tablet it won\'t let me play it please fix that and reply',
       'Good. However, the apple versioned platform overwhelms us by many advantages: They can earn coins and cash quicker n easier. They get options on what currency they use to purchase things. They get to higher leagues easier. Their weapon description overpasses ours as ours literally gives us damage and capacity whereas theirs comes with fire rate, trait etc.',
       'I love this game but I have a couple of requests 1st. Could you add u YouTuber skin back like boy,girl,animal then YouTuber 2nd. Could you add a button that you can press that alows you to make your own custom paint job for any vehicle that would be amazing 3rd. Can you make and road that ends come back into the city at the other side example the road behind the hospital 4th. Could add like 5 houses around the city that you can go into 5th. More vehicles   If you agree with what I have sead in this comment like so the developer can see!',
       'I love this game. But for the next update, u should give each skin there own special ability. Like the flash and hulk skins. Give the flash super speed, give hulk super strength and etc. So that everyone can get a different type of advantage. Plz make this happen next update also make a goku skin. So u can turn super saiyan. And have other transformation. So can u plz have every skin to have different abilities that match the skin',
       'I have been playing the game for 6 or 5 years and it has been the best game i have played. So, i  think you have to make this game better in the next update.Here r my suggestions 1 make the graphics better. 2 day and night shift. 3police attacks bandit in adventure mode.4 add a clan.  I hope u will add these in the next update.Also too many players that hacked their health so plz fix it.Thx',
       'This Game Is Awesome Ilove It Somuch I could Play it With My friends Keep It Up I think That You Should Add some New Weapons Like Lightsaber And You Should Make The People Drive Cars .Why  Peoples Does Not Drive Car?. Well But thats not good make the people drive thanks Keep It Up.' ,

      'Downloaded this through another app (free golden eagles) where if you downloaded and played this game, and got castle to level 10 would be rewarded. Sent off request to support a number of times with proof and no reply, and after a week still no reward.   So if you are downloading this to get reward from another app don\'t bother as you won\'t get it',
       'Pure pay tto win. You will either pay or quit out of frustration. Build times are hilarious. Seriously, our Earth\'s sun will die before you max out your hero\'s knowledge or most any other knowledge.  The Stronghold is worthless and a huge waste of resources. It\'s more of a trophy.  Sure you can join a clan, get some bonuses and buy some shields with points, but you will be destroyed by the winners. Me, I had a gift card and blew on this game, now I just start fights and make people quit.',
       'I like the game but it is hard for players who can\'t buy a lot of packs. Some slight tweaks to make it not so slanted towards big spenders.  Maybe make some exchange rate for silver to gold without changing the silver availability or price. Someway that gold can be acquired beside the little in the ground. I understand the game has to make a profit and so you should but more people would continue to play instead of giving up Anyway just a couple of thoughts. Got plenty more on just general gameplay  that I think would be useful. Again, not hating as I like and play the game.',
       'Great time killer, I love the interaction and concept of the game. It can get a bit laggy at times and at it\'s worst, it will crash on you. The wait times are unbearable though. No ads at all since the first time I played too!',
       'The game itself is great. Zero complaints there. But the fact that it I am unable to ever log in is infuriating. I\'ve literally been zeroed out because the app won\'t let me log in... multiple times. It\'s absolutely ridiculous. Needs to be fixed.',
       'Was never able to connect to even set up an account to try the game. Messages to support only returned with irrelevant form letters. Tried my Wi-Fi, data, and Wi-Fi at Att store. No luck and can\'t get an actual human to respond just a form letter telling me to uninstall, reinstall, use different Wi-Fi or get a different phone. All to try their game. LOL If that\'s the support you get when you are a perspective customer, imagine the "help" if they already have you hooked on their game. STAY AWAY!  (Galaxy S-7 Active Phone)' ,

      'PLEASE READ!! this game has quit 20 times no joke in the past 10 minutes of owning it lol. It keeps asking for permissions to my phone and camera and location.. It\'s fun af but I can\'t even play for a minute without the app stopping. Y\'all can download but 2 minutes from now ur gonna say "dang he told me so"',
       'Constantly force stopping. Cannot finish a game without the game closing on me.  Update: uninstalled and reinstalled game and did not fix the problem. Uninstalling until game is fixed. Other then that game has potential.  Update 2: after installing the game again, it finally worked. But now I\'m uninstalling the game for good.  After scoring over 7b points in 1 game, the game only gave me just over 2b points. Game is garbage. Do not download this game!',
       'The game is fixed so you can score more than 2.15 billion.  But you can bank anything over 2.15 billion still.  So I just wreck once I hit the 2.15.  About to uninstall unless the code is fixed to keep all the points you score.  Game is very addictive.',
       'Ok so there are two ways to fix the crashing and frequent ad problem. Simple way, just turn off your internet while playing. Second, disable the internet permission from app settings for permanent fix. No crash, no ads just a fun game. :-)',
       'In the last update you enabled the top score to go above 2.5 billion however the score to upgrade is still locked at 2.5 billion. My last game I scored 16 billion but I only had 2.5billion to spend on upgrades. Please fix',
       'Constantly crashes, makes it unplayable. I\'ve uninstalled and reinstalled and it still doesn\'t work. I have a note8 do am more than positive it\'s not the phone.' ,

      'Quick fire is the best but theres only one down fall, the seconds. When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..',
       'Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven\'t gotten very far yet. Thing I DON\'T like is you don\'t get an average..... IF you do, I\'ve yet to find where it is in the game. That\'s in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯',
       'It\'s a  fun game but it\'s rigged. I think if you have a billion chips you shouldn\'t be able to play on lower lanes. I thought you were supposed to be matched up with people who are the same or close level. How is it I\'m bowling against someone who is level 171 and 8 billion chips and  I\'m level 43 .',
       'Amazing.  It\'s just fun watching the bowling hall whizz by and get a strike.  I\'ve played and uninstalled this game, but the only reason for the uninstall part is storage.  For all of you who are new, try getting the ball between the front pin and either of the pins next to it, it usually gets strikes, but by strikes I mean doubles against level 7 Russians.',
       'This is a fun game however it allows people to cheat or it\'s rigged. It\'s no coincidence that the better I play the better my opponent plays. I think half the time we are playing a rigged computer. I spent $50 on this app in a week and I am deleting it now. Sorry crooked people that run this app.',
       'I have been playing for months and spent a fair bit of money on this app and also was enjoying playing until all of a sudden all the graphics went pink and now i cant play. Not happy!!! How do i fix it? Don\'t want to delete it really as i will loose all my chips and special balls. Someone help please !?!?' ,

       'Well, I\'ve changing my review. I have now been active for several months, and am disappointed in the lack of development. The events are not touched, it\'s showing Christmas and Thanksgiving for the titles.. hate to point this out, but it\'s almost March. The building scheme is outdated and slow, when you have someone help you out, the difference in building times is a laugh at best. The pack prices once you spend on the lower end packs, never come back down. The minimum price I see now is $9.99. And the game mechanics are a bit slower as well. Customer Service can take up to 24 hours to respond to something in-game, so be prepared to wait, and remember that English is not the first language of support. I\'m still playing for the moment, but it\'s getting to be more of a job then a game. And without paying, be prepared for some waiting. Some of the research even in tier 1 is 11 days of waiting before you can do something else, unless you spend the $25.00 it will be for a second research slot. Oh, and the rate that they open new battlefields up destroys the older battlefields with active populations. So be prepared to see no growth within a week of a new field opening as it\'s the way they keep you in game and spending. I\'m critical of a game that doesn\'t bother to change events, or address the issues in the game. Guess it might be easier to open another flawed battlefield rather then fix the issues across the entire game. And no, I don\'t expect a response from there customer service either.',

       'Great game both as a concept and its graphics. The only problem is the lack of energy. You only have energy for like 6-7 battles and then you have to wait or use gold. Make it at least 10 battles at low levels and keep increasing it.',
       'Energy goes way too fast. You can spend it all in a matter of a few minutes. Rewards feel miniscule compared to other games. Grenade recharge is too long when early missions require it for objectives. Game has potential but I can\'t recommend it right now as it barely qualifies as playable when energy depletes so fast',
       'I had this game a while back, and must not have linked it to google play games at the time as my progress is lost, but all the same I\'m happy to start over and do it all again! Great game, keep up the good work!',
       'I love this game but apart from 3 gold, 500 money and 1 hero and 1 weapon crates, I never get any other in the casino spin even though I\'ve been playing with gold. Used around 170 gold just to spin and did not even get any other. Kind of pissed off actually but still playing.',
       'This is 1 of my favourite game but it\'s very hard to play this game without money...Coz you have spend money to buy components to upgrade gun and character...and if you don\'t buy them then you have to wait for 1 year. To collect components' ,

      'Until an update like 3-4 months ago everything was ok, you could chose between battle mode and stage mode, both were equaly rewarding, you wanted gold you went for battle mode, you wanted crystals you went for stage mode. Now stage mode is a joke, it\'s so hard that is not worth it. Please fix this, either increase the rewards or reduce the dificulty.  Also a good idea would be to add a market where you could sell/exchange materials for other materials.',
       'Game is completely balanced around p2w. Takes forever to get anywhere or do anything.  The world bosses are a joke,  they are once a day for a couple of minutes.  So basically hard to catch.  It\'s beyond a grindfest. Moving up and doing anything becomes more of a pain than in game fun',
       'In world raid dragon keeps hitting me all good then bang out of nowhere hits me again with 4000 health and I lose. What\'s up with this? Before the update its fine now I\'m dying like crazy from 4000 health to 0 in one hit doesn\'t make sense. FIX THIS PLEASE was lots of fun with new mode now dying real fast for tons of health lot less fun :(',
       'I loved Defender 2, but this game did not live up. They made it way more complicated than it needs to be for the kind of game it is. Feels more pay-to-win too than the other ones. Stick with Defender 2. Uninstalled by stage 11.',
       'I love this game and have made a purchase or two, but it drives me nuts that the game keeps crashing on me.  It turns the screen of the game and locks up, sometimes it comes back and sometimes I have to restart the phone.  I don\'t know what causes this but it\'s infuriating.  I tried to load the game on my tablet but the progress won\'t move over with it.',
       'Great game . Can\'t connect to world raid though. Please fix. Also prices get outta hand at higher levels. So I\'ve updated. More then once. Still can\'t get in world raid. Constant disconnect. Really disappointing' ,

      'I think it\'s a very fun game. But only thing I would like to see is maybe a market where you could put up duplicates for a price rather than having to trade with 25 million people just to find someone who is willing to buy. It kinda gets annoying when you\'re trying to sell some duplicates and all you find are cheap people who waste time. Also, there should be more packs being released because of how many cards there are. It\'s just too hard to find a card you\'re looking for, through trading. Secondly, if the market idea doesn\'t work there should be an option in which you can talk with the trader and/or be able to set a price of the duplicate you\'re trying to sell rather than wait for people to make unreasonable offers.',
       'IF YOU DONT HAVE FUT DONT WORRY. THIS APP IS UP TO DATE TOTW ONLINE FUT DRAFT FOR FREE. ICONS AND MUCH MORE BEST GAME EVER.',
       'Maybe add like a thing when u have like 10 81+ players packs open all button or something,annyoing opening 20 gold packs or any packs 1 by 1',
       'Please add draft builder challenges to android. Also please add a new trading system so people on android can trade with people on Apple. Then it would be worth 5 stars.',
       'Would have been 5 but there isn\'t any news about DBC for android and regular lightening rounds have not happened. Plus an open all packs button would be helpful.',
       'I think that this game and Pack opener of yours are best ones in those categories ... I have a question . When will Draft Building Challenges adds in android ? Thanks' ,

      'Thought this was a fun game, but since last update an ad pops up after every stinkin\' level.  Not fun anymore.  Especially since there is also a lot of lag time and black screens everytime something is clicked on.  I was fine with the lag time between everything, but can\'t handle that and an ad between every level.  Fix this and I\'ll be inclined to adjust my rating.  Scratch that.  When an ad pops up in the middle of actually playing a level, CONGRATULATIONS!  You just earned an Uninstall.',
       'I have enjoyed this game immensely up until level 240. In this level, rated HARD, there are most often no options to make strings and you\'re stuck with only strings of 3 of just plain air. When you see the game itself changing the color of treats several times during one game to give you a move, you know you\'re not imagining that this level is designed to screw you over into making fruitless purchases to overcome it.',
       'I would give this 5 stars, if you could select a level of difficulty, like easy, medium and hard.  It is not relaxing at all, once you pass the early levels. I hate the levels with bullies, you should be able to skip them.',
       'Great game but it continually crashes and freezes and you have to force stop the app to get it working again. Seems to happen when the ads pop up, please fix this! **update - this is getting worse! Every time i lose or win a level the game crashes and I have to force stop',
       'All other games I switch sound and music off as I cannot stand it. Thus one I have left it on as it isn\'t as aggravating as the others.',
       'This feels like a game made by people who don\'t play games. The loading screens are pointlessly long and un-optimised, the menu is over-crowded with buttons and graphics and it\'s hard to navigate because of the sheer amount of stuff on the screen. The levels have very bad difficulty balancing because the types of snacks that are dropped are so random, a level can be considerably easier or harder than intended. Also the amount of pointless notifications popping up about certain challenges expiring are super annoying and there is no in-game setting to turn them off. Besides this, I do appreciate the artwork as I\'ve always been a big Simon\'s Cat fan and the candy-crush with a twist style gameplay is fun, but guys, seriously, take some inspiration from good game developers.' ,

      'Okay game. As a musician of multiple instrements, I can say that this game requires no musical talent. It is just a tap fast game. But if you like games like guitar hero from the 2000\'s only without the weird hippies and nicer music, then this is the game for you. In my opinion the game is okay, not very interesting but a definite time burner. To many ads but if you dont mins that, then its fine.',
       'This game is rubbish I would not recommend this to anyone with a Samsung. It flashes black, and makes my phone freeze. Don\'t get it',
       'I really like this game and the songs. There are some glitch\'s like when your playing it will go to an AD half way through the song and tou lose all the rhythm you have gotten, if they could sort this out then it would be a fantastic game.',
       'the game is awesome i loved it but  i want one change that is please give the feature of recording it would be a great game with recording function yet it is best piano game I love it so much some levels are quite hard and some are quite easy but still its an awesome game please download it if you love songs and piano😍😍😍😘😘😗😗😙😎😎😎😋😋😀😀😀😀😚😚😚😙😙😘😘🤘👌👌👌👍👍👍👄👄💋💋',
       'I will give it a five star rating if there weren\'t as many ads because after every song there is an ad, which shows down my phone. Plz fix it because its an awesome game its just the ads❤',
       'I don\'t like this game at all because at the tournament adults and teens are playing and I\'m just a kid so it\'s impossible to beat the elder ones well I might not be able to beat them but I can put smart them by turning up tye heat which means time to go to top speed!' ,

      'It\'s a best game on playstore!!! I play it lot of.. and it\'s my favourite game.. but one problem is that when i start multiplayer match it says sercer not found or server overloaded. But it doesent matter for much. I give all 5 star for best graphics, bedt controls, and also bestest weapons. I love this game. Thank you gameloft. We expect that you will keep developing games like modern combat. I am waiting anxiously for next series. Thank you.',
       'I had previously given this game a 1 star but for this update I\'m blown away by the network rectification aspect. The game runs butter smooth even after post FUP data speeds. The game is currently saturated with lvl 140 players with all the prestige weapons, so I\'d request you to bring about a balanced match making in the PvP based on their matching levels and introduce some welcome benefits for the returning players',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s by Gameloft so it\'s bound to be a good phone game. It\'s not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn\'t hold your hand but it\'s not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you\'re also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it\'s definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I\'m stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)',
       'This probably the best FPS game in the Play Store. Graphics, animations, music, voice actings everything in this game are awesome. 😊  The game runs in my phone in full 60 fps on Ultra-high settings. But sometimes it crashes without any reason and when I run the game again, it starts to verify game data. My phone is not rooted and I do believe the problem is not in my phone, it\'s a bug in the game. 😕  Overall, it\'s a great game. ☺️  Peace out. 🤘',
       'This game is awesome.  But plzzzz ban clone paragon  first plzz plzz plzz.  Every match i see 2 or three paragon...  And mc5 is best game so far... One more thing this game turn into pay to win i think so plzzz reduce  the pay to win system and in match give 40 to 50 credit 10 credit is very lowest credit  to unlock items.... So plzzzz ban paragon first and give extra free credit  resources to earn in multilayer match....',
       'This game use to be my life. I loved it. Until u ROBBED ME i had all the guns all amour, suits, badges and money. I was a very very old player and you just take my stuff.....that is not right. You need to fix something with my account!Will there be a Morden Combat 6?' ,

       'I love the game but its frustrating when you have all 8 Spartans and the sword guys get in the way so maybe an extras set of controls to control where your men start or something. Also for me the screen keeps jumping I try to look at enemy and I catch a glimpse but then it jumps to my side then back again and again and again please fix this.',

It looks like someone spray painted their hair gold and then glued jewels on it. I also wish there could be more types of zombies. The idea of endless is cool but please add the zombies to the campaign.',

Later we created Surviving High School and Cause of Death, the first games with episodes, for EA.Both games hit the Top 25 and were inspirations for other companies. After leaving EA, our team regrouped in a small office and with the quacking of nearby ducklings we set out to create story driven games with heart.

      'AMAZING! The graphics are stunning and the story lines are so good! Just 2 things I would improve to make the game even better:      •Less time to wait for more keys (4 hours is quite long).      •The diamond cost is really high considering the fact we get one diamond after every story chapter we play and having to wait so long for keys.  Other than that...AMAZING JOB WELL DONE!',
       'I like interactive stories and some of these are cool. A bit more personalization and less predictability would be nice, but I enjoy the stories. I dislike that many of the choices you have to pay for but it IS a business so I understand. It\'s just that other story apps weren\'t like this. Then again, said apps weren\'t as attractive as these. You can tell a lot of work goes into them visually speaking and in the programming. The stories could get better though.',
       'Love the story lines, the graphics, all of it. Would have liked to seen something that can be done to regenerate the diamonds or do something to earn more diamonds other than finishing a new chapter earns you only one. Did experience my diamonds disappearing and the timer of keys along with the keys reach zero and not returning. Hope this issue will be resolved. Other than these issues really enjoyed the game, it\'s highly addictive.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a few days, so here\'s my review. I enjoy the stories even though they use a lot of archetypes, and I don\'t mind waiting for keys. The biggest issue I have is with the gems and premium choices: not only do the premium choices cost an unreasonably high amount of gems, but every time there are choice options with at least one premium choice, the premium choices are always presented as the better ones. This is less like making my own choices and more like reaffirming my assumption that the premium choices are always the better ones. I\'ve come to the conclusion that I would rather pay once to have this app installed rather than install it for free and pay money for gems just so I could pick the premium choices.',
       'Its honestly GREAT, i love how you can choose what you will say next to change the flow of the story and how will the others will treat you later on. Im talking about ENDLESS SUMMER my most favourite book like BEYOND others..for my opinion. Please make diamonds cheaper in the future cause it really annoys me when you want some choices but you dont have enough diamonds...',
       'I absolutely love this game. i just wish the diamonds and keys werent so expensive. Nobody has $100 to spend on a game. $10 lasted me like 1 day smh...and i have to wait 2 hours everytime i play 2 chapters so please fix that. thats soooo annoying. Id rather PAY for the game once and have unlimited diamonds or please  make the diamonds much much CHEAPER....also itd be cool to make the characters move or place them in the actual scenery in the future.' ,

      'I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there\'s only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can\'t beat them! Keep making more awesome games!',
       'I can\'t help but love a mobile game that doesn\'t constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it\'s tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.',
       'This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn\'t always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing',
       'Excellent game, can\'t wait for a new map. There isn\'t any tutorials but it\'s quite a simple and fun game, you will catch on quick just be patient. Hope to see new maps soon don\'t make it too easy on us high levels now : )',
       'I really like the game. But there\'s one thing that annoys me: when I don\'t play this game for a few hours and then I do another battle in dungeon, the game crashes after killing last monster in that battle.  I found out that if I switch on mobile data it works. So I wanted to asked why is that. EDIT: now all works just fine. 5 stars',
       'Lots of work to do on this game. It\'s very SOLID in gameplay and possibilites, but lacks a lot of content. Needs to gather gold while away from the game, as the grind is tremendous right now! There is no purpose in leveling up your mine past lvl 5 right now. It doesn\'t do anything. The game is very incomplete, but has a ton of potential.' ,

      'wow ! why is this game so good!! addicting I got a problem ! to many ads! I under stands u need money but you should put purchases so u get some more money !! and also I want to have new characters and themes that will be cool course I nearly got all but I haven\'t! also change rating to pegi 3 I know there\'s the characters can be a vampire but srsly IT\'S NOT SCARY what is with wthat!  sorry it\'s long but thanks for taking time and reading bye!😀😀😀😁😁😁',
       'I really liked it at first. But now all I get are ads. it\'s so irritating to be playing and then ad pops up at the bottom. You\'re clicking on your character to jump & you click on the stupid ad than every time you die you have to watch another ad so annoying. But I could get pass the ad      after you die but not at the bottom of the screen. Makes me not want to play it anymore. And I\'m only on day 3. It was a cute to relieve stress and now it just gives me stress.',
       'Very very addictive pass time. Only a lil disappointed with the adds popping out every now and than. I know its a free app and adds are inevitable but try reducing the number of time it should appear not after each and every round.',
       'It\'s a very good game! I got my boyfriend hooked on it, but my problem with it is, sometimes when I start up the app it sits on the beginning stage of the app?? Like when am I going to be able to play again? Was just updated? So I\'m going to have to delete it and start it all over and re gain my high score??',
       'This adorable & addictive game is very fun to play at any time of the day! It is definitely a close competitor of the infamous"Candy Crush" trend. For such a simple concept, it never ceases to amaze me; especially since I can\'t seem to get a long enough winning streak to increase my stack count. I admit, I suck at this game... Yet I can\'t stop playing it! 4/5 stars for me. Loses a star for excessive ads and lagging during the game.',
       'Very good game, very addictive, but unfortunately the birds theme and the circus theme are not very good. They are not so sensitive to touch and jump late. My favourite is the farm one.

      'I really like it, turn based strategy, probably one of the best games I had on this phone yet. There are a few fun tribes you can buy (or rather should buy) and I think spending a few bucks for a game like this is absolutely fine. Just keep an eye on the time, half an hour flies away if you don\'t pay attention ^^',
       'Love game, but why the auto start, in my opinion, no app should auto start, app should only be turned on when in use, fix this or I uninstall. GEEZ, all you developers think your app is only one used, get a clue! Then why do I keep getting a "Poytopia has stopped" message every time I start a session on my tablet, even though I did not play Polytopia during last session.',
       'Fantastic mobile game. It\'s a great pocket sized Civilization-style game. Quick games with the depth and variation to keep you immersed.  Unfortunately, the multiplayer update doesn\'t seem to be functioning very stably at the moment. My friend (Verizon iPhone) and myself (Sprint Android) have been trying to play some matches, but we keep getting turns where we can\'t move our units, or gain resource points to spend. As it\'s an indie-developed game, I understand it\'s tough to test every permutation of devices and connections. I\'m hopeful and looking forward to subsequent updates and bugfixes. Keep up the great work!',
       'Guys. Love the game. Play it all the time. However...  When the update was done a week or two ago it is now locking up and shutting down. Not sure what you did but its annoying to get to level 29 of 30 and not be able to finish. For a while I would back out and just restart and it was ok. Now it just locks right back up after restarting.',
       'I love this game hence the 5 star. But the multiplayer needs some work, if I wanna play a game with a friend in 1 sitting I have to reload the map each turn. If the turns could progress without reloading the game that would be awesome. Also, I had a bug that made me replay a turn a few times in multiplayer for some reason after I returned to the game.',
       'The game is awesome. The multiplayer portion just got added, and it is very buggy. I tried it on three games already, and there are many instances where i did not get my stars during the game. I\'ve supported the game and have every tribe except the Luxidoor, and I\'m very excited with the new multiplayer gamemode. Midjiwan, pls solve it ASAP!' ,

      'Great game, Love it! Very creative, fantastic graphics. Not so difficult or loss of life\'s to where you can\'t even play.  Yet still challenging.  Only negative is lots of ads. Would gladly pay nominal fee to get rid of them.',
       'A truly fun, interesting & free game. A good game for any age. If you need to do something relaxing, this is a good way. You\'ll get hooked!!! I\'m in the 500\'s & it\'s still fun! The ads only require 1 more touch on the screen than you have been doing. Well worth it.',
       'I really like this game but newer version I have updated to after 3 months and I see the Hooray Sound in the end and some more sounds in between has been changed to Ticking kind of sound.   I seriously and kindly request to the developer to restore those sounds which were there in old versions because I seriously loved it. I wish those sounds can come back which makes the game more amazing.   And ofcourse I still continue to play this and have hope for those sounds to be back.',
       'Love it !!! Caught my eye when I saw "pick 2" vs. pick 3. I\'m a stay at home mom kids in school 6 days week that gives me time to burn   (lol) They did a couple small tweeks which  made the "typical pick 3 concept"a thing of the past (FINALLY) BUT WAS ENOUGH change to make it a keeper',
       'This is my second time playing it! I have already played it to the very end do I took a break and am back at it!!',
       'Love love love this game. Ty for making it as it is. It\'s not hard like the rest but it holds you. It great to take your mind off life and you don\'t gotta think of anything. Great game on level 300 and my so is on like 430. Way to go.' ,

      'I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.',
       'I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn\'t work.  So I pressed the \'X\' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I\'m pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE \'X\'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I\'m triggered.  Please fix that.',
       'I really, really love this game, but, I keep losing my ball count and I don\'t understand why this is happening. For instance, I have 90 balls and I\'m supposed to have 92, I don\'t get the 92. I will give 5 stars until the bug is fixed. The ads I don\'t care about because that only happens at the end of each game which is ok. Please fix this so I can give you 5 stars.  Update- I figured out why I keep losing my count with my balls. Everytime I get the balls by the number blocks, it wouldn\'t count them😐 I could get a lot further if this was fixed. If this keeps on happening, I\'m going to uninstall this game. I hope it doesn\'t come to that because I really love this game. Please fix asap!!',
       'If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.',
       'It\'s good at first but you\'ll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.',
       'Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I\'m not spoiling it, but I will tell you it\'s a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don\'t know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.' ,

Each game  is intriguing with an original story line. I do have my favorite crime scenes,  and plenty of friends(all over the world) whom play as often as they can too!',
       'DONT BOTHER WITH THIS GAME Played for 10 minutes before I ran out of energy, which you need to earn stars to progress! Then have to wait ages for it to recharge.  OR......pay to top it up. Don\'t think so. UNINSTALL IMMINENT',
       '4th instalment of the Criminal Case games. I love playing them all excellent time wasters intriguing story lines. I\'m well & truly hooked on the whole series. Gainsborough, Pacific Bay, Save The World & now this Mysteries Of The Past........ all brilliant',
       'Damn you Pretty Simple... damn you & your ridiculously addictive Criminal Case games!!  How about the next series to be set in space?  I\'d be VERY curious to see what your creative geniuses could do with that concept!!',
       'I am excited to play this game. I have been playing the other 3 but had forgotten how slow it is to start. Once you get to where you can get power ups the game play is much faster',

      'Really fun.  But crashes constantly on my Galaxy S5.  Then I have to force stop the app, and restart my phone to get it working, for about 5 minutes....  All have to do to avoid ads is not restart until the respawn timer clears, so they aren\'t that bad, and it\'s really cheap to turn the ads off.  I would happily do so, it the app would run for more than 5 minutes.  If it wasn\'t for the crashing, I would rate it 4 stars at least.',
       'Smooth game. Plenty of fire ball options and endless level options but after every death you have to watch  15 second ad. EVERY DEATH. Which just spoils the experience and all. I understand ads but like after 3 deaths that\'s fine. But after every death and some are unskippable. So download of you have patience. It\'s worth it of you have time to spend',
       'Love playing this game...very addictive! I would rate it 5* if there was a reason for why you level up and why you keep spinning for little lightening bolts when you do level up  as once you have bought the small amount on offer they are no longer needed. Add more things to buy and give the game a reason for levelling up 🤘🏼',
       'A wonderful aesthetically pleasing game.  Get as far as you can, with as many points as you can while unlocking different fireballs and portals. I would love to see how this game evolves in the future and i have not seen as many ad\'s as people claim so perhaps that issue has been resolved? Working perfectly on S8+',
       'TOO MANY ADS, every time you die you get an ad and that\'s just being money hungry what ever happened to games without long ads what\'s the point if you\'re gonna make a game and 1/3 of the gameplay being ads. Perhaps every 10 or 20 games, or just have those small popup ads, but don\'t ruin the gameplay because you want money. I\'m uninstalling and I\'m sure other people are as well.',
       'I hate this game because it literally makes you watch ads every single time you finish, and doesn\'t reward you for it like some apps do. I would not recommend this at all, especially because when you close the app to try to skip the add, you open it back up and it says it\'s stopped running and closes itself again because you didn\'t want to watch the stupid advertisement. If I could give it 0 stars, I would!!' ,

Smooth gameplay. Adorable graphics. But you\'ll be lucky to get maybe 10 minutes of gameplay per session before you have to wait. Not too bad if you only have a few minutes to play at a time, but not for me.',

      'This  was really  fun! Starts off easy but gets harder, not near the ads of the  other games I have played. Takes extra words, hints are reasonable,  earning money is reasonable.  So far the best of the word connects !! Really happy with this game, will add to my phone  and get rid of the other word connect games that seem to have ad, after ad not to mention the high amount for hints! There is one reason I didn\'t  give it a 5, because some of the ads get stuck and you can\'t  exit,  overall  4.8!',
       'Child-friendly! And, as an adult? I love how am yet to see an advertisement. 😊  Unlike other word games like Word Connect, it also lets you find and play words that are not necessarily those found on the board, storing it in an "Extra" slot, which generates added points to your score, rather than telling you to choose the word that\'s only on the board.  ADDENDUM: After reading the comments, it appears there may be ads after all. Am yet to see any though. Perhaps because am still in a lower level.',
       'Not a bad time killer - quick paced and not too taxing on the brain. I wish it had a more comprehensive dictionary so you would still get bonus points for valid words like \'cad.\' No matter - still basically a four star, though almost three for the number of ads.',
       'Game is fun. But giving me pop ups to bring me back to the game while it\'s not open is a nono. Especially when it takes up half the screen. I\'d give 5 stars cause i had fun playong this, but this one thing is annoying. Especially with the amount of ads, it shows you just wanna push people to keep playing for that ad revenue. Won\'t be downloading any of your games after i delete this now.',
       'OK, this word game is the bomb! It actually uses words that I know! I have played so many word games that use strange words and won\'t take common words! Thank you, WePlay! I will be trying your other games and telling my friends about them!',
       'I turned off the notifications on this game and it still gives me pop ups that cover up anything else I\'m doing including navigation instructions while I\'m driving.  This is dangerous and unacceptable.  I can\'t be fiddling with a game while I\'m driving in a whiteout blizzard in the middle of the night.  Uninstall.' ,

      'It is a good clicker game kinda like clicker heroes but with a lot better graphics, the controls are simple and the only thing I dislike about in the slightest way is that the heroes are a little bit to expensive, it has a simple but very cool design and deserves 5 stars. Thankfully it doesn\'t cost money to buy the game itself. All in all it is a great game.',
       'Great game still playing after 2 years and for people who ask what does prestige mean is that it gives you relics which are used to better you character with artifacts, but i come with a price... starting over with a slight headstart.',
       'was fun until the game stopped loading and I was forced to uninstall. thanks a f***ing lot too signed up with my email and it told me that my account is no longer valid. good game. ya d***heads.',
       'Pretty much fixes all my gripes with other rpg idle games, plus it looks really good. 1 day in, and I feel like even though I\'ve made a lot of progress, I still have more to discover. It\'s rare that an incremental like this actually captures that feeling. It\'s what makes me want to continue grinding.',
       'It\'s amazing, easy ,all you have to do is tap and upgrade your character and your allies and while your away and off your phone your allies could take down the titans for you. Super fun and addicting.',
       'Tried for a few minutes, then uninstalled. All I had to do is tap to kill the monsters, they don\'t even fight back. At lvl 2 or 3, I got a companion who auto attacked. Then I didn\'t even have to tap anymore. The monsters just died while I watched.  I don\'t understand why everyone is giving this 5 stars. Maybe some joke that the whole world gets except for me. Oh well.' ,

      'So I\'m changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it\'s a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I\'d rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!',
       'GAME CODE reveals ROLLS ARE NOT RANDOM - they\'re pulled from a table of predertirmined outcomes, designed to MILK YOU FOR MONEY at a set rate, based on PvP, reg. Game, Event, Boss, etc.  Just like slot machines & video poker (which i programme).  You must \'assemble\' high scoring games, like a puzzle, with majority of yahtzees sitting after 4 or 8 rolls (1 or 7 bonus \'dice\'(money) spent)... Like a choose your own adventure book that can cost Hundreds of Dollars.',
       'Scopely is the most greedy, disgusting company I have ever seen. The ads they have littered into the game play literally crash the game at least 4 times during a match. You will see about 10 ads on top of the crashing per game; you could be in mid roll and the ad will ruin it. So desperate for money.. Don\'t support scopelys terrible practices.',
       'Been playing and I love it very addictive.wish they actually give u the dice on scratch off cards.. in the tournament\'s and the showdown after getting so far, it\'s like they want let you win any more the computer wins every time and I don\'t think it\'s right when it want let you see the last roll of the apponement, and they always show computer beating you by 3 points but never shows the last roll.',
       'Its ok if you play against other people but if you play any of the challenges they have against the computer  you lose. They give so many days and you get nothing and have 0 across your board but the computer gas 3 plus yahtzees and over 300 points everytime. Not just 1 or 3 this is 32 times I\'ve played and it\'s happened. Just not worth it if you can\'t win a single challenge honestly. Update they have issues now when you play their computers you can be 150 points ahead of them and the computer magically wins with 1 roll',
       'Fun game overall....... Except when you play the \'showdowns\' the computer is nearly impossible to beat and matches you almost play for play, you end up losing... So needless to say, I would give 5 stars, but I am only giving 3 based on the clear facts of computer cheating... Yahtzee, be glad you got 3 stars from me... You need to fix this BS' ,

      'Very simple. Gives me a lot of nostalgia. Two things though, it seriously needs music maybe some Celtic tunes or shanties. And secondly it needs more stuff to do. When I first saw a whale I was excited about doing some whaling but nope. The whales do absolutely nothing. Maybe even some treasure hunting puzzles or something. Good game just needs a little more content.',
       'One of me and my sister\'s favourite game. But we wish we could play together same team or against each other with bots. We don\'t  want to be against online players. If you guys do that I will tell alllllll my friends to play. Anyway great job keep up the work , you guys are great😁',
       'Good game however, once you\'ve taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world\'s and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.',
       'please, please, please. update more maps or make it more challenging, ive already conquered all the islands and there\'s not much i can do anymore. so please, either more maps, or let others conquer my islands and let me reclaim it. i know you guys can still add up to this already amazing game. also, improve the controls, really cant see much when im steering. but over all, its a really fun, relaxing game. ;) thank you.',
       'Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.',
       'Awesome game! Two things: please do something about the controls, they feel very poor quality. Even addig a left and a right arrow would be more comfortable for me.. Second is content. This game is huuuuge. But I\'m so addicted I managed to conquer all the islands by now, so I really want more challenges. Thanks for the awesome game, keep up the good work!' ,

      'Was an awesome game Very addictive game! Was well done.. until the update. Needs more pens and new themes as I have thousands of coins but nothing left to unlock. Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don\'t register as pineapple hits for the counters. There\'s a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it',
       'Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.',
       'Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.',
       'GREAT!... but the coins are a bit hard 2 earn thought the game is very addictive and the adds are not very frequent but they do appear on the bottom of your screen while playing thought there is a no adds purchase also the only purchase in the game the thing I like about the no adds purchase is that sometimes it will let you get it for 50% off so it is only one dollar instead of $2 (USD). The game has a lot of pens and I so far have unlocked a bit more than half and have played the game a lot of the game. But really needs an update.',
       'Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.',
       'BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn\'t have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What\'s bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I\'m not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game.' ,

      'To many ads, and if you insist on all the red toy cats and spikes then you need to give free revives. And seems to me that on every new level  the mouse gets slower and the cats get faster. I thought this was a good game for children but if you make it to hard for them then they will not want to play it.',
       'It will not even let you get through the school portion of the game. Starts glitching at 7 in the school portion. Didn\'t even get to play the game that is so BAD, really glad didn\'t pay for anything',
       'I can\'t get the knack for controlling Jerry. He\'s sooooo slowwwww and Tom is so very FAST!  Very difficult to get very far past the School level.  Need more transport holes or vases and plants to hide behind. So many great comments, it\'s baffling to me.  Wish I  knew the tricks to get as far as a lot of the reviewers do.  Looks like it COULD BE A FUN GAME, but in present form, it\'s too challenging for me.  Bummer. Guess I\'ll have to uninstall it.',
       'No real instructions, mouse would not go where I dragged it, perhaps if it had more instructions I would know what to do. Became too frustrating!! Had to uninstall!😎',

      'Very cute and addictive. Loved it. It is somewhat similar to Talking Tom Gold Run. It would be better if you add some moving things like rolling snowball, fruit, candy, etc. Over some things the girls can jump but in some things they will crash like in other running games. Here\'s also a good point that we can buy puppies and girls from game money and not real money. Add more things which help us in running. Make racing also with other players from all over the world. It is in Talking Tom Gold Run. Also make a feature that with coins we can build the girls\' dream house like in Talking Tom Gold Run. Good game.',
       'I think its awesome. Tho I had one about 1 month ago and everytime it saved it, but this time it didn\'t. I had all strawberry shortcake characters. Not her friends. But now I only have the regular strawberry shortcake. I think it was because it was in a long time. But other than that I give ☆☆☆☆☆ stars. Please download!',
       'Great fun game. Similar to Super Mario Run. Pretty graphics. My daughter likes the sticker packs. Some variety in obstacles and tasks would be a great addition to the game. The free parts of the game are fantastic. Additional characters/pets are a bit pricey.',
       'My little girl (and myself) have been playing this game for a few years and love it. We\'re both disappointed that now the purple sticker packs have repeat stickers in them to sell. We used to get a new sticker after completing the daily challenges but not anymore. I don\'t think that\'s fair that she\'s gotten so close to finishing the sticker books to not be able to earn new stickers anymore. We\'ll probably uninstall now.',
       'If this took you so long to make the graphics then they look pretty good because when I bumbed my head then it had like pins on the desk I liked it so much BTW I don\'t care about that we need to pay real money I deal with it',
       'Graphics are bad. Gameplay is okay, although only a small child wpuld play this with enjoyment.' ,

      'I have only had the game a few hours and I am already falling in love with it. It is great to go on when you have a spare 10-15 minutes. The grid is larger than others so I can read the words fluently and quickly without them being hard to see. You get points after each time you complete the grid so if you are really stuck you can receive a hint for some points. I would highly recommend this excellent game.',
       'Only been playing for a few days now, and so far, I love it! Forgot how fun Word Search puzzles can be, and to have it on my phone is priceless lol.. No complaints with the app so far. I will say though, maybe they should tweak it just a tad, instead of giving a hint only after a short moment, possibly creating \'the option\' to have a hint may be a little better. Not a big deal to me. It truly is a great app, love the simplicity of the graphic design too. Glad I came across this game.',
       'I enjoy ALMOST the whole game, being a word find and all, simple, yet deceptively hard at times. Still, I wish there was a way to turn off the \'hints\' it gives, as they get annoying... unless there IS a way that I haven\'t discovered yet...otherwise, I REALLY like the game, and would suggest it to all ages, as it\'s not too tough for the young ones, but still challenging enough for experienced players.',
       'Pretty good word search game. It\'s sometimes hard to hit the right letters, especially toward the bottom of the screen. Occasionally words share more than one letter in common. Sometimes  (especially in the  lower levels) a word will show up more than  once in a puzzle. Maybe extra credit for finding a word that\'s not on the list?',
       'It\'s a good game but there needs to be a way to turn off hints. If you don\'t find a word in the time it thinks you should, it keeps giving hints which ruins the gameplay. I pause for various reasons like talking to someone, cat catching a mouse, watching tv at the time, etc.. Or sometimes it might take longer to fins a word than seconds allowed before the hint.',
       'I love this game. Really nice and well thought out game. It\'s educative too. But I have just one issue with it though: The flashing hint. This gets me distracted each time it flashes. Maybe there could be a hint button at the bottom of the puzzle. That way instead of it flashing and getting us distracted, we could just click on it whenever we need help. Apart from that, it\'s just perfect. Will give it a 5 when the flashing hint is worked on😁' ,

       'Got stuck playing til lvl 40 before I realized an hour had past, and I only came to the play store looking for sonic 3, but this looked interesting listed under "recomended." Great recommendation.',
       'Some levels are straight forward. Others you just have to skip because there\'s no logic or something is missing. Could be good with some type of help if you get stuck rather than just skipping an entire level.',
       'Fun and challenging for awhile, but I found most of the levels after 50 impossible to figure out without a cheat sheet. Got frustrating. I\'m at level 60 and about ready to throw in the towel.',
       'Items don\'t move when they are supposed to therefore making it impossible to complete each task. It is very frustrating because the game would be more fun. It would make it more enjoyable with at least 1 or 2 hints.' ,

      'Game became sluggish after update, the pads sounds only occur a few millisecinds afyer touching but its a noticeable difference. Makes all songs sound terrible. Sounds often mash together eg. In otherside, when you play the bass and guitar together, the bass becomes boosted and makes a sound as if a speaker is put too loud',
       'Some bugs and problems. It keeps saying "no space left on the device" even though I deleted some apps, tried to clear the cache and move the app to the sd card, still no enough, pls fix this. I going reinstall it though see if it fix. Also add more features and option to fits. By the way the device I\'m using is Samsung 355 4:3 screen ratio, 16 gb storage expandable',
       'Was good at the first... But.. When i create a  kit a cant hear anything even when i cut a part from my song i can\'t hear.... Can you  please fix the problem (my phone is oppo f3+',
       'Okay i will give 5 stars but please fix the problem that it will say like. There is no space left on the device? Why the hell tho. I got 2 gb of space left. Cmon. Please fix this i love the music guys there\'s no doubt but please fix this.',

      'reliance I bought a real money loot bundle which was for 76 dhs (UAE currency)but I did not get the loot cases. Also checked my loot place but nothing was there and also restarted the game but nothing was there.. Simply wasted money.so after that I deleted the game forever.also the game is having a lot of bugs like game freeze,network issue,sometime showing black screen,etc.',
       'Server disconnect constantly even on WiFi. I\'ve also ran into problems with the game freezing. I understand that this is a new game with only days after release but the constant disconnecting is beginning to be a problem. update I bought a new phone and lost my game progress. I don\'t think Facebook should be a requirement to a continue with the game.',
       'My loot cases are not being delivered also this game eats a lot of data.. There\'s no offline play options, I have 4 GB ram and still this is too slow, my reversal moves get stuck and there\'s no option to play it without internet, stupid game updates everyday and sends me notifications constantly.. Please improve it and stop asking for money',
       'I\'ve addicted to this game. But there\'s one problem that when in the versus mode we have to stop that the lucky draw like thing if we r getting a superstar the game cheats us and give money instead of that superstars.This is only a drawback of the game.. The producers of this game must fix this problem 🙂🙂',
       'I love this game . Now it is my favorite game . But in future can you add some story plz ?.......   ...That will awesome . They are fighting for something right ?      Some of them for revenge , some of them championship , interference add anything .        Without those the game is still awesome .',
       'I believe the blocking mechanism needs to be fixed because once you hold to block it lets go for a split second which has you being hit in that small opening of a spot. Please fix it it\'s honestly ruining the game for me and many others I know that play this.' ,

      'Very realistic and nice game. Missions and descriptions are entertaining. Controls are also great.   Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!',
       'Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!',
       'Its quite good but a little bit of fixing will do. The part "Slow Down thing" can you please please place that where it can not block the view of the player. It is very difficult to see whats behind it so it causes us players to crash. T.Y',
       'Great game but more issues to address.  The longer flight durations are a real waste of time,  make them more challenging rather than waiting for the destination. Also add more controls as the ones we have are not effective. How do you tell me to slow down yet i don\'t have the option for that?',
       'Why the hell they add brake when we cannot see the brake option even after landing which forces us to crash. Total stupidity do not waste time in downloading. Previously was better when there were no brakes just reverse it and stop or keep brake button always active.',
       'Its really boring... You have to do missions you cant just fly around and do whatever you have to fly through the squares and make it to the end... And who wants stripes?! Why are they so important?! Plus its really hard to control!!' ,

      'Several times now I\'ve tried to type in a logo name and the app has told me I got it wrong but I thought it was right and couldn\'t see why I was being told I was wrong. So I hit "solve" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I\'ve recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you\'ve ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?',
       'First Level at Barbie and Twitter, even if type the words correct, the app tells me that there\'s a mistake. Solve shows me exactly the same word I\'ve typed in before',
       'Not a bad game, but would be great if you could simply type the name down, instead of slowly searching for each individual letter. Makes it all sluggish and takes away the fluidity of the game.',
       'Several times I have tried to use a hint and it  wouldn\'t take it off and it was difficult and easy. When I type in the logo it would tell me I\'m wrong then I hit solve and it was the same thing I wrote also and if people don\'t know some of the logos what is the point of the game.',
       'It\'s too easy to amass a huge number of hints and use them. I\'d like not to be able to complete every level without doing some online searches.',
       'This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further.' ,

      'Lost another These constant updates caused me to uninstall this. Fun game - very good game!But if it ain\'t broke don\'t fix it. I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.',
       'It\'s a fun game. If you\'re a COD player you\'ll love it. In general It does good on it\'s own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It\'s good that there\'s a grind to get them but I think it\'s a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.',
       'I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to "rent" which is an option in the game.',
       'Great game play, Great graphic, but after 1 month, I think this is another pay to win game ; the great Gun need to buy,  the Armor need to buy, almost every wining key things need to buy. But some people really like it because they have money to buy all those and "WIN" other pool guy. it is not about skill, it is about money.',
       'There\'s no such thing as a realistic video game you cant reproduce the fear of a bullet coming through the screen and spread on your brains across the wall but this is the best phone game possible absolutely definitely worth the download. Have had zero issues',
       'I love the game over all. There are only small things that bug me 1. It takes super long to get guns whether you\'re using credits or gold 2. Once u get a gun if u used credits u have to fix it after a match 3. Games become one sided fast 4. You basically have to pay to get gold its ridiculous' ,

      'Using galaxy note 8 and the graphics are all skewed. I keep getting docked lives and having to restart  a level because the circle of off to the side of where the difference is. What\'s the point? It would be awesome if I could actually play it.',
       'The idea of the app is very nice, however, I am disappointed in the fact that the app requests to access my calls, contacts, and other data. I fail to see why is that necessary for a simple game like this. Moreover, when I listen to music and play the game, the ads come interrupting my music with their own. When I mute them and press X, the music on my phone stops completely, forcing me to leave the game and start the music again. Again, this is inconvenient for an app which I expected to be very simple.',
       'It seems that the touch is way off on my Galaxy S8, when i touch the differences i get a X, but get O for random spots mid-screen! This would be a great game if i could actually play it!!!',
       'This apps cool but being new to Samsung being a former apple person. I\'m not understanding why the games want to access your private things..calls pics etc?',
       'Sometimes it\'s like it didn\'t detect the correct difference.  You have to hit it twice, so you lose a life when you shouldn\'t.  Might be phone screen sensitivity, but it does impact playing.',
       'Fun game to use your brain. I really like that you don\'t have to buy hints!  Don\'t really like the background music, but that\'s nothing major.' ,

      'I absolutely love this game. It\'s so addictive and a really good game if your bored. I\'m really curious to find out what happens when you have collected all the balls, does the game just carry on or is their more challenges?? Overall, this game gets five stars from me 😚',
       'Its a really good game. The only thing is, that I wish there was maybe some instructions that appear at the beginning, because I didnt know that you couldnt hit the black lumps etc. Maybe if you add little phrases that say what to do and not to do, then it would be almost perfect.',
       'Great time killer I love everything about it and it is a great game to wake up to. The only down side is that you fall off the ledge and that makes it harder to dodge the black. Everything else is 5 stars so that is what I think about roller coaster.',
       'Its really fun and addictive. Awesome game play and good for passing time. Not always so friendly to my battery and too many adds. Other than those little hick ups I absolutely love it.',
       'This game is amazing! It is addicting and fun to play!! The only thing is that I was hoping for some sort of introduction to the game, to tell me how to play etc. Also, I was hoping to be able to choose what kind of ball i use, the black one is plain and kind of boring. But overall its an amazing game!!',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH   I love this game because it is exciting and addictive, it has easy controls and it is so many different colors as you move on and on! Try to beat the next high scores and HAVE AS MUCH FUN AS I DID' ,

      'Cross platform across Apple and Android and PC makes this game a fluid joy to play, without the feeling of a toned down mobile port - due to its 1:1 experience from the PC. It\'s the only Blizzard game u can play on Mobile. I\'m a legend (highest skill tier) ranked and totally F2P so the people who say this game is pay to win or random luck do not understand the game. Paying for is meant for helping you finish your collection fast. Overall highly recommended.',
       'Lots of fun over and over again. It doesn\'t get boring because of all the expansion updates that keep coming up. You need to readjust your decks to adapt with the new cards that get released. Didn\'t give it a full 5 because of the lag and graphic issues that keep coming up for me and others of the forums.               Playing on a Note 5',
       'I used to play the old tcg and this not  close to be a good card game. All it is is monster with power, moslty no spell, no artifact, no nothing. This game is boring and is lagging so much on the cellphone. Shadowverse is ways better for a similar formula, has a really good storyline and a waaaaay more generous. When you buy card for HS you get mostly nothing. They had the chance to do something good, everyone love the lore of warcraft, but they BS it.',
       'What the hell? I played this game about 2-3 years ago and i really liked it (on that time). But now when i came back I just can\'t win anyone. I tried to win on rank 25 about 10 times. There always players with full deck of legendary/epic cards, 25 RANK, DAMN!',
       'No way to begin the game without being decimated by cards I never see available to a new player.  Just geared toward getting me to spend money to HOPE to be able to learn and entice me to spend some cash.  Captive audience I guess..seemed fun but without spending money there is no way to battle other players to progress.   Even the quests are too hard to gain enough.  Just like WoW, which I couldn\'t keep up with monetarily for computer upgrades, good idea but not for the masses, only for the people without bills and responsibility.',
       'There\'s apparently no coming back to this game. If you stop playing for a bit and come back you\'ll never be able to catch up. I\'ve tried building decks but everyone playing has the best cards already and unless I buy card packs I\'ll never catch up.' ,

       'Filled with bots, there are very few real people I face, its far to easy because of this. I\'ve taken the whole arena 5+ times with ease. At least have the bots use bot as part of their name.',
       'Too many bots and the game keeps asking me to give it more access to my phone than it really needs to run.   Other than that it is fun.  If they fixed these issues it would be 5 stars.',
       'Okay so I like it.I mean I know I know it  could have been better, but I\'m going to be good with everything I say. If there is reality, this is what it would be: this is the worst app in the world! I hate it so much you,can\'t do anything with it it\'s just a boring junk app ,but that\'s not true I really like it just saying it could have been better!',

      'This is not a legitimate game. All the artwork and animation featured in the game design is plagiarised from Kevin Gemin, a freelance artist on several platforms. To take and profit from the hard work of an artist and not credit them let alone ask permission is below the scum of the earth. Don\'t download this trash and instead allow me to redirect to the proper source of "inspiration." YouTube - kekeflipnote Tumblr - k-eke Tumblr Twitter - @Kekeflipnote Facebook - @Kekeflipnote Deviantart - kokorokeke Patreon - Keke',
       'The animations in this game are blatantly plagiarized from Kevin Gremin. You would think that a small indie studio would be respectful of freelance artists and their work, but that\'s not the case with Fortafy Games. This is shameful and needs to be removed from this platform, along with apologies and compensation to the artists you stole from.',
       'I can\'t believe how obviously plagiarised the art and animations are in this! Kévin Gemin\'s animations always bring a smile to my face, and seeing his work so blatantly stolen like this is heartbreaking. For those that enjoy the animations in this game, please check out the original artist\'s work at k-eke on Tumblr / kekeflipnote on Twitter / kokorokeke on DeviantArt.',
       'Wonderful, two companies working together to rip off one artist\'s (K-eke) gimmick. It\'s pulled off so decently that it\'s infuriating. Get yourselves both a spine and work on ideas without plagiarising other people\'s content that they themselves depend very much on. Here\'s what you need to do, WORK on ORIGINAL ideas. If you were thoughtful enough of crediting a Tom Garett for the music what about the concept of the animations? Two companies worth of people just missed it I suppose, fantastic.',
       'I wish I could give this plagiarized piece of trash you tried to pass off as an original game zero stars! You blantantly stole the animations from Kekeflipnote, a person of actual talent! You truly are a scumbag in every sense of the word.',
       'This game has stolen and is profiting on plagiarized art. If you like the bouncing birds go find Kevins Gemins social media accounts and follow him. Show him the support for his art, not this company who stole his hard work like assholes.' ,

      'Loading to start game is rediculus. Takes 1gb nearly everytime you load it. Story part gets way too hard to manage keeping up with the difficulty even when you pay the subscription unless you spend real money to move along. It\'s a kids game, people don\'t have the money to keep up with the difficulty. I will be unsubscribing, subscription doesn\'t justify the price, everything costs too much and can\'t progress in the game because of price. Great game, shame it\'s destroyed by greed.',
       'It\'s a great game but it\'s such a money pit. 9 out of 10 times if you want something, you better get a credit card out otherwise you\'re waiting 4 days to unlock it. If it weren\'t for that, I\'d have given 5 stars.',
       'The game is not letting me in the game. and i have wifi. So i thought i don\'t have a lot of space so i checked and i had a lot of space and my wifi is good. I don\'t know what\'s the problem please fix this problem. Overall the game is great.',
       'Actually this game is very good but still...  It crashes if you dont have a good phone because i have an samsung at it crashes 1/3 times. Please fix this thank you',
       'Keep crashing after I win an arena game. Fix it. Great game though love the system. Don\'t need to spend anything to progress unless you really wanna jump ahead and get the best dinos',
       'Game is alright. Seems bit on the money grabbing side. I don\'t get why the battle challenge that is in placed. The dude gets an extra bonus move each start. The first couple battles it was easy to over look. But as you progress in the rank it begins to get a bit out of hand. And by luck do I best the guy.' ,

       'I love this game...only one thing needs to be changed: the use of Puck and his friends! Should have them spread their "special bubbles" (for lack of a better phrase) out more in a level rather than in a clump at the very beginning...sometimes they\'re of no use',

      'It feels like it was a soccer game that they changed a few thing to make it a hockey game.  That said it\'s not too bad.  I don\'t understand the finance part and there is no where to explain it.  The transfer portion is odd too.  The player got way more expensive with the last update.  It is irritating that I can\'t afford to sign my prospects once they are fully realized.  If I develop a 71 rated prospect it will cost me $700000 to sign him.  That is approximately 300 coins.  I could just let him walk and use those coins to sign 2 73 rated players... It makes no sense.  I have to forgo upgrades to afford to sign prospects.',
       'I like the game. You can do good if you put some thought into it. My only  complaint, is that I didn\'t make it to the next level at season end which is fine but why did I get reset at the minimum for that level and I check the standings and there are teams that already have enough points to make the next level?  I\'m 15-0 in my season and still 100 pts behind the leading team and not even in the top 1000.',
       'Abritrary garbage.  Great concept, poor execution.  Built a solid team and still lose even when ratings are better then opponents consistently.  Out shoot the opponent 97-8 and still lose.  Recommended if you need an exercise in futility in your life.',
       'I\'m really confused as to why I can only win games if I\'m 10+ overall better than my opponent. If we are even close to the same rating I get my butt kicked. It\'s absolutely ridiculous and seriously makes the game not fun.',
       'Not a bad game, but I\'ve noticed lately that the "reimbursed" money from voided contracts doesn\'t get added to my in-game wallet. Which is annoying since I need it to sign players.',
       'Game updates hurt you. Increased value of players to sign yet, left my teams wallet short. No fun when, updates cost me more money.' ,

      'This is a very well thought out game and I love the positive comments when I finally figure out the  way I need to go first so that the next shot is easier to get. Some of these shots are really difficult, if you don\'t get the right basket first. Anyway, I love the challenge. Y\'all got my vote. BEST GAME EVER. Thanks man. I love your guys\' creativity.',
       'This game is fun, but it seems like there are tons of attempts to get you to buy stuff. Plus you can\'t get Panda as a character. But other than that this game is awesome. I don\'t know why on the Dude Perfect channel they advertise it as just for iPhone, but at the very end say it is also available for Android. I recommend this game. It is very fun',
       'This game was good  but could be better. I wish there was something other than just basketball. Like tennis, football, or something like that. Graphics were good. This game is addicting but it\'s hard to get past level 20 if you don\'t have Facebook. So I\'m stuck on trying to get enough stars to get through. Good but could be better',
       'Firstly to John J - I have never paid a cent to play this game and that is why I love this game!! I have been able to complete the whole game 210 levels without paying a dime! That\'s truly awesome! It has been challenging because in order to advance I needed to get 3 stars on all levels to open up the next level for free. Then of course you have the energy bar that runs out, but that\'s ok because it replenishes in reasonable time. I would run out and instead of paying money I would go check an email, or post on Facebook and before too long I\'m back playing a few more shots on dude perfect 2!! So easy, so cheap, so challenging and so much fun and so friggin awesome when you completed level in 3 stars!! I can\'t wait till the next section opens to see what they have in store for us. Thanks.',
       'This game is clearly set up for suckers to pay ridiculous amounts of money to play.   1. Energy bar--- really? 2. Constant ads some of which you have to watch. 3. Want coins? Watch their YouTube videos, get them more views, more money, more endorsements. 4. Don\'t worry, after about $100 you can have everything and probably still have ads. 5. If you can get past all the BS posted above, after about level 35, this game gets so freaking hard that you cannot derive any fun nor entertainment at all.  These guys are entertaining but this game by the devs is clearly set up for money and sucking the entertainment value right out of what could be a fun game.',
       'Would be better if you could do everything without Facebook cos that sorta limits options for some people. Also could you please get rid of the energy bar? That makes things hard. But like that you put your actual voice in it.' ,

I don\'t have a clue why they made this game when it is this horrible. I don\'t recommend this game at all. My rating will say 1 star because there isn\'t a 0 star option. My true rating is 0 star.',
       ',okay it\'s just that when I play the game in like when I cut the hair and stuff and messes up on me like that!! It would be great if y\'all will fix the game and make it like more realistic and more funner and make the controls work better cuz I\'ll be awesome',

       'It was hard to use in general and the graphics a bad. I wish it was more realistic. You don\'t even really get to choose where you cut.',

      'I think SA should do a better job than what they are doing. Including me we all be screwed not once not twice but at least five times each player that did not mod and/or hack. You change the damages on skills that should be left alone and over half my friends is in Hacker Hell so my question to u guys fix this and give us some gifts cuz we\'ve been faithful for giving you guys money and it be nice to receive some compensation.',
       'If you\'re looking for a great game, this is not it!!! It\'s a pay to win, with NOTHING to win. Unless you\'re into running in circles chasing woodland animals for months, having your money stolen, or having your stats lowered by the devs after you\'ve worked on it... I suggest finding a different game. Really look at all these reviews if you don\'t believe me.',
       'Well, the graphics are amazing! There are nice views in the game and the animals look cool aswell. There are a few things I would like SA to add and the first one is: mates and cubs. Second is: add friends. Third is: you can eat your own prey and drink water. The Last one is: to make your own separate packs (atleast 5 wolves in each.) That\'s all! If you do any of these I will rate 5 stars! Other than that this is an amazing game. I like the way you can choose your wolf. Recommended for sure!!!!',
       'This game is very nice! But I would suggest adding a single player, so that you can find your mate, make pups and bring them with you on multi player! Also add more wolf colors and designs! You could also make different landscapes if you want and if you can, you shouls also add bosses and dens for us to live at, this game is very nice and addictive, but I think that if you add all that I mentioned it would become even more popular and addictive! Please hear my plea!',
       'This game is amazing the best game I love it so much. But I wish the game look like loading screen and plz plz plz make them the wolf better like the white wolf should be fast and stronger where as the the grey wolf should be strong and have more health and the Mexican wolf should be good in defences and health and black wolf should be good in strength and health and speed and there should be multiple maps and are there holiday skins. And it will be nice If you can add friend plz add some different skin for the white wolf. Like the mighty wolf should be in the white wolf category. Edit- I would love it if you .ca  make it night with different animals. And one more thing the creates of this game can you plz plz plz plz make a Dragon game like this cause there are not a lot of nice dragon game out there. Like the white wolf have an ice dragon and plz make a lightning Dragon it is my favourite element.  If you can do all of this I would be so happy .',
       'Too much lag. we won\'t receive each others messages. People will appear offline when they are on. I\'m not the only one with these problems some of my friends have it too. Could you fix it like I\'m not joking. I love this game but cmon fix it. Also, add more wolves pz. Best simulator ever.' ,

      'Well overall it is good... Gesture controls are not that much good... So, i insisted to keep on classic controls... It helps me to make a perfect through pass and a perfect finish...but what i couldn\'t like is the finishing... I love football too much and i am fc barcelona follower... So i will try to make a sequence of passes and boom..! Goal... But i want to score goal by myself... Means that if i want to curve the ball so i can fool the keeper from the long distance... Similar in free kicks... There are many ways to curve the ball in... And game provides the static ways to score in free kick... So please add this functionality...  Moreover of that... I love the game ... It\'s good... And make it evolve',
       'Loved playing the game.Though the controls in the previous version were a bit average but then too they were just ok.but the new update just ruined the controls. Don\'t know who\'s the person who gave the team the idea to remove the direction stick from the advanced controls. and now  it\'s almost impossible to score against a 5star opponent. Hope konami team is listening and might take some actions in the next update.',
       'I love PES18. I have changed the ratings to 1 star because KONAMI have decreased the Squad value of s18 A players and again we have to put effort to sign s18 B marquee players to increase our squad value. I don\'t know What is the need of this update?  I am not happy with update KONAMI or else you can change s18 A and s18 B have same squad value then I will change my rating to 5 star.',
       'नमस्कार । आपकी गेम तो अच्छी है पर इसमें गंद बहुत डाल रखा है आपने । Like a ball gets reduce from special agent on each search , then why not in agents ? Getting black ball is like getting a fairy tale angel to get married. Groe up konami and let us have some fun.',
       '22 Feb \'18: It\'s time to talk. Hope Konami reads this. Type of player like s17/s18A/s18B keeps the game going, but as you can see s17 and s18A has not got any more values. So I recommend that after every season update you take every previous season players. In place of that give exact same color ball draw. I have s17 Messi, Higuain, Godin, Czech black ball and many more gold balls. So you give me 4 black ball draw and exact same amount of gold ball draw. It should apply to every user depending on how many previous season players (and what color) they have. but we want latest season players so that our squad values does not drop down after so many months of hard work. There will be still an amount of luck as I don\'t know which black ball player I will get in place of Messi, So it will be better if position is also added like in PESCM (But I know you guys won\'t do that, but at least give same color ball draw). Don\'t force YOUR customer to hate such a splendid game. Remember you guys have done a lot of hard work also. Thank you.',
       'This was the best sports game for mobile. But current events made the gameplay worst. And the variants making it more worst. Highly dissatisfied and disappointed after the latest update. No ratings changed for deserving players and the tours are more unreal. Variants are causing more problems. Huge fanbase is in dismay. We hope that Konami\'s pes mobile just doesn\'t die.' ,

       'I really like this game and its one that I can play continuously, my only problem is that I can only play once a day.. the game will work for as long as I play but as soon as I exit I can\'t back on until the following day. It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can\'t just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...',
       'Good but buggy Good but buggy, one can earn infinite money in no time then u can upgrade ur vehicle to the max in the very first level. That destroys the fun of the game. Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.',
       'Yesss. I complete this game in 7 days. I can\'t understand the ending why that cantenar shake. It\'s mean the zombie are in the cantenar? It\'s mean part 3 will exist? Awesome game. I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don\'t read it before. I can\'t find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....',

      'not gonna mention too much ads, doesn\'t bother me so much. what bother me are words that dont belong in certain language ( specifically  Croatian here). PAZL isn\'t Croatian word for god sake. Lose too much time seeking that word to finish level ,I\'ve lost my nerves. and thats one of many. stupids',
       'I don\'t know how good is game on other languages but in Croatian it sucks. I\'m deleting this game because of constant repetition of non-existent words in Croatian language... Even all dialects included. I even purchased few times coins just to see which word is it and it wasn\'t Croatian.',
       'An ad after EVERY SINGLE TASK? Really? Too much for me, thanks. Otherwise, the game is fun, graphic is good, I like the variety of languages to choose from. Battery goes to hell while playing, even with sounds off - that\'s also an issue.',
       'Why so much ads??? Continuously during game and after each level two more fullscreen ads. And I can\'t pay without providing personal data. Very bad',
       'Okay app, would have given more points but waaaay too many adds. After each level  an add pops up which is very annoying.',
       'Excelent game, but I think that I found something which is not necessarily a bug, but it might be a design flaw. I am playing in eng. lang. and if I need to enter 2 similar words, in my case these were "oar" and "boar", application recognized later, longer word first, even if i entered "oar" first, but system rejected it as incorrect one...' ,

      'Boring and repetitive and poorly designed. The obstacles are hard to see. After starting a (new) stage, you don\'t have enough time to avoid the very first obstacle. The rooftop stage is unfair, you cannot avoid obstacles because either the controls don\'t work or because you don\'t have enough reaction time. And restarting from the beginning gets very boring very quickly.',
       'This app won\'t load at all. My son really wanted to play it. He was very exited only to be very disappointed.  I tried deleting and downloading it again but it still did the same thing. I would not recommend this app because all it does is disappoint.',
       'This is a good game and would be great if the controls would respond every time.  When you are playing a game where responsive controls matter, having them fail about every 20th swipe is unacceptable.  The other disappointing thing is that Batman is the only one that says anything.  I worked my way to get Robin and when he didn\'t say anything, I was completely turned off from the game.',
       'The game has a lot of style and that quirky lego movie humour. But if you strip away that you are left with a pretty mediocre by-the-books endless runner. The game has very little innovation, underwhelming and too expensive upgrades and suffers from poor frame rates and glitchy controls.   If you loved the movie you will get some enjoyment from it, but most people should give it a pass.',
       'Love batman, I live for anything lego... this is an utter failure. The first level is beyond difficult for a seasoned veteran. Game to difficult, plot line staging is beyond negligent and shame on the creators for designing such an impossible game to progress through.',

       'This game was actually better than I thought. I thought it was going to be one of those stupid games where it has a stupid amount of ads and stuff, but it was quite good. Unfortunately I had to uninstall this game (I\'m sorry Train Depo!) Because it I already have loads of games. This is a good game and I also love the way that you get loads of money when you go to loads of stations at a park. The only thing is I managed to upgrade all of the stuff for the coaster and don\'t know what to do with it. Other than that, it\'s good',
       'This game is the most boring game ever all u do is just hold down the handle its so boring do not downlode and save ur storage',

      'Amazing game. Me and my friend spend hours on it. I get to shows him my mods. He has none though we both have completed the levels. The game NEVER AND I REPEAT NEVER gets boring. Definitely better than the angry birds series must download. The only problome is the metal flap things don\'t work correctly. They just float in midair.Apart from that  Please make a new selection of levels. My life depends on it!!!!',
       'I would give it a higher rating, but on those levels like 6-18. The button activated doors and platforms don\'t work right and they glitch out. I\'ve been able to get through a few levels without the doors but on 6-18 you can\'t complete the level without this door working. Please get this fixed',
       'Very disappointed that I\'ve had no response to my email and that there is no sign of a fix to the bug with El Porkado, rendering the levels uncompletable. Wouldn\'t be so bad if you didn\'t have some of my actual money!',
       'The game is really good but the bridge bug is annoying. I got stuck on a level and tried to reinstall the app but it did not work. It is so annoying that a really good game like this has a bug that prevents you from finishing the game. Oh and also, what is different about the HD version? It seems to be the exacted same.',
       'Generally great, but destroyed by graphics/world modeling glitches that render levels impossible to complete! Generally involving trap doors that aren\'t in the right place. Frustrating. AND the new cake race won\'t unlock rewards- 24000 hrs to go apparently so I can\'t play more levels.',
       'This game is still my favourite, since I first played it. BTW can you fix the glitches in The Road To El Porkado which where the grey moving panels are out of position' ,

      'So I am a major mobile gamer.  And I must say this game is awesome in a number of ways. My cons however is: arena battles are way too long.     : more clarification should be emphasize on "finish daily or unfurnished daily", I can\'t seem to understand when my daily is completed by looking at the daily chart.  : too much pay to play going on. Mix it up a little plz.   Pros. Great story line.            Epic fighting styles.             Awesome mounts.             Super clean graphics.              Will keep u entertained.',
       'Its a good game. One of the nicest mmorpg on the market right now. However, my only nitpick is the lack of customization of the characters. You get new armor but your actual appearance doesn\'t change except with outfits, but everyone has those so at the end of the day your character does not feel unique at all. The combat and navigation are on point though. Overall a good game but just lack of personal input.',
       'Man I gotta write this again &gt;~&lt;... The only thing u need to fix is the bug that doesn\'t allows you to see the characters... It really anoys me b/c I\'m a girl and only the boy characters are visible so please fix tgis in the next game update! That\'s the only bug that I have experienced! Anyways everyother thing is *AWESOME* btw my character is the puppeteer if that helps in something',
       'Apparently, my first review is gone. It was just a few minutes ago. So basically, I wanted to create a puppeteer but it does not show the avatar in the character creation screen. Same thing goes with the bounty hunter. I\'ve restarted the app, my phone, and re-installed the game. It\'s the same thing. I only see the scythe and shadow for the puppeteer and shadow for the bounty hunter. I\'m not gonna play this game until this issue is fixed.',
       'I just downloaded this game since it looks very beautiful and enjoyable to play. Unfortunately even though I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 the Puppeteer and Bounty Hunter are invisible in-game, even in the character selection. I will rate this game 1 star until this is fixed and I am able to play the game to it\'s fullest. (I did not play past the character selection)',
       'Kinda like this game....BUT why i cannot see my character?? I dont know what im doing,i just look at the shadow moving..how can i control it if i cannot even see my char?? Just moving and tap the skill without seeing what my char doin,might be not sooo very satisfied..will gve 5stars if this thing fix..would be enjoy if i can see my char fight back there..😒😒' ,

      'Far too many ads. And being forced to watch a 30 sec ad before continuing! Sorry, uninstalling. Try banner ads only, and I will play this game for ages. Now you won\'t make any more money out of me. Also, look at the reviews, you obviously haven\'t got a clue about what irritates people.',
       'Potential to be a great game but wayyyy to many ads, like every 10 seconds of gameplay there\'s a 30 second ad, and when you choose to watch an ad to get a reward you never actually get it. Waste of time. No idol earnings so you have to have the app open to advance and forces you to watch more ads.i get you want to make money but this app is basically unplayable.',
       'The game itself is good but seriously the devs are so greedy they have an ad every 15 seconds or so. If it was an ad every 5 minutes or so I\'d probably end up buying no ads and maybe even spending more on microtransactions, but I won\'t support this game or company when they are so blinded by greed they don\'t realise they\'ll have many more consistant players watching more overall ads with just a longer delay in between...',
       'Invasive ads, after most actions. Skippable after 5-10 seconds, but come way too often for this type of game. Games cool, but I uninstalled it after my tenth ad in about ten minutes',
       'The amount of ads this game throws at you every few seconds is just unacceptable. Too many ads! Seriously, every 10-15 seconds a video ad plays when you tap anything. The game would actually be fun but the ads completely ruin it.',
       '1 star for this AD Simulator. I understand you guys need to earn some money, but putting too much ads in your app which is good ruins everything. Consider reducing number of ads. I\'m uninstalling game until this gets resolved.' ,

      'Fungerar och har ambitioner Detta är tre svaga stjärnor. Jag vill gärna gilla detta men det saknas en hel del fin puts på appen och kvalitets innehåll för att jag ska känna att det är värt att spendera pengar på sådant mina barn redan har sett. Det är dessutom hutlöst att förstöra andrahands marknaden så här, att ge bort Bamse är något av det bästa man kan göra.  Installera bara detta om du kan tänka dig slänga bort 300 kr på ganska tråkigt innehåll.',

      'REMOVE TANKS AND ARMOURED SUVS   The game is amazing. All the guns are balanced but there is one big problem... It\'s the TANKS and the SUVS   or make it a banable offence because all people do is camp in the last circle with a tank or a suv. Please fix this and I will rate 5 stars. And I know this is meant to be a minecraft version of pubg but pubg never had tanks or armoured suvs so please fix it. And is it just me but some of the players feel like bots. 😂',
       'Way to many ads. Ad to get to homescreen ad to get to waiting area, ad to get to arena. On top of that kept jumping back to homescreen and loading another ad instead of going to waiting area. Uninstalled, a shame because it seemed quite good.',
       'This game is so fun! I didn\'t expect it to be so good. I imagined that this would be like any other game remake, you know, a lot of glitches, bad graphics, and very high sensitivity. But, to my surprise, it was not like that at all. It was better than expected. I\'m going to be playing this game for a long time. I\'ll tell you that much!   This game is an instant🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟!!! - Andrew from Roboticfalcon21 Reviews',
       'All in all good game but only one major proble is too many ads.  Edit : uninstalled because my upgrades didn\'t stayed upgraded it massed up 🖕 my dopamine level.',
       'Overall it is a great game, but the controls are horrible. A lot of times, the game just won\'t let me move. I can\'t count how many times I have lost a game because of the controls messing up. Also, are the other players bots?',
       'This game is actually mentally retarded. The only good thing I can say is that at least it runs at 60fps. The controls are not always there, for example, in the waiting match, I cannot jump, because the button disappeared. When I was trying to play this with a friend as a joke, I was genuinely confused as to what was going on, and I have played both Fortnite, and PUBG' ,

Make a little bit easy races....and remove line changeable vehicle and police cars...they are motherfu****s!!!!! Disgusting!!!! That\'s why I have to uninstall it...Damn it.. I was so close to end!!!',
       'I am not going to spend a dime to get further in the game. Therefore I will never be able to progress. I would rather spend money to buy the game up front so that I know how much I\'m going to have to spend. The way this game works who knows how much I\'ll have to spend to Beat It. Good bye...your game sucks.',
       'I\'m almost @ the end of level 4. There is no more races after. When are you adding more levels? Also Nitro should be more visible when being used. Rain stages are to noisy. Can hardly hear the bike engine & even after the race the rain noise still goes on',
       'Great game just a suggestion. Like racing fever I think it would be a good idea for a daily spin that maybe you could win cash or a free motorcycle like in racing fever when you win a free car or money I think it would be a great idea and most likely you will have more people downloading this game thanks a lot.

      'Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.',
       'Absolutely amazing game!!! I\'m a huge petrol head and this ticks all boxes considering it\'s a phone game. Love the controls. Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress. Literally one downfall... upgrade costs when you get higher spec cars. Apart from that... GOOD JOB!!!',
       'Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning',
       'Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I\'m just going to name some things that I\'m sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I\'m just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!',
       'This game is brilliant. Have been playing it for ages. However the updates are messing with previous games, especially NASCAR I\'ve been playing previous events but with update they\'ve gone and replaced by new ones, I\'ve been working towards cars etc....all gone. Slightly annoying guys. Keep up with the good work etc but leave the previous ones alone please.',
       'I love this game but, I download it several times! And the download process is always stop at 98.8% and not finishing. And its say Download Error please check your connection setting! But my wifi connection is fine.Please help me ASAP i want this game so much' ,

       'After playing this game, I\'ve really enjoyed what it has to offer. The cars are cool, the graphics are fun, and the ragdoll feature is awesome. But it needs so much more. And I have a few badly needed suggestions. First of all, and most of all, a SAVE REPLAY feature and a SCREENSHOT feature. Adding both of these things would improve the game TREMENDOUSLY. Second of all, GRAPHICS OPTIMIZATION. It can get pretty lagged up on some of my favorite levels. And it\'s the same for other people. And last of all, a VR feature. Like for first person camera, there could be VR compatibility. This is not badly needed, but it would be pretty awesome. So, Secret Exit crew, please please PLEASE read this review, and please consider it. These ideas will make the game better.',

      'Cutest virtual pet game around! I\'ve never had an app so simple, yet it never gets boring. The controls are simple and user-friendly. It\'s easy to earn money, food and useful items just by shaking trees in the community or watching ads. I\'ve gotten many things from letting my Boo sleep and watching ads, then getting to pick a gift. The customization of your personal boo is also fantastic. Great way to entertain children or unwind at the end of the long day.',
       'Do you have a pet? If not, My Boo is a great way to know how it feels to have something to look after. With loads of awesome mini games, it\'s so fun to dress your Boo up in cute outfits and hairstyles! Feed it and play with it and it will love you! Honestly, I don\'t know how else to put this: My Boo is the best (and cutest) game ever!',
       'This game is really fun and cute!! I love it, its great when you\'re super bored, or something. The only problem I\'m having, is the when I go to change my boo\'s name, it won\'t let me delete any of the letters. Sooo... Yeah, um, other than that, its a great game. Also... WHY NO DELETE!?!? 😲 plz fix.',
       'I love this app. I have searched long and hard for a perfect virtual pet, and I found it in this cute little game. I LOVE the minigames, and the cute little sounds and faces the boo makes add to the charm of this game. Also, I love how there are a TON of options for customization, and even different kinds of food. I only wish there weren\'t so many ads and in app purchases... Oh well, a little thing like that won\'t stop me from loving this app.  My little Boo is named Marcellus, and I care for him as though he were a real animal. Lol',
       'It lets you change the style/look. And you can name your boo and lots more! I at first didn\'t think I really would appreciate it. It  is fun it is also sooooo cute you can name your boo anything you like l think it\'s the best game in the whole world!',
       'I love this game. It is like taking care of a real child. I\'m glad this is a free game bc now that ik how this app works I don\'t think i would be able to live without. The only thing I don\'t like is how it takes so much time to move to the next level. 💖💟🖤💜💛💚💙💞🐞😻' ,

      'Fantastically fun game! Easy controls are great, super clean graphics are very welcome, and all for the low price of free install!  My only issues against the game are minor. .When you first start playing a round, you automatically start moving. This forces me to start playing without a strategy. .When your trail is cut, I\'ve seen other players survive by touching their base in a quick fashion, but I haven\'t been able to do that.  Overall, a stellar gaming experience, with minor inconveniences.',
       'It\'s a pretty fun game if not repetitive. However, I have found some possible bugs. Firstly, some avatars bar restarts. For example, if it\'s unlock 15 avatars, the bar isn\'y increasing. And I\'m sure I\'ve unlocked more than 15 avatars. Secondly, I recieved the notification that I\'ve achieved more than 100% in a game which should unlock the gold and silver flags(?). This appeared after I had completed challenge 20, however, I haven\'t unlocked these avatars yet.',
       'I like this game a lot.  I beat it once and have gotten to 90%-80% around 4 times. It\'s really competitive and definitely requires focus. However after becoming so good at the game to where I could get to 40-50% in a single run I realized that I was not going against real people, I was against AI that discovery alone completely shattered my experience as I was under the impression I was against actual people. Now there are some real people here and there and you can tell by their name but most of it is AI',
       'This is a very great game! Its so addictive. I have everyone in my family playing it and friends too, they all love it. As soon as you start playing it your hooked. To the makers please think about adding playing with friends and also maybe powers for the different characters you can win one other thing it would be the number 1 game hands down if you could invite your friend into your arena. Please consider thank you for making such a great game though 👍👍👍💯💯💯✔✔🏆',
       'Amazing and almost perfect game but you should add another way of controlling it. Swiping is hard for me and there\'s some .io games that split the screen and makes it to where you tap the left side to turn left, right for right. I like that much better and it would make it a lot more fun for me',
       'Ok. I take back what I said before about this amazing game. And, why do these weird things ( &gt;b&lt; &gt;/b&lt; ) Keep on showing up in my review? Anyways, this game has incredible gameplay. It\'s so much fun!! And multiple characters? I couldn\'t wish for more!!! Thanks creators. And I\'m sorry for what I said for my last review.' ,

      'It\'s a great game fun to play. But you should also have some mini games to like where you have to stack the food or swipe bad items off the table. And you need to have more mysteries out as soon as possible because I was really getting into the game n I didn\'t have anymore to play',
       'Game was quite easy since I\'m a teenager and its geared towards kids, but I still found it enjoyable. More levels need to be added. Maybe even unlimited mini game mode where you try for high scores. Not the hidden objects one but the one where you stack food and also the eating food one. The game crashed a couple times on me and froze but it was fixable by closing it and going back in.',
       'This is a find objects game for kids. The objects are always the same. They change size and lighting, which changes the color making some objects near impossible to spot. The worst part of the game is the controls. Spacing of objects is often behind another object when you try to click on the object behind you are penalized for selecting the object in front. Also other challenges require swiping accurately and quickly but the interface is to slow making gameplay futile. The story is irrelevant and annoying. The voices are few and not all great. Music is unnoticeable. This should be cool and iconic like the cartoon. Instead it seems quickly thrown togetherm',
       'BEST app EVER made for mobile gaming! I personally can\'t thank you enough for making this game! It doesn\'t even need the stupid IMHO energy to play! You can just play forever :) The only "bad" thing i think its the "poor" voice over! It has all the quotes for all gang members but i just wanted to hear all the captions written in the script with their voices. Other than that it\'s the best game ever played on my cellphone. &lt;3',
       'The game seems to be well done I just can\'t stand the voices used. I grew up with Scooby Doo so I have their voices nearly memorized. So Sorry but won\'t be able to play because of that.',
       'It\'s cute. The tapping could use work. I would tap where an object was and it would take off seconds. Frustrating. When are more levels coming?' ,

      'It\'s an OK game. If it doesn\'t lock up in the next few days I\'ll come back and give a better review.  So many of these games end up costing you a bunch of money, then the errors start. I\'ve already put 3 games on my pad, spent money on them, and now they\'re useless so I will reserve my review until I see what happens with this game.',
       'Move forward, flip over and die Move backward, flip over and die Fire the canon, flip over and die Hit by another canon, flip over and die Ram a tank, flip over and die Rammed by another tank, flip over and die Sit perfectly still, flip over and die.  Terrible, terrible controls.  Edit: I\'m happy to say they removed the Flip and Die feature and now the game is quite enjoyable. Well worth playing!',
       'I like the game. Nice little time-waster. But *please note* that just before the Barracuda/Moon/ability-cards update I was rolling in in-game cash, had upgraded everything physical and had just started to buy the different paintjobs. Then the game reset me to zero earnings/kills/vehicles/upgrades. So it took time to get back up to speed and get everything (except painting) upgraded. Which I did. And was swimming in cash again, with nothing but visuals to spend it on. Bought a couple of those and then gpt Zeroed again! Was going to blame it on the paints, next time I checked in online. Maybe a subtle bug? Except now I find an upgrade, with something else to spend my (lost) game-coins on. Hope it\'s not /that/!  So, anyway, rather than remove and move on, I *will* grind up again. I\'ll get everything, along the way. *Except* the paints. And then see if it zeroes again before the next update, anyway. FYI, both developers and potential players. It\'s entertainment enough that I\'ll put myself through this, but note the mild frustration of the situation. ADDENDUM: Strangest thing - opening after update (but offline again, never yet opened whilst online) I seem to have regained about *half* the updates I thought I had lost, with coin level about where I might expect mid-grind. Also, you\'ve rescaled. Things look smaller, except that level-chooser now has two level-\'icons\' on this (wide) screen rather than three. Usually the left one is the active one (as confirmed by background layers, which goes through odd but maybe intentional \'assemble into position\' effect upon side-scroll selection of a new one). FYI.',

      'The gas traps are way to op. No point in trying to get to the cab, when infected, you die in 3 seconds flat, no way to get rid of it. Alot of thief bugs, such as air support doesn\'t called in when used medkits when used are ignored. And about 50%chance it will not pick up cash from a downed friend. Fun game, just needs some tweaking. Update:it wont let you diffuse the bomb on a fellow thiefs back, even if you spam click it as soon as he grabs it. Edit: speed shoes impossible to hit, super fast cooldown. Cheap. Heres an update for you. Later ranks, snipers are dominate. Rifles take one blow to the body and your dead, level ups dont up your health. Not worth it',
       'It like everything else but I hate that we don\'t get gold from anything and that the sniper rifles and that the bags for the thives cost too much and i will love that the cases we get take less time and have even more slots for even more cases',
       'Update: server crashes alot ,its really hard to reach top 3 rank those player aare pay to win player plus the market sucks',
       'i am go to unistall the game bcoz please check me its not possible my ranking is 09 iam in 25 th level and i can\'t shoot bankers  5 to 6 time to kill bankers how can i kill 4 bankers and snipers kill me only one time shoot  how i archive? first place waste of time   & waste of anything. dot reply fast 😠😠😬   Customer care support was not good ... Irritating me. Not only me',
       'This game is so fun, it involves strategy and shooting. Who doesn\'t love those two things in a game!?',

      'It has a lot of room for improvement, I hope to see more as I play.  Edit: from 5 stars to 3 stars, many problems from the start get ignored by devs due to rich kids pumping money into the game, still an OK game though.',
       'The same problem as previous person. Had 20 days left on Monthly card. Allowance has completely gone as they have introduced a new monthly card. Hopefully a mistake and not a scam. If scammed will be making chargeback of all payments !!',
       'This game is once sided. Players who have had the game for a while dominate the game so that new/weaker players can not advance. Really the only way you can stand a chance is buying packs  which still doesn\'t help as higher levels can attack and steal it. Finally the moderators are non existing and are often apart of the large groups attacking you. A terrible waste of time and money.',
       'Devs should add events or something where prizes has shields. Killing event is just too much a pain where bullying is tolerated. Universal shards are not universal as it covers only a few selected enabler shards...shady! Also sometimes or first log-in of the day it opens with phone media volume maxed and unchangable in-game, too loud. But overall not regreting installing this and will stay in phone for a long time.',
       'Im tired if I\'m being raped by many powerful player in the city, if only there is a balance system so only same lv player can attack... ( but i know its impossible )',
       'The game is great I enjoy playing it but I have two issues with it,   The chat censors are honestly a bit much, simple words that shouldn\'t be censored are and it\'s really annoying.  And the Grammer when taking the girls out on dates is so horrid I can barely understand what the actual heck is going on. I like reading the stories but I can\'t read if I can\'t understand' ,

      'The game is awesome. It is funny, has some challenges, it\'s community is friendly and you can collect familiars. Also you can use your equipment as costumes if you like a specific item\'s look. =D And I didn\'t even talk about the way the game looks like... It\'s the best pixel art I have seen in a while. =) So stop reading and start playing, have fun and thanks for making this game Developers! =D ( The only thing I miss is more coop gameplay =\'D )',
       'Great game and a lot of fun but... waiting for energy REALLY kills this game for me. I really don\'t feel energy limitations should be part of of a dungeon crawler where the object of the game is to run random dungeons for the chance of better loot.  I for one will never spend money on refreshing my energy in a game like this and the energy refresh costs are pretty high.   I feel like it be playing this game none stop if it weren\'t for the energy restrictions.   Otherwise good game and very enjoyable - when I can play.',
       'The perfect MMO RPG for your phone in my personal opinion. If you\'re a fan of dungeon games then this is the game for you. With its cute design, simple combat systems, dungeon patterns and loot systems, you\'ll find yourself easily sucked into the MMORPG world of Bit Heroes. Fight your way through the dungeons and gear up to strike fear imto the creatures who dwell within as well as the other players in challenging PvP matches.',
       'Spent over £200 in game and no legendary pet or accessory. This game uses RNG and it\'s extremely low you can\'t advance past a certain level unless you spend lots of money and even then you have to be extremely lucky to get legendary pet or accessory. Guilds won\'t take you without legendary pet or accessory. Don\'t waste your time on this PAY 2 PLAY game',
       'Perfect, very close to the perfect ultimate bit adventure rpg! I look forward to expanded versions. For this one the only issue i have is when i accept or decline a friend request, and i think duels, the request text lingers above for white someone even tho i already accepted/declined. Great work tho! I love this game!',
       'Was fun while it lasted. Now I can\'t even login to the game. "Disconnected from server" over and over. I troubleshot the issue on my end. No instructions on how to link the game to Kongregate so I can\'t do a fresh install of the game without losing everything. My network is stable. Never had this problem on My other game I\'ve ever played.  And if all you do think the account is sign in to kong in game, did that; then went to the site and it\'s not linked.' ,

      'Doesn\'t like this new update. It ruin my gameplay. My hired buddies is not working at all. I manually put the toppings on the pizza. I did buy all the upgrades before the update. Now i earn less than before. Hope you bring back the one tap auto  toppings. Oh and I\'m glad that you didn\'t remove the auto slice buddy. It\'s the only upgrade that helps you slice better, not "MANUALLY".',
       'While I was playing, my phone battery died and my phone shut off. After turning my phone back on, I now can\'t open the app. When I click on the shortcut, it opens up a black screen for a few seconds and then exits it the app completely and I get a notification saying "Pizza has stopped" it\'s done this a dozen or so times now even after waiting a day. I would just uninstall and reinstall, but I\'m scared I\'ll lose my progress. If my progress is saved to my Google play account, will I be able to get it back?',
       'Very nice! I love the art, cute voices and the game play!  Non I have seen from the others yet that are just bunches of copycats lol. I\'m just into my first hour so  I might change my mind xD',
       'This is best game . Simple and challenging. Difficulty is too high but I managed to figure the real answers and it became good ovenist but to arrange the pizza very well it needs artistic skills.',
       'Really bad. Some people don\'t even say what they want. Then complain when they don\'t get what they want. Just like working at Little Caesars.',
       'Game was working fine until I got to day 40. Every time the day ends, the screen goes black, and then the app crashes and I have to do the same day over again. Please fix' ,

      'This is a wonderful cross stitch app. The picture quality is excellant. Among all apps in the store, this one lets you make  the largest pics from your own. It is  also the most generous option to gain coins. I think the adds blocking colors some reviews mention must depend on your device. I play on 8 in samsung tablet and have no problems. I  have two requests. Would like to play in landscape mode and would like the  ability to turn off the highlighting of the selected color like Cross Stitch world for a little extra challange.',
       'This is my favourite cross stitch game of them all. I love the spin the wheel feature where you can earn bonuses such as gold, protect, etc. I actually don\'t mind the ads as they offset paying actual money for the patterns if you are a bit "broke" at the time and the import feature is great! Totally addicted.',
       'I\'m using my Samsung galaxy s7 and I LOVE this app! Such a great time killer, anxiety reducer, stress reducer. You can even upload your own pics! I just wish the spin would land on things other than 60 coins, unpick and shield. There was a day where I got 5 prizes every spin! That was AWESOME!!!',
       'Don\'t bother playing the mystery ones unless you like cartoon characters. Honestly, it\'s the last thing I want to see when I\'m relaxing after putting 3 kids to bed....more of the same characters that screeched at me all day.',
       'I absolutely love relaxing with this app. Even got my husband and sister addicted. I love to cross stitch in real life but my hands can\'t take it anymore due to health problems and this app has made me able to do what I love without the pain. Thank you for that!',
       'I love it!  I\'d give 5 stars IF there weren\'t ads that pop up when you go back to the home screen each time...I don\'t mind watching the ads to get coins though, those are fine! Love being able to import my own pics to use too! Awesome app!  As of 2-8-18  ***Having issues with duplicate images popping up while  coloring and afraid to delete them because I did that once and it deleted my work in progress too...' ,

      'It would be better if.... If you would be able to play MORE THAT ONE NIGHT. And when I used the flashlight I had to tap on the area a good few times before it actually worked. And no I don\'t have a problem with my screen.  I love the PC version of both the games, one of the best horror games in years. I\'ll definitely buy it IF reaction time on the flashlight would improve. I love the storyline and graphics of the game and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to work on night shift at Freddy Fazbear pizzeria.',
       'Creepy and super scary game! Wow!  This games is so awesome and fantastic because it does not log on my cellphone and so scary game!  My 2 nephew are having fun  with this game and actually when the time now is 3 am and the animatronics is going to move, they\'re so tense to watch the cctv because they will see chica the color yellow  bird looking at the camera!  So I give 5 stars to this game and to the Creator of this game.. keep the good work creating a game!  😊😉',
       'This is the best game! Its way better than the first game because there\'s more anamictronics! Moreover instead of doors you get the hall and vents also you have to flash your light at foxy to get him away. You also have a mask to make chica,boany,mango,balloons boy, and Freddy. Mary and net is creepy as hell because she\'s kinda like Freddy in the first one like I mean she comes at you randomly like Freddy in the last one.',
       'Cool but... It will only allow me to play on my phone and I want to also play on my laptop but when I try to download it on my laptop it says its already downloaded on my phone i dont know how to download FNaF on my laptop D: Can you please make a download for laptops/computers? I wanna try it on my laptop (I have a feeling its gunna be scarier than my phone cuz its bigger screen than my phone O.O) Please make a download for laptops and I will rate 5 stars  and it also shows on the screen there\'s night 5 but in game 1',
       'AWESOME I am in love with the 2nd game! It\'s scary and addicting because you want to come back for more! Fnaf is my fav game in the world and I make awesome fan art for it. (Instagram: Laughingsealey) I am saving up for the mobile versions of fnaf even tho I have all the PC versions. I love the graphics and the lore in this game! Actually, this is the only horror game I will play. I spend hours coming up with theory\'s and watching theorists make more theory\'s. Amazing game and it\'s worth the money!',
       'Awesome but... Great game 10 out 10 but where\'s toy Freddy when he gets off the stage? It seems like he rarly goes o the play room and I NEVER see him anywhere else not even in the hallway! Please fix this so we can enjoy the game a little bit more. And, what happened to the demo on five night at freddy\'s 1? Can you please put that back on the app store?' ,

      'Unable to unlocked paid for puzzles I don\'t know whether it\'s because I updated the system on my phone or updated the app but the paid for version of the games are back to being locked. My 3 yr old loves this app so I was happy to pay to unlock the games but I\'m frustrated & disappointed they are no longer accessible.',
       'Actually really nice app This is a great little app for kids. My daughter loves puzzles and after we finished the real thing she loved using this app. She is 3 and does the puzzles by herself on the screen, the putting flowers and snowflakes 9n. Augmented reality bit is cool but would be good to be able to take snapshots. I can do it screen capture though. Good app.',
       'Bloody hell I have to restart tab every time have to exit game....there is no option and I don\'t have a hard button to go home. Made by some idiot',
       'The game is not opening...I don\'t know what to do with the puzzles.alway asking me to pay before opening it, please is there no other way to play without paying.... thank',
       'Don\'t buy in app. Disney rips you off - with everything. New puzzles one moment unlocked the next locked another time.',
