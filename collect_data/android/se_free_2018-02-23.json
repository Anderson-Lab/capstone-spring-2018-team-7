I\'m newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me.

      'A simple game that\'s like a modern version of an old school racing game I played. It\'s cool for the most part but it is lacking in the department of how to earn money. I wish your developers could add another way to get money than just multiplayer after you complete the career mode. It\'s also incredibly hard to find parts to cars you want without gems. This is mostly a pay to win game, I know but you already have a ton of ads so why make the game less enjoyable by having only two ways to make money? One is temporary and the other is permanent but you earn so little. I still enjoy the game but consider what I had to say, thank you.',
       'Its overall a great game. I like the tracks and the cars. I just wished you could re-earn money by replaying tracks, but put it at half amount that way it gives people that dont want to spend money on the game a chance on singleplayer.  FIX THE LAG because you finish in first and you end up getting second, third or fourth because of the lag.',
       'Game is good. Do not even waste your time paying to get rid of ads. They will rip you off. I paid to get rid of them and you still have to watch videos to claim your money that you won. You have been warned. Would have given five stars if it were not for admin stealing money',
       'I am at level 6 and on stage 2. I am noticing that the game is kinda lacking in car part drops. The level progress is fine, the amount that it costs to upgrade vehicles is fine, the fact that you can use gems to unlock cars is fine, but I am not seeing enough car part drops to keep the game from becoming stagnant.',
       'I really like the game, but it is tricky to control the car. Plus I really like the paint, it was a good idea to make stripes and fire as a pattern, but the paints that are with out pattern are NOT good, because at the front of the car is brown and the rest is one colour, so it doesn\'t look nice. Still I really like the game. My friend had a little brother and her little brother gone crazy of this game because he LOVED IT!',
       'Annoying adds. Draining my internet data i dont like it! Every challenges in multiplayer need to watch the adds so you will receive the reward nope that\'s horible. I prefer playing a free game so i don\'t like this kind of game. Its just simple thia is money game!!!' ,

      'I love it very much. I also have some sugjestons to make. I think you should make categories for Thu pictures (animals,people,food,ect) and also have a daily challenge where you have to finish a picture (that you say) and we have to finish it. You would get a prize of a amount of coins and you could save them up to buy new pictures or tools like the bomb. But i really like this game. So even if you don\'t do my sugjestons I will still love it. ❤❤❤',
       'In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it\'s just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.',
       'AMAZING GAME! I am SOOOOOO HAPPY with this game! ITS SOO ADDICTIVE TO PLAY! SOOO MANY PICTURES TO CHOOSE FROM! THERE\'S EVEN A TRUMP ONE(which is EXTREMELY funny)! THIS IS THE-BEST-GAME-EVER THAT I HAVE PLAYED!I LOVE THIS GAME SOOO MUCH THAT YOU, YES YOU, SHOULD GO DOWNLOAD PIXEL  ART RIGHT NOW! YES RIGHT NOW! SO GO AHEAD AND DOWNLOAD IT!!! (also this is the longest thing i have EVER typed on my phone!)',
       'I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It\'s kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.☺',
       'I love this game and both myself n my grandbabies love doing the pics. It would b awsome to have n categories or level of pic. Didn\'t know about the bomb and other help. I would also suggest to move or when u r doing pic for the back button n save button to hide . I\'m always intrupting my pic by hitting the by accident . N also to b able to open the pic at a spot by touches instead of expanding pic. Expecially for more detailed pics. Love it Ty .',
       'Awesome app, its oddly satisfying and can either be really challenging ir really easy. Its constantly update with new pictures to do, and already contains probably hundreds lol, if dont 75+ and in saving the really detailed ones for last. If there even is such a thing. But, i think a counter for how many blocks of each color are left would be a really awesome alteration. There are many strategies to use when you do a color by number. So a counter for how many blocks of the selected number are left, it would be such a life save.this game has taken enough of my life already as is lmao' ,

      'At first, this is a fun little puzzle game. The levels are entertaining and simply addicting. But... This game takes quite a turn. I can\'t say for sure when it began, but I\'m on level 85 and it has become hilariously impossible to proceed. The levels become so ridiculously difficult that you need to spend real money to move forward. In other words, simple fun levels to get you hooked, followed by insanely difficult level to get you to pay. Over all, fun for the first 20 - 40 levels. Enjoy it while it lasts.',
       'Very fun and entertaining. I really like slow paced relaxing games and this is just that. There is no time limit so you can play at your own pace. Also there is minimal ads for a free game which is part of what makes this game so great. Such a great game for killing some time in a waiting room or just sitting at home trying to pass the time. This game truly deserves 5 stars. I love it!',
       'It\'s a fun little candy crush clone.  Nothing special but a good time waster.  I rated it as low as I did because of the lie they feed up about  the word random.  Tiles and rocket placement arnt random by any  means.  They say it is but random constitutes moves that work in your favor once and a while.  Ive spent DAYS on single levels.  If you need a rocket to point down, there\'s a good chance it\'ll point left/right.  You want that yellow tile, not happening.  I\'m all for the challenge.  I expect it.  But make it random.',
       'I do enjoy this game but certain levels don\'t give you enough moves to complete the level. The ones you have to match the cubes with the colors makes it impossible to pass when the game doesn\'t give you moves to do so. You waste your moves on areas that doesn\'t give you the opportunity to pass the level and then you don\'t have any moves left before it does give you the moves you need it does get frustrating you get stuck on that level and can\'t pass it. Which will just make you want to unistall the game cause you will never leave that level.',
       'I absolutely love this game. The graphics are spectacular. The characters well they\'re not characters their cartoons they\'re amazing. And the game is fun. My only complaint is that every level is a struggle to get through and it would be nice if occasionally they would make a few of them easier.',
       'You will not believe what I am about you tell you but this game picks and chooses who to charge for rewards. I have screenshots of my partner\'s game, not having to pay for his rewards and I look at my game, getting charged $2.99 everytime I want my rewards. Its messed up and I have deleted the game.' ,

As with all great puzzlers, Six! is great in one minute bursts or hours of emotive fun.In the game you are challenged to interact with a tower block of varying shaped bricks upon which rests a hexagonal block. The aim is to get the hexagon down the tower block to earn points.  You do this by tapping the bricks to make them disappear bringing the hexagon down into the space cleared underneath.It sounds easy, but when the hexagon starts to roll or the tower tilts, and with pressure of high scores you’ll find it’s not as easy as you originally thought. If the removal of the blocks topples the tower  or the hexagon gains momentum and rolls off the screen, then it’s game over and you have to start all over again.  Challenging, emotive and blissfully simple to play. Six! will have you hooked on getting as far down the tower as possible. In keeping with Gram Games’ hits, playing this game is simple and fun, but claiming a spot on the leaderboard and bettering your friends is challenging and rewarding.Key Features●    Easy to learn and fun to master gameplay●    Challenge your friend’s high scores, challenge the world.●    Fun and engaging graphics.●    Engaging and addictive.●    Play for a few minutes or hours at a time.',

      'I love this game and would have rated it a 5 but suddenly the pause feature isn\'t working and I lost a game that was over 8000 points because I had a phone call. After I unpaused it set me back to zero. So aggravating. Also the 30 second ad for 30 stars doesn\'t show up anymore. Not sure what happened to this game in the last 2 weeks.',
       'This used to be an awesome game. I played it every day! But after the latest update, the ads at the top cause the game to lag terribly and make the ball fall very slowly and the pieces disappear slowly.  I can\'t adjust as needed due to the lag. I\'m unable to play due to this lag. Interestingly enough, when I turn on Airplane Mode thereby disabling the ads across the top, everything runs smoothly like it used to!! I am all for ads to support the developers  but this type they currently have causes severe lag which has rendered the game useless.',
       'I really like this game, especially now that new levels were added and different areas instead of just the daily challenges and up to level 99, but since the update I have to do the daily challenges twice before it accepts that I\'ve done them. Every single day it resets my daily challenges after having just completed the new daily challenge. It\'s irritating.',
       'Sadly, it could\'ve been a fun game if I could actually tap where I wanted to. The tap is off by like a few mm or something. I have to tap above the try again button to actually try again, or else I end up hitting challenges... So during the game play the exact same thing would happen, which makes the game unplayable.',
       'This game was very addictive I used to play it everyday.This new update sucks. Nobody likes so you mise well change it back because you were getting better reviews. I am going no further with this game and deleting. Folks pleaseeeeeeee don\'t waste your time in this game unless your a lonely man or women with 30 cats',
       'It was overall a great game and great  way to pass time but my experience was ruined by the countless ads popping up on the screen. Within the first few minutes of playing the game I got three thirty second long ads. I do recommend this if you don\'t mind ads but I would probably just not waste my time.' ,

      'Progress loss. Try the suggestion I saw from the reply to others coment but only pop up for reopen the app. Please fix the problem or most player won\'t stay no to mention spend on the app.  Even update to the latest version, it still load to the lvl 1 version. But still have previous achievement done in my Google account. It become annoying r o player.  And I can not even register on Bandai for a account to issue a formal complaint.',
       'Updated review: The issue with account data loss is fixed with the help of the workaround given by Dev team... Loving this game all over again. Yet to test the latest update though. Previous review: Lost my progress since today noon IST. I\'m able to see the progress and acheivements in Google Play Games app but whenever I load the game it begins with the tutorial. Devs, kindly resolve the issue as I loved the game so much...',
       'When I first started a couple of days ago, I made a little progress. Then yesterday all that was lost so I started again and reached much farther away. Today all of it was reset again and I lost all that progress but my old account was restored! Please let me retrieve my second account, I have gone MUCH further in that account starting second time. I had managed to get 4 Level 2 players and few level 3 shards.. I dont wana start from scratch again...',
       'Not like the typical console beat\'em up Tekken but its better than the previous mobile Tekken game from before, more involved than playing rock-paper-scissor system. The \'adventure\' mode is somewhat similar to Tekken 6 where you collect better \'gears\' to improve your character, simple but its fun and thats whats missing in Tekken 7. Game somewhat laggy but being ver0.9, we\'ll see how they will fix it.',
       'This game is good but I am not able to load my account ( I have changed my phone ) whereas I have saved it( in my previous phone)I have tried the steps given by you but it is not working. Whenever I try your step a pop-up comes saying your account is linked to google. Help me i don\'t want to play this game from starting.pleaze fix this problem. The update also has not worked for me. Why does this happen?',
       'If you are expecting something like the old teken stuff I remember on play station. This is not it, it is like any other game where you will need to buy gems etc. It does not remind me of those games other than characters.' ,

      'This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don\'t worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you\'ll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!',
       'I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who\'s better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn\'t seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don\'t think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.',
       'This game has no WORLD\'S favourite song  DESPACITO  SO i m hating it tooooo much  when i see this then i think that let\'s download it bcoz it contains despacito song also but when i see all album of this app then i started hated it. So i would request from CHEETAH GAMES that plezz add DESPACITO SONG also in it This is my humble request from CHEETAH GAMES.',
       'It\'s been 4 months since my report that the game has such a major glitch, still NO improvement. I lost so many lives just because the song suddenly slowed down and then as suddenly fast forwarding itself, there\'s no rhythm at all. Why don\'t you just fix the glitch first rather than add more songs.. Now, at 2018, it\'s only getting worse..',
       'This game is honestly a great time-killer and even has it\'s challenging parts, but from what I\'ve noticed as you get to the higher tier songs they just get slower and slower and are just flat with barely any challenge. I expected more of a challenge with a higher level but now this game is getting horribly boring.',
       'I\'m in love with this game. It\'s challenging, you don\'t have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks.' ,

      'This game is fantastic! The style, sounds, and music set a fun and cartoon-ish tone, and the gameplay adds a sense of tension and suspense as the player does not know what the next obstacle will be and cannot stop the character completely as the sausage continues to walk onward. This game is fun to play and hilarious (specifically the sausage\'s dying cries/animations), and the obstacles aren\'t predictable, but the pace is initially too slow, making the game a bit boring at the beginning. I would like to see a game mode that increases the pace right from the start, like a speed mode, and new dying cries/animations and obstacles in future updates. However, as the game is right now, it\'s a lot of fun. Definitely recommend.',
       'It started lagging a bit since the last couple updates, the lag gets very distracting and annoying. Otherwise is a great game!',
       'Really fun game, always wanting you to get further than you did last time. The additional hazards change things up too which keeps you on your toes.',
       'Love love love this Game but the new update with the new obsticals is horrible. Most if them you can\'t get through due to being glitched. Seriously addicted to this game fix it 😭😭😭😭😭😭',
       'Good game over all, glad they fixed some of the bugs in the update, i hated dying when ever i got an "enlarge" the immediately after i get the horizontal blade, fun and good for passing a few minutes',
       'It is very fun I play with my friends slot and I beat them it\'s like subway surfer just you die and your some meat so I recommend it I\'m a real reviewer 😀😀' ,

      'Pretty, addicting and intriguing. Love the gameplay so far, and no purchases are required (they help a lot, though). Constant technical issues are a great nuisance, however. Force stop or reboot is usually needed to get the game running, and models occasionally fail to load (playing on a oneplus 5). All in all, thumbs up for a great and non-greedy game, which could use some serious bugfixing.',
       'Black screen on load. Will not load or go past blank screen. Tried everything and nothing works.   EDIT: After the latest update it is working fine again. Awesome game and very addicting. would be great if had an option to gain resources or something from ships enroute while waiting for them to return',
       'Very cute idea and addictive! However I wouldn\'t mind away to speed up the ships even by watching a few game adverts. 2 hours for most voyages leaves you with no play left after 5 minutes of sending your ships out. I love the idea though and perhaps an Airport game would be fun to have too!',
       'This is a really nice game. I\'m enjoying immensely.  There is one thing I\'d like to see happen. Every time I collect wood andmstone, the big hand comes on the screen to point at the buildings. Now useful as It was in the tutorial,  I now don\'t need to remind me. Can you get rid of it?',
       'Graphics are really beautiful. Controls work 90% of the time, 10% of it requiring you to tap 2 to 3 times due to it being unresponsive. Gameplay wise, its great at first, then after a while the wait times are too long and there is very little gameplay to fill the time in between voyages.  Overall, great graphics, controls can be optimized, gameplay can be more in depth and varied? I find myself just comin on every hour or so just to collect and set stuff.',
       'I\'m having one major issue with this game, and it\'s reoccurring. It keeps stating it Error cannot connect, even though my signal has full strength. Come on developers, my provider says that there\'s no problem my end, that leaves only one end possible, doesn\'t it!!' ,

      'This game was great until the most recent update now I dont play as much. Only being able to save 25 cupcakes when before tgere was no limit IS terrible! I\'ve purchased boost to pass a level & several times when I\'ve used them the game freezes so I lose the boost. I contacted customer service got a generic response & no refund but they want me to rate their service 🤔 no thanks! I loved the game before but not so much now!!',
       'Would of gave full marks but on a few cooking appliances when I tap on it doesn\'t work. Second I think it would help if you could carry money over from one country to another and convert currency. Some of the levels are hard to achieve and you don\'t earn enough power ups and spoons to help you through the levels plus restore lives take ages. Customer waiting is to quick.',
       'I LOVED this game before the update .. now it won\'t even let me play it because it keeps telling me to please update it. That wouldn\'t be a problem only that it IS updated ... my phone got the update and is playable but on my tablet it won\'t update and in the app store it says open or uninstall so obviously it\'s updated.. I like playing on my tablet because it\'s bigger and easier to see .. PLEASE FIX THIS !!!',
       'It is a great game and very fun to play but just needs a little more to it. The one thing I can\'t figure out is why do we keep getting coins if we can\'t use them to purchase anything after you get all the upgrades on your ingredients. There should be a use for them or stop giving us coins in the rewards of each day. I wish there more things to buy or if the coins could be transferred to the next level or something. Okay thanks. P.S. I was just enjoying this game until you guys decided to cut my cup cakes down to 25 only so that means I have been saving mine only to know that after I use them up I can only get 25 at a time well that sucks and I hope you change that back if not my time with this game has come to an end.',
       'Was a great,  fun game,  but now with the new Update things will not download.  I\'ve sent emails to them and nothing has change.  I did receive an email back asking to rate their and of course I told them you don\'t want me to rate something I never received!!  Can\'t open game,  this issue has gotten worse!!😡',
       'I LOVE IT!!  Very addictive & challenging. My only problem is that I accidentally uninstalled it while removing games from my tablet that I no longer play. I had just reached level 50 so now I have to start all over again. Fortunately this is one game I don\'t mind doing that with!!' ,

      'i love roblox but i have been having some diffuculties lately 1. when i join a game i havent been able to move but i had found a solution to this just by changing the movement 2. now i have been joining any game and it wont let me move my mice itll just be in the top left corner so can this bug be fixed as i had just bought 400 robux and bloxburg and havent had the chance to play it!',
       'With each *regular update* this app has gotten worse. Now none of the high quality mobile servers can be played because the app can\'t fit that into itself, thus causing a disconnect. My perfectly ok phone was playing this fine until recently, but now the app can\'t even play what little it could to begin with. Just remove the app from the store already.',
       'For some reason roblox stopped working today im on chrome and usely it works but today i tried play roblox and the mouse will not work it goes in the top left corner if anyone knows whats going on tell me please and fix this roblox!!! I love roblox dont want to lose it!! Hopfully you fix this i have seen its not just me but other aswell whats happening. whatever you did inm that update ruined my gameplay',
       'If you are a chromebook user I would half recomend this, I played it on my kindle and it was a great game! But when I got it on here a nearly everytime I joined a game a could not mover my character, I could do everything else though, and then lateley it has evolver into where I can not move, look around, or even click on anything, and for example you can press esc to open the settings, but when I did that it did not respond. If you are not a chrome book user then GET THIS GAME NOW!! It is great with millions of games and people to friend and play games with. But for chromebook users, 1 star, any other device, 5 stars',
       'I would\'ve rated this 5 stars if it didn\'t litterally ban NUMBERS, and also it\'s got A LOT of bugs... Can someone PLEASE do something about these things? It\'s still an amazing app but still, please try and fix this.',
       'First of all still very disaponted at the update. If my chromebook is going to stay like this then make and roblox app specifically for chromebooks so that you dont have to put it on the playstore for chromebooks. You put xbox controls on my chromebook and now I dont know what to do because i dont have an xbox controller.  If you dont fix now then just please get off the playstore. I saw other reviews by other who have the same model and I dont think their happy at all and neither am I.' ,

      'This is better than the browser version for multiple reasons. 1) It doesn\'t lag as much. I played a few rounds a noticed a little bit of lag, but it\'s better than the browser version.  2) You can play against AI if you don\'t want to play against people. I like this because I actually had a chance to win and was able to kill some. 3) You can create your own custom skin, which is awesome. All of this is free as well. I love this version of Slither.io.',
       'this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It\'s so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It\'s just so addicting and I can\'t get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the \'play online\' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊',
       'I\'ve recently upgraded from cubot to galaxy s7 and unfortunately the game is not working properly like it did on the old cubot phone. The screen gets stopping and it\'s impossible to play. I\'ve tried uninstalling and changing Wi-Fi settings but nothing worked. Other than that the game is sick! Love it,my kids love it and it\'s fun to play.',
       'So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I\'ll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It\'s in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I\'ve ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍',
       'Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃',
       'I\'m highly addicted to this game. It\'s a thousand times better then agar.io in my opinion and it\'s really cool that you get to create your own skin. The only downer is that I just wish there was some music because you start to get a bit bored after a while.This game is NOT a waste of time, and everyone needs to download it to experience the awesomeness!' ,

      'So nice to sit and enjoy a game of challenge. Almost as much fun as chess, but easier to carry. Great way to relax while waiting for the zombie apocalypse or the bus to come. Thank-you and keep up the awesome work.  *UPDATE* 17 FEB 2018.  Have started my friends and family trying to get Top Score. No one is really trying as they are all enjoying playing the app to care. Brought a tear to my eye. Once again, "Thank-you"  for a truly  wonderful game.',
       'Great game. Starts easy so you can get your eye in and then gets harder. Fun to play and not so difficult that you give up and uninstal. Ads are over fairly quickly and I like that you can choose to watch some to get extra coins.',
       'I love this game and I just start playing and I already have the iron ball!how cool is that!..........but there is ad after I pass every levels.If you can please fix this thing! :)',

      'Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!',
       'Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm\'s Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!',
       'Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I\'m just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it\'s going to be good.  We\'ll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!',
       'This game is awesome!! Just one thing... You might want to fix Power Trip, because if you miss the gravity pad in the robot part it\'s pretty much an insta-win. I don\'t know if it was meant to be there but if it wasn\'t, you should probably put some spikes there or something.',
       'This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10',
       'I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.' ,

      'So I played it on my iPhone e and loved it. Recently o got a new phone and it\'s am android. I connected to my Nintendo account and loaded it up. My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I\'m not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr',
       'I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',
       'Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I\'m paying £9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn\'t make it worth the price being asked.',
       'Like a big lugger spit in your eye if your a Mario fan. Iv played since the first Mario. For one I very very much hate how u can not control Mario really u just run forward very very annoying. I\'d be OK with this if not for the insane price they ask to move on after the 1st world! Highly disappointed in this. Make it like Mario or get rid of it personally',
       'Super Mario run is a great smartphone game it has the very addicting toad rally and remix ten and the simple, but very rewarding controls. The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars',
       'I beat world 1, and I have to pay for the rest of the game? Really? This is stupid.. If you\'re going to have a game you need to pay for, market it as such, not the ol bait and switch. Very deceitful.. At least make a trial game or demo game not lure someone in and then tell them they need to pay to finish the game' ,

      'I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It\'s pricey but we\'ll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn\'t need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get',
       'Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn\'t need to have the internet on. Don\'t know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.',
       'This game is truly addictive! I just wish you gained more crystals.  It would be great if you could get more than 2 crystals after logging in for 20 days straight. It should be:  2 daily until 20 days.  20th day 10 crystals   3 daily 21st -29th  30th day 10 crystals 4  daily 31st-39th 40th day 10 crystals 50th day  20 crystals You get the idea.',
       'this is a very well made game with excellent graphics and challenging play. It is however very money focused. The beginning levels are structured to encourage upgrades which at first are reasonable. Each later stage requires more diamonds to complete. The so called \'challenges\' are Impossible to complete without upgrading every implement so are essentially impossible for free play. Players beware!',
       'I love the way this game plays, and it plays like a dream. The grafics are wonderful, but there is just one flaw. The diamonds. You have to either play for a long time to earn more diamonds, and you can, or buy them with real money. And the game causes you to spend more diamonds than you can earn. From the atmosphere itself, to the food, and the appliances. Unless you have a lot of time and patience, or have the money to buy diamonds, this game might grind your nerves.',
       'Very nice graphics and addictive. The best thing is that it does not force you to pay for better progress. Ads are not noticeable. It provides a very comfortable playing environment.  It could be even better if the food can be more sensitive to touch. I always fail to grab those cooking food causing them to be burnt. Nice game overall though.' ,

      'Love it! I play it all the time! You can play online or offline - online gives you a chance to revive. Has course like game play or continuous. No pause which is understandable but kinda sucks. Once you get the hang of the controls it becomes  addicting. Would like to see more land and background options... maybe on the next update??',
       'Entirely too many ads.  Look I understand as a free app you have put time into this and some money back is nice.  But this is way over board with the ads. The game is fun, easy, and plays well. However it\'s not worth paying to remove ads. Ads are a necessary thing if you are looking looking to make money from your creation, however this mean is just ignorance and the main reason I uninstalled.',
       'tl;dr: Good game mechanics.  Ads are the worst ever, and the pay to remove them doesn\'t work. Would recommend if you don\'t mind watching long ads constantly.   Review: The base game is awesome. I love the mechanics and graphics. If you want a solid game, this is it.   However. I REFUSE to give this a good rating for 2 reasons.  1) The amount of ads is outrageous. I get they need to keep the lights on, but come on I don\'t want a 30 second video every time I "die" 2) I was willing to pay for the game to get rid of the ads. Well, don\'t do that. It doesn\'t actually work. I restarted my phone, reinstalled it, and did the force stop to confirm it wasn\'t a minor glitch. If you\'re going to have a pay to remove ad feature, make sure it works. Luckily I was able to get a refund from Google.',
       'I gannruntee this won\'t make it on the review list but oh well. I just uninstalled this game because I paid the $2.49 for no ads and it doesn\'t work. Don\'t waste your time or money. I really like the game bit there are way TOO MANY ads and when you try to hit home to bypass the ads the game freezes up. So until they fix the problem I WILL NOT download this game. I\'ll find another one similar.',
       'It sucks. It\'s not supposed to be an ad display app with a game thrown in every once in a while. I opened the game, it showed an ad. Played the first time, it showed an ad and asked me to rate it. Played a third time, it showed an ad and asked me to rate it so I did. 1 star since I can\'t even find out if the game is any good because of the damn ads and whining for ratings.',
       'I really like the game actually but I paid to get rid of the dumb ads and yet everyother frickin game more ads. If you pay to get rid of the ads the shouldn\'t be any. NONE So they took my money and gave me nothing for it so to me they kinda stole my money. To me thats not right. How many people are they takimg money from without fulfilling their end.' ,

      'Me and my son have had fun with this game and made an attempt to collect all characters. The game is set up so you can not earn all of the characters but have to buy the last couple in a cash grab. It would be fine if they we\'re only available for real money but the game gives the illusion that you can win them in a chest. One that we have spun over 50 times without success',
       'Great timewaster! There are a lot of characters to earn and you don\'t need to spend real money to get them, so that\'s a plus. However, rated it a 3 cuz there are sooooo many ads. I get that ads generate the revenue to keep a good game free but an ad populates for literally every action. Win a game=ad, lose a game=ad, go to the settings=ad, change the volume=ad... ok the last one is fictitious but it really seems like that\'s how it works',
       'Love the game, its fun, addictive, and challenging. It makes you actually think before you do anything. The ads really are a bit much, being that after every single round in a tournament there is one. Also, one major thing, keep up with the updates. IOS users seems to have gotten an update with new characters and pvp mode even but not android',
       'The game is simple to immediately start playing and fun. I shouldn\'t rate a game based off of this but, these pop up adds are tremendously common. Adds are essential so that the app can support itself but to have an add after every single play and then have an add to open a chest? Really? That\'s a bit much, especially, when the adds are not easily skippable and even force you to the download screen of the add. The game is simple, fun, and has witty, silly, and quirky characters. But the adds are a bit much.',
       'The game is amazing, and the ads help them make money, if you made a game this good would just want to let people play it? No, you would want a reward. The only things I don\'t like is that the land is sometimes unfair, my phone randomly mutes, and on my old phone I had this and there were more characters but not now on this phone',
       'The game itself is enjoyable and the controls are quite simple. Very intuitive. But Jesus Christ on a frosty log, the ads are way to much. After every round, ad, want your prize? Ad. Wanna do anything in the game? Enjoy the ad. Jesus guys, I don\'t mind ads and I understand that\'s how you make money, but you shouldn\'t have to watch an ad to get your prize for winning... Come on.' ,

      'Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it\'s advertised too much, but it\'s definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That\'s slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.',
       'Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I\'ll be playing this for a long time! I\'m working on the living room right now, getting close to level 600. Can\'t wait to see what the new character, Jerry, has in store for us! Thank you Playrix!',
       'I loved the game until the last update. Until then, I found it relaxing and challenging. Since the recent update it\'s just aggravating.  The boosters don\'t act upon the same set of rules since the update. I\'ve been on the same level for nearly a week. I\'m on 280, and looking at the number of tasks coming up makes me feel that I will likely uninstall rather than spend my entire life playing. I wish Playtrix would go back to the older version.',
       'Love it! It just needs some adjustments. Too many levels that are way too hard, that takes you 50 tries to beat when you only have 5 lives in the first place. And it should only be beat one level to unlock one task instead of needed to beat two levels to unlock one task. If it\'s going to take 2 stars to unlock a task it should be something big not 2 stars for unlocking a task for cleaning up a little mess!',
       'I really like this Game so Far. I will play for awhile to See how it Works & If I like it. Absolutely Love Your Game. Play it ALL THE TIME!!! I Must Admit that I Really Do enjoy this Game! Sometimes I find myself Having a Hard Time With Certain Levels. I Could be On that Level for Days or a Few Weeks. I think with Some Improvement that Would make People Play. This Game More. But I Must Say Hat\'s Off to The Developers',
       'I delete it then loaded again 7 months later. No change. Still hard as heck. Can\'t get thru the puzzles even with using 30 lives and no power ups. I can see you don\'t care about people and your gonna lose money. You have to be a freaking genius to play this game. And we ain\'t.' ,

      'The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won\'t annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie',
       'Its a legit fun game to play but...  For me I get streshed because when I need to do it over again then u  streshed by not doing it...    Its still kind of a good game though..  Also on YT thanks for...   !!!! 2 SUBSCRIBERS!!!!  I know its not alot but I am rlly happy and I\'m thankfully to who subscribed to me on YT :)  My name was galaxy DJ but now..  Its AngelPlayz I haven\'t even uploaded any videos yet 😂😂 but thanks for the support!  I might be making new videos about roleplays bloxburg builds and games to enturtain u guys to not be bored!!   I LIKE TACCCCOOOOSSSSSSSSS.....  🍍🍍🍍 .. This is so long lol...   Sorry how this is so long 😂😂😂😂 Well yeah that\'s all I got to say..!!?  Cya peace GUYS🍍🍍',
       'Well, I admit, I\'m addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn\'t be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can\'t Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍',
       'It\'s a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it\'s super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.',
       'So rage inducing! But i am a comete noob at your amazing creations. When o first downloaded it 3 yrs ago i hated it a deleyed after failing the first level before getting halfway. Some how though my abillity for rage cam control itself and yea. So in a way you made a rage game that helped my rage. Huh. Anyways great game might buy full version. Only if i can become a good player though',
       'Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it\'s fun because it\'s challenging and there\'s super fun things in GD except hacking because that\'s no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I\'m super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂' ,

      'First of all It\'s joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add "Edit and changing names"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱',
       'I realize y\'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don\'t pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I\'m pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It\'s a pretty good app and I\'ve sent many people to download your app.',
       'Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don\'t decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don\'t mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don\'t actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.',
       '8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don\'t win any games until those coins are over and I\'m only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don\'t know why this is happening but it sucks because it\'s putting me off the game.. it\'s like 8 ball is making sure I\'m losing hence the rate 3',
       'This is the most addictive game i have playing since a bought this phone. All the new updates are cool. Need to get rid of those hackers playin along. Also when we get a phonecall the game reopens, its better if you  reconnect it during the tier its self .. very plesent game give lots of happiness.. make sure you work with above mentioned glitches, then 5* is sure.',
       'I love this game an it is def super fun. Only complaint I have has nothing to do with the actual game play tho. When ever I try to get free coins from doing offers like surveys even tho I do everything it ask in order to get the coins it ends up never giving me the coins even after I do everything it says... plz fix this problem. Or reward me with the coins I never got from completing certain offers.other than that I love the game.' ,

      'I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I\'d end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!',
       'Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It\'s reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series\' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis\'s and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I\'m offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,',
       'I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It\'s fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn\'t want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.',
       'Game it self is great and a ton of fun.   But, the system for showing ads is so annoying.  It\'s not just your normal video ad no, they make you watch 3 different ads and a min of 16 or 11 sec each.  After you have watched the minimum time, you have to hit next and repeat again',
       'Quite addicting. But does have partial microtransaction walls where it\'s extremely difficult to get past certain parts without forking over real money. Other than that it\'s nice. I only have two things that I think could make this game better: 1) boss battles and 2) ability to sort through parts by specific type, rather than just their standard class.',
       'I want to report a glitch. I betted 3 parts, titan, drill, and a repulse. I lost on thd bet, and guess what? The titan car still had that tick on on it, then i got those stickers on the car unlimited. It took me 5 minutes to get back to normal. Please dont use this peopole.' ,

      'One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.',
       'I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That\'s why if I\'m going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.',
       'Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn\'t get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.',
       'Good game. I initially wrote a one star review because this game was very dependant on microtransactions but it\'s actually pretty fun if you have the patience. Right off the bat you have to wait upwards to 30 minutes or an hour for basic production and warming but as you grow your farm it gets easier to deal with. This definitely isn\'t a game you can play for, like, an hour, consecutively, which kinda sucks but it\'s great for the 10-20 minites you pop in now and then.',
       'It is an amazing game. Our entire family is hooked and i love the idea of neighbourhood chat on hay day it is awesome!!! Continue making this game as cool as it is👍. However it would be nice to have private chat on hayday where the entire neighbourhood does not see your conversation. There is also a glitch where i cannot open my daily videos.',

      'This "game" is like empty calories. I ingested it ate it up and left hungry.  There is no goal whatsoever to this game. It is a glorified add campaign intended to keep you going on and on with a false feeling of accomplishment in order push ads on you or make you buy perks. Want to double your earnings for 20 seconds? Watch a 30 second ad. Want to improve earnings for four hours. Watch an ad. You get the point. Of course you can buy these perks but why do any of this? The "game" never really does anything whatsoever. No milestones, no real goals, no anything. Well after about 3 hours of game time and the equivalent of add watching time I am off to ingest something with more substance.',
       'AMAZING! I love this game. It is so addicting and a great way to pass time and boredom. I think though for one small improvement you could add a thing where there are like \'mini games\' and you earn coins for that. Using those coins earend in the mini games you spend it on things like watering cans, fences for live stock and more! This was only some suggestions for a bigger game if you can have or make a new game called like farm life or something like that....LOVE IT...',
       'I have seen this as an ad. I thought I should give it a try. It worked out. Before long, I reached level 15. Now I\'m on level 33 and I have 8.448 trillon gold! I automated 100% of my farm!  I\'m already making lots of gold with automating potatoes. Potatoes give away so much gold! Great update!  Keep up the good work! Thanks, Idle Farming Empire! What a good replacement for Farm Away!                  Idle Farming Empire is like the best simulation for farming. I gave the game 5 stars for a reason. I loved the game! Look under the review! There\'re many people rating the game 5 stars. Over 78,800 people did it! Thanks for everything!',
       'I LOVE THIS GAMEE!! It\'s so addicting and once u get used to it, u can\'t stop playing it! It\'s a great time killer and it auto saves (not of u connected to Facebook.) Again, I love this game and I would recommend this game to EVERYONE because it\'s for all ages (unless u are a very serious person) JK LOL! :D',

    description: 'Children\'s doctor - we all love when people around us smile. We become well and happy when someone on the street gives us a smile. But for a smile to be beautiful, you need to take good care of your teeth. This applies to your pets, because in childhood they were for every kid. Like people, they also sometimes need to treat their teeth. This can be done by a special doctor - dentist. We present to your attention an exciting game for children - a dentist (vet clinic). In this entertaining game, your child is a real dentist, under the guidance of which there is a hospital for animals. The kid is entrusted with a very important and responsible task - the treatment of teeth of his four-footed pups, whose teeth began to ache heavily because of their love for sweets. You have to treat them in a real dental office, use various medical instruments, such as tongs, scalpels, Burmashin and many others, to clean your four-legged friends of teeth from plaque, align them, do operations, remove cavities and fill them. After all, they all just need your help. For her, the animals will be grateful to you and very grateful. Developing games for children, such as a veterinarian, contribute to the overall development of your child. They help to develop fine motor skills, coordination of movements, visual perception, attentiveness and observation, will show the baby how to treat animals, take care of them. Our games for kids, such as a dentist, will teach them not only to treat their pets with love and care, but also to protect their own teeth, do not forget to clean them several times a day, because going to the dentist is not the most pleasant pastime. For the purpose of comprehensive development of the child, we create applications and educational games for children that are aimed to help boys and girls develop basic motor and other skills, and also have fun, fun and useful to spend their free time. All you need is to download games, install and start playing, and in the future your child can choose one of the most needed professions in the world - the dentist Be sure to visit our http://yovogames.com and also we are at:Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZruadkJJTuD4Bgb1F6pa3ATwitter: https://twitter.com/YOVOstudioFacebook: https://facebook.com/yovogames',

      'Okay heres the thing,every f game is with money and this game was so much better without those money,i was 1000 lvl and my tom is gone why? Cuz u didnt made that feature back in the days,also u made this stupid diamonds alll for money,and not coins like it was...its not all about money get it? This game was so popularbback in the days and now is trash with all those videos to watch all those money you need to spend on clothes for tom...its ridiculus...sry for my english im just disapointed cuz u turned this game in real money not coins where you can be able to buy everything by playing like i did....',
       'The newest update is terrible with "to open chests". I must stop every game right after I got a key of four. Then, I can\'t play with my favorite, because Tom is sleeping. Also, it is very bad, the new chests opportunities starts not at midnight like before, but late afternoon (my friend\'s starts 11am) - ridiculous. I reached 99 - can I get back the old version? I don\'t care any firefighter cloth.',
       'Not good for little ones. Too many buttons leading ads or in app purchases. Might be good for kids 6+ who would know a little better but my 3 year old just clicks everything shiny which of course is ads or in app purchases',
       'I think this game is very very fun and addictive! Dont believe people who say talking animal games have people in their eyes, (except maybe Angela) Keep up the good work!',
       'It\'s a good game and nice way to let time pass ... I like it very much tom looks too cute when he\'s young at the age around 5 ... after all I like the game but one thing that I didn\'t like was that after the gems are finished there is no way of getting them back without spending real money so I think there should source in the game which would provide gems however the game is good',
       'Don\'t get me wrong good game, but most of the adds freeze up the game. Plus it has caused pop ups on my phone. Fix that and i will fix my rating' ,

      'This game is good for a good time waster, but eventually it gets boring. The only thing really fun is trying to beat your high score. I think a way to help improve the game is have a high score chart around the  world. So we are going against everyone and trying to beat their high score as well as our own.  You can have many charts. A weekly, monthly, daily, and overall.  And with that being said I think you should incorporate prizes. Which can just be skins for the blocks. Trying to collect all of the skins.    Just a thought and idea. Because there comes a time where it\'s gets boring competing against yourself.',
       'Love the game. I hate that there is a ad after every end. If you have to restart, you\'ll get any ad before you can continue. Outta frustrating Ann\'s makes me not want to play.',
       'The ads are so Terrible they interrupt gameplay now so if you were placing a block forget it it just placed itself because it registers that you let it go. Good game but not worth the annoyance.',
       'Really you have no idea what\'s coming next, so you can\'t plan on your next strategic move. Its all luck if you make it to the next round or not. So theres no challenge. I do appreciate the fact it has no ads.',
       'It would be better if the adverts didn\'t stop you playing the game. Also asking for the rating every five mins pisses me off',
       'It needs an undo option or needs to show two of the next set of 3...maybe even give an option to pick which set you want to play. It\'s frustratingly fun...I get mad and stop playing, but like an addict, I come back. And for those that don\'t like the ads. Turn your phone to airplane mode while playing.' ,

      'Is game could be so much more than it is! After a few weeks, PVP becomes a joke when you are up against paying users who have one shot kill guns and a barrage of armour.  Then single player is just rinse and repeat over and over again.',
       'The latest version is so annoying. On the sniper arena, my men get killed immidiatly at the end of the countdown to begin. If i even shoot any sniper he wont die rather it will finish it shoutout and then turn to my soldier and kill it. I hate now i hate d game. Please do something about it.',
       'Good graphics but the character movements are clunky.  I\'m a hardcore FPS gamer and I like to test the limitations of a game.  So tried shooting a shoulder and the bullet went for a headshot instead whereas I clearly know my aim would miss. Glitchy.  Clunky and not so realistic unfortunately.  So not sure why the high ratings.',
       'The basic concept of the game is fun, but like all games these days, micro transactions are rammed down your throat. I would be fine if that was all but then they time gate you with the weapon upgrades you need for missions and lock content out for you unless you\'ve paid for a better level of gun. Avoid this one.',
       'PvP has really gone down hill over the last few weeks. Kills just seem nonsensical. It doesn\'t look like any more levels are coming either after tier 19. Shame. It was good fun up until now',

      'Love this game! Very entertaining, never boring. My only complaint is with some of the collecting events. You have to do certain things to obtain the necessary items to put together, but for some reason with the current one you don\'t get enough of one item, and too much of another. It would be great if you could trade within your alliance for things like this.',
       'I played Game of War for appx 3 years.  The game started out great, everyone was on a somewhat even playing field. The game advanced to quick and left thousands of players behind. Other Players and I felt we could never keep up.  I hope this game advances at much more slower rate.  We all spend money to enjoy the game!    Don\'t be gready like GOW.  Thank you in advance.  Kirk',
       'Overall great game, however to play and be competitive ait is important to spend. In fact just to unlock some features you must spend at least .99 which is fine by me since I love to spend on this game anyways. I have been playing koa from the start and when this game came out I jumped on the bandwagon in the first 50 kingdom servers. So with that said yes it is LOTS of fun, I love my GoG family and definitely addicting LOL see you on the burning war field ;)',
       'It is a fun game and is the most indepth game I\'ve ever played. That all being said, unless you have a ton of money and a lot of time there is no way this game is worth it. I\'ve spend over $100 and play multiple times per day and I still find it hard to level up my estate. Even in an alliance unless they\'re all very high level it isn\'t much help. I\'m sure they\'re are much better games in this genre then Guns of Glory. To me it seems like a game for wealthy people and made by a company to just make money.',
       'What a great game!  Need to have introductory levels for newcomers, though.  You build your kingdom up and larger kingdom\'s just rush in and destroy you.  When you recover, they come right back.  Level into the attack mode, so people will enjoy the game more.  I am uninstalling after 6 weeks of running an Alliance, because it\'s just not worth the trouble.  Great concept, fantastic graphics!',
       'It\'s an interesting game of strategy.  You make allies in order for your alliance to grow. At the same time always on your guard knowing at any time your allies can instantly become enemies to prevent you on your way to becoming the strongest alliance in the kingdom. There are new quests to complete weekly. Each with different rewards that help you to achieve power.There are many kingdoms on the map which is great. The only downside is you have to leave one kingdom and join another to enter it and play the game in it. Not sure if you get to keep the same level and strength you achieved. But I\'m sure that the developers will one day have it to where kingdom will be able to attack kingdom and there\'s a lot of kingdoms. The game would definitely become very intense and even more exciting then. It would also become one of the best of the best strategic games there is.' ,

      'Would of gaven 5 stars. But there some bugs that need to be worked out. Like connection and handling. But other then that this game is really close to PUGB for the phone. Massive open world. COULD do little better on the mechanic of the game but nothing to major. Would like to have a better money earn system like small amout per kill or something. This game is well dont. Ive played almsot all games on gogole play and when i say this game is fun I MEAN IT!!..',
       'Thank you for constantly improving the game. Id say at this point not to add more but to fix and adjust what you already have. Fine tuning before more additions would be great. Optimizing sounds, movements, vehicles, rendering, scoping, responses, all that good stuff would be great. Its a little laggy but thats just what you get for a giant game and 100 million+ players. Love it either way.',
       'Why is there no controller support!!!!! For a game like this it is imperative for good controls. Playing on a touch screen is alright but I would like to be able to use a controller and considering controller support has been out sense android 4.0 this wouldn\'t even limit your customer base as I doubt any 4 year old phones can even play your game above 10fps. It seems like it is deliberately being left out and it is baffling me. Please can we use our controllers it\'s such a simple api to implement!!!! Seriously I think monkeys can implement controllers in games quicker then you guys what the hell!!',
       'Fun game, especially since it\'s free. But I saw that this game supports controllers so I tried to use my pro switch controller with it and so far only 2 buttons seem to work, as well as a huge delay from input to actual action. And I can\'t seem to customize the controller layout, so I\'m just stuck with the Ability to walk and crouch/lay down with said controller. Can\'t aim or shoot.',
       'The game has so much potential they just need to make it easier to see other players and easier to shoot people close to you. Also the game doesn\'t need to look realistic they should make it more like fortnite graphics and gameplay wise.  My main point is that it is too hard to see others in the game. still a good game though',
       'honestly a great game. but dont get diamonds to buy their packs. not only are they really expensive but the chance of actually getting their special clothes is so small I bought 10 packs of the monkey king and I got the same 2 grey items from all 10 packs.... like wth???' ,

      'I love this game. Every game I\'ve had, I played for a week or so, and uninstalled. But this one? Ive had for almost 6 months. Been playing every single day. Finally reached legendary 32, I\'ve unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so. Or at least a new adventure spot. Making a modded version of the rally car would be fantastic. Also, an upgrade on the formula car where it doesn\'t almost dead stop after it lands from a big air.',
       'Pretty good game the Ads are insane and they want a ton of money per month to get rid of them. Seems to be the way all the games are going. For the Chinese new year could have mad a tuk tuk I think it\'s called a mini taxi. Or something cool for China.',
       'Superb game! Too bad, the elements of hate like to hack good things and cause frustrations. For this reason, constantly run constant updates. I wouldn\'t mind paying through my rather expensive data to diffuse the damage by these bored, small prick nincompoops! Africa😝😝😝',
       'How can an offline mode still glitch?!?! I can\'t believe it. It\'s like I\'m playing with 512mg ram on dial up internet. This is ridiculous. How does this happen? Do your job, and when you release a game or an update, make it work!',
       'Alot of fun but needs new maps and vehicles. Wayyy overdue for some new stuff.  Update: since the latest update I was very disappointed to see that they nerfed the magnet. Still waiting to see new maps and vehicles',
       'Winter sports is terrible. Board jumps on its own without input. Rider falls off when landing flat. Board stops on its own despite holding down accelator. So buggy its laughable' ,

      'This is the most ridiculous game ever. I love it but i do have one suggestion can you make at least one new free map or make other free for a month during their seasons( for example: the buck to school map is free at the staer of july or august).p.s keep up the good work',
       'The gameplay is of course billion perfect and also the graphics!!! If any 1 wanted to play any interesting game....THIS IS THE ANSWER: goat simulator!! But when I was in a house in the game, I found a hilarious thing ..... Doritos the chips, hahaha it was really funny! Also when I went to the supermarket in goat simulator I found lays, Doritos and Oreos..can u imagine??!!!?!?!? Then I hit a girl and a boy with a gas car but they didn\'t die??!!! and that\'s a little bit creepy and weird. If u r asking a question why goat simulator got all of those downloads the 500 million I will answer u, cuz it\'s perfect and no 1 can do a game better than this. The graphics and gameplay and costumes!!',
       'Most rediculous game ever and I love it! But could you at least expand goatville (put more stuff in it and make it bigger) since you can\'t play in the other levels without buying them and a lot of people can\'t?',
       'Guys it\'s a great game but when I start playing the first level the controls don\'t work plz work this out. Otherwise it\'s a really good game with great graphics! Plz fix the problem.',

Please fix the multiplayer mode! It\'s really nice but constantly crashes!!! Only because of that, I\'m giveng it one star. As soon as it\'s fixed I\'ll be sure to give it 5 star and share it with my friends.',
       '1. The online mode isn\'t letting join a match 2. There should be special moves, like when you fall down, if you press the slide button, you won\'t lose speed (like in Mirrors edge) 3. The courses/levels are too easy, make it more harder',
       'The single player mode is amazing but the online mode isnt to great, i know its in beta. Either the game crashed, or the other player just can walk through walls on my screen and they win no matter what',
       'Some of the player crashing in the game pls fix so they can\'t cheat no more and when you do that I can give you 5star',
       'The multiplayer option closes the app at random. I know it\'s a new feature so I expect it will be addressed. Otherwise the game as a whole is ok. Could use more flipping it seems to me.',

      'The game itself is very well thought of, highly addictive and is a great time killer. Plus, there are almost no ads in this game. However, there are just too many animations. It\'s almost impossible to play this hame st a consistent frame rate. Maybe add an ability to downscale the resolution or tone down the animations?  Edit: after the new update they fixed it. The game runs buttery smooth',
       'I\'ve had this game on several phones and all of a sudden in the last couple months my game has reset. I\'ve always connected via google + but trying to reload my profile does not work. Is there another way to get my progress and blades back?',
       'I really like this app. The first time I played this game I kinda liked it. But it has ads in it and I hate it. It\'s graphics are awesome but also you have to slice the fruit outside the real game.😃😁😘😀😱🙃😛😨❤💙💚💛💜🍉🍌🍍🍎🍏🍐🍓🍑🍇🍒',
       'AMAZING! I played this on my kindle a few years ago, then deleted it. After about 2 years I got a new phone, then remembered this game. I downloaded it and wowowowow lots had changed. Good changes. I LOVE THIS GAME IT IS SO GOOD DOWNLOAD IT NOW!',
       'This game is very addictive but it just seems like an ad watching game. All the company cares about is money so they spam ads on to the game. Why play mini games for Golden Apples when you could just watch ads for Golden Apples since they let you watch infinite ads. Why play Classic, Zen or Arcade for Starfruit when you could just watch ads.',
       'The only reason I not rating it 5 stars is beacause on mini games you keep on losing your fruit so that the other guy wins please this apart from that great game good for little children' ,

      'Awesome Game!! Really I like this game. I dont even have words to describe it. Totally Fantastic... Whatever you say, this is totally cool. But I have a request...please add a column of legendary bikes. Like there is Common, Rares, Epics, and Specials , there should be a column of legendary. Waiting eagerly for the next update. Thanks a lot of making this fabulous game. And I would also like to appreciate the colours and graphics of this game. Thanks to the team for making this game. I advice this game to those who are looking for cool new games. Please install it and have FUN!!!! Dont just look at the pics, install and you\'ll be amazed.',
       'Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death',
       'Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I\'ll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.',
       'This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can\'t seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn\'t be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it\'s not something you have to add, it\'s just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven\'t seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it\'s an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘',
       'This game would be great if it wasn\'t so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn\'t slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.',
       'The game is great fun. I have been playing it for a few months and actually still play it. The only problem i seem to have with it. Is the laggish performance when i am connected to internet. The moment the internet is off then game runs more smoothly other than that. Still enjoy playing it. Though I must say it would be nice if there was a gem counter for each ride so i know how many I have collected. Otherwise great game' ,

      'It\'s pretty good. I am going to save this application for now. Right now I am reading the Campus hacker story. I really do like the humor in it but I kind of find the characters rude LOL. I\'m only on the first book so I don\'t want to give up yet. I have four other reading applications and this one honestly is my least favorite as of right now but I would definitely recommend it and give it a shot.',
       'I really hoped that this would be different than Episode, Choices, or Chapters, but nope. This is even worse. The fact that the game doesn\'t even give you any diamonds to start off is bad, but it\'s ridiculous to not even be able to choose the special choices because they require a lot of diamonds... So disappointing. Solmare, for the love of god, please be unique! Give the readers more tickets and diamonds and give us the ability to earn tickets/diamonds through watching videos! Seriously! Don\'t download unless you want to go through a circle of pain.',
       'Why does untold darkness book 1 and 2 not follow eachother.... Its not book 2 if my choices from book 1 don\'t carry over and the relationships are completely different. Other than that I like it so far. Like the earn diamonds too',
       'I really like the game and would have give 5 stars if darkness untold 2 would have been the following of darkness untold 1.... It\'s like the 1,you start from the beginning... But with another with the story taking another way... Very disappointing',
       'So sorry if I don\'t like it but it doesn\'t depict reality there are. Many skin tones in the world but you choose to put two skin tones on here and to be perfectly honest I bet I could make a better game that depicts real life',
       'So far it has been interesting. As far as these games go, at least they have challenges that allow you to win some diamonds unlike choices, what\'s your story and episodes ( with chapters you can watch videos, but that only gives you one diamond, so this is still better ). The characters faces are a bit odd though, but there is a similar problem with  episodes and choose your story. I am so drawn in by the mystery and fantasy stories so much that I hardly even notice the faces now. Also I love the aggressive lover options, for me fantasy means getting to do stuff I can\'t do in real life, like aggressively pursuing my love interests' ,

      'Cool game. I think I can say it\'s one of the best Android LEGO games I\'ve played. The visuals are cute and cool and the gameplay is impressively efficient. But this game suffers with the same problem of other LEGO games: why there\'s no cloud saving? Why can\'t you use Google Play or Facebook to keep our progress? I just can\'t understand.',
       'Love this game but it would be really awesome if the theme background would change instead of always driving in the street. Perhaps have a park theme and other areas maybe a beach theme and they ride on jetskis and collect coins jumping over obstacles etc. Make it more diverse and less of the same thing. And more fun characters 😀',
       '*This game is amazing try it out it\'s sooo addictive you can play it all day , the only thing I don\'t like is that you can only buy characters and the prices increase on how many you buy.*',
       'This is so hilarious because it\'s retarded! The face the face they make when they crash is stupid.  Love the Guavian Death Gang! I rate it a good game :)',
       'It is so boring  and its nothing to do it just choose  which  lego   friend  to use and you need to  drive  the car so i think  i am going to erase  the game',
       'Heartlake Rush is so much fub the only problem is that it lags/glitches alot of times also my phone is not broken so that\'s not the problem but if it did not lag/glitch that much it would be a 5/5 for me' ,

NO pop ups or commercials. !!!. . the inventors are genius... i Love this game..  thank you for making this game.. Graphics are Amazing!!!   Best farming game ...Bonus Zoo !!!...and breed ur animals ADORABLE BABIES.. with a splash of Cityville  ..Gold digging..making ingots to use...  So many optional tournaments if u want to win more money n prizes in the Regattas... Township friends make it SO much easier n fast 4 everyone  .. and so much more You just HAVE TO Try TOWNSHIP ❣💞',
       'The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen',
       'RSYFJH Great game very addictive, and I don\'t know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats\'s kind of ridiculous. That\'s the only bad thing I have to say about this game.',
       'BEST GAME EVER! It\'s my biggest game but even though I have an old phone the game still runs really smoothly. There\'s always something to do, it never gets boring. I\'ve been playing for 8 months. Super easy to use and learn. It\'s addictive. You also don\'t feel pressured to make purchases like other games.',
       'It is obvious the developers of this game care about the players, not just their wallets. The chat function for the co-ops is sensored more than any other game I have seen! The entire game promotes fair play and positive interactions. I even encourage my kids to build their own town!',
       'I love this game. Amazing sound effects, graphics. You guys did a great job that\'s for sure! But still couldn\'t give it a five star because of the lastest update. The entire screen goes black after playing the game for 5-6 minutes. That\'s pretty irritating not to mention how much slower the phone gets as well. Didn\'t have these issues with the last update. Fix it please!' ,

      'Most of the controls are excellent, I love the snap-to by selecting a ball, and the fine tune dial, however the "spin" mechanic is terrible to the point of being broken. No matter where you put the contact spot on the cue it is always maximum front spin or back spin, there is no diagonal spin or English, and no gentle spin of any kind. Fix this and you have a perfect pool game.',
       'It\'s not horrible by any means but it\'s basically the children\'s version of what the game should be. Way to basic way too easy and no points and buying system or any sort of upgrades every level just diffs with amount of balls and placement not difficulty Thanks',
       'Was disappointed when I reached level 816 and found no more game. Also, game could use some kind of "side game" to avoid boredom.  But still good time killer.',
       'I played without sound for a long time. After Upgrading my tablet, the sound won\'t turn OFF!   I have it off in the settings but am still getting sound after sinking a shot and at the end of a game.  I am very dissappointed that i wont be able to play this app anymore.',
       'I enjoy playing this game. I already reach level 400 but i don\'t know how many levels this game have. Do you increase the levels every time you update this game until it reach to never ending levels so that no one will stop playing this game because of the never ending levels. This game is fun and challenging.',
       '1st there are ads in between each play which is ridiculous.. I dont know how high the game goes up but there are NO hints or instructions on what exactly the goal is besides potting balls.. it\'s ADDICTIVE and fun BUT if this is all there is to it I won\'t keep game long' ,

      'This is by far the best chess "trainer" for me.  It\'s got a nice flow and the game isn\'t "stupid" like most other chess apps/games I\'ve played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I\'m making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.',
       'I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn\'t show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.',
       'For the non experts, let me tell you that 5his game cheats. I sat with a real chessboard to analyse why wasn\'t I  able to crack master level.   And what i observed was it didn\'t allow you to make actual moves when you show high levels of intell8gence. Sometimes it makes moves which are faulty. I think there is some mistakes in coding, perhaps deliberately made.  So not a fair play but a foul play.',
       'it\'s just a chess game yea, but it actually looks nice for a change. most chess games are really boring because all they have are symbols and very rarely, possibly sound. when you think it\'s boring that means you don\'t like chess, but not the app. what do you expect? guns and explosions? didn\'t think so.',
       'So far it\'s o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It\'s not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game',
       'The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.' ,

      'Amazing game... Loved it...😍 The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it\'ll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it\'s okay 😊',
       'This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn\'t as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn\'t there but now it\'s forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.',
       'I really wish you guys didn\'t update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can\'t listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!',
       'It\'s an amazing game. Sure I run around my bedroom screening every time I fail next to the end.... but there is something about this game that makes you happy. Is it the music? Maybe. Is it the back ground and the way it moves?possibly. It\'s all of those things plus more   In a nut shell I really really really really really really really really really love this game :p',
       'Good songs. That\'s about it. The hitbox detection and lag spikes are horrific, the checkpoint system is a blatant cash grab, and what annoys the most is that the timing of music+taps (the core mechanic of the game) is completely broken. It is significantly easier to play the game with audio off, so that you don\'t get distracted by the miss timed turns. Doesn\'t even fulfill it\'s most basic selling point. Atrocious.',
       'The gameplay is unique, but one thing I notice that is so hard to get the highest level as we totaly have no idea about the beat from music while we play it. Need to play the same level on and on until I become familiar with every single beat from it. Anyway, use your best headphone. They come with so much beautiful musics you\'ll ever heard' ,

      'I\'m 11 and i love it so much.I have some Ideas for a toca kitchen 3. You can be able to make sandwiches and soups or stews. And more ingredients, more people. And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.',
       'I like how I can give the guests disgusting drinks and food a see and hear their really funny reaction! Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!😆😆 I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils!

       'Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I\'m sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP',
       'I LOVE this app! And I\'m so glad it\'s free! Everyone is like \'it\'s the same thing over and over again\' but they\'re not actually getting into this game. They\'re are tons of different options to choose from and like Toca Boca says cook it your way. I LOVE TOCA BOCA!!!',
       'I\'m giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won\'t make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least',
       'This is the best game ever it is also funny because I was giving the girl food and I gave her some strawberries and I put a lot of lemon, hot sauce, Barbiecu sauce,Manas,keckup,salt, and pepper... SO funny, it also sounds just like a kid is playing with the food, that I\'m eating grapes right now,😂😂😂😂😁😀😊☺🙂😐' ,

      'It stopped working on my One plus! Help! I was excited about the side games! *********************************** Excellent, addictive fun. I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn\'t level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can\'t progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.',
       'Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It\'s nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don\'t want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn\'t get a key.',
       'Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion.',
       'Fun game but takes forever to get gold to upgrade. The cost to pay for the gems to buy so you can buy gold is really expensive. Not much dynamic to the game. Same stuff on each level just takes longer to bet enemies cause of higher HP.',
       'I wish I read the reviews before I downloaded this "game". Absolutely awful. Seriously, don\'t waste your time. If you like a stupid amount of ads and you are a fan of being bored then go for it.',
       'This game is simple. So simple that it is stupidly addictive at times when my mental and physical ability equates to a bowl of fruit. Nothing in this game brings me more satisfaction than the immensity of lag when bolts are caught in rapid bounce in a confined space. I say that with the utmost sincerity, no sarcasm at all. The lag is so intense, so joyful to watch. Please don\'t take it away from me. It is beautiful.' ,

Game play is ok but progression is slow. I suggest you make the "reasons" section free text so that you can get an accurate assessment for process improvement instead of a BS pre stagged answer.',
       'Honestly i really enjoy the game thus far thank you for all the recent updates niantic... but there is one thing that has been bothering me and that is 1v1 with friends and trading... both features were shown in the original trailer... yet again i love the care your giving the game niantic i truly praise it but i would like to know whats happening with my 2 listed thoughts',
       'The game has been majorly revamped and has benefited from it. It\'s so much better to see that content and events are happening more often. Hopefully we\'ll see the first wave of gen 4 by April or May and a nice egg event will happen to get a higher chance of a baby Pokemon from gen 4. Keep up the great work only downside is legendaries. I can\'t get them as not enough people in my area play Pokemon go and I\'m not travelling for a Pokemon. Can we have a legendary event for one week you can get 3* legendary raids? That would make it easier.',
       'Constantly saying GPS not found (11). She jumps to random places and takes forever to even move. Its basically useless.. I was going to get a new phone to play this thinking it would work better but even after the update it hasn\'t changed. Waste all my data trying to play. Not happy. Disappointed.',
       'I\'m an android user and also on a budget so I can\'t get the latest and greatest ever really. And every phone I\'ve ever had cannot run this stupid game. The developers really need to work with the lower quality phones to get it to be able to detect the GPS in them because it will load the character model, and the UI. Nothing else though. As soon as it starts loading it just says GPS signal not found and it can\'t ever find it  total garbage',
       'Pokemon keep disappearing from my backpack. They are in there after I catch them but disappear later.  They appear in pokedex as one\'s caught. Never had this problem before. Wasting money for balls when it doesn\'t count. Will never purchase balls again.  Rating would go up if bugs were fixed regularly.' ,

      'Ive been playing for the better part of a year, and this game started out great for a long while. But IGG not only panders and gives better deals to Chinese people, cheaper packs etc. But literally 99% of all mega guilds and players are Chinese or Vietnamese. If your not asain don\'t play this game  you\'ll end up like me playing forever just to quit because of the obvious discrimination IGG holds with its playerbase',
       'Do NOT go for high level military research without searching monster hunting, and Do NOT go for T4 if you not going to spent thousands of dollars. Even if you don\'t mind to wait 200 days, you will not able to afford it (lvl 10 military Def, Atk, Health cost 100m gold each). DO NOT GO FOR HIGH MILITARY AND T4 WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE GAME.',
       'This game is fun but be prepared for the mother of all Pay2win games.  These folks at IGG are experts at crafting new and exciting ways at fleecing their customers of every cent they can.  You CANNOT compete if u dont pay and pay often.  Players here ...just regular people... dump hundreds of rl $$$ regularly.  You have been warned.',
       'If you like spending mad money to be an Internet tough guy this is the game for you.  Of you have tons of time to kill to be a punching bag for pay to play Internet tough guys it may also be the game for you.  If the computer random stuff kills off your troops don\'t expect to get tech support, it will always be reviewed in 1-3 days, even the next time you ask, another 1-3 days.',
       'Game Sucks! Super high levels can come in wipe you out, seems like if they had a level limit, let\'s say 5 levels above you they can\'t attack, but O NO!!  Every day I come in to find I have been attack by a level 25 and I\'m only a level 14. It takes days to rebuild, so yeah everyday same thing, about to uninstall this game not worth it to me...',
       'Coloseum is BS. I think one reason is because you cant control who you can attack. I mean come on, auto battle sux really. You can be defeated by a low level and low rank with same type of heroes seriously? I would rate this zero if i could but bad luck for me i couldnt. Its getting worst everday. Ever since i rated this game, i never won a single battle in colo. Really? I wish i can rate this zero. This game is BS. No improvement ever since. I think i have edited this 3 or 4x already and nothing has changed. I gave up colo is BS.' ,

      'Lots of fun, creative and very easy!  Review update: I reinstalled in 2018 to find it has changed. You cant dig down very far like you could before, or down to water (it only floods a little bit in places) so I couldn\'t make a moat for the castle.',
       'Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.',
       'This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!',
       'Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses.',
       'I have a significant concern with how easy it is to accidentally spend the gems. It has happened at least once, though I\'m assuming it happened a second time while I was quickly clicking building a building, since fifteen gems are now unaccounted for. I cannot feel comfortable with this game if at any given moment, all my gems might get spent because of one misclick.',
       'I really like this game it is very fun. The only thing is, how do you wave, I dont know but I play it on PC so I am not very sure how to wave so please tell me if you can do it on PC. Also can you maybe update is so you can use it on PC with w a s d because I am used to it. Anyway love the game good job!' ,

      'It\'s fun because I  git to play with school friends, and the gaming is amazing so keep up the good work! But I hate the new update with levels to upgrade you wepons! On upgrade costs more than the gun! Not   every one in the game is rich you know!',
       'This game is the best I have ever played on a phone tons of maps, game modes, hundreds of guns, different tools, gear, and lots of skins. There is just so many things you can do. I also like it because it is a challenge something I would play. That\'s why I rated this game 5 stars.',
       'Don\'t restrict players by taking away added ability from weapons, gear, and wear in siege mode. The game should be a lot more flexible with the payouts... players not winning anything worth the time wasted playing a game that wants you to buy items that don\'t bring anything for the purchase. Like, reward players with trophies for purchases. Or create a new league for players that have accumulated enough points strictly for the new league. With more unlockable items and arenas...',
       'The reason why I gave 3 stars is beacause i want the renting to be more than just 2 matches maybe like 4 so they know how to use it. And when i was making my skin like some kind of bug showed up. And the bug reseted my hard work',
       'Its a Great game, played it for quiet a few years on multiple devices and never have i ever got tired of seeing whats next. One thing i dislike is how i get disconnected so easily but i over look it for the fun. Lastly i noticed how when its balanced fights its harder to get better weapons due to the other team usually having the best after you hit a certain level.',
       'I love this game in all ways but there are deleted things that I want back in the game... First of all there are multiple deleted maps that used to be my favourite- Arabian dust, Aztec temple, destroyed megalopolis, blockmart, four seasons and science lab were all incredibly fun maps that got removed for no reason and I was quite upset.... also the old rankings were loads better than the new levels... such as I II III and the eagle as top rank.... lastly I want the brutal head hunter to be a good weapon again as it was really fun for me to use.. thank you for reading and I hope you consider my feedback or At least the maps and ranking part mostly.. thanks' ,

      'Great game that I would really enjoy putting some time in but it constantly starts to shutter and the frame rate slow way down and makes it impossible to hit your marks. I had a subscription but decided to cancel it because the game is unplayable. Please fix and Its a 5 star game and worth the subscription. (Galaxy Note8)',
       'Cool little game with very few ads. The only downside is you have to buy gold to upgrade your bicycles so if you don\'t pay to win that\'s just a great time killer.',
       'You need gold bars to upgrade your bike. The only way to get gold bars is to buy them with money. I just want to play the game without having to spend £80 So I can upgrade my bike.  It because I can\'t upgrade my bike. I can\'t proceed through the game.',
       'Sucks that you have to pay to win, I\'ve spent ten bucks already but I\'m gonna have to buy more if I wanna get winning. Unless you got money to burn don\'t download',
       'would be great if i was allowed more gold for progress, but unless you pay for them you cant upgrade your bike. You will have to be perfect in the game or you wont progress. kinda sucks for that reason.',

      'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'I m lucky enough!!!!!  I just started playing 8 months ago and now I earn 7 legendaries in total and 2 of them are lvl2 where as my friend is playing since more than a year he owes only 6 legendaries and 1 of them is lvl 2..... So plz do something about this we(gamers) expect better from u  Plz don\'t disappoint them who has low no.s of legendaries....... This is request from all guys who have not got luck in this game I guess...',
       'This is  the best game ever. And supercell, can u add google + sign in so that people who don\'t use facebook can also have friends.. Also I have like 8 leggie right now and I am so happy. And the new clan battle is awesome, it is the best. I wish it is permanent. Anyways clan battle is so fun to play and who ever created it.. U r awesome. Keep up the good work Supercell. Love you so much and ur games.😙😙😙❤❤❤❤😀😁😁😊😊😊',
       'Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn\'t one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you\'re better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖',
       'This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.' ,

      'Very fun and time killing. I play with my bf and 2 friends and we all try to beat eachothers high scores. It can be pretty competitive. Im prob gonna try to get more ppl to play with me too lol. There could be more variety in the blocks, and there should be like different modes, just an idea',
       'Its cool and all but needs some extra features.  Maybe a way to store 1 brick for later or some level advancement.  Maybe challenges or a power up system. The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.',
       'What they show on the preview and what it gives you in game don\'t even match. They make it look like it so easy. You cannot rotate the pieces. The pieces they give are so random, and most games you can barely get past a couple of turns before you can\'t place anymore and you lose.',
       'This is very deceiving. It looks like it\'s Tetris, but it\'s not. The pieces don\'t come down like the pictures show. I hate apps like this who deceive people to believe its a certain game when it\'s not just to get people to download. Will never download a game from this developer again.',
       'This app would score a lot better if there was an option to get rid of the adds. If gladly pay to have them gone but that isn\'t an option for some reason. They\'re so intrusive and far too frequent even for a free game. Uninstalling and won\'t be coming back',
       'This game says it has all different types of shapes but it has the same ones from another puzzle game. I think this game was very boring and that you should not download it' ,

       'Its so super expensive to buy a fucshia tiara, please when i unlock it please reccomend 1999 coins again and my pou so super preety pink and so beautiful. Update: please when i unlock it it must be 999 coins per item and please make it cheaper and please make it more beautiful like adding sparkles in tiaras and make more minigames and specials!

       'After I posted my recent comment, there were some angry comments pointed out at me. I apologise for that. I mean, this game in great! There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars. For someone who says "too many notifications", go to the settings and turn off that notifications button. Thank you for those hate critics you guys made. It really teached me a lesson.',
       'It\'s been more than a year that you haven\'t added any mini game in any update. You\'ve written on "What\'s New" section that "We\'re working on something big" but you .haven\'t shown that big work yet😅..At least add more mini games...And I\'ll rate 5.',
       'I wish you didn\'t have to wait for a long time for a item. Like, for example, if a hat was level 60. Then you have to wait for a long time. Please instead of doing levels. Please just make them expensive. Because you need to wait.',
       'I love this app so much. I thinks its good that you can buy things for Pou and play games with friends  Pou is cute when\'s its a baby. I like that you can buy. Clothes and all sorts of stuff. I like the mini games they are fun too. I think that you. Would improve on making the things that were locked a little bit lower priced' ,

      'This is an awesome game that gives you daily and weekly quest\'s and offers treasure chests. Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven\'t tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.',
       'Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a "slide," I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don\'t compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.',
       'Nice, good, adventure game.but some times your team irritating who one completed thirteen level they will easily get diamond  your giving master challenge ( now the challenge Chinese New year )who one complete your giving thirty diamond only.this offer will useful only for entry level gamers. Most of players finished fourteen level so they no need diamonds.so think about genius players.',
       'I love all the graphics it\'s a bit like the        piano tiles it test\'s your fast skills but except it is temple run 2 love it. Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.',
       'I love this game, very addicting. And I love that it has the daily, weekly and global challenges. As well as objectives and the daily chest challenges. Lots of things to work for and win. Makes the game more fun. Plus, so far, I haven\'t come across anything that I\'ve had to spend money on in order to advance in the game',
       'Temple run 2 is a good game I like it to a lot could be better as always seem to have trouble with play services an so some features won\'t load e.g maps or have trouble getting the characters to slide windows for the selection takes a few attempts of start up. I think when it works it\'s a great game there is just know way to get the bugs out iv tried everything. G8UM8' ,

      'This is a great game but it has it\'s draw backs. Due to a glitch in the game I had some coins and trophies taken from me in a game that never loaded. The biggest issue with this game is there is no offline solo play. A solo or practice mode would be great to allow people to get a feel for the game and be able to make tweaks in certain scenarios when playing with others. Easily worth 5+ stars if some adjustments can be made. Very addictive, very fun and suspenseful, and a great time killer.',
       'Game seems fine as long as you DO NOT BUY ANYTHING!!. Game is so rigged and its about the most obvious Ive ever seen. Just before tourney time, you will not make a shot and you will be reduced to ZERO coins, balls and trophies. I have over 10,000 matches so I know the game and support very well. DO NOT BUY BALLS, COINS HEARTS OR ANYTHING ELSE FROM PLAYDEMIC.',
       'I think that you should win the balls all so instead of just trophies!! You pay so much money to qualify for a tournament and you got to pay a 10,000 dollar entry fee and then 1000 ever hole!! The game is coming to how much you can spend instead of how good you are you shouldn\'t be able to enter a rookie tournament if you have over a thousand trophies!! Maybe it shouldn\'t cost so much to be able to get into the tournament!!! Besides if you spend a lot of money the people who can\'t spend as much!! I enjoy this game a lot I play it all the time I believe that it should be cheaper to qualify for the tournament!! And when you lose your game that you should loose the ball your playing with!! I really appreciate your time in listening to my opinion!! Hopefully this might make it a little more fair to the people who can\'t spend the money they would like!! Sincerely a Huge fan of the game!!! Thanks Joseph',
       'Awesome game. The only thing I don\'t care for is, why am I playing people that have 80 trophies but have played 2,000 games? I mean I\'m working with starter clubs and they are playing me with so much better clubs.. I just don\'t think that\'s very fare. And is there any other way possible to receive extra gems and coins or get extra clubs higher-ranking clubs? Thank you for your time and thank you for coming out with this game it is awesome',
       'I haven\'t been able to use the app since I updated the app a few days ago. So apparently they haven\'t worked out all the bugs.... it will load all the way to 100%, then it goes to a 2nd download screen and it only makes it to 50 %  before it stops downloading. So it was great up until that point',
       'Fun and entertaining game for sure. I wish there was more variety of courses, but I enjoy the competition in this a lot. They update frequently, and have very helpful customer service. One small change I\'d make, on shootouts, if it could show your distance from the pin next to your name or vice versa. I\'d like to see different clubs available for purchase as well.' ,

      'There is a bug in your game I went first of my league, supposingly I am entitled to 350 cash, but it wasn\'t there.  How could you make it so unfair for someone. Why bother having a prizes if not given to the right person.',
       'Uninstalled and reinstalled app because the update made it to where the game was unplayable. Went to login, using Facebook credentials. It says it failed because I would not allow them access to my friends list. Something doesn\'t seem right about that. Never had a game NOT allow me to login, after denying access to my friends list. Sorry, would prefer you not send messages to all my friends with my name tagged on it.',
       'I am in love with this game.. But the only bad thing happened today and I\'m very disappointed. I won carnival cup so I should get the announced price which includes 2 VIP  cards also. I didn\'t get my prize and I\'m really very upset. I have a screenshot of winning cup also.. I hope miniclip will help me. I\'m expecting my prize from you. I really love this game.',
       'Uncanny how the opponent in shooting race goes for the same target as me more often than not and is generally quicker. Seems similarly biased in free kick mode. It\'s almost as if you aren\'t allowed to progress unless you spend a load of money.',
       'Used to be able to control the speed of the kick. Now no mater how fast or low I swipe it\'s either super fast or super slow. And it seems to be at random. I swipe the exact same speed yet the first time it\'s 200km/h and the second time it\'s 50km/h. Getting frustrating as it used to work so well. Can\'t remember the last time it just went in the middle.',
       'Every once in a while when I get on I try to click my free spin and it won\'t work. So it\'s like my phone froze but I can play every other app. So it\'s just this game that freezes every once and a while. I have shut my phone down and turned it back on but I\'m not going to do that for every time I want to get on the app. I do really love it. It\'s just that it freezes so I can barely play it.' ,

      'Great, addictive game! However, real fast, I was wondering how the free box worked. I always hope for something real good but ALWAYS end up with either raw materials or ONE coin. Now don\'t get me wrong, I LOVE getting free stuff, it just seems like the "spinner" purposefully chooses raw materials. Like, it\'s not random like it seems; it never chooses anything close to a weapon! In any case, I cannot play this game enough, very very fun!',
       'This was one of my favorite games... until like many others I lost all progress with the big patch about 6 weeks ago.   Numerous tickets have been submitted over those 6 weeks with zero response, except here on Google play to help them save face.  A lot of my time and money has been robbed.  Proceed with extreme caution.',
       'Honestly ive been waiting for close to 2 months. This game was like crack for me until the update left me no nice place, no hard earned stuff. I dont mind starting from the bottom again but at least give me some perks. This game is worth every cent and time. But until i get my account back or my stuff back im leaving 2 stars when really this game should be 5 stars all the time. I wont be playing this game til then. Thanks for the good times.',
       'The game doesn\'t load!!! 1.) There\'s nothing wrong with my internet connection! I don\'t have any problems playing RIFT, LOTRO, Neverwinter, Aura Kingdom, Allods Online, etc. or any of my other Google Play apps on my internet connection! 2.) Using Task Manager doesn\'t work! 3.) My device has way more than 200 MB of free space on it! 4.) I haven\'t been able to play for 14 days now!!! 5.) Jurassic Survival looks more promising since there are no loading problems!!!! >:(',
       '**UPDATE** Was an awesome game. Could use a few more perks (ie. Weapons and hard to get items) in drop boxes and yellow zones.Now the down side is if you die in a level your last position is no longer there to try and recoup some of your items. Players killing you as you open trunks in inventory screen. With that I think I am done with this game. Oh ya and the free spin box...give random prizes instead of coins and rope. People will get really into it if perks are awesome.',
       'I love the game. It\'s awesome. But I do have a few questions. Why are the bunker cards so extremely difficult to find? I\'ve been looking for days killing every zombie possible and looking through every crate without finding the cards. Also. Why isn\'t there a disclaimer that says if you die in the game, everything you purchased will be lost? I think that would be extremely necessary so no one over spends their money. Other than that, absolutely smooth running, fantastic graphics, and realistic deaths. I love every aspect except I can\'t find these darn bunker key cards.' ,

      'Best color by number pixel art I have played. Beautiful art, reasonable controls (would be better if you could click and drag without pressing and holding first, but the only one that does that has such awful art that it doesn\'t matter), it\'s fun. Thanks for making this.',
       'I think that this is a good way for people in high school and middle school to relax and be stress free. My daughter has been using this app since 7th grade and now is a junior in high-school. She suggested that I try it because I am always stressed after work. I did. I love who ever created this game and a BIG THANKS FOR THIS GAME',
       'I love the gameplay, graphics and controls and this is just so relaxing to play! I love this compared to other sandbox games because of the controls are way better! Also when you take a pic and colour it in can you have a palette so you can colour it in different colours to the image that would be great if you could kinda edit photos by using different colours.',
       'Amazing! The only problem is that I might accidentally touch a number I already coloured and undo it. To fix this problem I suggest you make it so if you have completed a number it cannot be changed.',

      'Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I\'m 20 just..😉😉 I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I\'m in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️',
       'Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn\'t respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I\'m willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.',
       'Fun little time killer. My only problem is that daily rewards fail to show up most days. It could be a problem on my end, but I don\'t know, and it\'s a pretty small issue so I don\'t really care.',
       'I\'ve noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don\'t think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying.',
       'This is the most addictive game i have ever played. I always play it when am bored and you can play it when your offline. Totally recommend it but pls answer this question..what is the world highest score?',
       'Absolutely great game.. I love it!  For those who say that there is so many ads, its not true, I don\'t have that problem..But if you want to be sure,that ads won\'t appeare just turn off your cellular data.. :)' ,

Please take this into account and keep up the good work 😀',

       'Love the game first off. But it takes so long to get some key resources to build. Cant use radio tower. No new quests, and haven\'t seen any zombies. But even with that said i still have alot of fun with this game.',
       'Parts of this game are really confusing. I built all the materials to make a ship and they\'re not usable in any way. The quests are also really messed up and once you have nets collecting materials there\'s nothing left to do. Seems like most of the issues with this game would be simple to fix but the developers obviously aren\'t interested in making the game better, just in getting people to click ads. Shame because it could\'ve been a fun game.',
       'I love the game really awesome my raft looks like a mansion one problem is need to get n mortar how do i get it cause you dont get it o e the islands please make place where you can  uild one please',

      'Was fun to play but I suddenly got the same issue alot of people are having. My game won\'t load past 42% on the boot up screen, was working fine last night, went to bed and hasn\'t worked since I woke up. Y\'all seriously need to figure out the problem since I have many people complain bout it',
       'I like this game a lot. There was a problem with one particular ad causing the game to have to be restarted, but they seem to have gotten rid of it.  Developer responded to my unhappiness.  Isn\'t that a good Developer? I think so.  Their game, Idle Factory Tycoon is really good also.',
       'Well although I like the game, I have to give such a low rating, due to the prices. I think the devs used the wrong currency. Otherwise it\'s hard to explain prices over 20€ for 1 chest or a boost for only a few hours. But that\'s the games we have to deal nowadays. Do nothing and pay a fortune for it.',
       'I think there has been a bit of glitch on my game. It\'s as if it has been zoomed in some how and im not sure how it happened of if it was anything that I actually did or an update 😕',
       'I saw my older son playing his game. Remind me of the old miner game I used to play. On my phone so I gave it a try I loved it. I just sit home and watch TV and play the game. So I could challenge my friends you better catch me',
       'I am addicted to this game but my only issue right now is when you do video boost to gain more. It\'s like there is a video limit or bug.  Reason I say this because after so many videos watched the game freezes and you have to reboot it. Good that I can play without internet too. Yet video boost flaw is my only reason I can\'t give this game a 5 star rat fix the bug in videos boost and 5 star is yours.e' ,

      'Wow how do u make it soooo incredibly cute? Even the icons r cute, the outfits r cute as well , cutest bunny pet game ive ever seen. Plz add more games...so far i dont hav a prob witt it n i cant wait for my lil cutey to grow up. I love it to the max thanks',
       'IT\'S SO CUTE! I LOVE IT! I JUST HAVE 3 SUGGESTIONS.  1. CAN YOU ADD A BOOKSHELF INTO THE BED ROOM SO WE CAN READ TO OUR BUNNY? 2. WHEN RUBBING THE BUNNY IT PURRS LIKE A CAT? PLEASE CHANGE IT( I\'M GUESSING YOU GOT THE PURRING IDEA FROM MY TALKING ANGELA).3.I CAN\'T BRUSH HER TEETH ONLY USE THAT SUCTION THING PLEASE FIX THIS!  BUT OVERALL A VERY CUTE AND FUN GAME TO KILL TIME!',
       'Well, it\'s really a pretty game, and quite similar to Angela and Tom the cats, but it has unique mini games and a map and this is a plus, but a disadvantage is in the work of game. There is always bags! A lot of them. For example I choose white hair colour, but next time I\'m into the game it\'s changed into blue! It happened every time. Mini games are running not as smooth as in the beginning, so you can\'t continue to play. Sometimes, when you get new items of clothes and try them on, there is now bunny to see them on her, and then there is only the white screen and game closed. Please, fix it, and I\'ll instal this app with pleasure one more time.',
       'It\'s so cute. I cant even describe how great it feels when youve been gone for a long time, then you come back to the app and see you have like 30 likes or so. It just makes you feel acomplished. I also enjoy how its not a pay to win game.',
       'Love my bunny,but would like to be able to save my progress from one  device to another maybe via email form as I\'ve worked hard on her,game sometimes bit glitchy please also add more games so this game does need an update',
       'Like everyone says, it is a knock-off. But beside that it is super boring. And tje animation is creepy. Also they bombard you with ads. Don\'t waste your time with this trash of an app.' ,

      'I think there should be option of chatting with guild members and other players not voice chatting but message ones.  There should be some research option in every guild or either there should be some Commander talent points by which we can increase some of the tactics of team & player.  Main Idea :  I think there should be some event in which 2 guilds can fight with each other & there should be option of ally & others.  I know it\'s kinda different game but it will make fun to game.   Overall this game is best and addictive,  Thanks for making this game.  Great effort by dev team.  Love you.',
       'The game itself is awesome, the gameplay is awesome. However I\'d suggest to make the following changes to make the game better. First I\'d add an event each week which would allow players to play different matches like training with bots or zombie apocalypse and many more. I know his might be hard but I\'m also recording free fire  for my YouTube channel ( Natan Prokop ) and trying hard with it. So it would be nice if you also added ladders and so you could climb to like buildings and towers. I\'d  also add revolvers, at least one type. Please sub to my channel and if you could add the things above that\'d be great',
       'This game is good fun but pls can u stop peoee from running u over as when 8 get in top 3 some keeps running me over. It\'s still and amazing games but when people run u over its boring and wish u could stop people from doing this   is th8nkthere u should maybe be able to drive places but when u want to fight they have to get out and shoot and have a proper gun fight . Overall this is a great game my favourite mobile game and it\'s really enjoyable. But pls can u make people not being able to do this. Thankyou',
       'I\'ve been facing a new issue. I always used to get a ping of around 140 - 180 ms with my Jio until day before yesterday. But, since then, I\'m always getting a ping of 300+ ms. This is really annoying. Close combats are pretty impossible. I\'ve checked everything. My network is fine. I get a better ping in other online games which I play. My friends have been facing this issue as well. So, it has become harder to play squad and duo matches as well. Please do something about this Garena. I would definitely drop a 5 star then.',
       'One of the biggest online game I ever played...Graphics is a bit low and others are awesome... The Main thing I like in this game is the voice chatting with team mates... Commonly Only PC games has this program but now Android also has... And again i am saying that graphics could be a bit more good and I love playing this... Its a great game',
       'Itu a great game. But there are something you should add like more vehicle, weapon, bom, and inside the supply crate add more item. Second.,when i use medkite it dont do anything, you should make it move when using medkite. And last,  please make the grass and tree taller because it hard to hide inside small grass' ,

I suppose it is quite addictive but I lost interest after a few goes. It wasn\'t my cup of tea so to speak. I hope this review was helpful and remember to give it a big thumbs up!!! Be sure to look out for my trade mark "Xxx" and I\'ll see you next time!! Bye! Xxx. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍',
       'I like this game. I purchased it because it deserves, also I want to remove ads. 3,50 € and ads are not removed completely. I\'m disappointed, expecially for the "restore purchase" button that not works. Despite this I think that as a game is fun but monotonous in the long run, defect of 90% of apps of this kind. I hope developers will add something with updates that are not other challenges that ofter go to luck (and waiting time should e removed also). Sometimes there are some bugs but irrilevant for gameplay. The development house has made other interesting apps too. Sorry for errors, is not my first language.',

      'Don\'t get me wrong, I love the game. It has a nice idea, gameplay is great, and it\'s addictive. Or, it WOULD be addictive if it didn\'t take me 3 hours to get enough chalices to play 1 level.   It\'s no fun if I have to stop, then play, then stop, then play. Before, I had a limit of 7 chalices (1 chalice every 10 minutes, I think) and each level cost 1 chalice for first play. Now I still have a limit of 7 chalices (1 chalice every 30 minutes???) And each level costs 6 chalices. 6 CHALICES!  It doesn\'t add up! Do you want me to play your game or not? I would honestly give this game 5 stars if it had reasonable timing. I don\'t like this update.',
       'I really want to love this game but the time mechanics in it are just too much. An hour for one game token and most of the maps after the tutorials cost more than one token to play. I have to wait 3 hours to play one round? I really like this game, the merging mechanics are addicting and fun! I find my self between kicking myself for popping something early and getting excited for getting close to going just one more level up, but I almost have to literally forget about the game in order to get any sort of meaningful play time out of this game.',
       'Reason I changed from 5 star rating to 4 stars is before a recent update, you only needed 1 dragon chalice to play any level. Got changed to needing more than 1 on most levels, which wouldn\'t be so bad if they didn\'t make you wait 1 hour to get 1 dragon chalice back. Used to only be a 15 minute wait between chalice\'s. If it goes back to old way......5 stars again! Still a great game',
       'I played this in 2016 and it was fine. Now I\'ve been playing for a few days and still haven\'t got to levels with stone (which I need for dragon houses) because it takes so long to get chalices to play levels.  I\'m not going to invest in a game that I can only play for 5 minutes a few times a day.',
       'After reaching level 39 my camp game completely erased and I\'m back to level 2. wasted so much time making hearts. .update. I tried to play again. I even have cloud saving my game again. I reached level 30. Suddenly all my dragons are gone. Again. What the hell game! Update: once again  the updated and all my progress is gone. This time om at level 53. I\'m done. The creators don\'t even reply or show that they are listening to the players to come to a solution. I\'m not playing this game again. WASTE OF TIME!',
       'Purchased the 30 day gem subscription. Got the first few days then it stopped. No way to contact support from inside the game, help menu continually crashed. Emailed support from outside the game and received no reply. Hoping Paypal can get my money back. Cute  time wasting game but don\'t spend real money on it.' ,

    descriptionHTML: 'Join your friends in a brand new 5v5 MOBA showdown against real human opponents, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang! Choose your  favorite heroes and build the perfect team with your comrades-in-arms! 10-second matchmaking, 10-minute battles.

Shatter your opponents with the touch of your finger and claim the crown of strongest Challenger!<br><br>Your phone thirsts for battle!<br><br><b>Features:</b> <br><br><b>1. Classic MOBA Maps, 5v5 Battles</b> <br>Real-time 5v5 battles against real opponents. Fight over 3 lanes to take the enemy&#x2019;s tower. 4 jungle areas. 18 defense towers. 2 Wild Bosses. Complete reproductions of classic MOBA maps. Full-on 5v5, Human vs. Human battles. A triumphant return to genuine MOBA gameplay.<br><br><b>2. Win with Teamwork &amp; Strategy</b> <br>Block damage, control the enemy, and heal teammates! Choose from Tanks, Mages, Marksmen, Assassins, Supports, etc. to anchor your team or be match MVP! New heroes are constantly being released!<br><br><b>3. Fair Fights, Carry Your Team to Victory</b> <br>Just like classic MOBAs, there is no hero training or paying for stats. Winners and losers are decided based on skill and ability on this fair and balanced platform for competitive gaming. Play to Win, not Pay to Win.<br><br><b>4.

And a convenient tap-to-equip system lets you focus on the thrill of battle!<br><br><b>5. 10 Second Matchmaking, 10 Minute Matches</b> <br>Matchmaking only takes 10 seconds, and battles last 10 minutes, glossing over the quiet early-game leveling up and jumping right into intense battles. Less boring waiting and repetitive farming, and more thrilling action and fist-pumping victories. At any place, at any moment, just pick up your phone, fire up the game, and immerse yourself in heart-pounding MOBA competition.<br><br><b>6. Smart Offline AI Assistance</b> <br>In most MOBAs, a dropped connection means hanging your team out to dry, but with Mobile Legends: Bang Bang&#x2019;s powerful reconnection system, if you get dropped, you can be back in the battle in seconds.

      'It\'s a pretty amazing game, like league of legends but what makes it amazing is that you can play it on your phone. The only problem is the prices of the heroes and skins. Most of the heroes are 32k battle points.. So it would be fair if it was at least 5k cheaper than that. Also the game lags sometimes which interups gameplay which can cause you to unexpectedly die.  For anyone who is reading this, I highly recommend this game to anyone.  It\'s amazing and extremely addictive!!',
       'I think this game is great! I play It Almost Everyday And My Mum Always Has To Scold Me For Playing Too Much! Its Addictive And Fun To Play! Just A Few Things You Guys Could Work On. 1)I Hope That You Guys Will Let Us BE ABLE To Sell Hereos And I Bet Others Agree. 2)I Also Hope You Guys MAKE IT EASIER For Us To Get BP\'S I Really Really Hope You Guys Get To Fulfill My Request! Its a good game!',
       'Not enough with unskippable tutorials now you want us to level up till lvl 8 to be able to change account? Here\'s some suggestion, make a button just before the tutorial, for login purposes for those who have old accounts. I mean, people sometimes reset their phone and you want us to play till level 8 again just so we can play old account? Be realistic developers.',

       'Quite simply a super fun game. This game does exactly what it is supposed to, which is provide a fun portable moba experience condensed into short bursts of fun. This is one of the few games where even losing is a fun experience for me. Pros - wide range of heroes, fun over the top cartoon graphics, multiple game modes, great community and incredible speed of matchmaking that still some how retains quality of matchups. Cons - I am personally not a fan of the joystick based control system, the heroes require quite a bit of time playing before you can get enough in game currency to unlock them. So if you haven\'t already started playing this game then you are definitely missing out',
       'Being Honest this game hasnt really been up to date with others competitors. One thing I think would be lovely is a training camp/single player bot practices to do with new heros. Maybe a small revamp to the art style like 5% realism. And to decrease the amount of gold heros cost, really turns down the tone to play more for new heros' ,

      'Fun addictive game, alot of ads but you can X out of them quickly. What the downfall is..if you hit a "perfect" shot, it still drifts left or right. Plus offline bonus are odd. First 3 or 4 days the log on bonus was over 15-20k after not playing about 12-14 hours. Now its a little over 5k bonus. Bummer',
       'So initially I gave this a low star rating because of the amount of ads that appear between games and it drags the fun out of it. SO......here\'s the Trick, turn your Data/WiFi off and play offline simple!! No ads and therefore no interruptions. Best thing is you can also earn dollars when your not playing! The Game itself is addictive and so much fun! Big thumbs up from me!! 👍',
       'This game is a very simple way to pass some time. Almost no skill required. There are ALOT of ads. Paying for the premium version removed the ads between shots, but still offers occasional ads to upgrade your guy. Also watching an add to double your offline bonus always results in no ads available to watch lol. Speaking of which for the first few days offline bonuses are huge, but they become MUCH smaller after a few days.',
       'Love the game honestly. It\'s simple and a great time killer but it is still so simple that it just runs itself out of game. There\'s no modes no effects after the ball is hit it\'s just a rubber ball whatever it hits it bounces. The character is just a dude in a jersey in red there\'s not really any customization. The bats come relatively quick and easily and that\'s the only thing you can change in the entire game. Could be fantastic buts it\'s just too simple still a fun little game.',
       'Good game, quite addictive. However, two things: 1) It\'s draining my battery quite a bit when running 2) There\'s no way to quit the game. I can only exit by hitting "home" on my phone. It seems as though the battery drain is preventing my phone from running properly, so now I need to force close the app to ensure I can continue to use my phone properly.  I would like to see this game improve in terms of battery usage,',
       'Great game. Had me playing for hrs. But like evryone has alreafy said this game is littered with ads. Ill get 1 swing and then theres and ad. Ill collect my offline game play and pop an ad. At first it was every 2 or 3 swing now its every time i hit the collect or double button i get an ad thats 30 sec. Get rid of some ads and itll be a great game. Uninstalling due to being burnt out by watching ads.' ,

      'Hey supercell,no doubt your game is awesome but I didn\'t like the supercell id technique in the new update...why did u removed the Google play login system? It was easier to change coc account in it...but in the supercell id it takes a lot of time to change the accounts plus we have to write our email then wait for the password....please fix this issue..... Probably I m not the only one who is facing it......    So I hope that your team can fix this issue..',
       'The heroes should be for all players from the lower level. They can make their own choice to choose the hero or switch them. If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy? It\'s the strategy game, not for only the big or strong players. Thanks!!...',
       'Coc is on the first place in my games list. It is very addictive and enjoyable. I am looking forward till the day town hall 12 comes. I am not much happy with SUPERCELL ID thing. Because it is not much easy to use. I recommend using the normal GOOGLE PLAY sign in method because it is much more appropriate for me. Overall COC have become my life. I also recoomend to have a time limit for coc, like coc automatically switch off if the user plays coc more than 1 hour. Long Live COC!',
       'Awesome strategic game, love it. But I have one request to Clash of clans creators that pls update clan castle of coc village that there would be an option that how much treasury do you want to Transfer to your storage. I think all coc players would be love this option and it would be great idea because you can transfer required amount of treasury to your storage and the rest of it will remains safe in clan Castel. If you like this idea and will work on it then pls reply me. I would be thankful to all Coc creators if that happens.. 😊',
       'NICE GAME, NICE GRAPHICS,NICE GAMEPLAY.. Been Playing Since 2015 and I See A Lot Of Changes..  I Wish new content would Be Added More Frequently and I HOPE The Village must Have Village Houses! Cause A Village Is Not A Village Wihout Houses SUPERCELL. There should be houses that has different colors and traits, some which raises stats of barbs and valks, or reduces time to produce troops and spells like in Builder Base,there should be houses which raises defense or offense and houses which reduces building production. This May Give Clash Of Clans A New Spark and Would Be More Strategic than usual. Thanks For Reading Devs Godbless.',
       'it\'s a good game and challenging. Strategy is needed on going through battles, Arranging your defenses is very tough to manage lol..... You want to keep away the enemies from your lawn though........ and I love the "Builder hall" when I\'m done on my "Town hall" I manage the second camp.... although the loot in Builder hall is limited it\'s fun and addictive a real time killer........ keep up the good work developers........ have a good day.... ^_¤' ,

      'This game is AMAZING I think its  suitable for any age because its entertaining and it doesn\'t have a lot of adds which is really cool since this game is free. It also has a variation of different puzzles to keep u entertained. I think that if u r reading this right now then DOWNLOAD IT NOW.',
       'I abseloutly love this game. The controls are amazing the games are great and it is so stress relieving and I would play this in every second of my spare time. I would totally reccomend this for kids and adults!!! Go and get this free app that I am addicted to 😀😍',
       'This is a nice hodgepodge of puzzle games. They have a great selection, and I like the mental workout that I get when I play. If you\'re on the fence, download it, and at least try it out because it really is a great app. It can get quite challenging though, so be aware of that, and don\'t give up!  Update: I took away one star because I was concentrating hard on a puzzle, and an ad popped up which totally ruined my concentration. I actually stopped playing the app because I was so pissed.',
       'This is actually quite addictive & enjoyable. Definitely distracts you & helps kill time or zone out when your brain is too busy. My daughters, (16 yrs & 5 yrs) along w my son (12 yrs) play w me, and we try to race each other thru the levels. I would give this wee game 5 stars if it weren\'t for the amount of ads & the length of time the ads play. If the ads were adjusted a wee bit it would be easier to do the side by side races. Hope y\'all 👍 it.',
       'It\'s an amazing app with great puzzles. Though there\'s so many ads and recently the app started crashing every time I try open the app and try to do a puzzle. I hope this problem is fixable without having to reinstall and start over.',
       'Great app saw it from an ad and I don\'t regret getting it.  The only thing  I dislike is that there are too many ads but other than that u should download  this right now 😁' ,

      'It\'s a really fun game, but sometimes you\'ll play a video to revive your shark and the video will play but you don\'t get another life afterwards. It\'s hard to believe that it is a WiFi problem because if it was an ad wouldn\'t be able to load at all. Also, I have paused the game before and come back minutes later and the game had kicked me out and not saved any coins/gems gained from that round. They clearly have a few bugs to work out.',
       'IT IS SO GOOD, YOU HAVE TO BUY IT!Every level you get a new shark,though,you have to pay for them.But the good thing is you still have your old shark! You will be challenged throughout the levels! AND WHATEVER YOU DO,DO NOT SPEND YOUR JEMS!!!! You barely can get any jems,besides the five you get for downloading it.Anyway all I want to say is have fun be cool and be one with the shark! Bye,rsvp!',
       'OMG! I love the gameplay in this arcade game I love everything about it. It is very cool that you can evolve sharks that can eat more stuff. Keep the updates coming it would be better if you added more sharks in this game . I recommend downloading this game if you want something to do in a long amount of time. This is so addictive I can\'t stop playing it!',
       'My apologies for the negative review lately. But to be honest, I have to use VPN just to log-in in Google Play and enable cloud sync or else, I wouldn\'t be able to sync my progress. Just a little request, can you make the gameplay smoother for lower end devices, such as devices with 1GB RAM? It lags frequently during gameplay. Thanks a lot!',
       'Amazing game. I completed this game in 48 minutes Hahaha! Because I used luckypatcher :) I downloaded the luckypatcher in Googlechrome But it can harm your Device..... And the last shark is Moby dick His baby is as big as Megalodon.',
       'The is the most intense game ever.When you think you\'ve got it ,it\'s gone. Can\'t figure out how to boost. Controls aren\'t the best.Rhis game could improve. Oth er than that it\'s fine I guess.Too many pop up ads. Really frustrating. I want to play the game not look at ads. Sometimes  you can\'t back out of the ad.' ,

They offer 2 packs for 5 and 20 then except for rare sales which offer 49 and 79 dollar packs everything is 100 dollars google should step in and pull this game off the google play market for a square enix licensed product they have enough backing to have actual microtransactions not be a game exclusive to rich people who use 100 dollar bills as toilet paper...',
       'Please understand that there is really nothing free about this game except the install. While the gameplay WAS very promising at first, purchaseable bonus packs take any strategy completely out of the game. Now, in addition, each new element of the game that has been released in recent weeks requires cash to unlock. I can only use about half of the games features now. Bummer. If you\'re willing to pay, have a blast with this game. Otherwise leave it alone!',
       'I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.',
       'This game has potential to be fun but it\'s completely ruined because IT\'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don\'t get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it\'s full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it\'s a complete money bucket!',
       'This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.',
       'The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it\'s free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15' ,

      'Whenever you die in the game you start completely over again. And after each game an advertisement plays. Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It\'s a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It\'s very competitive!!! I swear my husband can\'t beat my score no one has lol',
       'It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone\'s or tablets I find it hard to control I don\'t know if anyone else thinks so but that\'s my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company',
       'It\'s good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it\'s my opinion so don\'t get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don\'t have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn\'t play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀',
       'Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface',
       'Worst game played ever . Too irritating , so many adds . Very disappointed . I was just seeing the ratings and I thought it will be good but after that I got very much angry. PLEASE NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. Slither.io is much better game than this one. Worst game controls',
       'It would be great if it didn\'t have ads every few games! Didn\'t ask to rate am only rating because am fed up of it. Also control is a bit hard. Name doesn\'t save. It is addictive and annoys me alot 😂 but overall its fine. Just sort the ads out' ,

      'I can\'t say I love it,maybe I can. But any way, this would have to be in one of top hundred games😀. There are a few things I would like added though. Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed this😀😁😀😁😀😁.',
       'I think you guys have messed up your game in the past few updates. Seems like there is some memory leak or something. After a while the steering wheel lags so much. Only the input. Graphics don\'t lag at all. Please fix. Also would be great if you could add some button to start and stop a timer in free mode so we can set time challenges for ourselves. I like the game but it is unplayable after a few minutes after the recent updates',
       'What you should improve is that YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ADD\'s I MEAN SERIOUSLY I WATCH MORE ADDS THAN THE GAMEPLAY. I ONLY PLAY FOR A LITTLE THEN MOST OF ADDS SHOW UP. I WQ5CH ADDS THAN PLAY8NG THE GAME FOR CRYING OT LOUD!!',
       'This has to be like, my 5th or 6th reinstallment of this game since there\'s no ingame reset, but darn well worth the data(little bytes). I usually like more realistic car games, but even the "extreme" warp in physics in the gameplay doesn\'t distract from the fun. These are the cars you\'d want if you\'re trying to beat the traffic, run from the cops, or solve a parking dillemma. Great fun time killer! One thing though, the other reviewers are correct in their complaints about how often and when ads pop up. That shouldn\'t happen smack dab in the middle of a maneuver.',
       'This game was just really really good! But please please make the exact same game but instead, if you do something illegal like crash into another car, the cops start chasing you. If you do do this I will comment on every single game that comes up on the adds. But, there is a tiny bit to much adds. Anyways, AMAZING fame!!!😊',
       'The cars are totally good and pls add some more. The traffic is really bad. Because they are inconsiderate and doesn\'t care about other cars. How come some of your games has the traffic considerate, Axesinmotion?🤔🤔 In other words, I hope u will do the things above that is mentioned.' ,

I hope my tears will help u guys. :)',
       'Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it\'s just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............',
       'Its a very good game without any tension of wining any difficult task...I like it very much and its not much addicting I have played many games but its very different. controls are also good but this game needs some practice . I am enjoying this game because the tasks are not very difficult but at the same time not very easy its a perfect game and the main character of the game is very funny he always sleeps in the vehicle.....so finally.... I like this game very much',
       'Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!',
       'Plez put some changes in upgrading options..... Like..when we upgrade our vehicles...... Vehicles should look different...and..some added things like....nitros.,new wheels and etc.... By this changes this game will be liked and can be played by more and more people',
       'At first I wasn\'t sure how good the game was but after playing it several times on Android and Windows 8.1 phone, I like it.  It doesn\'t weigh down on the phone\'s processing power. A very addictive game!! Give it go.' ,

      'Great game. The games are more fun than Candy crush and much more fair. For example, they let you make moves you can\'t play in Candy crush and timed rounds don\'t start until you touch the screen. Also, while some of the games are really challenging, you don\'t get stuck on them for days and days.  There are no gems or gold bars, etc. You don\'t have to slowly earn some kind of premium currency or pay real money to get special prizes.',
       'Loving it.  Reached level 370, and am really enjoying the game. Fun, good graphics, good story. Nice balance of challenging levels and easier ones, but so far no levels that look impossible. On the negative side, 900 hard won coins for 5 extra moves is ridiculous. When replaying a level it would be nice if you could go straight to the game play without the screen telling you what you need, we already know.',
       'I think that we should get more  coins for winning the levels. I find that the game can cost me money that I don\'t have, so I will spend less time playing your game. I love this game alot but why play if you are not getting enjoyment because it costs to much to play. (Otherwise I love the game) I also never got my horse, please give me my horse, I really need that horse btw. I already had a name for her to. I was going to call her daisy. The name goes great with the garden theme. (If you hadnt realized thst already) Please please send me daisy, I love her already. Peace.',
       'Playrix games are all generally the same.. They\'re good. But well designed to ensure and encourage the use of real money to play. Think of old arcade machine style of game mechanics and you\'ve got a general idea of what you can expect from any of their titles.  The only thing truely different is how quickly each game decides it wants to dig for your wallet.  Disappointing.',
       'It was a lot of fun the first few "days" but got very hard very fast. Don\'t bother with power-ups as it doesn\'t really make a difference. The only way to win is to get lucky with a big bomb. That\'s it. It\'s a shame because the game is nice, I just progress way too slowly now for it to be worth playing.',
       'I enjoy playing this game but I think 900 coins is crazy for 5 extra lives. There are other games I play that offer less coins and a boost for a smaller price. On one game I play it\'s 65 coins for 10 extra moves and a boost, on a different one it\'s 25 coins for 5 extra moves. I also think that stars for each level should vary too. For harder levels it should be 3 stars, for medium levels it should be 2 stars, and for easy levels 1 star. I\'ll continue to play no matter what, it\'s fun, challenging and strategical!' ,

      'The PvP system is super broken. One game might be played with someone at close to your rank and next you might be playing a player with 20,000+ more trophies than you. And along with that the 2 players aren\'t even getting the same waves of enemies to start with so someone with 8 less rank ups than you can beat you by 35,000+ points. This has only happened to me like 15 times a day so please fix it cause game ain\'t worth playing if PvP is broken.',
       'Bland, generic microtransaction-laden mobile version of a good game type. Levels are short and provide very little challenge until the difficulty spikes. Upgrades demand grinding or spending money. It\'s just more of the same trash flooding the mobile market.',
       'I\'ve always enjoyed this type of game, but the upgrade costs are absolutely insane for anyone who doesn\'t feel like shelling out gross amounts of cash in microtransactions. The levels steadily become longer and more tedious, without ever becoming an actual challenge. Too many ads for too little payout.',
       'Great graphics and controls. Really unbalanced on PvP. So won\'t be bothering with that aspect of the game. Prices on gems is a bit of a rip off. Don\'t get much gems for the $. Will be avoiding that aspect of the game as well. Overall a solid 3 stars. Is fun, but could be so much better!',
       'The game was cool up until you start getting stuck and can\'t level up so the only way to move up you have to spend money to buy coins and hearts. Unfortunately people need to chase money rather than make something cool',
       'Kind of a bummer that the PvP has been under maintenance for soooooo long now.  Once you complete all the missions, the fun thing is getting new ships.  Can\'t get the newest ship without access to PvP.' ,

      'Should be able to start of where you get destroyed.  Not start of the beginning of the level. Also I agree with some of the reviews. There are times where there are too many rockets and roadblocks. Need to cut back a bit. Also. With all the fire power. I can\'t destroy a rocket or roadblock?',
       'Tons of fun and addicting. Though the difficulty is a little unfair. I\'ve upgraded all my stats and still haven\'t gotten much further than when it was stock. And I\'m only on map 2.',
       'This game is awesome! it\'s like an 90\'s style playstation game but bare in mind that it needs more cars and maybe some new power ups. Hate the road blocks lol 😂',
       'I really enjoy playing this game. but playing it for too long the music will get boring. Also music player is broken after last update.',
       'It\'s another "Shoot Em Up"addictive game. The graphics are 👍👍 Awesome👍👍 So is the gameplay. It has that Grand Theft Auto#1🚘 feel to it  Along with  Galactica 🚀,2 of my favorites.  The bonus mission with the 🚁is the $hit, nice way to pick up cash to upgrade your 🚘, there\'s really not much I can say bad about this game. The only thing I\'m not to fond of is the ⬅️🚘➡️action it be nice if you could move ↕️&↔️to, But then again it might make the game too easy.  Also some of the small side Jobs, like traveling a certain distance for certain amount of⏱ seconds, doesn\'t seem to be working. I don\'t know if it\'s just my game or if it\'s an error in the game But I tried to do them and nothing gets record it for them. It would also be nice if the💎💎💎\'s could show up just a bit more often during play, you know so you can continue after you 🔥BLOW💥UP🔥lol lol. All in all This game gets 4🌟\'s from me and sits pretty close to the 🔝of the list of my games to play.  HELL its the only game you can drive a 🚗or fly a 🚁🍺🥃, shooting at other 🚗,⛟,&🛥,crash it, 🔥💥🔥 it up, and do it all over again JUST FOR FUN!!! Gotta Love It!',
       'Boy oh boy,  where do I begin? OK,  I\'m not gonna waste half my review on telling on how good it os because you probably already know it\'s exelent so.  Things needed to be changed... Make the road blocks nerfed,  I don\'t want less road blocks but rather it only does 1\\2 of your health instead of a 1 shot,  Also,  late in the game it almost sorta gets impossible to win because of enemy spam,  maybe lower the rate of enemy\'s or lower their health by around 20%,  OK?  Well,  that\'s all I have to say...' ,

      'Game is getting better with being fair. Free to play people can actually roll decent heroes after a while with persistence. IGG is still unbelievably money hungry for their newest released things - but I guess it\'s better to wait for everything or pay for it upfront. I chose option 1. Thank you IGG for making rolling a little more fair.',
       'I\'ve played for 3 years and this game has just gone way downhill, this is the biggest pay to win game that exists. It\'s enjoyable to see people have the ability to buy what I worked so hard during the last 3 years for a mere $10. I haven\'t enjoyed this game in months, it\'s a chore to still play. Download only if you\'re willing to drop a fortune.',
       'nice game for the others saying that this is a copy of coc it has a lot of difference this game is more easy to play than coc. coc is a hard game more time o upgrade more time on things in this in only 5 m its fast becouse it is free and you already have a hero if you start the game in coc you ned to be th lvl 7 to get it or 8 idk but dont say that coc an cc is the same becouse your wrong of saying that they are the same (^_^)',
       'What stands out the most from other games of this type for me is that you get heroes and that you don\'t lose fighters in battle unless they die whereas in other games like clash of clans you lose all you fight with regardless. Plus it\'s just an incredibly addictive game that you can do well with even if you don\'t spend any money.',
       'I\'ve been playing for almost 4 years and CC used to be better before you could purchase top level heroes. IGG really sucked what little competitive nature was left in the game out with pay to win. If you want to spend money on a game and still be competitive, play Summoners War instead.',

      'It\'s nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it\'s not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It\'s just not fair.',
       'I loved flow free from a young age. I\'ve played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I\'ve tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs',
       'Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.',
       'Fantastic game. Real addiction game I\'d say. It\'s an awesome time killer. Different types of levels never make the game boring. Graphics is okay. Number of ads for a free to play game is less compared to other games out in the market which is a relief.Overall I would give 4.5/5',
       'Love this app! I prefer the original version over the walls, hex, etc. and have solved every single one of them. Need more puzzles. Although I\'m sure I can solve them all again as it\'s impossible to remember these. Either way, I cannot get enough of them.',
       'Massive increase in ads recently. I used to get through at least 3 quick levels (Sometimes more) before an ad will appear. Now, however, there are ads after every 30 second level, so I\'m seeing an ad every 30 seconds. Not only that, but I every single time I click the back button an ad pops up, and I end up having to click back a second time after dismissing the ad. I understand the need for ads, but this level of ad intrusion is completely unacceptable.' ,

Although I like the new power-ups, it wouldn\'t hurt to bring back the old ones as well, and by that I mean allow players to buy more lives, boosts etc.   I hope the developers can make this happen, although I\'m only one person so they will not listen and probably couldn\'t care less what I think, but listening to the customer (or player of your game in this case) would probably work out quite well.',
       'I love this game. It\'s pretty old, but amazingly, still one of the best games on a mobile device. It\'s unbelievably addicting, which is quite a problem.. 😂 But I love this game so much, and I play it everyday. Keep it up, Halfbrick Studios! I\'ve been playing this game since I was about 5, so sorry for the late rate. 😄',
       'I love this game. It could be improved though, I think that during missions where you have to do a certain amount of something in one game (for example, ride 500m on the hog in one run, or collect 4 tokens in one game) there should something that tells you how much of that thing you have done during gameplay. This would be super helpful so you don\'t have to count yourself. Also to those who are complaining about ads, I simply turn off my WiFi when I am playing (this prevents ads) and I turn it back on to do the S.A.M challenge.',
       'Pretty good game. It\'s a really fun game to play, and a great killer time. But it has way too many ads. It also tells you to spend a lot of real life money, to the point that is ridiculous. Like, having to pay to be able to use a third slot. Really???',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME. Ok this game is a amazing, sometimes it is very glitchy but i think that it\'s just my divice. I llve the imagination that the game gives you and I LOVE THAT YOU CAN EVEN BUY A DOG CALLED FLASH and buy new clothes and even jetpacks. Personally i think this game is really cool and it is now officially my favourite game!',
       'The ads are disgustingly invasive and annoying as they follow most playthroughs. The game itself is quite enjoyable. Id honestly pay to have them removed, but does not seem an option. If ya dont like ads, dont play this game' ,

       'It\'s stupid. It\'s really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn\'t turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked.',
       'I dont know why people are rating Ketchapp games below 4 stars... I agree games are difficult but one of the unique one\'s in every launch. Their creativity is awesome... Love to play each of their games. Kind of more chanlenging and unique ones',
       'This is an amazing game! But there\'s a tiny problem with the controls: they are hard to be used. In addition, there are so many advertisments and that\'s the only reason I gave 4/5 Stars',
       'Nice game but became boring in just one day! 2 options of controls: Spin (Steering Wheel) and Tap. Tap option is easier than spin. You have to complete the damn missions but the coins are only available in Normal mode they aren\'t available in arena mode. For making easy highscore follow this!! 1. Switch your controls to tap mode. 2. Open Arena mode. 3. In the beginning take the U-turn. 4. Keep driving in the middle line i.e in between of lane 1 and lane 2. 5. Just keep driving on that small line dividing both lanes and you\'ll get your highscore until and unless you get tired, I\'ve made it to 3,887.  Normal mode is quite harder than the Arena but it provides coins and you\'ve to play it for getting your missions accomplished!  Thanks' ,

      'lnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools "playable",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it\'d be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.',
       'First, I don\'t like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don\'t like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you\'re just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!',
       'Love it addictive,if u like the sims on the pc you will like this.If you are a patient person you don\'t need to spend money either. Update it has lost stars as I don\'t want to spend money and now you need vip to get to the next stages of things. Disappointed with this. If you didn\'t have to pay for anything it would be 5 stars.',
       'im not sure what\'s the cause of the problem but what i know is the sims\' act a lil bit freaky. i just redownloaded this game bcs i cant log in this game before bcs i just updated it. before this, the sims is ok, but now they act really awkward. when they\'re walking, they legs dont even move! it\'s like they\'re flying, plus when they\'re doing any action like "clean the dishes", they dont move, they just stand still in front of the sink. this is freaky. please reply to my review bcs i really want to know more about this. i really like this game except what i said above. this game is really addicting:).',
       'I really like this game, but it would be great that we can do some things with more detail. Like the wedding for example, it would be fantastic if we could send invitations and make a feast...  Those kind of things. Really enjoyed it. Thanks!' ,

      'Can be kinda fun, but the pixel art is pretty bad in a lot of ways. Like, color palettes with weird contrast and too many similar colors, inconsistent line widths that look like they drew the piece too small and scaled it up without paying attention, or like they just converted art drawn in another style to pixel art without fixing anything. Actually a lot of this would be explained if the app makers just put a pixel filter over traditional art pieces or digital paintings. Shows a lot of disrespect for this art form that you made your whole app about.',
       'Controls are more difficult than others like this. It should not erase numbers you have already colored. You should be able to move the screen without coloring where you move the screen. Plus you can\'t color diagonally. Fix these problems and it would be better.',
       'I lost my work on one of my hardest paintings and my removed ads too all because of THE FREE COINS. I accidentally pressed the button and then another one appeared after that. After I closed the next ad I knew everything I did to that painting was gone. The removed ads, the colors. AT LEAST LIKE, MOVE THE FREE COINS. I just quit this game because I know this will always happen to me every time. 😨😤🙀😾',
       'I think its a great app and that you shoulf get it. But there is one thing that needs working on. Which is how much coins you have to use to unlock things. I also likr how they gave me alot of coins to start with which made it easyer for me to start.',
       'I think its good but....... Who ever madw this whatever color you use should only go on that color other colors shouls stay blank not a lighter shade....',

      'Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can\'t stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn\'t happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can\'t buy any of the bikes.',
       'Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you\'re racing friends.',
       'Bugs and Glitches... Multiplayer links are not being sent back and forth properly. Some games keep giving me desert level 1 and not showing any replays or ghost bikes are doing a different levels then the one I am suppose to be racing against. Please Fix!!!',
       'Game is challenging and highly  addictive.  My four year old uploaded this game to my phone and I made fun of him and now I can\'t stop playing it',
       'why is it all the good games have update such as this and with it comes a bombardment of adverts that ure completely unnessesary. i have now deleted this game as a result. stop the flooding of ads within games. its now always about squeezing every penny you can from them. the enjoyment is now gone.',
       'Lost all of my bikes when I re-download the app. It shows the 500+ wins I have, but I don\'t even see a way to get the basic ones unlocked again without paying for their stupid VIP package. It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven\'t bothered to update this in years.' ,

      'I like playing this game although i find that male characters do not have many long hair/ girl hair options available to buy unless you are vip or have diamonds. I think i speak for many people when i say that boys and girls should have more hair options from the opposite sex, for starcoins, as some people may take offense if they are strictly only allowed "boys hair"/ "girls hair" unlsss they are paying for it. I think you could inmprove further by making it easier to earn starcoins and another way to earn diamonds because many people do not want to/ cannot afford to BUY items in a fictional world.. Overall, i think this is a well rounded game, with a few improvement points, however i enjoy being able to have my own unique style in a virtual world :)',

       'Its a fun game however there are hackers,scammers ,glitches and its really annoying when the game freezes. Also when people post art books they can be really inappropriate. I think you should be at least  13 to play this game because of the inappropriate art books. I think the new update is great but I would like it if we would make n buy wish list on tablet and  on phone. Its a fun game but you reply need to think about who you can trust because many people just ply with your feelings.',

      'Yes this is addictive, yes it\'s fun, and it\'s great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don\'t have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it\'s not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it\'s clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.',
       'Way way WAYYY too laggy. It\'s an easy casual game though. I wouldn\'t say it\'s "fun" but it does pass the time and make you want to achieve the little goals. Only goal, make more money in game. That\'s it and you achieve that by not even playing the game so there\'s no challenge whatsoever. Uninstalled after first day reaching about 500 Trillion and force closing 100 times.',
       'I really liked the game but I hate the pay to win more stuff and all the ads and incentives to go download and play other games. I know that\'s what mobile games have become but I want to just enjoy a simple clicker game in peace without a thousand tie ins and adds ruining my sense of immersion. Oh vanilla cookie clicker how I miss you. The game itself is great. Tying in a leader board with a game that incentivizes you to pay real world money to increase your earning rate in game seems messed up, but once again that is what mobile games have become.',
       'Since the last update on don\'t get as much return back from my businesses as I used to. Of it isn\'t fix i will be deleting my game soon. Was fun 2 play, now it\'s not worth it.(edit) I\'ve had this review up for a month and not a single dev has looked at my review or care. They just want your money and do not care about their players.',
       'You should be connected to facebook. So when people change from iPhone to android, we can keep our levels. I just had to restart again and I had 6800 lemons and not much longer to complete the game. What an accomplishment I\'m going to try to receive this time',
       'I like how simple but addicting the gameplay is... it\'s what you would expect from most idle clickers. It\'s fun and it\'s a time filler for when you\'re bored. The only thing I don\'t like is chosing how to spend your money after coming back from a while without playing. You\'ll have this abundance of money but you won\'t know what upgrades to get... You\'re stuck and you were hoping it would be an easy decision but you aren\'t sure of what to upgrade. "Should I upgrade the oil rig a small amount, or should I upgrade the lemonade stand by a substantial amount?" This isn\'t a bad thing, for it\'s normal in games like this, so I wouldn\'t rate the game poorly based soul off of that minor thing. It\'s just how these games are. Overall this is a fun twist on these types of games and I really enjoy it. Also, if you enjoy idle clickers, I highly recommend Clicker Hero\'s or maybe even the classic Cookie Clicker. #notsponsored' ,

      'Pretty cool! I hate that there is not enough reward to play more.. at least victory chests should be always available or an option to erase a chest so you can use the slot to win a more powerful chest. Idea of the game is good, but for the player becomes more frustrating than enjoyable. You wait for all cards to load then you can\'t use them, only one.. the rest need another reloading.. crappy gameplay.',
       'Don\'t bother playing unless you\'re made of money.  If you play without paying a lot of money you will lose a lot and never win a tournament.  The lag is terrible which also causes you to lose a lot. When you decide to pay for some gems watch out cause they will charge up to 4x the amount, then you get to go through the process of emailing idiots and taking days to get your money back. Plus they don\'t match you to your equal the person could be the champ and you\'ll never win against someone that has played it years longer than you. Well best of luck to those that this review didn\'t scare off.',
       'The  Best ANTI - PLAYER GAME Ever!😆1 yr + of play= GUARENTEES/  No PROGRESSION,  To be robbed,  To be cheated, To be underleveled,  To be overmatched, To FAIL! FRUSTRATION! To be insulted & ignored, Daily- in rows of 20 + losses. To be taken for a fool😤BUT most importantly........TO BE UNINSTALLED 😋!',
       'If u don\'t spend money you will never be a big winner! Everytime a new card comes out everyone buys them up and you can\'t win. That makes this beautiful fun game suck turds!!!!',
       'It\'s a fun game, but don\'t waste you\'re money. If you\'re going to charge $25 for a chest at least give someone a legendary character. Waste of cash, never again!.',
       'Been playing for a year now,very addictive. But its very unreasonable .. ive spend more tha  R1500 on the game and im on 2400 trophies for 5months. They put you against players that\'s much stronger then you..' ,

      'Overall the game is great and super addictive. I probably would have continued to play but the sheer number of advertisements and some coding logic that makes it annoying after every game to wait for the ad to go and to even after selecting the Google account, it keeps asking for that... It\'s become annoying beyond the point for me to continue. Otherwise, great game.',
       'On mobile, the ball often ends up too close to the corners for you to aim or see any trajectory. It clearly needs bigger margins, or you have to see lots of balls wasted. Apart from that, might be a fun game',
       'A geometry based game with messed up geometry, especially interaction with corners. Add the fact that block addition on each level is set up to fail you - \'it\'s ok\' is a pretty accurate overall experience',
       'An addictive game! Frustrating maybe at first but once into it it difficult to stop playing 👍',
       'Too much ads for such a simple game. Lacking of functions which differentiate itself from many other same games, but require to watch several more ads.',

      'how awful. need to buy building upgrades. building upgrades do nothing. buildings do nothing. literally do nothing. how do you get money? spin a slot machine. Thats the only way. There is no actual game here. And what happens when you run out of spins and realize you still need millions more money to upgrade worthless buildings? give them real money. this game is so lazy it might as well be classified as a scam.',
       'I love this game. But please increase the numbers of spins every hour. And I also have come across one more problem- I get notifications saying that I have won spins and coins but when I open the app there is nothing or no way to collect my reward. I don\'t know what to do?',
       'I love this game but my question is how do you retrieve your game play if stupid Facebook keep locking you out of your account? My friend has been locked out of Facebook as she only uses it for games and is quite far in her game but now cannot play there must be an easier way to play and trade cards with ftiends without connecting to Facebook.',
       'Really so sick of this game. They really need to change some things it\'s absolutely ridiculous how some people spend a lot of their OWN money buying coins and spins for this game for someone to go right behind you and take almost every coin you have before you even got to spend them after you just spent $25 Of your actually money. So done playing this is ridiculous I should have never spent real money on this game anyways so it\'s my own fault but I mean COME ON NOW...',
       'DON\'T PLAY!! SCAMMER! THEY DON\'T CREDIT YOU THE COINS YOU WON FROM RAIDS!! EVEN IF YOU BUY THEY DON\'T GIVE YOU THE CREDITS EITHER. AND THEY WILL IGNORE YOUR MESSAGES TO SUPPORT',
       'Love the game but it restarts every time I try and watch a video for spins/coins. Also restarts when I try and invite friends to play , and trying to gift send or accept. Might have to delete and find a new game' ,

      'wouldve given 5 star. but because i stated my mind and what other players have thought ab that weird guy ironangel. i was silenced. for stating my mind. i have spent a load of money om this game and tech support doesnt respond at all much anymore. when you stop persuading ppl to pay money and then ban them from the game then 5 stars woll be awarded.',
       'It feels like you have destroyed the loot given buy the golden chests. I used to frequently get hero\'s or 30 shards. Now I get 3 shards for a 100 shard character... not worth spending 400 quid to get op hero\'s',
       'Good game, but so far diamond rewards are small. Gold and party experience/skill points, although come in bunches, are expensive builds. Good game, but other games give more  (in the early levels) than this one.',
       'PQ has gone from being a fun and honest game to hardcore pay to play. If you\'re not prepared to shell at least $100 a month then don\'t bother.  Even worse there is no technical support. There\'s this robot called Iron Angel who either insults your intelligence or gives you the we hate bugs to reply that doesn\'t do much to help players. They also have company trolls on their forums so don\'t bother complaining there.',
       'Game is great, but the support team never responds to emails and free offers are like Russian roulette. Deserve better than to get ignored after spending 150 on this game',
       'The game is ok but the mods are horrible. They chat silence everyone. You ask them to unsilence a friend and they silence you as well, no warning or anything. Id avoid this game until they deal with the mod named Ironangel' ,

    description: 'Ever wanted to be Mayor? Ever wanted to run a town, develop the land, and see a metropolis grow? Well, look no further than Merge Town!, the newest title from Gram Games. The concept of the game is simple - you have a plot of land, and it’s your job to turn it into a town. Every so often, you’ll be gifted with a house. Each house can be merged with other houses of the same variety to form a bigger home. Every house built on the land will earn you money - the bigger the home, the more you will earn. The more you earn, the more houses you can purchase, and the more you can push the clock to develop faster. Use your spoils to discover new homes, and to expand into all new towns.You have a singular goal: make your towns the best they can be. The bar at the top of the screen measures development - Merge buildings to earn XP and level up. Higher levels will unlock more space in your plot for you to develop, which will only allow you to develop your town to even further greatness. Once you develop into new towns, keep an eye on all your land, ensuring that you’re merging and developing to your full potential.Merge, build, and develop your very own towns with Merge Town!',

      'I just bought the level 4 crates. Some were delivered, then it reverted to level 3. I have a screen shot showing that I already had level 4. I cannot find a bug report feature in this game. Please fix this in my account. Otherwise, I love the game. Remember to buy something to fix the ads.  Edit: I sent customer support an email with a screen shot a month ago. There has been no response.',
       'I like merging games, but this one has a huge ad issue that makes the game somewhat frustraiting to play. I\'ll click the store to buy a house and it will auto start an ad video. It\'s lacking a bit in the story line department too. For a base merging game it\'s simple and fun, but definitely needs some work.',
       'Ever wanted to be Mayor? Ever wanted to run a town, develop the land, and see a metropolis grow? Well, look no further than Animal Crossing cuz this game does none of those things. You just merge buildings into better buildings. It is fun, if you spend money so that you\'re not bombarded with ads. But then you run the risk of being unable to watch ads when you want to to do things like double your earnings or unlock a better building from the mystery box.',
       'When opening the game it loads fine Nd does its idle thing, but I can\'t tap on anything. Completely 100%unrespomsive. After multiple attempts. Will change rating if game becomes playable before I forget about this review.',
       'Too many useless ads! I don\'t like being forced to watch ads. Especially when they take up more of your time than gameplay. The game forced me to watch a 15 second ad just to open the store. UNINSTALL!!!',
       'Same problem as many, wanted to buy the lvl 4 crate upgrade, now it says there\'s an error. Hopefully my card didn\'t get charged. Don\'t you want people\'s money, guys? Otherwise nice gameplay.' ,

      'Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I\'ll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily "less than 20 coins" reward. Sooooooo cheap!',
       'It\'s just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that\'s a good question.',
       'Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don\'t terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.',
       'Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don\'t ever plan to, but here you also don\'t really need to. I\'ve won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you\'re not forced to watch them. It\'s not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.',
       'Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don\'t even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.',
       'Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn\'t be putting people in the "club" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this "club" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they\'re INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game' ,

      'Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?',
       'Ok. I admit this game is pretty fun. But the missions, especially the hardcore ones, are ridiculously hard. So if you want a challenge, I recommend this game. But if you rage over really dumb things like me, then I definitely do not recommend it.',
       'New update stucks a lot and 1st time my mobile hangs a lot due to this game and btry drains faster than ever. plz crt these mistakes to continue njoying this game',
       'I have a problem. It won\'t let me  replay what I did its bad I want it fixed. Can you help?',
       'Fantastic time passer, very fun... but where is my progress? I had a lot of vehicles and other things but with the new update, all of its gone... can I have it back?',
       'It WAS good, I spent 5 dollars and   so many hours on this game. In the new update what do I see? IT\'S ALL GONE every vehicle, head, and map, GONE! Was an amazing game after this I\'m done for a long time.' ,

      'I like this game but there\'s so much cheating going on. It doesn\'t resister some of the moves you make or it\'s lagging and when you smash the minions they should fly away and not stick to the screen for ten seconds so you can\'t see what\'s coming next. Just stop cheating! Don\'t take 20hours to give the necessary tools when doing a double task in the jelly lab.',

The only other thing is they grew more wise  for the latest update, you can\'t change the time on your phone to add lives anymore! Probably better that way, one (read: I) should pace themselves when playing....',
       'No really, if there were 100 stars this game and developer would get it! A word of warning....IT\'S ADDICTIVE!! if you ever reach the end of the game ( which is very doubtful) you might have to suffer "withdrawals" or you could play one of the other games...',
       'Really an exciting game. But there is a small problem. Sometime when I run the game it\'s not response (all animation are moving, but it isn\'t resopnse when I press the screen) , so I have to close it and run it again many times till it response. Hopefully you will fix this problem ASAP. Thanks!',
       'The arena levels are very hard to pass even though I have unlimited lives the leves become boring because you play and play and never pass. I believe they keep us in that level becuase there is no more levels. Really boring.',

      'I wanted to give 5 stars but when l reached 16 th level....... It came like if you want to open other levels then watch a video...... I don\'t have problem in this..... Then it came like - video unavailable check your internet connection... Dont know why.. Mobile data is on then also. This is the bad point of this game',
       'The ball is super hard to control. Half the time I\'m swiping over and over again just to make the ball move. The game acts like it is super easy when it is the hardest task to do. I\'m also being spammed with ads because once or twice you restart the level because you lost an ad plays. Plys the ads take me to Google Play without me touching the screen or tapping on download. And since the controls are a nightmare because of lines glitching around the ball, (thus making it not move a single centimeter) I have to watch an ad. or lines just glitching themselves. And finally, this game spams me with notifications to "thumbs up" you and download your other games. I\'m obviously NOT INTERESTED IN PAYING YOU WITH ADS!',
       'Don\'t get me wrong this game is fun and gets your brain thinking but I hate how many adds it has. Plus every time an add comes up it takes me straight to Google play with out me even tapping on it. It gets annoying. Another thing I don\'t like about this game is after a certain amount of levels you have to watch a video (add again) just to unlock more levels. And it does this more than once to. On the flip side it is a good game that gets the brain running and the levels do get more challenging throughout.',
       'The ads are forced onto you, and that is the worse system I\'ve seen yet. The controls are pretty good if you have an s pen. Most puzzles are way to easy.',
       'Too many ads and it glitches like crazy. Needs more levels, other than that it was a good game.',

      'If you\'ve liked the first game you\'re probably gonna enjoy this one. It\'s more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it\'s built around microtransactions so if you\'re feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don\'t understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it\'s likely you\'re going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren\'t aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don\'t expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!',
       'I love this game! One thing though, I believe that there are too many plants that cost real money to get. Could you please make some more plants that you can get them by being able to unlock them by playing the game, instead of ones where you have to use real money. Besides that, this is a really great game!',
       'I like this game so much, but after the last update the game is a bit laggy, and I noticed that only the normal level music plays every time no matter what type of level I am playing. For example: the ultimate battle theme and the minigame music are all missing. I am playing on Galaxy A5 2017.',
       'DON\'T WASTE YOUR TIME & MONEY! I made $17 in-game purchase and it crashed very next day. EA support is terrible. Contacted them 3 times but they have not been able to fix it.',
       'Free to play games are always the same formula: Starts off addictive, gets more challenging, starts encouraging you to buy gem equivalent, forces you to buy gem equivalent. At least most other games are fair with it though, giving you a chance. PVZ 2 does not. Levels go quickly from fun to I\'m done, and become impossible. I\'d love to see developers or game testers try to complete later levels without gems, especially Big Wave Beach. It\'s a shame, as the first game remains a classic. Buy the first game and Garden Warfare if you like it. Leaf this game alone, it\'s a sprout at best. Oh and remember, if zombies try to break into your house, throw your money at them.' ,

I love how we\'re able to take care of the premies and foster them until they\'re adopted! 6/10 - Would play again if bored.',

      'Bought all the babies when I first downloaded the app. Everything was working great. So when the most recent (3) babies were available for purchase I bought them, but now those babies don\'t work!.... I\'ll give five stars when you get them to work. In the meantime, I think I should get a refund on my money.',
       'Downloaded this game for my daughter and we never got to play because the game will not load. It gets stuck on the bottle screen and then has a black screen after that. She has Nabi tablet, so I will keep the app for now and just disable it. Please fix soon!!!',
       'My daughter loves this game and plays it all the time. I just bought her all of the last babies today for her to have them all and the bottle freezes and she can\'t play with her new babies. If someone could fix this for me or refund me that would be great. I just got 6 new babies and she can\'t use any of them which is ashame cause she loves this game.',
       'Bought the game early on, then after an update with new babies they mixed the new babies in.  So you are left with a child constantly wanting the new babies.  A horrible money grab.  Otherwise a fun game.  Shoyld not show the locked babies mixed in with purchased ones.',
       'Dang, I wish the purchases I made on 6 more babies for my daughter would just work! She loves the app, but gets frustrated that the whole app freezes when she clicks to play one of the other babies. Wouldn\'t recommend this app because of that... it\'s just stealing my money..',

      'Two big things hurt this otherwise great and fun idea:. 1) projects are not saved in progress!  If you leave one unfinished and go back to it, you have to start all over! 2) there are not enough tools/ways to get at all the pieces in the more complicated patterns. There are other minor things. ... I will say the positives.  This is unique and a good and fun idea!  The designs and colors are very nice!  I did not have a single crash so it is very stable!  There seemed to be a fair amount of ones to do with the free version.  Ads were not any worse than others that use this model.',
       'In general it\'s a fun game but the controls aren\'t easy to control/get use to and aren\'t smooth. There aren\'t many new drawings every day either. What I like is that some of the ones where you need to pay you can watch an ad to unlock it. It\'s also a great time killer.',
       'It is quite cute and you can even do the ones that need you too pay by watching an ad. They are quite detailed and you can rotate around unlike some other apps. When I was moving around, the controls were a bit slippery, but it was a big upgrade from other apps. I recommend you download it if you like medium difficulty pixel art, although there are a few simpler ones.',
       'Great stress reduction game I had to lower my rating because my game is having trouble scrolling down the list. I don\'t get far and it\'ll put me back at the top of the list. Please fix this problem so I can go back to five stars... thanks',
       'This is rlly fun I love the part where u can see like a type of slideshow of when u were coloring it and starts off of nothing then fills in the areas u filled in when coloring . This game is REALLY FUN mostly if u have nothing to do just color it\'s satisfying and fun! Also when u are bored this helps u! This game is fun and addicting!',
       'The only problem is that everytime you wanna play one it pops up an ad. There is no point in not doing the ones that you can do if you watch a video. You watch one everytime. (Hint: Press the back button on your device to get out of the video but still play) Otherwise, It is my favorite 3d color by number!' ,

       'Really like this game I give it only three stars or two just because on the 6th or 7th or 5th it gets really hard because I think on this six you have to play a game and the arrows weren\'t showing up and then I think on the 7th it gets harder because they\'re the sky and it\'s a circle and Eric trying to get to Mia but he can\'t do that dress because the guys keep on knocking into the guy Eric keeps on knocking into the guy but that\'s not his fault because the guy keeps on coming for him which that\'s not what it was supposed to be it said is going to just guard me if I don\'t give it a zero from 1 to 10 5 from 1 to 10 because 5% of that I hate it by a person of it I like it I don\'t even love it I don\'t even want to say love in this one because it\'s not that good of a game so I want to play it and if you\'re wondering why I rate this game is because I\'m on the like 6 or 7th and it\'s really hard so I would I wouldn\'t play this game if you want a hard game that will that is just making that guy win you\'ll keep on having to do it and do it and do it and do it and do it and do it and do it but you\'ll never win because the guy always wins he has a hoodie on and on his shirt if I were to if I were to do this on a mermaid secret seven.',

      'Good idea, poor execution ok on the mobile version. Constant lag, hard to control, the view is zoomed way in so you never see anyone bigger coming your way, full of adds, and the game constantly crashes and kicks me out. When I try to log back in, it says that I\'m trying to log in to an account I\'m logged into elsewhere. It has potential, but it needs work...',
       'fix the laaags please. I have high speed internet but still facing lags. I spent a lot in this game and don\'t want to loose it. Still lagging :(. It works with only high speed internet. Can\'t play with the data packages only strong wifi.  You didn\'t fix this in the new edition of the game and the rush mode is not working. The new party is sucks big time. Fix fix fix',
       'Lately I\'ve been lagging ALOT and I have high speed internet. Oh, and when it does somehow load i get eaten repeatedly by teams, so I restart the game and that lobby has teamers too.   On days when I feel like going through all of this I have to go through the constant ads that me have to go through hell and back to exit... So I assume, maybe rush? NOPE rush has teams left to right as well... please fix the lagging problems and find a way to terminate teamers or make lobby\'s smaller so nobody would see a reason to team, and when that\'s done I\'ll rate you 5 stars.',
       'What is this???? After every 1 or 2 game when the main menu comes I touch screen just frozes I can\'t even touch any button. Neither I can play nor I can go to shop it\'s nothing I can do but just to quit the game. My phone is Samsung S6  Pls do something it\'s really irritating',
       'This is a nice idea for a game but needs a lot of work. First of i couldn\'t even understand how the game works. Always saying "connection is slow" every damn time. Controls? Terrible. Before i even learn how to move i get eaten. Please look into these and you might have a good game there.',
       'It makes me frustrated but it\'s really addictive also very fun I love it though. The graphics uhh... well it\'s okay kinda... well moving on. I would rate a 5 only because the game is AWESOME!!! I love it!!!!!  But the controls... I hate them just being honest because... well you know person reading this well there\'s my story about the game.' ,

      'Great solitaire game! If you want to play on and on, you need to buy extra credits, which I did because I could not wait+their CS is amazing!! Games are fun to play and challenging... You could still play without buying credits,,, it would just be slower. Highly recommended,! So grateful for fantastic customer service',
       'The game is very fun, but I only get to play one or two hands before I have to wait another hour to get more credits to play. Would be a lot better if you got more credits for wins or had free play. I\'m not spending money to buy credits. Also, it would be great if there was an option to turn off the fancy card movements; I get motion sick from it.',
       'If you like solitaire you will hate this game. This isnt a game of skill or strategy. Its a sort of a matching game and it becomes clear quick that they are going to drain you of your seed currency quick so you can start spending real money. You will just pull card after card that you dont need.',
       'Its great game love that I don\'t need Wi-Fi to play it. But some of levels just get so impossible to beat you spend four day on one level. Make the crops pay out more and levels make them a bit easier make the challenges be the hard ones.',
       'Great game concept, great graphics, however it really sucks that the amount of coins required to play  increases too much and you don\'t get enough coins. I wish it didn\'t cost so much to play, it seems like they just want you to actually buy more coins. No thanks. Will be deleting.',
       'I really like the concept of this game. Unfortunately I am not prepared to even give it one star as it doesn\'t take you long to realize that the only aim from this game is to extract money from all who wish to play. Pitiful really as there are many similar games available which you don\'t have to feel pressure to buy' ,

      'I have only had this game for a few days, so I can\'t write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it\'s up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.',
       'Man i love this game!!! So much better than wolfquest!!! I do hope tht this game soon be added new things like more animal to play as, better in performance. The ad free guys...keep it up!!! Just wondering if there\'s a add as mate system in multiplayer in the future? Anyways....this is the best wolf game tht i played!!! Do hope tht you guys one day add more animals to play as (like a snow leopard for example)',
       'On one of the quest, I think 11. There ia a syrange new animal and I went to the game menu for information and there wasn\'t any. It looks like a brown rabbit, I tried killing Rabbits squirrels and deer, but It wasn\'t the right animal! Is it in the snow biome?  Anyways hope you can help me and otger quest 11 users. It\'ll be great that when you get the same animal twice it counts as duplicate. For example "Wolf Common Duplicate +(however acorns). Thanks and the update is great!',
       'Could you add more animals to play as? And a world idea could be a dessert. I love this game, and the others you\'ve made, so I know you will make awesome updates soon! Keep up the good work. If you fixed the glitch were you eat and jump at the same time you fly, if you fixed that can you please put it back. It was fun... XD',
       'It just lags now. The new update made it to where my chat, my character, and my animations won\'t work. I run about as fast as a turtle, and I am not pregnant. Please fix!!!! I love this game. I have a few questions if you don\'t mind... Can you guys add in multi-player mode, like single player mode, that we can pick up our pups, it would be cool to add that option in the top left menu. Thank you guys so much!! Love the games!!',
       'I LOVE THIS!!!!!!! thank you, thank you, thank you! This game is so amazing. Are you going to add more creatures though? Maybe like wild chickens or somthing? And with the deer, I think they should run away from you like rabbits, cuz deer in real life deer run away from wolves and lynx.  I would also like it if you made a horse/pegusis/unicorn game(s) as well. That would be amazing.' ,

      'The car will control itself... If you hold left it will turn left for a period but will start to try and straighten up... To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed',
       'I hope in the new update you can upgrade the engine and body kits as well. That would bring back the fast and the furious Season 7 track 6 nexts to be check it says three lap but you are basicly doing lap 2 twice and it says wrong way. Third lap starts when u finish three laps and doing 4th lap counts as 3rd lap. Needs to be looked at this is cheating  u guys are doing',
       'I have a one plus 5T with 8 GB ram still the game hangs at the finish line and all my progress is lost. I have to restart the game to get it going. Please fix this I can sent you the screenshot is you want. I love your game and it would be great if these small thing is fixed swiftly !',
       'Fix the detection when you touch/hit in perfect drift mode. There\'s been hundreds of times where ive definately not hit and yet it ends. So Infuriating, love the game but that one detail could definitely be optimized better. The drift should not end unless you actually hit and it screws up your direction. 4/5',
       'Game is really good. Best drift game I\'ve ever played on the phone. But there are small bugs in the game such as season 7 second perfect drift track (should be Turin) the race is not 3 laps. Even though I finish 3 laps it didn\'t finish the race and it gives the "wrong way" warning Everytime I pass from start/finish line. I hope you can fix this.',
       'I love this game and so do all my mates. It dose have a few light glitches as most games do. I would love a night track of some kind in the future but other wise great game all together. Also out of all the drifting games this is the best one at of all of them.' ,

      'The game is nice for every football fan.... Nice controls and good graphics...events are awesome... There r different game modes.. the only thing that I don\'t like after the recent update is that while playing campaign mode there are many stages which requires u to be in certain lvl in VS mode.... I think both the modes should be independent.. otherwise it\'s a fabulous game... The most awesome football game in play store right now.',
       'Fut can not be developed with this building team. Football is one of the most attractive games but how this fut goes? In Vs attack mode, what the hell meaning do chances have? Players must creat chances by themselves not the game. You must let them play whole game and create the chances by themselves. EA is a big builder in football games and develop a lot but have you ever thought how your fut only stands at this place?',
       'overall its an awesome game great experience. but Its hard for free to play players to complete and go through the events..... the icons are too difficult to get please make them a bit earlier to get, it will be awesome to have them in the team.... its difficult to get elite players in a pack of 500 fp totw pack n few others packs too... the vs attack mode is great.... EA please make sure that the free to play players to get a good experience of getting new and better players....',
       'I played and like fifa mobile very much but I left it because of some issue but when I login again i lost kt 90+ account its. Shows 110/10 energy and i only got my 3200 fifa notes i lost my i account all i got is logos and notes is this how you protect our privacy? I want to enjoy and play again with my account as soon as possible. Please help.',
       'This season is much better than the earlier. The developers are doing a very good job by listening to the users through Twitter. The Free to Play users will find it a but tough to get the best of the players. In App Purchases will help a lot in this game. But even without paying this game has a lot to offer. Addictive if you are football fan.',
       'Can you please make the following improvements then your game will rule the playstore. 1) Make your graphics good. Sometimes one can\'t even recognise the player. 2) Add  real referee there on the pitch. 3) Add a feature of commentary in all languages. 4) Add an option of the records of every individual player\'s stats, goals, assists and all. 5) Add some weather conditions,night mode, attendance. 5) Add a number of more celebrations and especially player\'s signature celebration.  Please take a look on my review and make the game more beautiful.' ,

      'Graphics are awesome, but the game itself is very monotonous. You can fall asleep waiting for something to change and make it more exciting. When a change such as an added bonus does come (bomb or a rainbow bubble) you realize that it wasn\'t worth the 20 or 30 levels you just wasted your time on. Progressive enticing events need to happen more quickly.',
       'On level 19 I scored three stars bit it shows only two. Aside from that, no other complaints... YET. I will say thank you, though, for not aggressively pushing ads, pushing to pay to extend the aim line. So far, its amusing😁',
       'This is a really fun game but my  my concerns are that when I have no balls left, for me it doesn\'t have the option to play a video to earn more but for my brother it does therefore it makes me start all over again. The other concern is that when I use a bomb for the chest it takes away a ball for example I have 12 balls when I use the bomb from the chest, I get 11 balls left which it doesn\'t do that for my brother. I hope you can fix this.',
       'Excellent game, 20 on 10, but only worth 1 on 100 for WAY TOO MUCH USELESS ADVERTS!!! Not worth installing because of WAY TOO MUCH USELESS ADVERTS.',
       'I like it other then the fact of every time I got to shoot the ball goes slightly left or right not exactly where I want it. Might be my screen sensitivity?  Other then that I dig it!',
       'It\'s the best! But there are a bit too many ads, but the thing I like about the ads that they are shorter than most ads.' ,

      'It was fun while it lasted. I was a big fan of the first game and this one was an awesome improvement. Unfortunately my game crashed after months of playing and forced me to play the tutorial again. UPDATE: After reaching out to Pikpok customer service they reset my story progress and gifted me several leveled up weapons that help balance out what I lost. I appreciate their rapid response and look forward to playing more!',
       'After i reach chapter 4, suddenly all my weapons progress are gone,  then i contact the support team,  and they dont restore my previous weapons,  but they give me MORE than what i have before. 😄  I really happy with this,  and i really appreciate this.  You guys should try this game. This is AWESOME. Now it\'s time for me to kill more zombies 😎',
       'I give you guys a 5-star rating. The graphics are amazing. And the weapons are cool. The only thing. I wish we didn\'t have to have the stamina constraints. And it would be awesome if I was able to keep the extra ammo I find so I have it for future levels. And also its a pain in the ass to level up the guns all the damn time',
       'OMG. I definitely LOVE this. Better than the first. The storyline had me excited. Now it\'s more fun running with a goal. Love everything. I\'m on the lowest graphic settings but I still encounter minor lags. Oppo A83. But that\'s fine. I love how you can name your companion. Makes it more personal. Good job!',
       'Excellent game. I am totally addicted to it. Developers can you please include a reload button. Also sometimes playing I hit a wall or fence and it becones impossible to move left or right. In that case moving a couple of steps backward coukd save us in the game. Please include these options for making the most out of it. Overall its an excellent game and I highlh recommend it.',
       'Update! I spoke with the PikPok sevice team they fixed everythimg! Thanks guys! After getting to a certain level the game froze on the start up screen. Reinstalled and lost all my progress.' ,

      'Hey RobTop, the game is ok, but there is one issue. im used to playing geometry dash with my samsung chromebook 3 (it doesn\'t have touchscreen) and when i press the spacebar on my computer (this is the same issue on geometry dash lite and subzero) it doesn\'t let me jump. And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.',
       'This game stress me out but the next day when I play it I beat the lv in one go and fills my heart up with joy! So what if the control\'s are sensitive? I know they are.. but if you take a day and give it another go you know what happens and you do great!',
       'This is really hard. I can\'t buy the full game as I am only 9, but I think I am missing out on a lot. Please add check points to normal mode as some levels are basically impossible',
       'I HATE GD WORLD YOU KNOW WHY?? IF U ALREADY DOWNLOAD SONGS AND LEVELS IN FEATURED THEN AFTER PLAYING YOUR SAVED LEVELS AND SONGS THEN IF U WANT TO EXIT GD WORLD AND IF U WANT TO PLAY GD WORLD AGAIN U WANT TO PLAY SOME SAVED LEVELS THEN IF U SEE SOME SAVED LEVELS THAT U DOWNLOAD U NEED TO DOWNLOAD IT AGAIN AND IT\'S SONGS THATS WHY I HATE GD WORLD EVEN GD FULL!! (F*** MY LIFE!!)',
       'I love this game just...can you fix one glitch? On the final level final area the wave is bugged ...when I tap it goes down by itself! Can you please fix it? I was trying over 3 hours to make it but I can\' t because of the glitch :( Please fix it.',
       'Got all the way to the end,  and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow,  and ended up having to restart all of the levels,  fix this,  it doesn\'t happen with the other geometry dash games,  just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted...  Fix then 5 stars' ,

      'Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!',
       'In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it\'s newer it\'s boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star',
       'Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can\'t just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can\'t advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it\'s basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.',
       'This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said "add break". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them.',
       'The game desparately needs to offer more coins as skill level increases.  The frequency of coins remains the same while the skill level demands more and more coins (in the thousands).  Watching ads helps, but the player finds themselves doing that exclusively, which defeats the purpose of the game.  Physics, graphics and gameplay are good.',
       'One Of My Favorite Games  So. Let me start of by saying I LOVE it! So I like very few games, in fact nearly no games. But this  game is epic! It\'s interactive, fun, motivate and time killing. But there is one problem and that\'s there are to many adds and most of them are inappropriate' ,

      'I love playing the game but there are so many updates all the time. And when they do their bimonthly update you have to download new package and then some gameplay features dont work. I have had a couple things not work from last update. I tried to contact support and they havent replied at all. Its been three days now. Im an everyday player who spends real money in game. Would rate higher if someone would help me out..',
       'I recently switched to mobile gaming only, and I have a g stylo phone and a Nvidia shield k1 tablet. On my phone I get network error (I\'m data only) and my tablet says the game isn\'t compatible. It\'s marshmallow OS on the shield tablet and the thing can run borderlands 2 natively so I know it\'s not a hardware issue. This game looks cool. Wish I could find out for sure. And no, I\'m not running a speed test.',
       'I just realized this evening that this game uses the microphone feature to spy on the players and listen to their conversations without their consent. After joining one event I could clearly hear conversations of other players (not about game and I\'m sure without them even knowing that they were being listened to) while I was having my sound turned off, even after leaving that particular event and when having my game in the background the sounds didn\'t stop until I turned off the game. This game should be called Legacy of Spies, nice try 👍🏻',
       'I Love the Game itself. But the reason I give 4S only is their Support System. It seems that they dont really care about their Players, And also, The game itself is Great from its Interface to its gaming experience. Its all good, but when new updates comes, the game has Always Bugs, and Developers seems so slow to Fix them.',
       'Sorry for giving you low rating. But it\'s been days or weeks idk, it\'s always freezing when I try to open assassins chronicle and soul relic. And it\'s been months I\'m getting messages \'go get your mine\', but no map\'s coming. I can\'t even enter any plunder, for days. Hope you fix that.',
       'Will i ever get the chance to play again? Cant sign in to complain and it doesn\'t look like LOD  really  care about the players. I haven\'t been able to get on since The 8th!!! The game has stoped loading after the last update. It will either reach 21% or 71%.' ,

      'Awsome game. Completed all levels without any hack jzt waited  for hope   ( the lives ) evrbdy shld try this. Sry i gonna uninstall this app only bcoz i finished all levels. Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.',
       'The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don\'t get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new "enemies". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you\'ve lost some lives. But that\'s not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.',
       'I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It\'s more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.',
       'Completed all but just couldn\'t get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I\'ve ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.',
       'I love this game 😍😍 it is my favourite but.... I don\'t like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it\'s a great idea😋😋 btw i loved it 😍😍😍 ill give it 5 stars then😊😊',
       'Game is great, but when you lose all your lives it takes some minutes for you to be able to play again, or you can buy the pro version but who wants that? I just wanted to play whenever I wanted to without paying extra for it... You maybe could allow us to play without achieving anything without the need for lives...' ,

      'Me and my little brother really love this game! But then it has lots of ads everytime i arrive at the green light and also when purchasing weapon at the weapon shop😣😣 its also difficult to climb up the hill or mountain especially when i accidentally fall into the sea.  Maybe add some extra moves like to able to grabbing thing, and speed up the ability to punch or kick people/thing.',

      'Loved the game but if the life was free this waiting for minutes to play again is not cool. Also noticed if you have to score more than 1 goal and you make a mistake you have to start from the same goal you already scored. If we can get the requirements before each challenge that would make it much more fun otherwise I love this game a lot keep updating for more seasons. Thank you. I am on Level 560 with 1257 stars I am awaiting Season 29. If you can also create a full football game with same concept. This is a Great game!!! Thank you developers keep developing Great games like these!!!',
       'Wonderful! Game by first touch   But I can\'t wait till the hearts 💚 are filled!  So Reduce the time. Improve this game more and more and create a new exciting games.  I have finished 390 levels. And I have a doubt what is the last level and what happens after it? All the best for ur future and I\'m a biiiiiiig fans of u guys!!  Hands off',
       'SCORE  HERO RULES This game is so sick dudes. It so cool that this gives us idea that how to play soccer or football. Gameplay is so smooth . They players show us some epic skills . It has an commentary. The worst part was the heart. I can\'t wait till it get refilled ❤❤❤❤❤ this. Graphics are great . Just reduce the time of refilling the energy . Overall this game cool. Thanks for the game FTG.',
       'Most irritating game plan.  Have any one ever seen in real game that if a player miss a goal then all the previous goals are cancelled? But in this game such thing is happening. You should not cancel all the goals scored only for a miss or loss of a ball. Goals should be saved and to be started from where it stopped for missing a goal or losing a ball. Developer should take it into his consideration.',
       'This now a prize example of a freemium game that needs a premium option. I would gladly pay £10 as a one off purchase to do away with the need to say for lives. In the past games worthy of a one-off fee would offer it and this issue such game that should consider it. I will never pay for any in app purchases on any game and I am sure I am not alone. This has 5* written all over it but the long wait times and exorbitant cost of energy replenishing means this doesn\'t get anything higher than average.',
       'I would absolutely give five stars if you could just pay a fee to unlock the whole game.  Until that time, not a chance.  Great game ruined by the fact that people are forced to either play the game for 30 seconds every 20 minutes or fork out £3 a day or whatever to get unlimited energy.  I get why developers go freemium these days but once in a while it would be nice for one to buck the trend.' ,

      'An interesting game, it gives the planes a slightly paper feel when viewing them. However, the actual controls are smooth although they can be slightly twitchy at times. The addition of game modes recently was a welcome change to the game and has helped me through many hours of boredom. This game overall is very good and I advise you download it.',
       'Hate this app because of too many advertisement. The game is good but too many advertisment make it worst cant play much because of it. Google play you should work on the advertisment.',
       'Great game, but there are a lot of ads if you play it enough you can pay to get the ads to go away but they want way to much to just get rid of homework.',
       'To many ads so I paid for ad free and I am still getting ads. Total waste of $3!',
       'TOO MANY ADS! IS THIS WHAT YOU CALL A GAME TO ENJOY? WITH MANY EFFING ADS? Y\'ALL ONLY WANT TO EARN MONEY',

      'Good fun and very addictive. I see people moaning about the adds 😧 but what can you expect from a free game? You get an add pop up after about 5 puzzles and to be honest it is only for a few seconds....just close it if you don\'t want to see them.',
       'Saw it advertised and gave it a go. Pretty fun, once you understand the tactics it\'s pretty easy but I still like it. If you want to waste time, but not on a Candy Crush rip off, this is it!',
       'Simple easy game that just let\'s me stop and focus. I don\'t find the ads too bad, gives me a break between boards. I like the occasional board I can\'t figure out right away.',
       'Love the game but WAY to many ads. Not bad the first level. A 5 sec. ad every 2 or 3 boards. But by half way through the 2nd level it\'s a 30 sec. ad after every board. Definitely going to uninstall it. Too bad.',
       'Hated all the ads every game has an ad! Don\'t waste your time! Uninstalling because of ad bombardment.',

      'Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.',
       'Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I\'ve progressed it\'s just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I\'m not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!',
       'I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I\'ve already dumped into this game and the devs didn\'t give me my in game rewards. I\'ve submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.',
       'Wasn\'t sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to "farm gold,xp,mats". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it\'s an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don\'t be jealous, just play your game and have fun.',
       'Honestly gameplay and all is good but the game is so p2w it\'s not funny, it would cost u over a hundred dollars just to complete every reward for new Valentine\'s event. If you like this game play private server instead this version is a giant cash grab. Not competitive for f2p at all',
       'Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an "annoying add". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It\'s simple, it\'s fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend.' ,
    recentChanges: 
      '1. New Player Level Cap: 300.',
       '2. Celestial Island Battle opens now.',
       '3. New function added: Hero Skin',
       '4. Added 5 new Guild Raid Bosses',
       '5. Other game optimizations and BUG fixed.' ,

      'This game is fun and entertaining and time will pass by you playing this. The only downfall is you only get so many chests locations on main screen and take hrs to open them up. So you have to decide if you want to play or wait the hrs. You can free up those chests by using your gold that you have but if you run out then you have to buy more with real money.',
       'It always seems that luck favors your opponent and gold is extremely hard to come by. Wind totally inconsistent, almost like it screws you purposely.  It would be nice if they gave you gold rewards for achievements but that\'s where their money grab is. Some courses have bugs and it\'s extremely frustrating, Win or lose money always seems to be pretty tight.',
       'It\'s a great game but I was up against one person and it usually gives the other person a chance to hit but this time I would have won but it didn\'t give me a chance to go another round. Don\'t know if this is a glitch or part of the game but it irritated me',
       'Games rotten everytime i go to play the big money games it says iv lost connection. iv got the best wifi on the market so nah dont think so. very annoying dont instal',
       'Would be nice if I could actually get a club that can get a hole in one on a par 3. I\'m pretty sure nearly all par 3 mini golf courses we play in life make it possible for an ace. A little disappointed this game doesn\'t give the chance',
       'I was really skeptical about the quality of this, all other mini golf games I\'ve played have sucked honestly. But wait - this is actually a good game! Kind of rips Golf Clash off a touch design wise but who isn\'t copying everyone these days? Remember the Flappy Bird fiasco and the 500,000 clones still on the play store? Yeah, not going to complain about this game lol.' ,

      'The original sonic dash is better imo. had a better atmosphere, maps looks better gameplay also better. the original was a masterpiece. also, I don\'t like that they introduce scenes that requires you to tilt your phone. since i played sonic dash i didn\'t expect it to be there. it\'s annoying when you\'re laying down and play the game and you got that scene just ruins the gameplay.',
       'Way too many advertisements. I actually downloaded this game because subway surfer makes start over everytime you download it but after my next tech upgrade I\'m going back to that, atleast the game not flooded with ads.',
       'Ads are back. I paid for a red ring bundle, which did remove them for a while, but they\'re back. The only reason I made a real purchase was so that I wouldn\'t have ads, so can someone please remove the ads from my account. On another note, I really like this, and nice to see Shadow playable again.',
       'The responsiveness of the controls I  this game make it unplayable... it\'s slightly more responsive than the original sonic dash but it\'s still no where near good enough for such a fast paced game.  I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it\'s the same on all of them',
       'I would give it 5 stars, I made an in app purchase to remove ads, but after the game updated non Sega ads started showing again and it asked me to make another purchase in order to remove the non Sega ads AGAIN... love the game, hate the ads...',
       'The game is great but the ads are so intrusive, immersion-breaking, and so annoying that I\'m giving the game 3 stars. Please, I understand that ads are necessary to make money for a free game but make it so that they are not so persistent that an ad automatically opens after a single run. A shame really, this would be such a great game if this would be fixed.' ,

       'There is a huge delay from when you hit the key to when you hear the key and too many ads. I was trying to find something good to get down song ideas so I wasn\'t the intended consumer and I can see how this could he good for learning, but you could get the same thing off youtube and not have the excessive ads.',
       'It\'s pretty good, and good enough to warm up my voice and practice before singing at my church, and when I\'m bored I just play the songs that comes with the app. And it\'s also handy for when I don\'t have my bass guitar at hand and trying figure out song notes and chords, this is pretty useful. I like it.',
       'It didn\'t work. (Desclaimer: NO HATE, JUST BUGS AND STUFF THAT DIDN\'T WORK)  Very laggy and so many glitches,  I\'m just stating the cons, no hate. It just didn\'t work for me and when I tried to record, it got all glitchy and recorded multiple at a time. I tried to press keys but it wasn\'t picking anything up. After a while, all the keys I pressed came into a big bundle and sometimes, it randomly recorded for no reason. Again, no hate. I just found a lot of bugs, which I would be happy to play this piano with, if the developers fixed it. I couldn\'t move the keyboard as well. I tried to drag it to a different spot, but no avail. Just a couple of things that didn\'t work for me, like how it wasn\'t timed when I pressed a certain button. (NO HATE)' ,

      'Got to the moon in 2 tries,  mars took longer, though it was mars one way, Venus was a challenge. Now I want more, haha, fun game. Encourages innovation. Idea: with persistent modules already in the game, why not allow orbital modules like a space station? Or missions where you need to put a satellite into orbit. How about reusable rocket stages? Updates just make the game better.',
       'So I\'ve been playing the game for a couple of months now. i think that there is an awesome game here, with already plenty to do. I do also think that there is lots of room and need to improve upon this. As I have been playing for a while, I do notice it becomes quite challenging to escape orbit with enough fuel to make it to other planets, like mars. i do recommend you add a cheats section that you can enable in the settings, with unlimited fuel, larger build space, indestructable rockets, etc. I also recommend more bits and pieces for building, like bigger and more powerful thrusters, or air vents for turning in space. For later development, a satellite system would be much appreciated, as well as a little spaceman that you can control when docked at a space station, or when you\'re on a planet. Thank you for an awesome game!!!',
       'I landed on the Moon and... I got back to Earth safely on manual control! What\'s with you, you think I\'m expendable?! There is no way to add new destination once the original one is attained. Also it would be great to have a payload that can be carried other then the capsule alone. Other than this is the greatest fun I had in a while.',
       'I am so addicted to this game. I love everything about it. I just wish there was a place to donate to you (developer). Also, I would love it if there were more rocket parts. Also, I wish there was a thermosphere you had to get through to get on planets. All in all, I love it! Can\'t get enough!  Edit: Thank you so much for the reply. I\'m sorry I wasn\'t clear on the thermosphere part, but i think the reentry effect would be lovely. I just can\'t stop playing. And I\'m SOOOO excited about rovers and things! Thank you so much again! :)',
       'I got to the Moon my second launch! Fun game for doing a launch while waiting for the bus etc. It\'s simple and I like it! Couldn\'t figure out how to decouple my boosters simultaneously. Very nice work on this app! It\'s KSP but mobile version very cool! The music is cool too! My suggestion is to add some reentry heat affects, more sounds like parachute opening sound, etc but I\'m sure that\'s on your list.',
       'Bee looking for a game like for my entire years ! this is the best rocket game, I have ever seen in my life travelling to space , I like the sound system , formation of building materials is compatible ,graphics are excellent to the 2D platform . I like the physics of the game. Please keep it , ur the best Space programmer of all times (GOAT). Is it possible to add a space shuttle and moon rover ?    Regards. Please fix up batrrey issues . my phone heats up a lot .' ,

      'They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It\'s definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you\'ll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.',
       'Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don\'t be fooled. This is a pay to win game.',
       'I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that\'s cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!',
       'This is a great game! I am having fun playing it since I downloaded it! these are my recommendations for the game, ya dont really need to add this but it would be much better if you did: 1.Can you please add a map that shows where you can and cant go. 2. Different controls would be nice, so I can pick what controls are best. 3. Last thing is, If you can change the position of the guns on the robots, but I think this is not gunna be added cause it would nearly change the game, but ya\'ll never know what devs can do right?',
       'Typical pay for play. Fun in the low levels then it becomes painfully obvious who are paying the big bucks. They will say everything can be obtained for free. While this is true. The amount of time and effort makes it not worth the hassle. To get the better robots you will pay a lot of money. $100 for a robot as a sale price in this game. It shuts off in the middle of the game tech support took their time responding and didn\'t address the problem. They say record and take pictures but they will not upload. In my opinion not worth the time.',
       'I totally like the game and all but there must be balance between different robots especially..... some robots have a big advantage like the haechi with 3 medium slots and its dash ability.. its like u cant even aim at it......  Also please remove the components so that everyone is able to buy newer robots... u can make them available in gold or silver or even workshop points' ,

      'After months of playing this game I realised  no need to keep gems but to spend them snd rewards are amazing when you got gifts for fulfilling the tasks. So slow pacing. Could have been more exciting but I like this game and I belong to a township that\'s competitive and kind. Awesome game!',
       'I\'m facing a problem. Their is a costumer that wants a statue that costs me 650 diamond and I don\'t have that much of diamonds I only have 5. And he asked it from me like more than 2 weeks ago . So please give me the diamonds. But its a very wonderful game and I like it so much. But please help...',
       'Game is good. Easy to figure out. Not a fan of the spices that cost gems or the whole VIP thing. Also only leaving this in hopes that that one customer always asking me to rate the game will stfu.',
       'When is the next update on the game and how much longer do we have to wait for Bill and Mary to say I do ? It\'s killing me to wait this long ? Oh I am also wondering why haven\'t I got to go on a higher level I have been on level 28 for the longest time so fix the problems now',
       'Great game. Enjoy the different story lines. What happened to the wedding storyline for Bill & Mary? Every time Diego leaves something goes wrong. My township has disappeared.  I had deposited money & spices in the treasury...what\'s joining on.',
       'I loved this game but when I\'ve played a while  it tells me my profile has changed and to reload losing any progress since the last time I loaded the game very annoying as progressing is taking even longer' ,

      'Think about playing all day Ridiculously good graphics for a mobile game, excellent soundtrack that matches the intensity of each level, and never gets boring. The free version makes you restart from the beginning instead of checkpoints, but I don\'t even mind because it\'s still challenging and fun with each replay. I do wish I could play in a different mode for free though. This would be an awesome Zen game.',
       'So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn\'t save where I\'m at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won\'t be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!',
       'I am going crazy for this game. Great time killer and stress reliever. Graphics, music, and everything else is completely superb. I am totally enthusiastic about purchasing the premium version, however, I could not buy it because I do not have any credit or debit card. Can someone please tell me if there is other ways to purchase, like deducting the fee directly from my SIM balance, perhaps?',
       'Smash Hit Smash hit is awesome because it has a lot of intensity in the game so I get to let my brain work a little.  It kinda let your brain decide if your should hit it or not. I also really like this game because the game is kinda hard so it challenges me a little bit. So who ever made this game I appreciate it. One more thing about Smash Hit is that it brings my family together because we take turns playing the game to let our brain think. Thank You!',
       'I love this game.  It\'s very simple, just go without getting hit by glass or running out of balls, but it is a lot harder than it sounds.  I am forever telling myself I have time for just one more attempt, it is very addicting.  The 3d design on this is amazing and creative.  Up at the top it says to write a SHORT review, so this will end here.',
       'Excellent game. Really superb game. Engaging play and the music works well. Plus fantastic breaking sounds. This game is both addictive and relaxing. Reminds me of the original wipeout. Another cool element is that each level adds interesting new elements. Only thing that would make it better is if my acheivements would track. Im on a galaxy s 7, and they don\'t track. At least my checkpoints save.' ,

      'Overall a great game, there\'s one feature though that I feel lets this game down. Just the small fact that a father can copulate with his daughter, then again with their inbred child if you so wish. I currently have 4 generations of inbred mutants running my castle, if anything the extra fingers actually help with certain tasks such as cleaning. Do you happen to have a designer working on this with the surname Fritzl?',
       'I love this game so much! I spend every moment of free time playing this. The graphics are awesome, music is nice, controls are also easy to get used to. The only thing is the internet. Yea sure, its for online purchases, but i dont buy anything. Still gonna rate it 5 stars tho, because this game is awesome! Definetly worth downloading.',
       'I think the gameplay is good and the caatle building aspect is fun.  However, the level scaling is way off.  You get a point between throne room 4 and 5 and can\'t do a whole lot.  Losing fights when your characters are maxed out in training.  Other than that its pretty solid.',
       'Why in the f**k does this require an internet connection. Fallout shelter is the same thing but doesn\'t need internet. Sure you can use internet for purchases and rewards but it definitely should not be required. Please consider making this offline compatible and I will change my review to 5 stars and a positive actual review of the game. Thank you.',
       'Definitely worth downloading and trying out.. It\'s just like fallout shelter but a little more. You can do a story line and attack other players rather then just sending people out and HOPING to get something good. It\'s a little slow at first but it\'s really quite alot of fun and the creators actually listen to its players.',
       'Good game but when your rank gets high all of a sudden most enemies are too powerful. Then it takes forever to gear up. Solution is to deliberately lose and lower your rank. Not good. Also you will find yourself with a lot of gear after you played a while. Would be nice to able to sort it, not only for your different warriors but also all the production gear. Would be good to be able to more easily compare gear in your stash and what your inhabitants are wearing. It\'s a bit messy now.' ,

      'Why I liked it? Because it\'s a simple game that doesn\'t make you addicted to phone but rather enjoy going forward focusing your attention entirely on your finger. What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven\'t listened to this game\'s. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I\'m entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.',
       'I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it\'s meant to be "skillfull" but thats harder than skillfull, you can\'t even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don\'t care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.',
       'This is game is ok if you are bored and don\'t know what to do.... however it becomes irritating after playing for a while.... overall its a nice game',
       'I would like to report a bug. When you pause the game, moving obstacles keep moving. Someone would use this as a cheat',
       'This is the best game to relax. But i have a problem i do i change the music there are some music that i like and i want only that to play so i request ro put a music option  Thank you',
       'It\'s a good game not that much ads great controls and concept people just rage and rate it bad. keep up the good work' ,

      'Purchasing the other ponies is worth it. Don\'t know why other people are complaining. It\'s only 5 dollars, you could get a DQ lunch for 5 dollars. Anyways, game is amazing. What\'s cool is that you can reset your progress so you can have fun all over again. Amazing work Budge Studios!',
       'This game is my 5 yr olds favorite thing to do during trips. She loves the music and animation, and the gameplay is entertaining enough to keep her engaged. It\'s definitely worth the few bucks to get the add free version.',
       'Pay to play mechanic. Seems rather predatory for a game targeted for younger CHILDREN. Not to mention the constant barrage of ads that can only be removed by paying for ponies which shouldn\'t be EA\'d. Outside of that the game is enjoyable but the paywall issue is a problem. Devs... you should feel bad about yourself.',
       'Installed it, launched it, after the bungie screen was presented by a full screen ad for some game involving a woman + handcuffs + panties. Not a good look for a game aimed at children, my 6 year old was standing behind me.',
       'Only 3 ponies to play with, or 2 for certain people. If you want them all, you MUST pay $5.00 to defeat the pay wall and continue, otherwise reset the game and play the free levels again, with the SAME ponies, Twilight Sparkle, Fluttershy, and Applejack, for the people who got 3 ponies, for the people who have 2, you have Twilight Sparkle and Fluttershy. The game is fun but the pay wall problem has got to go.',
       'Ads popped up every 45 seconds. I timed it. Made the game useless for my son (4). And he really wanted to play it too.' ,

      'There are ads every time you load something new as a level loads, again right after that. which is mentioned in multiple reviews. The game crashes every few levels and the Levels are now designed to be use the power ups for which you will end up paying for more. The first one was such a great game and some of these are enjoyable,  if you have the patience to wait for them.',
       'Its very nice to play. But........there is a gate where they force to get 3 keys by either watching advertisments or asking facebook .   And the worst paet is that u can only watch ones a day which makes 3 daysssss.. Thats what i hate.',
       'The ads are ridiculous. It crashes after some levels. I loved wheres my water 1 because I purchased it. Wish that was an option with this one. I\'ll probably uninstall and look for something else',
       'Ok I beat it but it was to many ads so many that after every level it would go to the home screen but im just glad they finally make the next level free i remember a lot of complaints on that also i was like waiting at the end to do some type of celebration but i dont know if i should uninstall it or like is something suppose to happen',
       'Omg because I can\'t save this app to ANYTHING I\'ve lost all my progress because my phone broke. And I\'ve spent alot of money on this. Why cant u ppl add google or adding facebook to save progress. What a waste. Fix it and I\'ll consider going back and spending more money to get ahead',
       'The stupid "Duck Rush" levels lag and you have to keep swipping to remove the dirt. I have finger burn and still can\'t pass level 28. Think I\'ll go back to the original and complete the achievements. PLEASE FIX THIS.' ,

The AI got worse at the same time, so it\'s not really harder... just more random.  I now find that this game stresses me out instead of helping me relax, so I have to give it up.',
       'Stale gameplay with nothing interesting. AI sucks. Lv 27 has little difference from lv 1. Too boring. Time to rid this trash from my phone at least I bothered playing with AI till lv 27. I wonder if there is even a end game or maybe the level keeps increasing aimlessly without any interesting change. Bored to max.',

      'Great game Social Point!! Im addicted.. One thing tho.. Can you add a production line for the library. Its a bit sucky just making one book at a time. Having a production line like the food will help the flow if the game.. 😉 can\'t wait for the food truck to be opened up!!!',
       'Where\'s most of the sounds gone and where\'s the new ingredients to do the7 challenges. What have you done to the game with the last updates. Cant have chefs without the stuff to cook with. STILL MISSING SOUNDS AND NO RESPONSE FROM THE MAKERS I FEEL RIPPED OFF AND LET DOWN.  Might be time to erase this game go to town ship game maybe they will listen and respond. Wish i could get a refund back on all the gems you have to buy to finish levels. Yes you and your game is starting to p-ss us off waiting for you.  My phone is brand new up to date don\'t try to blame our phone and it the same on my tablet which is brand new to. All the sound was there before your new update',
       'Everything is good and okay. But there\'s one bug in the game. The people just go through the wall even there\'s a door placed... If you can fix this it will be more realistic and great. I hope that the camera can be rotate too so it will be so wonderful...',
       'I think over all its a good app maybe they should change the fact that you have to rank up to get more stuff but really other than that its a pretty good app i incorege who ever is reading this to download it but have in mind its a app that u need to work hard on to enjoy it 👍❤',

      'I played it a long time ago and i stopted like 5 months ago. Then now i reinstalled it and:  1. I could not enter my acc  2. I could not connect to facebook or google play.  3. I had to pay each time i danced wich sucks.  Till that update this game was the best game/app ever. It was so fun and so great that I just wanted to play nonstop.  I mean before this big update u payed for a song and u could dance on it as much as you liked. Now it just ain\'t fun anymore.   Please return to the classic game or your gonna lose much much more players like me.',
       'I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.',
       'It\'s fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I\'m bored. I love the songs and dance moves it\'s awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it\'s awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don\'t know how to dance then you should download this game it\'s perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.',
       'Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren\'t enough. And one of them didn\'t work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.',
       'Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn\'t have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!',
       'I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn\'t make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun.' ,

      'I never EVER been so absolutely in love with a app. I only read about 3 stories and spent $82 for gems and tickets because not only I couldn\'t resist it\'s the least I could do for the creaters for creating such a perfect game that seriously was meant for me in every way possible! (And I NEVER spent money on ANY apps so THAT is how much I LOVE this!) This brings me endless amounts of happiness! It\'s EVERYTHING a story lover could love! 😍💓 AND THERE IS NO ISSUE AT ALL ABSOLUTELY NONE! And I am so not lying when I say NO ISSUE! 😁 100/10 game! My only wish is I\'d love for another way to earn gems.',
       'Game is fun. Dont even mind spending money in gens every now and again. But seriously to get the outcome you want, this app is charging waaaaaaay too many gems. Like 50 for one simple choice. And its goes up higher depending on the amount of gems you have. If I pay $5.99 for like 60 gems.. that should get me through and entire story. Not just one chapter. Will delete app if they dont change it. Not gonna spend $40 to finish a story.. Sorry but I think thats outrageous.',
       'This game is really fun! I wish there was a way to restart a story that you are in the middle of or that you could change your appearance or other people\'s appearence at any time. Also when you decide what your character is wearing, sometimes you can\'t see it because dialog is in the way. Also when you choose what you look like. I would prefer it to be against a white background. It\'s hard to see what the darker colors look like.',
       'It\'s such a fun game, no matter what genre you prefer. But I think the chapters are really short and the tickets take way to long to load. If there is no way to make the wait time shorter, at least give me more than 3. Other then that I think episode is a great game',
       'The stories seem great so far, the app is really nice. But the limiting of how much you can "read" is way over the top. Two short chapters and then a 4 hour wait to get another two. Or buying more chapter tickets. All the actually fun choices are also gated behind premium currency. If it was even a bit less limiting, it would be great. As it is, its fun but annoying.',
       'Really fun, the animation style is adorable but the waiting time is killer! Two short chapters, then you have to wait a ridiculously long amount of time to be able to play more unless you pay. Also the best story options are only available through micro transactions to get more gems to unlock the ability to make certain choices' ,

      'Perty good Edit: We\'re in the middle of an event and the game won\'t load. Finally says down for maintenance. It would be nice to get a heads up on when that happens. Gonna put a hindrance on the event that\'s over on Friday. Do hope it\'s resolved soon. Still like the game tho, but would like it better if I can play.',
       'Right.  First off, If you are not a fan of Idle games, then don\'t play. This is the epitome of an Idle game.   The Early game is pretty simple. Click, Collect, Make your way to Level 80. You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn\'t bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn\'t been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event\'s are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events\'  All in, pretty good.',
       'Well guess they deleted my last post cause I complained that the game took up 1.8 gig till I uninstalled it and reinstalled it then lost my saves because of bad programming.   Don\'t waste your time or money on this company.',
       'One of the best "tap" games. Love the satirical theme. Who would have thought that politics and money were SO interconnected😁. Just to be clear to some, I AM being sarcastic!!!! Great time waster. And that\'s NOT fake news.',
       'They put so many buttons to purchase things ion the main screen. When tapping as is the nature of the game, it brings up confirmation for your purchases. If you\'re trying to play fast, you could easily spend $20 in mere seconds without noticing. Put all the purchases in one place instead of cheating players.',
       'Fun game for what it is.  Some of the ads (especially for Stash) get stuck and don\'t have an "x button" when they finish playing...forcing me to close the game and restawrt without the bonus I was offered for watching the ad.  Fix that and I\'ll add another star.' ,

      'Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I\'ve never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.',
       'I\'ve been playing this app for a while now and up intil now I loved it but ever since the daily race-off challenge the game has been full of bugs. The daily race-off is a great idea but there are just too many bugs in it. I lose lives when I didn\'t even lose the race or I lose all my lives when I only lost one race.',
       'The game is my little boys favourite but the recent batch of adverts in game (Yahoo specifically) don\'t close - meaning you have to force quit the game. Lazy programming and terrible QA process from the developers. Avoid.',
       'Whoever decided to put the HW Poppa wheelie in the game is an idiot. Loved this game until i came across that car. Im seconds away from fully upgrading and moving on but i couldnt let it go. That car is a load of frustration.',
       'Yahoo ad is obnoxious!  The only way off the ad screen is to ap store, the x in the corner does nothing, closing app store without installing=back to ad.  Only way to kill ad is to close game and lose anything you had going.  That gets you a minute or so of pretty good game before you run intk the yahoo ad again...im uninstalling...too bad because the game is pretty fun.',
       'Upgrading the vehicles makes little to no improvement to their performance, which makes the game too frustrating. For example you get stuck at exactly the same place without enough grip to go up a dumb hill no much how much you upgrade your car. There\'s no skill involved.  The game forces you to keep playing the same tracks until you get a better car.' ,

Turn it down a notch.... edit to developer reply...that doesn\'t explain why more and more ads are popping up. What was wrong with it before?  Getting greedy with get you nowhere.',

       'I thought it was a really good game and very addictive. I wish that instead of you losing when you\'re connection is down the game should carry on until you join again. I\'ve lost loads of battle\'s that where going really well then lose connection and it won\'t reconnect so I get a loss. Also there are loads of ads.',
       'Ranking system is horrible,  to many game options make matching a hassle.  Defence mode is to hard to play even though its made to be like single player, very discouraging.  Then when you get into it the game it crashes.  This happens frequently, very upsetting I don\'t know how this game has a 4.4 star rating.  It also throws ads at you randomly as well as has pay to win with  the ability to buy metals.  One or the other please.  Not made for the player at all.',

      'Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it\'s so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I\'ve had to start all over again... but the fun continues!',
       'This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don\'t play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don\'t make us wait foreverrrr!',
       'It\'s a fun game and I\'m enjoying it. However, I\'ve come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.',
       'Do not upgrade your Sharks.  The bigger the shark, the more difficult it is to play.  Big sharks have more drain on health and hunger, causing you to die more frequently. Impassable areas due to size of !! shark and less fishes to eat when health gets low.  Not to mention how slow these big sharks move!  The more you spend on bigger sharks, the less fun you\'ll have.',
       'Everything is lagging. From exploring the sea to chomping down the humans and fishes. It was great before but it is getting very very lagging. For example, Swimming towards a school of fish but instead of eating them, shark just swam through them. All sharks are lagging. Glitching here and there. Please fix this!',
       'Fun time waster, can get quite a lot sunk into it, and get e erything without paying up. Glad its always been grindable. Just has had trouble connecting for saves. I lost everything a couple years ago before they had cloud saves... They\'re here now and aside from a logout/in they are wonderous afaik. Good stuff!' ,

      'I used to play this game a long time ago with my brother. I thought since after all these years so many new updates have come, the game must feel different. But it\'s the same. I love the tune that plays as you play it. It\'s so nostalgic. My brother isn\'t anymore with me but playing this game makes me really very happy. It\'s just like I am back in those old days. Specially for me, as it has so many memories, this game is the absolute best.',
       'I have a problem with my account. My punk zombird was maxed out. Level 3. Then when I opened the game, my punk zombird was gone... I obtained that by waiting patiently and gathering 90 diamonds. I had to watch 3 15-30 sec long video for 2 diamonds each. After watching the 3 vids, I had to wait another 8 hours for it to be available again. It took me a month to obtain that bird and then all of a sudden it dissapears?! I obtained it again but I had to start all over again. I uninstalled this app because of that issue.',
       'The game is really addictive. but repeated zombie birds are generated and diamonds are getting wasted. Please change that. One bird one time please. One bird should be at max 3 level not another set. It\'s wasting my internet to watch video to get diamonds for collecting birds',
       'I love this game cause it kills our time when were bored. Yep, we, my mom also is addicted to this game hahaha, shes always getting my phone and play this game whenever im sleeping. Love it, I recommend this game to everyone💖 you\'ll be definitely love this game. MobiGame you slaaaay hahaha',
       'I personally loved this game. First off,  u cant jump for high periods of time cause u to run into the bombs. Secondly, whats sup with these prices? Thats ridiculous. You cant level up with prices that high and u have to buy 💎 gems and coins just to get a level up... But tum... Very great game overall.',
       'i think it\'s really good every single detail of it is the best only yu should add different zombies that give u power -ups and special effects The next thing is what I said yu should add it into the second one yu could make. The last thing is in the 2 one yu should make it so when an amount a zombies yu get yu get special powers,boost, and cool stuff. Plz make what I just said it would me so awesome if yu did. I\'m begging do it it is my first time ever making a short statement If I misspelled anything I\'m so sorry and for how long this is☺.I  love this game do it💖' ,

       'Th is game sucks! It\'s a total waste of time and it is so boring. This is the worst game ever😡😤 Also there are so many stupid ads! The taxi is so slow and when other cars get in front of you it\'s even slower. I would not recommend this game to anyone!',
       'First if all... Its down right BORING! Also there is adds after every single level! Sometimes the adds are weird and innaproprete! I do NOT reccomend this game, download at your own risk😕',
       'I liked the game and all but there were way to many ads. Every level there was a thirty second video playing and some of them were extremely inappropriate. I got a bit impatient waiting for all the ads to end but I liked the game set-up. I think that was a neat idea. I just think it would be better without all the interruptions',
       'I thoughgbthis game was pretty good but there were too many add after every level, I completed the whole game in ten minutes there are only 16 levels! And it goes in a giant loop so it\'s pretty boring!' ,

That\'s not good. An I, who are 15 thought that this is too hard. It\'s not fun. I and my brother couldn\'t play. ease fix easier controls. An dit says 6-12 years old. Yeah... Too hard for that older.',

      'Ok.....we need an aquarium just for the holiday\'s.  I cleaned out one aquarium and that\'s all I have in there is the holidays.  After this session I\'ll probably save one just for Christmas itself.  Love the unlimited times! Keep the surprises coming!! I don\'t like so many clocks in one game and the "timed" games are insane! It is definitely challenging.  I play several times a day if possible.',
       'Great game but would love it more if it kept track of when you bought something . Like a little quantity number in the corner after you purchase a fish or decorations. Hard to save up to buy things for guests, sucks when you buy something you already have when trying to complete a task. Other then that it\'s a great game lol I enjoy playing it.',
       'Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I\'m 32 and play this often so it\'s not just for kids . Give it a try it\'s very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen 😉',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.',
       'Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can\'t do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!',
       'I Loooove Fishdom!!!😁 I\'m absolutely addicted to this wonderfully fun & challenging game. The graphics are very cute & entertaining. The only issue i have is that I\'m up in levels 180+ & there\'s just NO way to make the amount of coins to purchase ALL the decos/plants i earn. Most are priced too high.' ,

      'Sometimes it makes no sense. You are coming from quailication as 7th, you jump to 2nd position so surely you cant finish worse than 8th? WRONG. You end up on 16th place which is impossible. There is no in between you either win or you finish 14th or lower. You have 30 pts lead in front of number 2. after 1st round, you slightly fail your 2nd jump, guess what? 18th place for you! If you jump for example 120m on a K90 in Q, you finish first because everyone jumped 20m less, sudennly in 1st round you need 130m to secure your first place because everone managed to jump extra 30m. All in all fun, but still needs a lot.',

      'This game is ok. The graphics are good. It\'s my favourite bowling game out there.  However I really don\'t know why this needs access to my phone contacts and other permissions.  As a result it\'s been removed. Apps and games need to sort out their permissions for what it needs to do. If it\'s not required I\'m not installing it. Other than that complaint it\'s actually a nice game for a quick 5 minute time waster.',

      'This game used to be awesome, sadly I have just removed it due to the star issue. I used to be able to play for fun, however, due to the its current standing, one MUST achieve three stars in each level in order to play other levels. Madness! Great job for taking the fun out of a game!',
       'Angry Birds used to be a game you could just tap on and play to your heart\'s content.  Now it\'s gone fee-to-pay (sic) -- you can read the other reviews to see how well that has been received.   Not well is an understatement.  I\'d say more, but you\'ll have to gain 50 more stars to read each new paragraph.  Meanwhile, watch these unskippable half-minute-long ads.',
       'Between ads completely over running gameplay and the new requirement of having to earn stars to proceed, Rovio continues to run this once great game into the ground. **Update** game now freezes randomly requiring a force close. This is beyond ridiculous. I HATE what this franchise has become. Rovio should be ashamed.',
       'Well people are saying they hate the game update. So I don\'t see the problem with the update well I get how you hate it but that doesn\'t mean you have to hate the game its a great game and it is so popular, since 2009. And don\'t be to harsh to Rovio they were just trying to make the game more fun for their fans this is probably why they stopped updating the game i feel bad for Rovio. And before Angry birds Rovio was dead they had nothing but one day they or someone though of Angry birds so please be glad that Angry birds is even a thing and game',
       'The Feb 08,2018 update has completely changed my opinion. The update makes the game unplayable for almost everyone now. I would have thought by now  that Rovio would have rolled back this version so we could play the game again. Obviously disappointing.',
       'I am going to remove all games that I get on Google play. They do not support a Desk top computer that I got in 2012. So I will be taking Google everything off my  devices that consist of my desk top computer that is to old I guess to play any games on.  Also Angry Birds has changed so much , all I find is complaints on that game. So I know people will not delete the game or the google accounts. But I am going to with mine.  I Know I can find a better lie outside of google and the COMPUTER. THANK YOU GOOGLE>' ,

      'Graphics were generic until now for x86 devices. Thanks for that update. And that moving data to sd card, it is really appreciable since now a days even 32 gb  not sufficient. Hope other game developers get inspiration from this. And downloading just updated part is also an improvement instead of downloading whole data again. 4 stars because this game just wont allow to play older version once it finds out new version is present.',
       'Best driving and racing game on the net. There is so much you can do, it not just " drive a car on a track and try to win", in this game you can choose your path on the track, perform unbelievable stunts and trick\'s, take out other players and cars.  The game play is absolutely great and the graphics are f***#&@ awesome, the only step to fallow in the graphics is realistic and their close to that now, love the game, the only thing I would change is I would make it easier to get car\'s, now the bikes and car packs instead of having to work really hard to get them or spend a lot of real money, granted the real money goes to development of the graphics and game, I would like to be able to get the car and bike packs a little bit easier. Definitely a winner, 🤩',
       'Asphalt 8 airborne is a very exciting game to play. The addition of bikes is mind blowing. Wish all time limited events could be on mobile data rather than wifi. Thumbs up gameloft for an exciting game. After the recent update of this app it keeps crashing with a pop-up message "unfortunately asphalt 8 has stopped working". Please fix this issue.',
       'As racing games go, this is probably the best. The graphics, sound, gameplay are excellent. Race solo, against friends or the world. The variety of ways to race is big. The selection of cars and now bikes, keeps getting bigger. The only down side is buying something from the shop or on offer. I purchased a special offer and never got it. They got my money, I never got the goods. Trying to get in contact with them is a joke. All replies to my emails were automated responses telling me to do the same thing over and over again.',
       'Was once the best racing games I\'ve played until this dang update. It won\'t even check the required files and crashes in the middle of verifying the required files. Not giving 5 stars until I get this fixed out. Playing on Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge',
       'What the heck! My carrier is in the season 5 but, needs to download all of tracks in the game! I much like the first version of this game this is stupid... And when you drift there\'s no smoke come out in the tires! When you knockdown yourself there\'s no effect in your car. Please fix.' ,

      'This is the best game in the world. srsly if this was the only game on my ipad then i will be happy. As soon as you get onto the game you just cant put it down. The only down side is that the spins cost alot of coins and those coins can be hard to earn. So 4.5 stars i would rate it is that was a option but its not so i rate it a a big fat 5',
       'I love this game a lot. The only problem is that when you do the Dailey spin, you only get like coins. And then with the coins you can buy another spin which is what I do. And I get even more coins. It\'s really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and',

GOOD LUCK, good  night, new york city. at late night talk show with stephen colebert......jk',
       'Would rate give starts, but the amount of ads is absolutely ridiculous. I\'m actually thinking about uninstalling please fix that. I know you want players to pay but in all actuality, it\'s quite stupid. Anyway, I do believe the game is quite fun',
       'Whatever they did last update broke the game for me, this is why I never buy anything in these games. No way to contact anyone to resolve any problems.  Game gets boring anyway',
       'It\'s a really good game and works really well. The only thing I don\'t like is how the cost of the daily spin goes up every time. It is quite annoying. Other than that I really enjoy playing this game. Great job guys😀' ,

      'I kind of miss the old version because isn\'t that why they came out with a 2nd game so if we eant more we got it.  Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.',
       'This game is really good and fun but strate after you lose all 3 of your lives it goes straight onto an add. There are loads of adds and I don\'t think it needs that much adds for a game like dumb ways to die, on the other hand it\'s a grate game and it\'s a laugh and a joke, I think it\'s a really good game☺',
       'I think that there could be less ads. When I\'m trying to replay he game an ad pops up which is really annoying. What I would say is that this is an excellent game but just less of the ads',
       'A truly wonderful and entertaining game. Very well supported with great updates over the years. Latest version (Valentine\'s) appears to be buggy (animations jerk ahead) ruining the gameplay. I\'m unsure it this is the game or my phone.',
       'Love it although can get annoying This game is really fun and I remember the oldest version and now it has more dumb ways to die which is amazing! Although some of the mini games are annoying no matter what I do I still die from them. Other than that, it\'s an amazing interactive game :)',
       'OMG BEST GAME EVERRR IT HAS SO MANY NEW GAMES IN IT & A SPECIAL VALENTINE\'S ADDITION! U CAN EVEN CREATE YOUR OWN DUMB WAY TO DIE CHARACTER!!!! PLEASE DOWNLOAD DONT MISS OUT! And about the ads there are a lot of them but if u turn of wifi and data then u won\'t have a problem with the ads cause they don\'t show up!              Please pledge to be safe aroun trains' ,

      'I\'m really fond of this game and love the gameplay and quick paced matches. The new update is AMAZING!   There are a few things that would make this game extra perfect for me!   Must have character customisation. This would be of big amazing to me. Char customisation makes me bind more to certain characters. The rings we get don\'t have much value to them except for upgrading the characters.  Could have non-ranked matches. I would love the option to play/practice against rivals or my own friends.   Should have quick chat responses. Would like to communicate before and after the match with simple reactions. Like Good luck and I win, tee-hee!',
       'Thanks for the new update SEGA. It fixed the "I\'m lagging" condition even though I have fast internet connection and what\'s more you also enchance the Point of view on which lane I would go,Lastly please make Infinite a playable character. Keep up the good work :D',
       'Fun fun fun! My 5 year old child is a sonic fan and recently I found this game app for him to play before his afternoon nap to calm him down. He loves it.  Pros:  -unlimited racing chances (do no require stamina or energy that limits you to race) -fair chance of getting new characters from chests without needing to spend money -simple controls and gameplay -variety of race course unlocked depending on how many "trophies" you gain -you get chests whether you place 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th so your time is not wasted -has a decent amount of sonic characters that can be unlocked or upgraded  Cons: -Time chests that you gain from racing (silver, gold, etc.) Are limited to count down only ONE at a time. Lowest time for a countdown is 3 hours, so when you have four 3 hour chests to open, you can only open them 1 at a time. This is the biggest drag since you are limited to four time-limit chests at a time. If they are full, you cannot gain more from your wins until you clear a space.  Other then the one con I have, my son is satisfied with everything else.',
       'Guys please fix the bug which closes the app automatically without any crash message. It simply exits out and takes you to your home screen. I really love this game and would have given a 5 * rating if not for the crash.   Update 23 Feb: The game still crashes, for e.g, the battle was about to start, and the audio started as a matter of fact but the screen simply didn\'t change, it froze, a few seconds later, the game restarts, and now when I try to start a new battle, it says that the previous session is still running. So guys please look into it and make this an already superb game better. My system is a Motorola G5 plus, running Android 7.0 Thanks.',
       'This new update fixed a lot of bugs.  Haven\'t had any problems since.  Keep it up.',

I can\'t hold down on the object and move it. It just seems to think im tapping on the building. Not good it all for a game lock up and stop working before step 2.',

       'Really fun game. My 2 year old adores Hank. The only thing that I feel is missing is a way to save your progress to the cloud. My phone needed to be reset a couple times and we had to start over. Didn\'t mind so much because hank as a puppy is much cuter.',
       'I like this new update. Hanks now have His own happy meter like Tom and Angela. Nice. Also this is just my suggestion. Can you guys also make My Talking Ben and My Talking Ginger. Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that\'s it. You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It\'s not fair. Lastly good job guys.',
       'I like my talking tom and I download this one thinking that it will have some fun stuff like play mini games I know this one have a picture feature but man only eat, pet, sleep , and pics? Sorry I am re-downloading my talking Tom and start from scratch that only take pics feed and sleep on this game',
       'My three year old grand daughter got around my password and charged $40 of in app purchases and did a monthly subscription, too. I have gone through everything to try to remedy this, with no help from the customer service from the this apps developer.',
       'I love playing this game it\'s addictive but it\'s been acting up here lately it\'ll knock me off nd it\'s been making my phone get really hot and there even times that I\'ll be in the middle of playing it and it closes out on me! Please fix or I\'m going to have to uninstall it :(' ,

      'YOU GUYS ACTUALLY LISTENED!!! Im so happy right now because when I saw theres a new update, I immediately downloaded it to see if I can play it without crashing. I can actually play it now with my friends! A little bit of framrate drop but still... I can play this wonderful game. Im going to totally recommend this game to my friends. The devs of this game are the best devs in the Google Play Store. Again, Im truely greatful and I thank you guys. :D',
       'I dont know why you chosen Retro style graphic and i hope for a change. There is a lot of IRANIAN players but PING is over 250ms and too much delay. Add iran flag. Google play sign-in is not working. Add more skins. Events are just bunch of objectives and prizes, add more artworks and stuff for events. Other things are good for now. Thanks for the revolutionary IO game. Congratulation on 10million downloads 💝',
       'Since the game is under process - it has a lot of room to improve. The studio is generous for the rewards and daily logins. They listen to the community and it takes time to fix those bumps. Love the game and the art also - unique and tasty! A competetive game that gives you urge to hustle more. Impressive game!   Been a butthurt person before - my apologies! Hope for the best!',
       'simple, fun, addictive gameplay, good graphic with unique animations, great events that keep players active which is good, have great potential. dark adventure loading still takes too long, i already dead when the loading is finished. crashing and some bugs in event tab. talking about awaken system, man atleast dont downgrade the stars or reduce the percentage of downgrade, finding awaken item is already damn hard. this great game need new character and more feature but not p2w. keep the good work barbarq !!',
       'It is the best game I\'ve ever played! With simple graphics and gameplays, you won\'t notice how long you\'ve played! Generous with presents daily and very recommended to spend time. However with the new update, I can\'t connect and it stayed on connecting. Tried to change internet source, but to no avail it\'s still there.  I would like to ask the developers, to reply as soon  as possible, on what should I do to get rid of this problem.',
       'Hello! I\'ve seen this game many times from the ads and I tried installing it and later found that this game was really intertaining and fun. Anyways, I am having problems with the game\'s connectivity to the internet. I am using 4G in playing the game and it seems that it does not connect very well, other online games connect well to the internet. I think that is the only issue I have in mind. Just hoping for more smoothness though.. But I love the game, it is worth the time playing. Thank you!!' ,

      'This is a really good game. got a great high score and it\'s good when you don\'t know what to do. But once you have been playing it for bit you get board or at least I do.and to the creators of this game to make it less boring you could put levels or different modes in it or add more  shapes. Please reply or just update. Thank you.',
       'Your English is so bad it is insulting.    You need to hire someone to proof read before you post requests for ratings.  A definite turn off to the game which is actually quite fun and challenging.    Requires strategic planning.',
       'The app is fun but it needs a no ads option for purchase. Also if the game is muted the ads should be auto muted as well. Currently the play at full volume whether the game is muted or not. It\'s very frustrating.',
       'My four year old likes it and I feel like it helps him on making decisions. I can actually see him thinking what going to be him next move. I like this game and I love playing with my son. Only thing I hate is that it does have to many ads 😒',
       'I like the game itself, but way too many adds and they pop up in the middle of the game and then your piece you are placing goes wonky.  Do away with the adds in the middle. Whoever thought that was a good idea in a puzzle game was completely misplaced.',
       'Great game to pass time. Adverts are frustrating but necessary unless you want to pay to stop, BUT very annoying when they pop up as you just lifted a puzzle piece and because of advert it just drops randomly. Also being able to rotate pieces would be handy, granted not as challenging however.' ,

      'I used to love this game, very addictive but recent updates have made the game have too many elements (clubs - who cares???) Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels "fixed" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.',
       'This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.',
       'Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the "boards" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it\'s addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It\'s becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.',
       'I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn\'t really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don\'t know how many more points you need.',
       'Game is good when the app opens, which is not often. Don\'t bother messaging support with any issues. They are useless and just just repeat the same solutions to problems you aren\'t even experiencing. Serious dissapointment. Be prepared to loose lots of coins!',
       'Way too many glitches and loss of coins/rewards. Money hungry gsn. Trying to get money from people in every which way possible. Ads are rediculous. Quit making changes to the game! Worse with every update! Will change my rating when they start rewarding better for your time put into game. Money hungry. Money hungry, money hungry.' ,

      'Buyer beware, I purchased the "unlock all manicures" option less than a year ago, not only to unlock options but also to remove Ads for my kids. It\'s less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed.',
       'A really nice game which also got me hooked up! Nevertheles, it frequently and automatically shuts down, deleting what was there.....this really broke my litlle sister\'s heart, even mine. For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....',
       'I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn\'t get me board everytime i have different desins to do.',
       'Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!',
       'I  am finally at the final last level! Before I thought it was boring but after I reached some levels farther I thought it was awesome! And it is the best game ever! YEAH!!!!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💙💙💚💚💛💛💜💜💗💗❤❤ AND when I was playing my 1st game all things were opened but when I played in my small sister\'s tab all, things were closed! I got everything for free!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA',

      'It would be a real good app if they didn\'t have so many ads popping up. Budge needs to reevaluate this because it\'s not making my kid want more games...its making her hate this game. It\'s not an effective strategy...and no parent would download another budge game after seeing one ad a minute.',
       'It\'s a good game but I\'m telling you. There are way too many ads. 30 second ads without a skip ad button seriously I spend 80% trying to exit the ad then I do playing the game. I see that everyone else is complaining about the same thing. So Delete the ads Please. And please make all of the Ponies free. Some of the levels required a different pony but you have to buy them. Drag and drop is broken. Please fix it.',
       'My kid loved this game. She got really into it and was loving every moment, but then a part of the game wouldnt let her do anything. It was a boss scene on a pinkie pie level and a drop and drag boss on a rarity level. The game simply wont do anything and hence she cant get any farther. This is frustrating as i paid for all the stuff for it as she enjoyed it so much and its beginning to feel like i paid for my kid to be sad. Please fix!',
       '"drag and drop the broken bits into the right place" game locks up and little 4 year old girl cries. Now I know why these games get hacked by little sisters older brother. People get pissed. Enjoy your money budge!',
       'Let\'s talk about ads. I downloaded this for my kid. She would love it except for the fact that EVERY 30 SECONDS THERE IS AN AD! I realize that\'s how money is made, but that\'s ridiculous. One at the end of each level would be fine, but this 4-5 inside the level is overkill. And they play upside down. She spends more time trying to exit the ad than playing the game.',
       'AMAZING Now don\'t blame me for loving this, I know there is not many levels, too many ads, but this is very active for kids. It can make thier reflex better! Can season 2 just come out already?' ,

      'I love this game!! "it helps a lot" with my shopping addiction because I feel like I\'m buying real merchandise. I really enjoy the updates and how you guys added more room to be designed!!!! Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))',
       'I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.',
       'The game is fun, but results take 2 and 3 days and if other people are on higher levels they have access to better tableware and vases, pictures etc, so their rooms stand out more and they have a better chance at getting 5 stars. And some items I\'ve purchased don\'t work it gives a message saying they couldn\'t find it in the warehouse. But the game never gave me my gems back and of money. NEED TO FIX IT',
       'O.k. the game has been fun. Love decorating. My gripe is why can\'t I keep the furniture that I have purchased with my own money? And why do I have to repurchase items that I have already bought? And why am I limited on purchasing if I spend my own money.  You guys say that you don\'t enhance the voting process but I tend to differ. Many times rooms that have scored A 5 are all in the same color tones and almost look the same. It has been fun but unless you give me more options to purchase I\'m? out.',
       'Entertaining, enjoyable and inspiring! Brings out  your creativity in utilizing your available resources and in maximizing your limited funds. The game makes you travel around the globe.  Hope to seeing homes from less popular countries. Sad to note that there are times that free diamonds don\'t add up after watching the videos and there are items not found in the warehouse.',
       'I really love this game! It surely brings out my passion in interior designing, nourish my mind as i see others works, getting inspired also to continue want i really love in life, which is designing/art. And it does help me to chill or relax whenever im depressed bcoz it makes me think what to design, and helps me get out of the stress that life brings. It indeed help me with my mental and emotional instability. 5 stars for this! Number 1 app for me. Never failed my expectations. LOVE IT!' ,

      'tbh it\'s a really good app! The only problem is that it gets a little boaring after a while (obviously that\'s my opinion) And I don\'t know if it\'s just me but there or tons of over 30 second ads.',
       'I like this game  very much cause you dont know what comes in front of you which makes this game more interesting. But 1 problem is there that the second i crash to any obstacle an add popups',
       'This game is the WORST!!! The controls don\'t work and there is not even demonstration on how to play. Also every time I retried to do it a stupid add came up. I AM FURIUS!!!! Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don\'t get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don\'t mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!',
       'This game is AWFUL!! There is no tutorial and every time I fail an unimportant ad comes up. What is wrong with you making games like this? Close this game down it is terrible. Just learn. Who would want to play a game like this you stupid idiot',
       'It\'s honestly a fun game, and I\'d love to use it as a stimulating activity (ah, who am I kidding, it\'s just a great time killer), but it makes my head hurt-- and that\'s a problem. I\'m not even the type of person that is negatively affected by fast-paced graphics or rapidly changing colors. It\'d be five stars if it didn\'t give me headaches, but, for now, it gets three; good graphics, smooth gameplay, but no matter how great the app, it isn\'t worth physical discomfort. (Note: if you are looking for something similar, try "Run". It has the same sort of concept, but without the advertisements and headaches.)',
       'Ugh look people if u start playing this game oh wait if u had any sense u wouldn\'t. these adds are outrageous every time I die there an add I\'m not even kidding. My dad rates tones of games and I\'m the one playing some of them and I told my dad that these adds are so horrible I even had to report it. Now here me out great game but the adds. And in the beginning there is no instructions on how to do the game so like I said in the beginning there is a add at the end of every round so in the beginning there are many adds. Now i think there are more adds then game in this game. I\'m not trying to be mean so don\'t go crying😢 to ur boss.' ,

      'A great game, but WAAAAY  too many ads. Its the same thing after each level: AN AD. The game is fun, but its hard to enjoy when you\'re watching ads every second. And Im getting the same ads over and over! I want to rate five stars, I really do, but I cant if there\'s going to be this many ads in a game I think everyone would enjoy. 💛💛💛💛♡ (( pretend the hearts are stars )) I\'ll download the game again once I see less ads in your games, like My Talking Angela, which also has way too many ads. Please take this into consideration! Thank you!',
       'The game was great until they put the ads on there, there are too many and 90% of the time I try to "x" out of one, it takes me to the play store anyway, and the game freezes a lot more now. It\'s also frustrating you can\'t alter the decorations. Game needs some improvements, and I hope they address them because it\'s quite fun to play.',
       'I am so disappointed in this game due to the fact my 3 year old somehow bypassed my password and spent 79.99 on coins!!! I sent a message immediately to Google play and the developer and I was told it doesn\'t meet the refund requirements. WTH?!! So frustrating! 😡',
       'This game would be a whole lot of fun IF there weren\'t so many ads! My niece is not patient enough to wait for stupid ads to finish, and u can\'t play the game until the ad is finished! Very disappointed!',
       'Love this game. Super fun but how do you get rid of ads? I paid for coins yet i still have ads. This is highly annoying especially if i can\'t skip them. Still love the game just not the ads :(',
       'I hate this game cause one, you can\'t even change the decorations or visitors. Two, you can\'t even get coins for completing a level and the daily wheel is rigged cause you can\'t get anything good. Three, if you watch a video for a reward or life, it never gives you anything. And four, they don\'t give you enough moves for each level, there are too many ads and everything\'s so overpriced. Hate this bullcrap game😡' ,

      'It is inexcusable to allow ads to make such noise when both my phone is in silent mode AND I have the sound off in the game settings! I went over other reviews and the developers wanted to know which ads. Seriously?! How about all of them?! They have to be aware yet refuse to fix the problem. Do not download this intrusive app. Also I get a migraine with the annoying "Ready? Let\'s go!" voice when the sound is on.',
       'Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.',
       'Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you\'re given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.',
       'Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.',
       'Annoying ads with sound even i off d sound , if u need a life they forced u to see the ads first there is no option to buy energy power by u\'r point still u want then they are selling in $ ... and lots more... Bad experience i m going to uninstall the app.',

      'There was a time when you can still feel the dev team\'s gratitude for you choosing their game. But now, its just one paywall after another. Whatever they used to give for free in the past years, they\'ve found a way to turn into cashcrop. I\'ve never been closer to deleting this game than when the latest update came out. If you\'re not a VIP, uninstall it now. They\'ve made a fool out of us.',
       'I love this game. I truly do. That\'s why this hurts. With the Adam Warlock update, I knew I had to be ready to save up crystals, though I did intend to spend a few for new uniforms, but hiding the one for the update\'s protagonist behind 5.5k crystals is a new low, and you haven\'t even soothed the slap on our faces from the Ultimates\' update. I was prepared to buy a new subscription for crystals or bios, but not anymore.  Netmarble, I thought you better than this. You had a good, committed following, yet you abuse us like this.',
       'An amazingly, beautiful made Game, which is a true gem for Marvel fans. Hats off to you guys. I didn\'t thought that android platform will be that big in gaming areas. I am a Hardcore gamer and i know what gaming should look like...and that\'s what it looks like - Future Fight. I hope you guys will improve the game from time-to-time so that we can\'t get bored of it.',
       'Updates? Updating means improving something, you\'re just digging a bigger hole NM.. I used to spend £10 a month on this, now it\'s not even enough to unlock the new characters... Many of my free to play friends stopped playing, and I\'m 1 update of following them.. Just can\'t be bothered with the grind, and the other option is pumping money into it. That\'s not gonna happen anymore.',
       'Do not even download this game. It is an absolute scam. At one point it was a good game but you will quickly find all the good characters are locked behind thousands of dollars of paywall. Much of the game is based on RNG and so a lot of the resources you can actually grind for go up in smoke. If you don\'t already have this, stay away.',
       'Look I downloaded this game not too long after installation I expect to play the game then I was notified that I can\'t play offline no problem with that but my problem was downloading the update info which also cost 522.36 mb. All this should not b necessary I think it should be like this when downloading the game there should be an additional file which should be the update info.I feel it will be easy for those who are downloading this game (like me) to start the game instead of downloading "update info" before starting the game. And I hope make u of this advice because it will be beneficial for those who are downloading the game and for you.' ,

      'Lemme just say ketchapp your games are soooo good!! And addictive including this one it\'s fun and ever since the first play I\'ve been hooked there are barely any adds and the graphics are phenomenal. I play it all the time plz don\'t change this, if u do your going to loose my five stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟.',
       'Most of my apps are from Ketchapp. Their creativity and style of games have just been wanting me to download more and more! Right now, Ketchapp is one of my most favourite game groups ever! Keep making more! I don\'t have any improvements, which means that their games are top notch!',
       'Patheitc. Being such a fast paced game you cannot have the blocks starting to move a split second before you\'re going to pass it. Makes the game pretty impossible from the first level. For something that was supposed to be fun, is more frustrating. You need severe luck on your side to get a win. Recommended do not download',
       'Its a good concept, but you need to update it, and make sure the blocks no longer move. Right now, it is by far the most luck based skill game. It is impossible to dodge the moving blocks, so if they are to move, they should move much slower',
       'Good, but difficulty is a bit tough. Unless I was a Jedi, it feels like I\'m starting on what should be a hard level. The AI is way too slow as well. I wish you could could change the color of your ball and race online with others in real time.',
       'I think it is a great way for amiee to get design for her Xbox 360 and help her get over with her anger with her sister and to help her to figure out what\'s the matter but what is the most important thing is to be a fantastic family together but why are we so lonely.... Well i think it is a great opportunity to make new friends to life' ,

Play as Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, or Fred, and help Scooby-Doo find the missing pieces of the LEGO key, recover the lost treasures, unmask the villains, and solve the many mysteries of Haunted Isle.Who is your favourite character?Shaggy might be the hungriest, goofiest, most-fearful member of the group, but the bond he shares with Scooby-Doo sees him through thick and thin. He might run at the first sign of danger, but when it comes to helping his friends, he’s always ready to step in! Fred is the glue that keeps Mystery Inc. together, and his mind is always two or three steps ahead of the monster they’re after. He sees mysteries as a chess match, and nothing makes him happier than planning genius and elaborate traps to catch ghosts, vampires, bogeymen and more!Brave, beautiful and brainy, Daphne is the most enthusiastic member of Mystery Inc. She never leaves home without her camera and her notebook because someday she wants to be either a famous mystery writer or an investigative journalist. Velma is the resident smart kid of Mystery Inc. Her hyper-analytical mind deciphers clues almost as fast as she can say “Jinkies!” Although the group tries to stick together, Velma often ends up wandering off by herself, searching for the next clue. A Great Dane with an even greater appetite, Scooby-Doo reluctantly chases ghosts and ghouls with the rest of Mystery Inc. Although Scooby-Doo is always up for an adventure, he prefers activities that end with an all-you-can-eat buffet. When his friends need him, Scooby-Doo will run to the rescue! His best friend in the whole world is Shaggy, and you can usually find the two of them running away from a monster or snacking on double-decker sandwiches in the back of the Mystery Machine.For app support contact LEGO Consumer Service.

      'Maybe the reason people think its boring. It\'s probably because they are boring and lame. I beat the first level without a problem, they didn\'t because they feel like everything should be easy and they shouldn\'t have to work hard for anything. The game is challenging and fun if you like a challenge. If your a lame, whinny, expect nothing to be hard, and can\'t handle a challenge as tough as making toast, then this game isn\'t for you.',
       'These other reviewers are jerks! Lol. The game is awesome! And my 4 year old can even play it well!  I like it so much, I\'m downloading it onto my phone (4 yr old plays it on my old phone)  just to see how far I can get lol',
       'I would get to the title page and that was it. It won\'t let me go further. I have turned my phone off and back on and I have uninstalled it twice and installed it 3 times. Please fix.',
       'The game controls are very annoying. The character won\'t go where you want him to. During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don\'t want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn\'t want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.',
       'It\'s an disaster game. It doesn\'t even open on my phone...it just stuck all the time.',
       'So, this game is very exciting, but i have problems with defeating the monsters, and after this "update" nothing changed, so next time make new levels! I MEAN, COME ON !! Other than that, game is great.' ,

      'I like it a lot but I hate how the drawings are so linked with pokemon go. I hate pokemon go!!!!! The graphics are okay but I wish they were a bit better quality. It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn\'t like how easy the drawings were and I don\'t think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn\'t recommend this game if you don\'t like colouring. It\'s ok!!!!',
       'I love this app! It\'s sooo good. And its brilliant for when your bored. But its a little hard sometimes to go over the lines with our fingers as the lines are so thin. But overall I think it\'s a fantastic app!',
       'I love this game but i don\'t like the characters tho .but it\'s fine . I like the way you can colour it in and then do the glow pen around it and at the end it looks amazing . You just colour and then press the pencil button ontop of the rubber in the pictures right bottom corner and then do the glow pen thing . Some people may don\'t know so that\'s why they don\'t like it . It\'s good when your travelling or when your bored . O THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!I like it',
       'I think there should be more cartoons to draw and color. And it should not always be right colors to trace it in. Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn\'t color the whole background, because what if you didn\'t want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!',
       'It\'s a great app however it keeps crashing and I have to start the drawing all over again. The whole app stops and my drawing starts over and it\'s really annoying. If this gets fixed I will definitely rate 5 stars',
       'Well the animals are cute and the drawings are cute, but I thought you could use the rainbow color like in the picture,but you can\'t😢you should still get this app and definitely of you like drawing. It\'s still fun though!😆' ,

       'Found a game called "Infinite Balls" on my friend\'s iPhone, we loved it. This is the best Android alternative we could find, but it\'s not quite as satisfying. Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls. Would be nice to turn off the help lines, too.',
       'Super fun and addicting, the beginning levels are pretty easy but they get to be rather challenging after a while!  The only thing I don\'t like is the frequency of the ads.  Game itself is great though.',

      'Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can\'t without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.',
       'First up the images used as what the game looks like are fakes. I saw too many polygons.... (Shudder) Secondly there is no start menu. NOPE! Just some fancy loading screen and boom you\'re in the game without a chance to look at the controls. Plus your first mission is ruined by the tutorial at the worst places on the track.   Bad game knockoff. If you download this just delete it. This game is EXPLICATIVE',
       'Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?',
       'I don\'t know what the game is even like. I couldn\'t even get past the loading part because it won\'t let me tap on the screen.  I find this very irritating because I like trying out new car games. But please promise me you won\'t play this game any further as its a waste of your time.',
       'So many ad\'s, there back to back ad\'s. When I am finally able to select a race, guess what...another ad pops up and takes me to the play store to download it. I go back to the game and I gotta start all over again from the first screen. Ad\'s ad\'s ad\'s I was only able to play on the first day I downloaded it, after that..... Ad\'s ad\'s ad\'s                    "AD\'S!!!".... But i did like the game when I played it',
       'Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that\'s excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.' ,

      'I know a lot of people seem to not like this game but I actually really enjoy it the only thing I don\'t like is the lack of sound.   It would be nice if there was background music of some kind and a glass breaking sound effect when you went through each barrier something pleasing to the ears  Oh and shorter ads would also probably be good.  It could also use more roads and balls and barriers to work towards. I feel like this game has a lot of potential though hope it keeps being updated.',
       'This is a very addictive game. I don\'t understand why people don\'t like it. Fast paced. As for the adds, you people should turn your internet off and play. It will help.. ##VOODOO## Would you accept a video from me? You can use it for advertising purposes. I thought it might be of great help for you.  Please get back to me by replying. I would be happy to email the video to you..',
       'The game is fine. But OMG the ads....they make you watch an ad every few seconds until you pay for the premium version. This is just sick. I mean games do have ads but the number of ads in this game are unbearable. Very frustrating . So if you are looking for a free game THIS IS NOT IT.',
       'Hey Developer! This is Great Job!. But, if there are other players who have the disease "Afraid of Heights", this game will not be suitable for him. You make players Cringe (Afraid), because there is no music. This game like a Dark Theme Games.',
       'Maybe you could add coins, for example each gate you go through could +1 Coin and you need like 290 Coins to upgrade your airtime by a few seconds or milliseconds, although the sound is not very good due to no sound at all. Very good game although!',
       'Well it\'s an ok game however I find it fascinating how people can design a game like this and think it\'s so good that they can pack it with adds. Make a better game and then you can pack it with adds. This game shows a lack of dedication to the product. All I see is another game where you tried to dig as much money out of it as possible from adds and then forgot about it.' ,

      'After a week of play , I am getting to attack smaller cities , KILL KILL,  grate time filler,  some sexier clothing options for the (ladies) would be nice,  lots to do and manage, clans mates are important, so chose wisely. I am enjoying this immensely.  Edit after (time seems like forever,)  I am really enjoying this,  Negotiated a couple of Peace Treaties, built my crew and strength, I am getting to be a force to reckon with... But there are still bigger fish, frustrating  Would love a feature to hunt the attacker, but then that would backfire too,   Great game...lots of challenges and opportunities for growth,  Highly recommended   *****',
       'So many players have reported on one player that keep spamming the city.  Just because he cant take it when his city got burned .  Check ur report n banned him from playing. Or many others player will start quitting.',
       'It\'s your standard "GOW" clone with a Godfather ripoff motif.  You know the formula: spend money, build fast, get stomped by the kiddies with access to daddy\'s credit card who spend thousands of $$$.    Guaranteed to trigger the easily offended due to scantily clad women.  Hilariously bad "Engrish" text throughout the game.    Just get your currency for whatever other game it is you play as fast as possible and move on.',
       'I think this could possibly be the worst game for GM support ever. If you need help after paying, Don\'t worry someone with broken English will appear, answer a different question then leave. Mind blowingly stupid.',
       'Nice game. I just thought that the Babe game part should be a bit more easier and less difficult coz its hard to score the chicks when your way up to level 11 and getting to the yatch. But the rest of the gameplay is fun and challenging. Overall... its a Good Fun Game. Awesome.',
       'Newbie dont play this game. It\'s was fun at first then you follow the instructions as normal. But at the end of the day you will get stuck and you will run out of supplies.. Their idea is to make you buy.' ,

      'This is a great game and is challenging it definitely requires some focus and concentration. There is a bug that needs to be fixed it is on the gold game mode and it\'s the game that asks you to select which colours are more prominent out of all the squares but the coloured squares don\'t appear. Please fix this as soon as possible because I really enjoy this game.',

       'I really lived thus game because it isn\'t just tapping something but it\'s actually training your brand and improving your attention, memory, logic and your mind in general. If you need help in any of those subjects (or you just like a bit of fun ) I would dwfinately say this is the game for you.',
       'Simple but fun. These games are challenging and do make you use your brain without taking much time. You can play a few levels in just a few minutes easily. Ads are not too bad either, not too obtrusive and are sporadic enough.',
       'the memory mahjong doesn\'t work for me. even after I updated the app, the mahjong pieces do not flip when I\'m supposed to memorize them, they just disappear. and I don\'t want to reinstall the game, bc I don\'t want to lose my progress. I wish you could somehow fix it. thanks',
       'Fast game play,  you can train for a few minutes, or as hour, depending on what you have time for.  Auto saves your progress. Ads are not intrusive,  and can be skipped easily. The games do get a bit repetitive.' ,

      'I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance',
       'A Great Game For When You\'re Dumpin\'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin\' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I\'m in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren\'t too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I\'m happy to say that. I don\'t like to stay too long. Great game!',
       'So,  basically it\'s a pretty fun app to play when you\'re bored. It\'s a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It\'s a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don\'t really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!',
       'Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn\'t have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic.',
       'Good, with a major flaw I\'ve ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I\'ll tap, and the game won\'t register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I\'m on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I\'ve closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It\'s an issue I\'d like to see fixed.',
       'Some faults Overall a simple yet addictive game. Too many ads. The game ends and instantly an ad appears and your still hitting the screen so you automatically click an ad. I\'m sure advertisers don\'t want to pay for a click that was purely a mistake. Also the leader board has people on 5000 points. I can\'t get past 78 after a lot of playing so I can\'t see 5000 points is scored without a hack.' ,

Think you can shave a man with a cut-throat razor? Can you shape his beard just the way he wants it? Can you turn the mess of facial hair he calls a beard into something truly unique and amazing? Barber Shop Pro 3D will push you to your limit!<br><br>Your customers don&apos;t just want their beards shaved off, they&apos;ll want you to give them that perfect moustache - the one that makes them look and feel like a real man - and they&apos;ll want it done the only way a professional barber should, with a sharp blade and a steady hand!<br><br>You&apos;ll be scored on your accuracy and your time - shave too much off and you&apos;ll lose points. Take too long and you&apos;ll lose points. And if your customer isn&apos;t completely happy with the job, he&apos;ll make sure you don&apos;t get paid the full price! The pressure is on!<br><br>Get that blade under the nose and make sure you follow the contours of your customer&apos;s face, there&apos;s nothing worse than a nick of a razor on soft skin! You&apos;ve got a guide image and you&apos;ve got a selection of razors, and that&apos;s all you need save for your skill. How are you at Pencil moustaches? can you shape a Horse Shoe? How about the super tricky Handlebar? They&apos;re even trickier to resist pulling on! The Toothbrush, the Walrus, the Pyramid - there&apos;s so many moustache styles out there and you&apos;re going to have to master them all if you&apos;re going to make it to the top of your game!<br><br>As you progress through the levels, the job gets harder, the time gets shorter and the beard styles get trickier! But to make it easier, you can spend your hard-earned dough on better razors that will do the job in half the time - in the right hands.<br><br>So get ready to open your doors and welcome your customers in - right here at Barber Shop Simulator 3D where the razors are sharp and the styles are sharper!',

      'A very fun and addictive game. I make bows all day, but it\'s nice to be able to shoot from my couch at night.  The influence of wind on the arrow is accurate when it comes to drift. A little costly on the upgrades for those that don\'t buy their way to the top, but all games are that way.',
       'Ok game, but bingo mode is a huge pain.  My shots filled out the opponent\'s card better than mine.  Stupid way to lose a lot of progress/coins.',
       'Game was fine. Lately, keeps freezing and somehow opponents are getting 10\'s when I CLEARLY see them hitting nowhere near the middle. Matches are freezing while i\'m ahead, then match ends and says I lost. Somehow i\'ve lost 20 million coins, and not from legit losing either. I also just played a match for 1 million coins, i had over 1 million in the bank. I know sonehow have 0 after I clearly won the match but it said I lost. Either people are using cheats or the game is not functioning properly',
       'It\'s really pathetic that apps like this only allow Facebook login... At least provide Google login too.... Not everyone uses Facebook.... Google should make it mandatory on Google play store apps to provide Google login....',
       'It feels like I\'m playing a cpu, because the first cup is easy and my opponents only score very low points. I mean, I score 8-10 and my opposition have a hard time hitting the mark at all! (I\'ve repeatedly played it a handful of times.)',
       'Good  game when it works. Seems to run out your  time  and  freeze  up  when  you start  winning  to  much' ,

      'Really liked this when I first started playing. Honestly,there is no point me keeping it now. Can\'t perform my operations,as don\'t have bought staff and ward not on the appropriate level. I can\'t get any new staff,as I don\'t have enough hearts,and once you are at a standstill like this it take FOREVER to earn hearts back. Have loads of cash but nothing to do with it!! Game seems to be designed around getting people hooked initially (as performing operations etc is really fun), but then can\'t continue or progress without purchasing hearts!! Not wasting my time with it any longer.',
       'I\'m VERY unhappy!! I downloaded the update and the game informed me there was a problem with the download. I then uninstalled and reinstalled the game and ALL my progress was lost. Its back to the beginning. Worst part is I just spent 10 bucks on content...money down the drain. Lesson learned. It\'s a very good game but DON\'T spend money on purchases.',
       'Your new update will not let me, or several people it looks like,  get into the game. I am currently doing the 12 day event and am on level 17 please fix it ASAP! I refuse to lose all my progress. This is the best game I\'ve had on my phone in a very long time.',
       'I downloaded the game, it\'s a great game except for today when I did an update and now won\'t let me get back into the game. Also, really difficult to level up after level 7. Everything is really expensive. Not so much fun when you have to wait along time for money to accumulate. Might delete the game.',
       'Enjoyed it for the first two days, but it just feels boring now, the game is very very slow, and there is nothing new in it, similar type of surgery every time, and in most of the cases only we have to stitch the wound. Also the upgrade time for everything is too high, have to wait for nothing.  Read some reviews before in which the developer had asked to wait till the next update, i did so, and today i updated the game, and surprisingly, nothhing changed. Wasted my 203MB of data. Finally uninstalled it. Anyways thanks for the two days fun.',
       'This last update screwed it up so i cant get it to let me play it just sayd issue loading game and to come back later. I uninstalled and wont be re installing becouse im not doing all that hard work all over agian.' ,

      'So nearly perfect. I tried several and they all had too many ads... some (others) with startling loud sounds that you couldn\'t turn off! Very upsetting! THIS game, however, has only ONE ad at the start of each game, and allows you to mute the sound "once" for all future ads. It\'s simple to click the ad off before the game commences. *wink* The background is lovely and the graphics are wonderful! So relaxing. The happy little "card dance" animation after each win is nice, as well. Thank You!',
       'I grew up with all I had to do so day long was teach myself how to play Solitaire.  It\'s not like I didn\'t have friends but was bored with the ones I had to play with.  I think the game is very realistic.  And completely challenging.',
       'I\'d really give it a 4.5 - plays smoothly and easily, ads are expected in a free game and these are easily disposed of.  The only downside for me is the "wins" are too frequent - not realistic.',
       'I need to take a break from ghastly stuff on the news. I am old and decrepit and it is all way beyond me. May I thank you all xxxxxx',
       'Lots of hints for beginners. Adverts are a little distracting coz sometimes i cant work out how to close them',
       'The game itself was fine but it would often drain the battery on my phone from 100% to 0 in just over an hour so I didn\'t get a lot of use out of it.' ,

      'If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It\'s by far the best maze game app I\'ve come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I\'ve tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It\'s the only maze puzzle app I\'ve found worth playing! 😀💜',
       'Time killer. B&W colors are a bit hard on the eyes after awhile. I wish the controls weren\'t so touchy. Even if I\'m using my stylus it\'s easy to move into a wrong corner by accident when you know it\'s not the right direction.',
       'I\'m not far into it, but it\'s fun so far. My eyesight could be why it\'s not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It\'s still a very good game though.',
       'I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven\'t played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I\'ll have to download a separate kid version for her.',
       '5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes',
       'Where is the challenge? This game is as lame as the rest of the maze games. If you would  try make the game more challenging then maybe I would not have deleted it.' ,

      'I love Beat the Boss 4! But there are some things that I would like to be fixed. For example, when naming your custom boss, the name duplicates. The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can\'t go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.',
       'I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i\'m asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting',
       'I\'d happily purchase this game but that doesn\'t seem like an option. Tge ads, especially the LOUD BLOW UP EXPLOSIONS game that go on for 30 seconds are especially annoying. I\'ll gladly buy it, if only to not deal with Fing ads all the Fing time!!',
       'Too many ads. It\'s annoying especially when you are connected to the internet. The King Boss is not working and is always saying "Something went wrong, please try again later" and crashes the whole gane. On the other hand it\'s a super addictive and fun game to play.',
       'Game is now unplayable due to ads and KIIP rewards popups. The ads bring up my status bar so I can\'t X out of the ad, and the app hangs when trying to load the KIIP program. I have no interest in trying to play something that shovels ads in your face more often than you can actually play.',
       'Recent updates have made this guy unplayable. Now you have to wait  through a 24 second ad that keeps reoccurring.  Not fun for kids and worse for their parents. Kids loved it before these updates.' ,

      'I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn\'t have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn\'t get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren\'t vigilant of their customers and don\'t take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.',
       'I REALY LOVE this game but the only thing is that I\'m on level 10 and when ever I play in a battle and win I only get 200 gun bucks. PLZ can I have money transported to my account.My name is PRO_ADMIN.I would REALY HAPPY if you do😕.By the way this is also for my FAMILY and they would love it if you do ):  . I am only 10 and I know I\'m asking for you to do a big thing but my family would really be happy😊.My brother\'s acount is PROGAMER and he is only 6. PLZ if you don\'t reply or do something then it\'s ok ):  .',
       'Game is really tooo gud, graphics also nice n smooth controls but u guys released only one game mode(Team death match), but in lot of fps games they provided free for all, bomb mode, Flag capture n many more modes.. If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games 😀 n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area.',
       'Awesome game! Love it. Downloaded it around 2 hours ago and I haven\'t stopped playing it. Just one suggestion though Dev\'s... Can we please have some female characters please for us girl gamers.. Thank you if you can do this. Great game 👍💜',
       'The best shooting game ever. Lobed each and every single thing about this game but there a little suggestion that we can see the player if they are online or not but how is this if we can see there live going on matches? That concept will be great and games lag sometimes so if you can fix this and add my suggestion in guns of boom that will be hell great!! #the best game',
       'Great game with a lot of potential.... There can be so many more additions to make this fps better. More grenade varieties? A spectator mode? Clan levels that allow more players to join when we reacher higher levels? Gun balancing changes? I feel like the Cerberus should be buffed. It is expensive, and the 3 shots at once doesn\'t allow for many attempts for kills. Adventure mode for more gunbucks? Death match option? Allowing us to pick the map? I understand the game is fairly new, so keep on adding changes and new improvements. Thanks for listening!' ,

      'Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can\'t play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.',
       'Brilliant game. I\'ve played this longer than any other free game. You can pay if you want to but it\'s not necessary at all if you join a good guild. The tutorial could be better though, some things aren\'t explained at all e.g. how to awaken characters. But apart from that it\'s really good!',
       'Greed leads to downfall. If you dont like to pay to win, this is NOT the game to play. Not to mention, the customer service is absolute garbage.',
       'All I hate about it..... it is costing me lots of hours of sleep, its EXTREMELY addictive. Thanx to the developers, this is the first game I reallllllly enjoy. Keep the GvG and PvP coming',
       'I love it so much, seriously, this is so much fun! And it\'s one of the only games I\'ve downloaded because of an advertisement and the game was ACTUALLY as fun as the mini ad. No false advertising here!',
       'Love the combination of a upgradeable card match three, but with an added diagonal, multiple move counter, and addition onto the original 3 match gem system.  Amazing, thank you Lord Zazen Egrega' ,

This game says it isn\'t looking for personal data but it is. It\'s not safe and it wants to learn more about people. I don\'t trust this game! Also if someone mentions \'Dr.Wallace" ask them who it is and then you will see what I mean.',
       'I think that this game is trash DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!!first they won\'t even let me in the game but when I finally got in I couldn\'t even ride anything I built.snd I wanted to talk to but the people there are just robots!I know it sounds dum to say that but I am at my limit with this game.',

       'This game is supper creepy and if u ask for wallace enough times or continue the conversation about who wallace is it will say "you really want to know dont you" u cant use any of the rides either and in general its creepy.',
       'If you download this game and you are reading this , ask someone who Dr. Richard S Wallace is. I got the name and went to ask her to "tell me more about Dr. Richard S Wallace and it wouldn\'t let me, it kept kicking me out. CREEPY' ,

And this is first time i\'m very exited when i managed to finish a level, even after that, i repeat again till i can surpass it perfectly. Even i haven\'t sleep for 2 days, felt like an alien or zombie, etc. But this game cheers me up alot. Recommended ? Yes! Good job dev, just download it guys. Lu pasti hepi dah! Keren!',
       'Wow... as I was writing this review it suddenly all disappeared as it said unfortunately traffic rider has stopped. Wow.. nice. I cannot even open the game without freezing up my tablet. Real nice. And tbh I love this game! On my phone it works..... 😥😣😈👹',
       'Pretty cool..It was actually a little more than i expected.  The bikes are cool. They seem to be modeled after actual bikes, but perhaps didnt want to pay 4 the licensing to use actual manufacturer names.',
       'One of the best motorcycle game to date, weather conditions are great, bikes are great and handling is great, but the bad ai on higher difficulty level a few times are ridiculous and messes up everything.  Sometimes a truck speeds up to 150km/h just to close off that small gap, where you could slip through, but next time all cars in all lane slow down at once, so you can\'t pass anywhere, even though there\'s nothing in front of them. This is really annoying, when every second counts and there\'s no way to pass them for 4-7 seconds. Apart from this the game is great. The keep changing weather conditions is great too.',
       'There are some idiot missions such as combo overheading. I would give this game 5 stars if not those missions.',
       'I can\'t stop playing this!! The missions are really hard and thats what makes it fun! although i almost threw my phone twice. but this game is amazing! the graphic is good too!' ,

      'Great game for its genre. However it desperately needs some events maybe a daily login bonus and some form of vip ladder. I like the nostalgic of the old game but I feel like the developers made the game and just walked away from it. Please for love of games add new stuff and throw some events to us who are almost maxed out. This happens and I\'m totally cool with a 5 star rating',
       'Best game in years and I especially love the character jam and there are many more for you to collect they are worth the get even when your scroundging around for the last few characters. Also it\'s crazy how much they throw at you for watching an ad It can give you 20 diamonds to 8 hours of cash it\'s insane',
       'Pretty fun. But I don\'t think drivers or taxi drivers should drive like that, let alone be rewarded for hitting other cars like they do... Lol in the car it\'s cool but I wouldn\'t want to be physically in the game. It\'d hurt and be scary. Lol',
       'Fun game, cool animations and graphics. Good music and sound effects. Can you help with diamonds and sell out features just a tad bit more. I enjoy the game. Awesome job developers and programmers. Nice twist on the classic crazy taxi game',
       'It\'s a cool game. Nice to be able to be in charge of the classic Crazy Taxi Crew along with a bunch of new friends to help take down an evil corporation.  However, I haven\'t been able to receive the 1 Day Boost bonuses from the blimps I pop. This has happened 3 times where I watch an ad, then not receive the bonus boost after I\'m done.',
       'Great game, it\'s fun to play. Would rate it higher, but it often crashes when I\'m trying refuel or double my earnings by watching ads. Then the game restarts, and I can\'t refuel for awhile, or I list the bonus earnings. FRUSTRATING!!' ,

      'I really enjoy this game, but I have found a flaw in the design. The game speeds up as you go and after a point it doesn\'t go faster, but after around 10,000 you notice the ball start to move forward on the screen and after about 20,000 you don\'t even have to move the ball to not die. It just misses the spikes. I know you might be thinking Its not on the leaderboards, but that\'s my next complaint. Im currently 6 on the leaderboards, but I\'ve gotten a better score and it won\'t update. I quite frankly destroyed that score and it doesn\'t show up. Thank you for your time and I hope this helped',
       'Game is great, far too many ads, after each level AND major issues with the videos giving rewards. I watched 4 and only received 1 reward which makes the game unfair and not worth playing.',

       'I think the game is good but the pop up ads make it almost impossible to play as when ever you about to start a new level pop up ads and some where even in the middle of the game and it happens to a lot of their games',
       'Fun game, but occasionally an ad will pop up while I\'m playing, causing me to mess up and die. I was having a really great run when an ad popped up. Not cool.',

ITS BEEN COUPLE WEEKS AND NO NEW LEVELS HAVE BEEN ADDED, SO RATING IS NOW GOING DOWN. FIX THIS PLEASE! I love this game but I\'m on level 1190 and there is not another level after this. It did this before on a lower level and after a few days there were more levels. I shouldn\'t have to wait for levels to load up or the game itself reload levels.... my husband is going to catch up to me!!! Fix this please!',
       'I\'m not trying to be a hard ass, but I take issue when games like yours automatically goes into a tutorial mode instead of offering it as a choice. It drives me crazy. If your game gave the user the choice of either to use the tutorial or not my ratings would be between 4 & 5 stars.',
       'Does what it says on the label. Airplane mode takes care of the ads. Happy to make a purchase to remove them though. Good time wasting game. Thanks guys for a great app!',
       'It was exactly what I was wanting to play.  Also unlike other previews, yours is what you show right away not after a bunch of other games that are not worth playing to get to the game you thought you had downloaded.',

       'Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won\'t reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.',
       'The game starts off good in the first couple levels. But once you start getting to the faster cars, it becomes way harder to keep up with the cars PR points, to get to better races. Unless you spend real money to get the parts. One question I do have. Is about the blackridge rivals. Why put some one with a car at a way higher level against a person who\'s car isn\'t even close to the car at a high level, and one more thing... make the races longer. 20 seconds a race isn\'t fun at all. Thinking with the name "Need For Speed". You guys would of done a lot better. The only thing that I seem to like are the  graphics... But that\'s about it...',
       'Goog game, adddictive infact. But I don\'t understand the concept of PATANJALI adds. Whenever i choose to see adds to reduce the waiting time, you comeup with Patanjali adds of 10 and 20 seconds and the irritating part is the time doesn\'t gets reduced even after watching the whole add. Please fix this. When you say reduce wait time by watching add, you need to actually reduce the waiting time after the add instead of insisting to watch the add again and again.',
       'When I started playing this game I really enjoyed it. But now I realise that in order to progress, you MUST spend REAL money. I am a family man, with a wife and 6 children, I just wanted a game that I could play when kids are in bed and wife is in bath, I don\'t have cash to spend on games, the worst thing is the 7 Day events, you cannot beat them without spending money. Very disappointed. Good game but don\'t expect to progress very far if you don\'t want to spend money.',
       'This game is..... Interesting. Some pros, lots of cons. Let\'s start with the pros. The graphics are ok for a mobile game. The selection of cars is... Ok. Pretty much everything good is ok. Now the cons. The controls are terrible. All cars shift at 9500 rpm(witch would make any engine explode besides a 4rotor or a vtec inline 4.) The sounds are terrible. Nothing like the real cars. The customization is ugly and obviously ricer inspired. But, it is in some ways, fun. The campaign is challenging(in a good way.). The events are just as good. Although it has many flaws, I would recommend getting this game. It\'s free, it\'s sorta fun.' ,

      'Game is very pleasant to look at, but it is basically a platform to watch advertisements on. And after a certain point, watching the advertisements don\'t offset the cost of opening your eggs. Smooth gameplay. Adorable graphics. But you\'ll be lucky to get maybe 10 minutes of gameplay per session before you have to wait. Not too bad if you only have a few minutes to play at a time, but not for me.',
       'The latest update deleted my save, and when I reloaded the one saved on the cloud, it only had my progress up to before Jurassic Island. Losing my stuff kind of took away the fun in playing for me, so I\'m uninstalling. It\'s too bad, I\'ve been enjoying the game for months.',
       'Just super cute time waster lots of adds but you find super cute things and I Love claw games so we\'re Good! I keep wining the super size 2x  your eggs but for some reason I can\'t get the ability to do that even though it says I won 3 times?',
       'I\'ve lost all my progress 😱 i\'ve lost everything:all my worlds including special events islands like Halloween and Valentines\', all toys and puzzles. I just opened it and it was showing me a tutorial. Signing in Google play account didn\'t help. What happened?? How do I fix it? I\'m so upset.. 😔',
       'Was a good pass time until the last update. For whatever reason, 2 eggs have been sitting hatched, however, when I click them they never open. They just continue bouncing up and down. Frustrating because now I can only hatch one egg at a time...',
       'Please get rid of the coin master demo ad.  It crashes my phone every time. Note that my phone can play any other demo ads fine.  I\'m fine watching a 30 sec video, not waiting for the app to restart several times. Will leave a bad rating until you fix this.' ,

       'Where is support? I have gem confirmation enabled but it\'s just taken 70 gems without warning. I\'ve also done extras to win gems but they haven\'t been added. There needs to be a cancel button like on food etc. Need to say time it will take to hatch eggs etc. When doing challenges it should say exactly what you need to do and spend so you aren\'t guessing. Besides these issues, I am really enjoying this game. It\'s easy and fun. I just wish you didn\'t need to spend so much to get further in the game.',
       'This one of the coolest city building games I\'ve ever played in my life, and the various types of dragons blows my mind. I play this for hours and hours and it\'s insane gameplay because the choices of breeding dragons is vast. I also love the fact that you can battle with the dragons currently available to do so. I 1000%+ recommend downloading this game, and I\'d give it 5+ rating for EVERYTHING. BEST GAME EVER!!!!!😃' ,

      'Pretty good design, but there is a cheater mode which tells you when one is wrong even if it\'s not apparent. So the fastest times are always really fast even for the hard ones. Also the ad bar is right below the numbers so you accidentally hit it when you play. Pretty sure that\'s intentional to get extra clicks, but super annoying.',
       'having lots of fun with the game, especially the daily challenges. But  ads that cannot be skipped pops up way too often, and its quite irritating. Also it would b good if u can ad d something like automatically mark (diff cotour, shade out) the numbers thats already been fully filled so we dont have to check it manually.',
       'Great game for keeping your mind active and gives me something to do on my phone.  If there was a way to get rid of the adds then it would be even better.  I wouldn\'t expect a free game to be advert free; but I would like a feature to remove them even if I have to pay.',
       'The game in itself isn\'t bad but I\'ve completed a puzzle in 10 minutes and for the past half an hour I don\'t know what to do next, does it pop up on the screen \'You have finished\' or do we just move on? I\'ve been looking for any place that I\'ve gone wrong but I haven\'t found any',
       'My wife and I play this game like an old couple as we wait for our son to sleep, sure enough - we all doze off!  This game makes the brain go, sometimes my brain goes so hard that smoke comes out my ears.  Beautiful. Thank you for the gift of this game, we\'ve shared about the light it brings into our lives.   That\'s a good ending.',
       'Really functional sudoku app with a great UI and some nice features. My one issue is the hint button.  I tap it way too often by accident and it permanently reveals a tile, which kind of spoils the puzzle. Otherwise it\'s great' ,

      'I hate it! There is only three looks to do, and the make up! Literally you have to click on it a thousand times until you get the one you like. The cloths aren\'t that bad, but they can be a little more pretty. They should make it for boys and girls, so you can dress up boys, and maybe the boys can take a girl on a date so, they could get married and then they can have children but, it would be a life cycle! They would start out as babies and grow on and get married!!! Hope you like my feedback!! P.S. Plz update the game!!!',
       'Really! you could only do their makeup and dress them up! BORING! Hmmph!',

      'Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)',
       'I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn\'t have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it\'s Definitely Not a game you\'d wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!',
       'Too many ads. I just downloaded n was very happy to check this out but first thing that came on my screen was advertisement. It\'s sad that even after so many feedbacks given for excessive advertisements still developers are running with it. I\'m uninstalling this game n not recommending anyone to try it unless you want to watch commercials',
       'Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout',
       'Great game.... but difficult for controle on himeself during shooting  you can get killed during shooting by enemies if you will not move to and fro...',
       'Guys let me tell u how to crack every level if u sit down in the game i mn the shooter sits on the knees it can reach every enemy without being discovered coz u can get close to them as much as u want and will not be able to ahoot the player once also. Ur lifebank will be full. Also developers should update the game due to above lacking..😂😂😂😂' ,

      'A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it\'s a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you\'ve done them and reached level 10 on both, there\'s really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.',
       'Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON\'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!',
       'The game itself is awesome, really awesome. But my god, there is too many ads, It is okay to have ads in a free game, I totally understand, the dev has worked to build a game so it is fair to receive money back for the work.  But here there are too many ads, there is ad in game, there is ad when you lose a match and there are the famous win coins for watching a video.  Couldn\'t find an option to buy the game and remove the ads, hope the developer improve this, because the is really awesome...',
       'Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I\'ve basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I\'ve got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.',
       'Be cool if there is boosts. Example if you get 3 perfect you get a free auto perfect boost or something. Also plz add a line of code to stop people from the date/time bug abuse - save current time to file. Player won\'t get money till that last input time has passed.  Also be cool to spend the coins on boosts',
       'Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot\'s more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn\'t bother me that much. 5 stars for the team' ,

      'This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!',
       'Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don\'t like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option',
       'Great game, I totally love it. I don\'t mind the ad but I get annoyed of too many questions of Selena Gomez/Taylor Swift/Beyonce/Ariana Grande etc top hits. How about the legends..like David Bowie, Prince, Foo fighters, Guns n roses, Smashing pumpkins.. other than that, u all admins really rock!!  Edit: So I finally get questions like hits by David Bowie, Oasis..so cool. Well done fight list!! And they do consider our suggested answers!!❤❤❤',
       'It\'s fun. It\'s actually more informative that I thought it would be. It kind of opens up you mind and is an amazing pass time stimulate. However I feel it would be more beneficial in and educational sense if you had more of an opportunity to review the answer list through the app. It\'s actually something I look forward to when the round is over.  So you\'re not just learning something from what you and your challenger have contributed as far as answers, but the game itself has also done it\'s part. Other than that, totally awesome.',
       'Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it\'s good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can\'t take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren\'t recognised either. I\'d enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.',

      'I wish I could post pictures, but the game is too easy. I beat the first 2 levels both on one attempt. Though I am an experienced geometry dash player. But if I can beat a level first try, not knowing the course at all, that\'s some easy stuff. I highly recommend geometry dash sub zero though.',
       'Great fun but needs more levels. I laughed when I saw a review made by an idiot because he said this was a copy of the Impossible Game LOL it\'s the other way around, dumbass.',
       'THIS GAME IS AWESOME PLZ MAKE THE COMING SOON Levels Music kind of more like the seven seas music THANKS and also I rated 5 stars on every thing on this game and P.S. could you please make the coming soon levels more faster dear fellows, thanks',
       'I love every Geometry Dash version! And this one might be the best. But my only downfall is that the music, which is freaking awesome,gets ahead of the actual gameplay and I miss my jumps. Plz fix and I\'ll rate 5 stars! But keep up the good work!',
       'I think this game is going to change your life once you start is going to test you all you know you need to be focused to pass the whole entire thing and make sure you try to get all the coins good luck out there and may the best guy win or woman',
       'Incredible as always. Level design is amazing and the graphics are spot on. However, controls are wanky on mobile and makes a few techniques way harder than they should be. There also should have been more levels.' ,

      'First off, they obsessively ask you to rate the app which I did not like at all. Secondly, the in-app purchases doesn\'t translate to other devices downloaded in the same account so be warned. Thirdly, the gameplay was nice enough and everything else.',
       'I really like the game. I got hooked on it. I didn\'t like that I had to pay to unlock the other levels especially since the game was so short. I passed every level within 3hrs. It was daeasy and fadt. Wish there were more levels. To unlock the levels it was kind of expensive.',
       'You should be able to earn what it takes to up grade.. You don\'t get very far in the game to even see if you really like it.. Your just stuck',
       'I love this game I love this game and I\'m a boy wow this is so cool like there\'s no like ads and it\'s crazy how it is like you can make lots of treats and you can tell the customers to come up and get their traits and the love it I\'m sure can tell them to come get the tree and they\'re really loud seriously they\'ll be the best traits that ever tasted',
       'If the other people said that they hated it I\'m just going to say I love it because its a fun game I just whished that I did not have to pay to get a new car for the bumppy road',
       'For anything over the basic you have to pay for it. Even after getting 3 stars on everything to go to higher levels you have to pay that\'s ridiculous. ..' ,

      'The first time I played I easily got over 800, now I swear the game upped it\'s difficulty like crazy, I can\'t get past the 200s. Not sure if it\'s a bug, an Easter egg feature or what, or if it\'s because I completed challenges but I don\'t appreciate the inconsistency especially when playing against friends and I don\'t feel evenly matched :(',
       'Its a fun game, really, however in my opinion its too easy. I got 150 First try and 346  my second. and maybe consider adding things to unlock like different balls or hoops. other than that its a fun game to kill time',
       'I like the game and the idea of it, but the only problem I have with it, its the ads. Dear God there is a lot of ads, even when I\'m in the middle of a game, an ad pops up from the bottom. Just try to lower the amount of ads especially on the challenges, I hate to be asked and forced to watch an ad everytime I fail a challenge or complete it',
       'I got this game just so I can beat my friends high score... lol',
       'The problem is that every time it asks me if I would like to continue I say yes and then kicks me out of the game',

      'It is a good clicker game kinda like clicker heroes but with a lot better graphics, the controls are simple and the only thing I dislike about in the slightest way is that the heroes are a little bit to expensive, it has a simple but very cool design and deserves 5 stars. Thankfully it doesn\'t cost money to buy the game itself. All in all it is a great game.',
       'Great game still playing after 2 years and for people who ask what does prestige mean is that it gives you relics which are used to better you character with artifacts, but i come with a price... starting over with a slight headstart.',
       'was fun until the game stopped loading and I was forced to uninstall. thanks a f***ing lot too signed up with my email and it told me that my account is no longer valid. good game. ya d***heads.',
       'Pretty much fixes all my gripes with other rpg idle games, plus it looks really good. 1 day in, and I feel like even though I\'ve made a lot of progress, I still have more to discover. It\'s rare that an incremental like this actually captures that feeling. It\'s what makes me want to continue grinding.',
       'It\'s amazing, easy ,all you have to do is tap and upgrade your character and your allies and while your away and off your phone your allies could take down the titans for you. Super fun and addicting.',
       'Tried for a few minutes, then uninstalled. All I had to do is tap to kill the monsters, they don\'t even fight back. At lvl 2 or 3, I got a companion who auto attacked. Then I didn\'t even have to tap anymore. The monsters just died while I watched.  I don\'t understand why everyone is giving this 5 stars. Maybe some joke that the whole world gets except for me. Oh well.' ,

      'Not good enough It could get more better. It actually failed to fulfill the expectations! Not really very fun to play as was written in the description. The game could include a shop to buy things such as powerups or different colours and styles of jetski and some more creative adventures could get the game into a very interesting zone!',
       'Very fun, I love it In this game you can choose your players, Tom or Angela. Then you can ride and you try to get as far as you can throughout the obstacles and challenges. You also try to collect stars along the way. However many stars you collect determines your score. This app will keep your scores and will let you know if you get a high score. When you run into something you have the option to keep going if you watch an advertisement. This app is not boring at all. It works great and doesn\'t take up much space.',

       'Addictive and challenging It makes me put the score I wanna get in mind so I can work towards it and that inspires me to read my books......... If I can determine that I wanna pass my high score who says I can\'t get better grades....... I love the game keep doing  what your doing and make more games..... To everyone  I advise you to play this game 💖💞',
       'Oh please shut up. It is a very good game and a nice distraction for kids so stop saying it\'s not good enough.  If you are still so sure it sucks then try making your own game see how people reject it',
       'I think that it\'s a great game to play with. they have a lot of obstacles that you can play with and try to dodge them. It\'s also a  score below your score and if u pass it up you have a new high score. if you run into anything you have available options to watch an advertising video or you can press the x. You can also pick which character you want to use if your a girl it\'s most likely to be Angela. And if your a boy it\'s most likely to be Tom.  Yeah it\'s a great game to me it\'s also great for little kids.  It\'s a great game so yeah it should have a high rate at all times.' ,

Well, maybe not the first time, but you can not sleep at night until you pass it and you do not know what at the end of this trip on interesting lands and locations. By the way, there is no plot in the game, but it will appear if you can play long enough! In any case, which of us does not like to shoot and douse a dozen evil creatures? The game has 60 levels or so. And to pass them you need to sweat. The explosions, shooting, guns. You can also find spinners and gyro-paceters, which are likely to become invincible.

      'I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there\'s only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can\'t beat them! Keep making more awesome games!',
       'I can\'t help but love a mobile game that doesn\'t constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it\'s tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.',
       'This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn\'t always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing',
       'Excellent game, can\'t wait for a new map. There isn\'t any tutorials but it\'s quite a simple and fun game, you will catch on quick just be patient. Hope to see new maps soon don\'t make it too easy on us high levels now : )',
       'I really like the game. But there\'s one thing that annoys me: when I don\'t play this game for a few hours and then I do another battle in dungeon, the game crashes after killing last monster in that battle.  I found out that if I switch on mobile data it works. So I wanted to asked why is that. EDIT: now all works just fine. 5 stars',
       'Lots of work to do on this game. It\'s very SOLID in gameplay and possibilites, but lacks a lot of content. Needs to gather gold while away from the game, as the grind is tremendous right now! There is no purpose in leveling up your mine past lvl 5 right now. It doesn\'t do anything. The game is very incomplete, but has a ton of potential.' ,

      'I really do enjoy playing this game. It\'s a great time waster. Good for breaks at work. Public transit. Bored at home. Good graphics. You can choose the controls method. Great car selection. I enjoy it so much, to help the creator I spend a few bucks now and then. It\'s one of the few games I actually play. Just wish there was actual racing. Or if you could have police chasing you, rather than being the police. Either way, good game. Those would be great to implement. 😁',
       'THIS GAME IS OVERPOWERD I\'ve been finding a game that is  A Leagend Car game. Then i found this cool game and  I PLAYED IT ALOT. But not forever.   🎵THE STORY🎵  When i\'ve played it i saw a !alarm At the gifts then i liked you at facebook Then i subscribed you on youtube  And i liked you at twitter too. Then theres a free luckybucy thing. The free watch and then you will have $500.THANK YOU FOR THE GAME',
       'This game is getting boring. Yah, Next Generation Endless Racing blahblah. But is this all about endless whatever? I think you must put some thrill to this game. This is nothing compared to Traffic Rider which is you also create that game (Yeah. Traffic Rider is one of my fav game.) I HOPE YOU PUT SOMETHING THRILLING LIKE MISSIONS *NOT DAILY MISSION* AND PUT SOME CAR NAMES IN IT. ONE MORE HOPE YOU MAKE THE CARS IN TRAFFIC MORE REALISTIC IT LOOKS LIKE A MOVING BOX... AND I WANT SOME FEEDBACK.',
       'Hello, 😊 I really love this game, my favourite actually! I have play a lot of games, but this one is the best so far! PS.:I never spent real money on games! But in this game you don\'t really have to, so it\'s even better for me and for people who can\'t spend real money in virtual things. I know that there are 1 or 2 cars in the game that you can only buy with real money, but it still is a perfect game in my opinion! 😉',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a long time on a couple devices and it\'s been a lot of fun. There seems to be some variations in scale of one compact car to another. The models themselves don\'t quite seem to be in scale to each other. You might have two hatch backs that should both be small, even very near in size but when you\'re looking at cars to buy you can tell that the model itself just isn\'t quite the right size compared to other similar cars, and then when you get out on the road with it, it looks bigger than it should compared to other vehicles on the road around it. But.. That\'s not too big of a deal. Great game!',
       'Fun, decent selection of vehicles, graphics and controls look and  work great. But theres a car with no way to get it but paying 15 actual dollars and I hate that. Everything should be earnable even if basically impossible to earn and $15 is alot of money for a single vehicle in a small limited android game. Even the dlc cars in major games like gran turismo and forza are cheaper and those games are way better. That aspect of the game is just confusing is all. Still fun to play.' ,

      'The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I\'d like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.',
       'Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It\'s very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again',
       'The more stuff is added the lagier it gets. Game freezes when buying items, when going over your city, with the chat, loading the flobsl trade, travelling to other cities and basicly everything nowadays. Requires multiple restarts of the game and reboots of my phone regularly to keep jt playable nowadays. It used to be really good and smooth, but it only gets worse each update and no improvement in sight. I only play now because I made some good friends in my club, but the actual fun is long gone. :(',
       'i like the quests to earn gold keys & platinum keys. other players can see what is in my storage & i hope EA can block/fix that. there are still video ad problems; a video will either play or not; and it will not return me to game; and/or it will not offer the three choices. 02/20/2018. how many times do i have to rate game?',
       'Great game!!! Would love coins for basic production items but they are not necessary for this game to be great. Also maybe if there were rewards for club donations back and forth more lol would do it. Thanks for providing really great entertainment :)',
       'Lots of potential! A EA omega blog headquarters building for idears would be good. bring back the cinema, city with no cinema! Simcity needs a expansion. Don\'t like the desaster battle concept, it should of been a stock exchange battle concept. and had a better approach to the desasters.like Desasters emergency service building with weekly events for random desaster repairs for existing and new realistic scenarios. Get rid of vu building and desaster island and replace it with emergency desaster service building and a weather towers. Then instead of having to event there would be 3 online events.' ,

      'Downloaded this through another app (free golden eagles) where if you downloaded and played this game, and got castle to level 10 would be rewarded. Sent off request to support a number of times with proof and no reply, and after a week still no reward.   So if you are downloading this to get reward from another app don\'t bother as you won\'t get it',
       'Pure pay tto win. You will either pay or quit out of frustration. Build times are hilarious. Seriously, our Earth\'s sun will die before you max out your hero\'s knowledge or most any other knowledge.  The Stronghold is worthless and a huge waste of resources. It\'s more of a trophy.  Sure you can join a clan, get some bonuses and buy some shields with points, but you will be destroyed by the winners. Me, I had a gift card and blew on this game, now I just start fights and make people quit.',
       'I like the game but it is hard for players who can\'t buy a lot of packs. Some slight tweaks to make it not so slanted towards big spenders.  Maybe make some exchange rate for silver to gold without changing the silver availability or price. Someway that gold can be acquired beside the little in the ground. I understand the game has to make a profit and so you should but more people would continue to play instead of giving up Anyway just a couple of thoughts. Got plenty more on just general gameplay  that I think would be useful. Again, not hating as I like and play the game.',

      'It feels like it was a soccer game that they changed a few thing to make it a hockey game.  That said it\'s not too bad.  I don\'t understand the finance part and there is no where to explain it.  The transfer portion is odd too.  The player got way more expensive with the last update.  It is irritating that I can\'t afford to sign my prospects once they are fully realized.  If I develop a 71 rated prospect it will cost me $700000 to sign him.  That is approximately 300 coins.  I could just let him walk and use those coins to sign 2 73 rated players... It makes no sense.  I have to forgo upgrades to afford to sign prospects.',
       'I like the game. You can do good if you put some thought into it. My only  complaint, is that I didn\'t make it to the next level at season end which is fine but why did I get reset at the minimum for that level and I check the standings and there are teams that already have enough points to make the next level?  I\'m 15-0 in my season and still 100 pts behind the leading team and not even in the top 1000.',
       'Abritrary garbage.  Great concept, poor execution.  Built a solid team and still lose even when ratings are better then opponents consistently.  Out shoot the opponent 97-8 and still lose.  Recommended if you need an exercise in futility in your life.',
       'I\'m really confused as to why I can only win games if I\'m 10+ overall better than my opponent. If we are even close to the same rating I get my butt kicked. It\'s absolutely ridiculous and seriously makes the game not fun.',
       'Not a bad game, but I\'ve noticed lately that the "reimbursed" money from voided contracts doesn\'t get added to my in-game wallet. Which is annoying since I need it to sign players.',
       'Game updates hurt you. Increased value of players to sign yet, left my teams wallet short. No fun when, updates cost me more money.' ,

      'Very simple. Gives me a lot of nostalgia. Two things though, it seriously needs music maybe some Celtic tunes or shanties. And secondly it needs more stuff to do. When I first saw a whale I was excited about doing some whaling but nope. The whales do absolutely nothing. Maybe even some treasure hunting puzzles or something. Good game just needs a little more content.',
       'Good game however, once you\'ve taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world\'s and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.',
       'please, please, please. update more maps or make it more challenging, ive already conquered all the islands and there\'s not much i can do anymore. so please, either more maps, or let others conquer my islands and let me reclaim it. i know you guys can still add up to this already amazing game. also, improve the controls, really cant see much when im steering. but over all, its a really fun, relaxing game. ;) thank you.',
       'Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.',
       'One of me and my sister\'s favourite game. But we wish we could play together same team or against each other with bots. We don\'t  want to be against online players. If you guys do that I will tell alllllll my friends to play. Anyway great job keep up the work , you guys are great😁',
       'Awesome game! Two things: please do something about the controls, they feel very poor quality. Even addig a left and a right arrow would be more comfortable for me.. Second is content. This game is huuuuge. But I\'m so addicted I managed to conquer all the islands by now, so I really want more challenges. Thanks for the awesome game, keep up the good work!' ,

      'First of all, clearly stolen from Google Chrome. Second of all, why waste time with the ads on the game if you could play it on no-wifi Chrome with no ads? Why even waste storage on your device? Don\'t bother!',
       'Can u make the Dino long jump if u long press the screen and quick jump if u press it quickly? it so hard to avoid obstacles in late game because the jump is too long and the obstacles going faster and faster . Sorry for my bad English, thanks.',
       'This game is a rip off. The original is on Google. When ur offline and you go to a visited page, this shows up. Don\'t download this and waste your time.',
       'You can play this on laptops on chrome when your internet is off! SO MUCH FUN! I JUST CANT STOP WHEN IM PLAYING IN SCHOOL. Thank you so much for making it available on the phone. ☺☺🙂🙂😎😎😎😎😎',
       'This is the worst game ever. Ot kust copyed the no wifi game on google. Suggest you to not download this game',
       'Well I think this game is really awesome and fun. But sometimes it could be frustrating because when you get a high score then you lose. But its still amazingly fun' ,

      'I really like this one. Sometimes the game cheats. But since the last update that seems to be happening less. Update: What happened to my premium clothes? The game changed my look!!! Update: I like the update. Need easier way to get skills. Suggestion: get skills during game play, not just in bags.',
       'Fix the bugs.  everytime is messes up in the middle of a game I have lost the money that I bet.  I want my money back too.  Also that one on one is garbage.  Take it off the game.  I cant pass the 50 level in carrer because I dont want to play one one one and I just losr 25000 again because of your bugs.',
       'Fun game. But constantly asking me to buy something is annoying. Also, good graphics but control are not good enough. It malfunction, player with bad connection has advantage and wins game and money. That\'s problematic.',
       'The new bags won after a win are meant to get you to spend real money to open them up quicker by using gold. It\'s so obvious a money grab for mini games, it\'s sad. Also, the more real money you pay to get a better in game basketball, the more skills you\'ll have to beat anyone. That\'s why so many people scream about cheaters. There aren\'t any cheaters, just those who paid real money to pad the pockets of miniclip and make the game a true pay-to-win clustermuck.',
       'I effing hate the new ways, they just made me pay 25,000 to upgrade my ball when it used to be 2 gs. But other than that this game is badasss',
       'So, be prepared for this, Miniclip will suspend you for gaining an advantage on their system. How you do that? I have no idea. But, today I was told that I am suspended from getting credit for my wins. Yeah, what a waste of money to spend on this app, do not do it' ,

      'Such a bad game. Nekki never gets enough of money so they show ads nearly after every fight. You can\'t earn gems from watching videos as it\'s never available. Tapjoy offers have been completed, but never awarded. All the weapons gets worser as you level up. Nekki wants you to BUY the good weapons. Bad game. Shadow fight 3 is worser than this one.',
       'Challenges ruin the experience. Mandatory in order to progress and level up. Some challenges are just ridiculous, and frustrating when you\'re given five tries and having to watch a thirty second ad to get one back every time, even if you make a simple mistake. Other than that it\'s good.',
       'The AI spam SO much! All they do is throw a suriken at you till you die. They won\'t even let you get up! 2 hits and I die yet I hit them like 10 times! There should be unlimited energy who wants to spend $20 for unlimited energy. Plus the controls are trash.',
       'This is a fun action game! I\'m so addicted to it right now and I\'m completely hooked into the game\'s story. The fight animation is just brilliant, unique moves based on real martial arts, fighting styles that vary with each weapon, beautiful background locations, exciting music! It\'s perfect!',
       'Let me just say I don\'t mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high',
       'Fuck this game and who ever created it... It\'s a challenge and a fight I understood but I am not fighting a god my opponents are invincible even though I have the same weapon they have... Even my weapon is fully upgraded... I loved the level Linux it was satisfying but after that it sucks... I\'m uninstalling this game now... And I will tell my friends not to play this game... Because I\'m that much irritated... Hate you.. And duck you..' ,

      'Some things are hidden in such a place makes it hard on note 8 due to curved screen. Level 89 doesn\'t work, as well as other levels where touching the same place over and over and over might get something to work.  Most puzzles are extremely easy,  it\'s just a matter of the game not working.',
       'Not responsive to most touches. I finally got a cheat only to realize it was the game.  Ads were not frequent but had a strobe light going off (health issues) and would not turn off. Had to close out of the game every time so I just quit playing. Typo many similar more challenging games out there to try and work with this one.',
       'Got stuck playing til lvl 40 before I realized an hour had past, and I only came to the play store looking for sonic 3, but this looked interesting listed under "recomended." Great recommendation.',
       'Some levels are straight forward. Others you just have to skip because there\'s no logic or something is missing. Could be good with some type of help if you get stuck rather than just skipping an entire level.',
       'Items don\'t move when they are supposed to therefore making it impossible to complete each task. It is very frustrating because the game would be more fun. It would make it more enjoyable with at least 1 or 2 hints.',
       'I found it boring. A character in the game tells you what to do, where to find the key etc and you do it, then you move a level up. How is that exciting? But millions of people do, so go figure.' ,

      'I\'m impressed. This really is a fun game. And with all of the aid, events and rewards there are you really don\'t need to pay to win. There\'s a lot to learn so you may feel a bit lost at first but it keeps the game from being repetitive. I didn\'t think this would be a 5 star game but after 2 weeks of playing I can tell you that it certainly is. A+ 💯',
       'Overall a great fun game. The only complaint I have is the rate at which it takes to get an officer. Like all games they try their hardest to get you to spend money but I absolutely refuse to spend any actual more wy on a game. So the way they try to squeeze cash out of you is by making it almost impossible to get an officer. So be very aware about your officers cuz if you don\'t want to spend any cash like me, it\'ll take you FOREVER to gain a new officer. Other than that, awsome game!',
       'Great graphics and addictive but not alot of explanation on how to do things. Too many updates in short amount of time,  too long of a waiting time on researches. You need to spend money if you want to keep up with the rest and you\'re placed up against players alot more stronger so always have to go protection buffs. Not an even playing battlefield.',
       'Stupid game. I spent so much time on it building just for a higher leveled person to come in a destroyed it to point i couldnt rebuild. Not worth time spent on rebuilding things if higher leveled people just continuously attacking lower leveled teams and wiping them out. Only shows u have to have money to play this game to level up to defend. Im not spending a dime on this retarded game',
       'A whole lot of effort to get anything done. They\'re constantly trying to sell you things at obnoxious prices and if you don\'t buy them you\'re setting yourself up to be abused by those foolish enough to waste their money on this game.',
       'Really not happy I have spent loads off money over time on buying gold in the game and packs.. I have had major glitches in the game that have made it a waste of my time and money I have lost over 10 advanced teleports on the game and when I contact your customer service team they don\'t even reply to me.  I find this very bad customer service and that all u want to do is take my hard earned money and not even reimburse me what I have lost.i really enjoy playing this game but this is making me want to not play any more' ,

      'I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.',
       'LOVE this game!! Literally, I don\'t think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it\'s just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜',
       'A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it\'s really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it.',
       'This game apparently needs more graphics power than my tablet has. Every time i start to draw, there is a two to three second delay before the line starts moving. The game will lock up momentarily, then skip to where i am in the drawing, leaving out large sections of my solution. And of course, when the game skips ahead, the timer does too. Not a good thing to have happen in a game where every tenth of a second matters.',
       'this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates',
       'The game is addictive. Mediocre ratings are because there is a bug. On all games on all levels I\'m getting a network error and I\'m not connected to a network viewing a hint. I have been connected to numerous networks and reset the phone. This needs to be sorted.' ,

      'Whenever I try to open the app the screen starts flashing black and it\'ll stay like that or keeping turning back to the screen I was on and off, which ends up somewhat strobe-like. The actual game itself is amazing despite having a hard time trying to beat the bacteria level but, what\'s the point of a good game concept, if the game won\'t work properly',
       'I thought the new scenario was a free-trial only like the simian flu. (At least you can unlock it after being a brutal pro at the game) I\'m gonna enjoy playing this a good few times and unlock even MORE scenarios. Keep up the good work! I wanted to make a suggestion, but I just can\'t remember now. Oh well...',
       'Fun game. I wish the rate of death was more consistent. 37,000,000 a day at one point, but waiting 6 months for 100,000 to die towards the end. The disease didn\'t change, the rate of death shouldn\'t decrease just because there are fewer people. Good game otherwise',
       'I didn\'t buy the new plague, i might need to. The first 2 difficulty settings are easy, the 3rd not so much. Good game to me! Just have to read what it is that you spend your DNA points on and you should do just fine',
       'Really annoying ads keep repeating and covering controls.  So annoying. Pity as game is unplayable like this. It never used to happen before. Why can\'t developer just charge for extra content rather than make game unplayable. Will have to remove.',
       'Awesome game! Very addicting! You can replay over and over and it doesn\'t get boring! Just keeps getting better!  There is no need to buy if you don\'t want to.... Just because you suck doesn\'t mean it isn\'t beatable... You shouldn\'t give low stars because it\'s a difficult game! It\'s very beatable without purchase!!!  5 stars!!!!  Just keep trying!

      'wow ! why is this game so good!! addicting I got a problem ! to many ads! I under stands u need money but you should put purchases so u get some more money !! and also I want to have new characters and themes that will be cool course I nearly got all but I haven\'t! also change rating to pegi 3 I know there\'s the characters can be a vampire but srsly IT\'S NOT SCARY what is with wthat!  sorry it\'s long but thanks for taking time and reading bye!😀😀😀😁😁😁',
       'Very very addictive pass time. Only a lil disappointed with the adds popping out every now and than. I know its a free app and adds are inevitable but try reducing the number of time it should appear not after each and every round.',
       'It\'s a very good game! I got my boyfriend hooked on it, but my problem with it is, sometimes when I start up the app it sits on the beginning stage of the app?? Like when am I going to be able to play again? Was just updated? So I\'m going to have to delete it and start it all over and re gain my high score??',
       'There are wayyyy too many ads seriously. You don\'t need that many ads for your game you have enough money you have a bursting game brand . Most of your games don\'t even have as many ads. Every failed turn "here\'s an ad buy my game!!!!" No!!!',
       'I loved this game, but recently I noticed when I played the owl for example by the way this happend to all of them, but after one death I noticed it changed to the basic map. I don\'t know what is wrong but do please sort this out.',
       'The *only* complaint is the frequent,  long 30 second ads after nearly every single round.  It\'s quicker to close the app and reopen,  but either way,  it\'s annoying enough to not want to play the game.   Other than that,  this is a fun game! :D' ,

      'To many ads, even if they make the game free.. Pathetic. Conflicts with game when trying to back out of them and even crashes. Inconsistent game play, twitchy controls at times. Unplayable shots where one number on power scale is to hard the next one down is to soft.  Multi player has a feel of being rigged at times.  Potential for a good game but not yet in my books.',
       'Super fun game, but WAY TOO MANY crashes. I\'ve been struggling with a level several times only for the game to crash mid-level and I lose all my progress getting booted back to the beginning. Infuriating!',
       'Some observations: ball does not rebound off rails as they should, especially the back and side rails near the hole, where the ball hits the rail and stops dead. Part of miniature golf mastery is using the rails but not in this game. And when the ball is against a rail a shot is allowed as if the rail was not present. After a shot the screen should automatically rotate close to what the next shot would be expected so as to minimize manual rotation. I was making a long swipe to rotate almost 180° and my finger hit the power slide and an errant shot was made. Most hills are not smoothly sloped but instead very angular. Hitting the bottom of the slope causes the ball to jump in ways unanticipated rather than roll. This is golf, not basketball. I uninstalled the game because it just wasn\'t as fun and realistic as I had hoped.',

      'Great game if you wanna run low graphics for a smoother gameplay on your phone. 40 instead of 100 is great for mobile games as well. Maybe make the controls a tad bit larger for default size. Otherwise really fun. Maybe add a first person mode? Unless I haven\'t found out how to haha. Great game. I seemed to like this one out of all the others tbh.',
       'Well I love the potential. Has a lot of bugs. Dual or quad mode doesn\'t work and overall it takes too long to wait. I waited 10 minutes for quad and then it just stopped and put me back to choosing game modes. I think thi s game can be the best if it had more work put into it.',
       'I honestly liked the game better before the update. You got rid of the aim button, the game is full of glitches like taking damage inside the safe zone, and I get lagged out all the time even though I have a pretty good Wi-Fi connection. To be honest,  you kinda ruined the game.',
       'Good game. Takes a bit to get used to controlling but after a while it\'s OK. I think it has a great potential if devs will keep working on it. There are some minor glitches in graphics and gameplay which hopefully will get fixed over time but apart from that it\'s good game. And you could add voicechat. That would improve it  a lot. Keep up the good job.',
       'This game is good and very challenging but i dont like the new update. My overall Stats have stopped working and im still dyeing even when im in circle and the aim button needs to come back it is so hard to play without it.  But overall a good game it just needs a few adjustments.',
       'Good game, but after the last update the game game is riddled with bugs and glitches, making the game next to unplayable. Will often come up with queue error and kick me from the game and the screen constantly freezes. I can move, but I can\'t pick anything up and my teammate position is also frozen. Pls fix or I will uninstall. Also, you got rid of the aim button which sucks. Was way better before the update. You\'ve ruined the game for me😭😭😭' ,

      'This game is perfect for anyone who loves magic, fantasy, collecting, and a whole new level of adorable! Dragonvale takes everything to the next level! I highly recommend it, as it is a amazing game, my most played, and I hope everyone else enjoys it just as much as I do. Five stars! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Edit 2: I was re-organizing my islands by Element the other day, and I had just finished the Plant Island. I put down a Oversized Oak Tree, and immediately, a image flashed through my mind: a young girl, sitting on a branch of the oak tree, a book in one hand, a baby Plant dragon sitting next to her. Stretched out in front of them was my Plant Island, the dragons freely soaring, the other islands in the distance. And that sparked a inspiration in my head. I just wanted to ask; can I write a Dragonvale book, which takes place at my park? Please let me know !  :)',
       'Cmon Backflip! Okay look I love Dragonvale, I\'ve been playing it forever. First off I lost my amazing park a while back and that really sucked. But now I am restarting and I go to buy the beginners pack for 9.99 and it says there was an error and i wont be charged...come to find out it did charge me and i didnt receive anything!

Well for Gardenia\'s event, it turned in all my roses before I could exchange them. I had over 25,000 and was so pumped to get the new dragons. Now I don\'t have any roses and 25,000,000 extra coins i don\'t need. Please help. This is a very frustrating bug.',
       'I really love collecting all of the dragons and the fact that you can theme/decorate your park too. But the amount of types of decorations are unbalanced, the majority that you can currently buy in the market are just plant and earth type while there are very few decorations of the other types (such as air, cold, etc).',
       'When I first had it it was super fun. Then I saw a game I wanted so I deleted it I did that before and got it back I could log into facebook and go to my old island. But this time I could not. I was so far and looking forward to seeimg my dragons but it did not let me go to my old island. It left me im tears that I had to do what I did all over again. So I deleted this stupid game and gave this. If I could rate 0 I would',
       'its ok, and you might think you cant li e without it, but trust me.... after a while year of playing, which is what i have waited to wrote this review, the game play becomes very repetitive. sure try it out, its fun, but not something for the rest of your life. dont put money into it, you will regret ir later.' ,

      'Really fun.  But crashes constantly on my Galaxy S5.  Then I have to force stop the app, and restart my phone to get it working, for about 5 minutes....  All have to do to avoid ads is not restart until the respawn timer clears, so they aren\'t that bad, and it\'s really cheap to turn the ads off.  I would happily do so, it the app would run for more than 5 minutes.  If it wasn\'t for the crashing, I would rate it 4 stars at least.',
       'Love playing this game...very addictive! I would rate it 5* if there was a reason for why you level up and why you keep spinning for little lightening bolts when you do level up  as once you have bought the small amount on offer they are no longer needed. Add more things to buy and give the game a reason for levelling up 🤘🏼',
       'Smooth game. Plenty of fire ball options and endless level options but after every death you have to watch  15 second ad. EVERY DEATH. Which just spoils the experience and all. I understand ads but like after 3 deaths that\'s fine. But after every death and some are unskippable. So download of you have patience. It\'s worth it of you have time to spend',
       'A wonderful aesthetically pleasing game.  Get as far as you can, with as many points as you can while unlocking different fireballs and portals. I would love to see how this game evolves in the future and i have not seen as many ad\'s as people claim so perhaps that issue has been resolved? Working perfectly on S8+',
       'TOO MANY ADS, every time you die you get an ad and that\'s just being money hungry what ever happened to games without long ads what\'s the point if you\'re gonna make a game and 1/3 of the gameplay being ads. Perhaps every 10 or 20 games, or just have those small popup ads, but don\'t ruin the gameplay because you want money. I\'m uninstalling and I\'m sure other people are as well.',
       'I don\'t understand what is everyone\'s problem here. The developers are, like every other developer, trying to make money and you complain about ads in a free game? Well I\'ve had a lot of fun with this game and I will keep on playing it.' ,

It\'s fun af but I can\'t even play for a minute without the app stopping. Y\'all can download but 2 minutes from now ur gonna say "dang he told me so"',
       'Constantly force stopping. Cannot finish a game without the game closing on me.  Update: uninstalled and reinstalled game and did not fix the problem. Uninstalling until game is fixed. Other then that game has potential.  Update 2: after installing the game again, it finally worked. But now I\'m uninstalling the game for good.  After scoring over 7b points in 1 game, the game only gave me just over 2b points. Game is garbage. Do not download this game!',
       'Update 2/20/18: the game had an update again and now created even faster than before. It was 90% unplayable, now it\'s 100% unplayable.  Over a week after my initial review the game is still broken and has not been updated.   Loved game for the first week or so after I discovered it. Now it just crashes constantly no matter what I\'m doing in the game.',
       'The game is fixed so you can score more than 2.15 billion.  But you can bank anything over 2.15 billion still.  So I just wreck once I hit the 2.15.  About to uninstall unless the code is fixed to keep all the points you score.  Game is very addictive.',
       'Ok so there are two ways to fix the crashing and frequent ad problem. Simple way, just turn off your internet while playing. Second, disable the internet permission from app settings for permanent fix. No crash, no ads just a fun game. :-)',
       'In the last update you enabled the top score to go above 2.5 billion however the score to upgrade is still locked at 2.5 billion. My last game I scored 16 billion but I only had 2.5billion to spend on upgrades. Please fix' ,

       'One of the best games I have played on Google play. Or rather it is the best games  Cons: 1. There should be a storyline with this game like a real superhero(and not someone who helps bad guys too)something I found awkward.   2.The area is descent but please add the underground train terminal with some action there too. It will just take the area to a whole new level   3.There are no days and night. No whether change, nothing.   4. Add more fighting style for the protagonist.   5. Please add more buildings and the climbing up is lethargic.   Else it is a great 100 mb game. Keep it up!!!!!! 😎 😎 😎',
       'Actually i love GTA GAMES so i thaught it would be fun playing but its almost 3 weeks and i have completed all the mission.. And have nothing to do... So just uninstalling the game.... Waiting for more mission but could not find any so now uninstalling it... Ya it is quite a fun to play but quite difficult to handle the controls if ur new to this kind of game...',
       'Major problems with the Rope Hero games. ALL OF THEM. First problem: Leaving the game at all shuts it down completely; any quests you may have been in the middle of, will be dropped. Second: By tapping any of their many ads, you leave the game. Which in turn, shuts it down, and whatever you were in the middle of. Third: there are far too many ads. Anything you do? There will be an ad. Fourth: There are major grammar problems in any speech within the game. This shows a great neglect during the creation of the game.' ,

      'Honestly I think it\'s amazing that they sell this game for free because it is one of the best games I\'ve ever played in my life. It doesn\'t take any internet and the animals in details so good and the graphics. If you\'re ever bored you should download this game and play it all the time.',
       'Sometimes it feels like the difficulty of the levels is way off. Levels labeled "hard" or "super hard" are many times much easier than standard levels. I do enjoy the amount of unlimited lives given, and the speed at which lives are replenished, however. Overall, a good time-passer',
       'Guys, you have a glitch that needs fixed. Side game (right now the ignite game) causes app to close every time. Also... Inserting the gold in the piggy bank takes way too long. Speeding up that process or allowing a skip feature would be nice.',
       'It\'s been at least 3 or 4 weeks since I\'ve been able to accept any lives given by friends. For a game that has so many downloads, developers sure have an issue addressing mad fixing it. I\'ve list roughly 100 lives to this issue. Please fix it!!!',
       'I adore this game. However, I have had 7 gold bars for over a year and every time I win a level that awards lots of gold bars the game tells me my bank is full... even though everything costs at least 9 gold bars. According to my math I should have over 100 bars. I would settle for two at this point.',
       'Highly addictive. I love this game but there is one fault that it doesn\'t allow your device to enter sleep mode. I have ruined 2 phone screens with burnt in images because of this. I would fall asleep playing the game and when I wake up it\'s still on the screen.  I also don\'t understand why the special games are not offered on the Facebook game.' ,

      'A great time killer with well-written, diverse, and addicting stories. I\'m far from the first one to say this, but my one critique is how often diamonds are needed to make choices that are interesting/clearly crucial to the plot. I don\'t mind paying for diamonds or playing chapters of other stories to save up, but 20 diamonds should last longer than just one chapter. I suggest either introducing a subscription based option that frees up all choices for a one time or monthly fee or reducing the amount of diamonds needed to make a special choice. An alternative way of earning diamonds, such as watching ads, might be something to consider as well.',
       'The stories are great but to enjoy them properly, you have to spend diamonds. Free diamonds at the beginning is way too less (25 diamonds). And you earn 1 diamond per chapter, which is less because to make premium choices you have to spend so much more diamonds (min. 12 diamonds for a choice). And you have to make at least one premium choice per chapter. Buying the diamonds is way too expensive. I think the developers should allow users to earn more diamonds in the game. Maybe make them watch a video to earn free diamonds. That would certainly help...',
       'Really fun but I wish you gave us more than 2 keys. I\'m not going to spend actual money on a short story but I\'m sure a lot of others will, which is great for you but I think 2 keys is a little low since there are numerous chapters to play and many stories to choose from. Would be cool if you would match most other games and give us 5 keys for gameplay.',
       'Love the story lines, the graphics, all of it. Would have liked to seen something that can be done to regenerate the diamonds or do something to earn more diamonds other than finishing a new chapter earns you only one. Did experience my diamonds disappearing and the timer of keys along with the keys reach zero and not returning. Hope this issue will be resolved. Other than these issues really enjoyed the game, it\'s highly addictive.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a few days, so here\'s my review. I enjoy the stories even though they use a lot of archetypes, and I don\'t mind waiting for keys. The biggest issue I have is with the gems and premium choices: not only do the premium choices cost an unreasonably high amount of gems, but every time there are choice options with at least one premium choice, the premium choices are always presented as the better ones. This is less like making my own choices and more like reaffirming my assumption that the premium choices are always the better ones. I\'ve come to the conclusion that I would rather pay once to have this app installed rather than install it for free and pay money for gems just so I could pick the premium choices.',
       'i really love this game. but all of my saved games are gone and u still hasn\'t respond to my message. although i\'ve bought diamonds so many times. can u retrieve my account? \'cause i used the same one but now it\'s just all gone. and for the game i don\'t mind waiting 2 hours to get keys but i don\'t want to always spend my diamonds when it\'s so hard to get. like, we\'re just playing 1 chap and we only get 1 diamond, but we have to spend 20/25/30 to just pick one choice? like, what? i have to play 25 chap first just so i can choose 1 answer? and when i restart a story, we don\'t get a diamonds at all? but we have to spend 1 key to play it again? i think it isn\'t fair. \'cause i played all of the stories, and i need a diamonds but i don\'t get a diamonds when i restart a stories. please, make it easier for us who really loved this game to get diamonds. i really like this game tho. amazing script, amazing scene. i\'m giving u 2 \'cause i really wanted to play this game again but my saved in my account\'s all gone.' ,

      'Quick fire is the best but theres only one down fall, the seconds. When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..',
       'Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven\'t gotten very far yet. Thing I DON\'T like is you don\'t get an average..... IF you do, I\'ve yet to find where it is in the game. That\'s in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯',
       'It\'s a  fun game but it\'s rigged. I think if you have a billion chips you shouldn\'t be able to play on lower lanes. I thought you were supposed to be matched up with people who are the same or close level. How is it I\'m bowling against someone who is level 171 and 8 billion chips and  I\'m level 43 .',
       'Amazing.  It\'s just fun watching the bowling hall whizz by and get a strike.  I\'ve played and uninstalled this game, but the only reason for the uninstall part is storage.  For all of you who are new, try getting the ball between the front pin and either of the pins next to it, it usually gets strikes, but by strikes I mean doubles against level 7 Russians.',
       'This is a fun game however it allows people to cheat or it\'s rigged. It\'s no coincidence that the better I play the better my opponent plays. I think half the time we are playing a rigged computer. I spent $50 on this app in a week and I am deleting it now. Sorry crooked people that run this app.',
       'I have been playing for months and spent a fair bit of money on this app and also was enjoying playing until all of a sudden all the graphics went pink and now i cant play. Not happy!!! How do i fix it? Don\'t want to delete it really as i will loose all my chips and special balls. Someone help please !?!?' ,

      'I have only had the game a few hours and I am already falling in love with it. It is great to go on when you have a spare 10-15 minutes. The grid is larger than others so I can read the words fluently and quickly without them being hard to see. You get points after each time you complete the grid so if you are really stuck you can receive a hint for some points. I would highly recommend this excellent game.',
       'Only been playing for a few days now, and so far, I love it! Forgot how fun Word Search puzzles can be, and to have it on my phone is priceless lol.. No complaints with the app so far. I will say though, maybe they should tweak it just a tad, instead of giving a hint only after a short moment, possibly creating \'the option\' to have a hint may be a little better. Not a big deal to me. It truly is a great app, love the simplicity of the graphic design too. Glad I came across this game.',
       'I enjoy ALMOST the whole game, being a word find and all, simple, yet deceptively hard at times. Still, I wish there was a way to turn off the \'hints\' it gives, as they get annoying... unless there IS a way that I haven\'t discovered yet...otherwise, I REALLY like the game, and would suggest it to all ages, as it\'s not too tough for the young ones, but still challenging enough for experienced players.',
       'Pretty good word search game. It\'s sometimes hard to hit the right letters, especially toward the bottom of the screen. Occasionally words share more than one letter in common. Sometimes  (especially in the  lower levels) a word will show up more than  once in a puzzle. Maybe extra credit for finding a word that\'s not on the list?',
       'It\'s a good game but there needs to be a way to turn off hints. If you don\'t find a word in the time it thinks you should, it keeps giving hints which ruins the gameplay. I pause for various reasons like talking to someone, cat catching a mouse, watching tv at the time, etc.. Or sometimes it might take longer to fins a word than seconds allowed before the hint.',
       'I love this game. Really nice and well thought out game. It\'s educative too. But I have just one issue with it though: The flashing hint. This gets me distracted each time it flashes. Maybe there could be a hint button at the bottom of the puzzle. That way instead of it flashing and getting us distracted, we could just click on it whenever we need help. Apart from that, it\'s just perfect. Will give it a 5 when the flashing hint is worked on😁' ,

      'This  was really  fun! Starts off easy but gets harder, not near the ads of the  other games I have played. Takes extra words, hints are reasonable,  earning money is reasonable.  So far the best of the word connects !! Really happy with this game, will add to my phone  and get rid of the other word connect games that seem to have ad, after ad not to mention the high amount for hints! There is one reason I didn\'t  give it a 5, because some of the ads get stuck and you can\'t  exit,  overall  4.8!',
       'Child-friendly! And, as an adult? I love how am yet to see an advertisement. 😊  Unlike other word games like Word Connect, it also lets you find and play words that are not necessarily those found on the board, storing it in an "Extra" slot, which generates added points to your score, rather than telling you to choose the word that\'s only on the board.  ADDENDUM: After reading the comments, it appears there may be ads after all. Am yet to see any though. Perhaps because am still in a lower level.',
       'Not a bad time killer - quick paced and not too taxing on the brain. I wish it had a more comprehensive dictionary so you would still get bonus points for valid words like \'cad.\' No matter - still basically a four star, though almost three for the number of ads.',
       'Game is fun. But giving me pop ups to bring me back to the game while it\'s not open is a nono. Especially when it takes up half the screen. I\'d give 5 stars cause i had fun playong this, but this one thing is annoying. Especially with the amount of ads, it shows you just wanna push people to keep playing for that ad revenue. Won\'t be downloading any of your games after i delete this now.',
       'OK, this word game is the bomb! It actually uses words that I know! I have played so many word games that use strange words and won\'t take common words! Thank you, WePlay! I will be trying your other games and telling my friends about them!',
       'I turned off the notifications on this game and it still gives me pop ups that cover up anything else I\'m doing including navigation instructions while I\'m driving.  This is dangerous and unacceptable.  I can\'t be fiddling with a game while I\'m driving in a whiteout blizzard in the middle of the night.  Uninstall.' ,

      'I think it\'s a very fun game. But only thing I would like to see is maybe a market where you could put up duplicates for a price rather than having to trade with 25 million people just to find someone who is willing to buy. It kinda gets annoying when you\'re trying to sell some duplicates and all you find are cheap people who waste time. Also, there should be more packs being released because of how many cards there are. It\'s just too hard to find a card you\'re looking for, through trading. Secondly, if the market idea doesn\'t work there should be an option in which you can talk with the trader and/or be able to set a price of the duplicate you\'re trying to sell rather than wait for people to make unreasonable offers.',

       'Maybe add like a thing when u have like 10 81+ players packs open all button or something,annyoing opening 20 gold packs or any packs 1 by 1',
       'I think that this game and Pack opener of yours are best ones in those categories ... I have a question . When will Draft Building Challenges adds in android ? Thanks',
       'It\'s a great game and a virtual version of fifa 18. You will enjoy it as you are guaranteed good players. It\'s not just about the draft you can open packs and trade duplicates.',
       'Would have been 5 but there isn\'t any news about DBC for android and regular lightening rounds have not happened. Plus an open all packs button would be helpful.' ,

      'Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh',
       'I love the game but its frustrating when you have all 8 Spartans and the sword guys get in the way so maybe an extras set of controls to control where your men start or something. Also for me the screen keeps jumping I try to look at enemy and I catch a glimpse but then it jumps to my side then back again and again and again please fix this.',
       'I wish there were more commands. Like maybe you could command the miners to garrison while the rest of the troops guard. Also, redesign the swordwrath helmet. It looks like someone spray painted their hair gold and then glued jewels on it. I also wish there could be more types of zombies. The idea of endless is cool but please add the zombies to the campaign.',
       'This is one of the most awesome game of all time and thanks to the creators you can play it on mobile too. But it still lack some awesome components, 1. Add Chaos Empire, 2. Add multiplayer!!! Overall still AWESOME!!!',
       'You know,  its a shame because this is a fantastic game. There is ZERO balancing. The entire game is designed to force you into using gems and micro transactions to get past abnormally difficult gameplay walls.',
       'It\'s nice how you\'ve mashed together Stick War and Stick Empires together to make this masterpiece. I know its only meant to be a remake of the original Stick War, so I shouldn\'t expect too much updates, but it would be cool if there was multiplayer on Legacy. Keep the games coming!!!' ,

      'I love this game but I have a couple of requests 1st. Could you add u YouTuber skin back like boy,girl,animal then YouTuber 2nd. Could you add a button that you can press that alows you to make your own custom paint job for any vehicle that would be amazing 3rd. Can you make and road that ends come back into the city at the other side example the road behind the hospital 4th. Could add like 5 houses around the city that you can go into 5th. More vehicles   If you agree with what I have sead in this comment like so the developer can see!',
       'Ok I get it but why do the army kill you for no reason? I like this game because you can do roleplay and I\'m a girl and there is girl skins which is amazing but can you start with a girl skin and a boy skin to be fair with the girls  Pls do these. Love your company :-) but can you add a roleplay mode that would be great DO MORE:-) but now on my new tablet it won\'t let me play it please fix that and reply',
       'Good. However, the apple versioned platform overwhelms us by many advantages: They can earn coins and cash quicker n easier. They get options on what currency they use to purchase things. They get to higher leagues easier. Their weapon description overpasses ours as ours literally gives us damage and capacity whereas theirs comes with fire rate, trait etc.',
       'I love this game. But for the next update, u should give each skin there own special ability. Like the flash and hulk skins. Give the flash super speed, give hulk super strength and etc. So that everyone can get a different type of advantage. Plz make this happen next update also make a goku skin. So u can turn super saiyan. And have other transformation. So can u plz have every skin to have different abilities that match the skin',
       'I have been playing the game for 6 or 5 years and it has been the best game i have played. So, i  think you have to make this game better in the next update.Here r my suggestions 1 make the graphics better. 2 day and night shift. 3police attacks bandit in adventure mode.4 add a clan.  I hope u will add these in the next update.Also too many players that hacked their health so plz fix it.Thx',
       'Please get rid of the hackers that have unlimited money, health, ammo, jetpack fuel, and cause unlimited damage. Also I can\'t wait for another update, I\'m hoping for lots of new and cool things in the shop and new games. I also hope you guys continue to update for the holidays.' ,

      'Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.',
       'Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don\'t get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a "Create a Player" option under \'My Club\' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It\'d be so nice if you add that.',
       'I will love it if i can send players on loan and be paid some coins instead of directly selling them off. Also switching players for a few or no coins will be great. Since players like pogba likes changing his hairstyles, it will also be great to effect some changes in some players hairstyle. More leagues are needed, if possible, German,  Chinese, Nigerian and south African league. Lastly, commentators find it difficult to call the name of a created player, work on these and this game will be perfect.  Thanks',
       'Where\'s my coin? Last week my buy the coins and until now she didn\'t receive any coins. Earlier day, i buy the coins, because of offer that you have given, its was fine. Except for just now, i buy it because of i want to buy Alexis Sanchez, because of this matter, i have lost my chances to buy it. Connection was stable, and if it do so, you have to fix it. Otherwise refund back the money or in future, what would happen to your company?',
       'This Game is what all soccer fans around the world have been waiting for. It is fun and easy to play once you master the controls. The graphics are exciting and the gameplay fantastic. However there are some things i would like the dream league team to improve.  Rate at which coins accumulate is way to slow for the games played. Reward players with a free secret player for every division completed. Make the game slightly more difficult and improve Goal keepers.  Include some legendary teams like invicibles in the Elite division challenges. Overall great game.',
       'Very good game. There are lots of players but Manuel Neuer is missing. Some extra things need to be done for this game to become the top football game. German Clubs and many clubs of other countries like those of Poland, Denmark, etc. are missing. If these clubs are added, then the game becomes complete. Hope this changes are done by the "First Touch" as fast as possible.' ,

      'One of the best wwe games.. even better than immortals.. the difficulty level is always fair when competing with online rivals... gaining loot boxes is also perfect and  not very difficult... I obviously made some In app purchases so I could compete well... just wish to open a loot box and get 1 four star wrestler... things would get awesome I don\'t mind paying for it as well..',
       'STRENGTH : Nice game, wonderful graphics and commentary, great feature of versus and events mode. WEAKNESS : I have spinned loot cases many times but I never got a good superstar. So, purchasing a superstar by using gold or cash should be replaced instead of spinning. Another issue is we cannot remain as a wwe champion as there is no race for championship. Entrance should be added like wwe 2k has done.',

       'Game is good except for one thing. You gotta fix the "Versus" mode. How is it "fair" for me to be level 3 but for my first match online be put up against a level 12?? Makes no sense. Should be match making so you match up with someone close to your own level..',
       'Great game! But after the last update there are some bugs and the most annoying one is this: 4 stars Sting, Sting Deathlock, after you use this special the game freezes and you can\'t do anything. Please fix this! Again great game, but it needs some fixes!',
       'Love the game play, how ever the event cases and daily cases play you, I will stop it so it lands on a susperstar and then all of the sudden there is keys in between the superstar it should have landed on. Super shady. So because of that it\'s only a 3 star. C\'mon now...if someone is good enough to stop the wheel on a superstar don\'t play them.' ,

      'It\'s like Cooking Mama from the Wii, but you don\'t have to be accurate at all. There are SO many ads. I mean... They send you an ad like every 30 seconds or so! It\'s a lot. Good game four a you get crowd I think I because it\'s not really a strategy cooking game where you have to time manage and things. It had a decorating feature that I think kids would enjoy. Also, with that feature, a tablet would be better. Or if on a mobile, a stylis.',
       'Most of the things r automatic so I rate it 3 or 4 stars. Pls guys pls,pls I want u to make it nonautomatic so that we can play it properly .that\'s all I want to say about this game and most and things are locked these r the two things which I did not like about this game. So guys pls make it properly. Then I will rate it 5 stars for sure. One of the best game I have ever played. Thank u so much',
       'Nice game... everyone who love cooking should download it. But there is only one problem that the things which are the main are locked and we have to pay the real money or watch s 40 ad. For ex:- In the doll cake we don\'t have the doll so how are we going to bake it.Please fix this problem, otherwise the game is nice.',
       'At first, I was pleasantly suprised this came from TabTales. The lack of pay walls at the beginning is wonderful for their games. Though I\'m not very creative, the game demands it for making food. The graphics look great, gameplay is realistic. I was sad to see a paywal at the princess cake though. If you have 10 dollars and a young girl who loves to cook and bake, by all means buy it for her.',
       'This game is awesome!!!! It makes me go hungry every time I play it!!! The graphics are awesome and very realistic. I luv the fact that it is automatic so you don\'t have to waste your time in perfection... Please keep it automatic like this forever. P.S, for those who are worried about unlocking other stuff like the princess cake, etc. Well, don\'t be, you will get a chance to play it when you unlock the other new bakeries and when you also compete in the competitions.... 😉',
       'I love the game but it\'s not free.. I\'m not paying for the game and buying money through out the game... Pick one ppl, If it was 5 dollars less count me in but 10 no way! Sorry uninstall ed maybe when I check in again it will be free LOL' ,

      'I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.',
       'I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn\'t work.  So I pressed the \'X\' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I\'m pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE \'X\'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I\'m triggered.  Please fix that.',
       'I really, really love this game, but, I keep losing my ball count and I don\'t understand why this is happening. For instance, I have 90 balls and I\'m supposed to have 92, I don\'t get the 92. I will give 5 stars until the bug is fixed. The ads I don\'t care about because that only happens at the end of each game which is ok. Please fix this so I can give you 5 stars.  Update- I figured out why I keep losing my count with my balls. Everytime I get the balls by the number blocks, it wouldn\'t count them😐 I could get a lot further if this was fixed. If this keeps on happening, I\'m going to uninstall this game. I hope it doesn\'t come to that because I really love this game. Please fix asap!!',
       'If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.',
       'It\'s good at first but you\'ll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.',
       'Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I\'m not spoiling it, but I will tell you it\'s a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don\'t know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.' ,

      'this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It\'s a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that\'s it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame',
       'I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.',
       'Great game, addictive, in a good way. This is one of the few games that is addictive, but does not take up a large amount of your day, unlike some game (Clash Royale), I feel it\'s not Pay to Win. Great job guys, thanks for making an entertaining, relaxing, non time consuming, free to play and win game. Graphics can be bested.',
       'Funny characters, endearing cartoon aesthetic and enjoyable game play, but after a couple hunts forces you to wait over 8 minutes before you can actually play again (in order to entice you to pay to make the wait times go away). What kind of game compels you to QUIT out of BOREDOM after playing it for 5 minutes?',
       'Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn\'t came in two years it probably isn\'t. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don\'t pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges.',
       'Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.' ,

      'This game is nice but it is full of adds. the game started showing adds from its beginning. Even this game is not having much functions like changing gun and all. It seems that they are not focused on customer satisfaction,  they are only about earning money 💰 through adds and all.',
       'What a waste of time this is., before the game has even loaded am introduced to 3 forced Apps as Ads. I dont think the game is real just a Port Hole for Rubbish Ads that are only appealing to a demented blindman... Dont Waste Your Time With This One...',

      'I love this game but I found a bug, I don\'t know how exactly it happened but I was doing an extra task (a clown factory dice making one) I used auto clicker and was just holding one finder down and tapping to sell with the other. Now all of my factories have a die on each person\'s desk and it doesn\'t go away once sold. Other then that, great game and nice timewaster. :D',
       'It\'s fun building up stuff and I like how the game keeps playing even when closed.   One thing that annoys me, I try to watch the ads for free in game currencey, but most of the time either the ad crashes or the game is reset when I close the ad and I don\'t receive in-game currencey. Probably my potato Moto G5 doesn\'t have enough RAM. Another fingersoft game, HCR2 has the same concept and doesn\'t have this problem.',
       'What\'s the highest trophy you can get?  Every ten I get a new set of ten pops up.  I can see up to the 30th trophy now. Wonder if it goes higher sill',
       'The only thing I don\'t like about this app is the controls. You can\'t hold your finger to make production faster. You have to tap constantly. But other wise, it was a great app and I recommend it\'s',
       'I somewhat enjoyed this time wasting game until one of the characters (robots) I purchased for millions of coins just left, and sent me a picture to share with friends.  From there I had to spend another million coins to buy a human who had less skill.   Not worth playing a game that takes your hand earned characters away for no reason.',
       'It\'s a great time killer if you are waiting or have nothing to do. It does get boring after 3 and a half hours,but it\'s still good. Also way less and I mean way less ads than other games. Excuse my spelling and grammar, but you know what it means. (It\'s good)' ,

      'Great game, Love it! Very creative, fantastic graphics. Not so difficult or loss of life\'s to where you can\'t even play.  Yet still challenging.  Only negative is lots of ads. Would gladly pay nominal fee to get rid of them.',
       'A truly fun, interesting & free game. A good game for any age. If you need to do something relaxing, this is a good way. You\'ll get hooked!!! I\'m in the 500\'s & it\'s still fun! The ads only require 1 more touch on the screen than you have been doing. Well worth it.',
       'I really like this game but newer version I have updated to after 3 months and I see the Hooray Sound in the end and some more sounds in between has been changed to Ticking kind of sound.   I seriously and kindly request to the developer to restore those sounds which were there in old versions because I seriously loved it. I wish those sounds can come back which makes the game more amazing.   And ofcourse I still continue to play this and have hope for those sounds to be back.',
       'Love it !!! Caught my eye when I saw "pick 2" vs. pick 3. I\'m a stay at home mom kids in school 6 days week that gives me time to burn   (lol) They did a couple small tweeks which  made the "typical pick 3 concept"a thing of the past (FINALLY) BUT WAS ENOUGH change to make it a keeper',
       'Game is fine, ads are fine and can be avoided by not opening chests (not really needed to beat the levels) I\'m really hoping they increase in difficulty though, on level 50+ and that all seem to be fairly easy.',
       'Love love love this game. Ty for making it as it is. It\'s not hard like the rest but it holds you. It great to take your mind off life and you don\'t gotta think of anything. Great game on level 300 and my so is on like 430. Way to go.' ,

      'Until an update like 3-4 months ago everything was ok, you could chose between battle mode and stage mode, both were equaly rewarding, you wanted gold you went for battle mode, you wanted crystals you went for stage mode. Now stage mode is a joke, it\'s so hard that is not worth it. Please fix this, either increase the rewards or reduce the dificulty.  Also a good idea would be to add a market where you could sell/exchange materials for other materials.',
       'Game is completely balanced around p2w. Takes forever to get anywhere or do anything.  The world bosses are a joke,  they are once a day for a couple of minutes.  So basically hard to catch.  It\'s beyond a grindfest. Moving up and doing anything becomes more of a pain than in game fun',
       'In world raid dragon keeps hitting me all good then bang out of nowhere hits me again with 4000 health and I lose. What\'s up with this? Before the update its fine now I\'m dying like crazy from 4000 health to 0 in one hit doesn\'t make sense. FIX THIS PLEASE was lots of fun with new mode now dying real fast for tons of health lot less fun :(',
       'I loved Defender 2, but this game did not live up. They made it way more complicated than it needs to be for the kind of game it is. Feels more pay-to-win too than the other ones. Stick with Defender 2. Uninstalled by stage 11.',
       'I love this game and have made a purchase or two, but it drives me nuts that the game keeps crashing on me.  It turns the screen of the game and locks up, sometimes it comes back and sometimes I have to restart the phone.  I don\'t know what causes this but it\'s infuriating.  I tried to load the game on my tablet but the progress won\'t move over with it.',
       'Great game . Can\'t connect to world raid though. Please fix. Also prices get outta hand at higher levels. So I\'ve updated. More then once. Still can\'t get in world raid. Constant disconnect. Really disappointing' ,

      'Its a good game and i enjoy it but the graphics are bad because my game gliches and i dont know whats going on. Also i dont like having to pay to get the thinks and to many thinks are whach a vidio to get the thinks it takes to long so i dont l0play it that often. I hope u understand what I\'m going through please fix the game up a bit 😄',
       'What a nice game coco made, love the pair mode. Amazing ice skating moves too. But what i don\'t see from the app picture is the holiday (Christmas) items in the game? Other than that, make more gamez of this...😄😉👍👌💙',
       'Very dissatisfied... I unlocked almost everything I could through watching videos yesterday, and I open the game today and NOTHING is unlocked! So EVERY time you close the game you have to start over? No thanks! Good bye! YOU SUCK with your ad ridden games! Will not be downloading another of yours!',
       'Ok lmy phone then I fell asleep guess what they did they put the game a start over then what!!! Nope I ilwill not play one of games I will play Roblox and Roblox good fame but I still have cocoa and the point is that I can\'t delete it bye bye Coco',
       'I like the game but the ads are annoying and i dont like the face rhat we actually have to buy stuff for the game and put real money into something we are probably going to delete within the same month we got it. I think its a waste of money but the game is good i guess.',
       'This is clearly a game for young girls around 9-13 years of age. What money will the developer make from 9-13 year olds with no job? Nothing, hence the ads! Makes sence to me! The game play is good for this age group. If you find it boring then you are probably too old for this game.' ,

      'So I\'m changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it\'s a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I\'d rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!',
       'Scopely is the most greedy, disgusting company I have ever seen. The ads they have littered into the game play literally crash the game at least 4 times during a match. You will see about 10 ads on top of the crashing per game; you could be in mid roll and the ad will ruin it. So desperate for money.. Don\'t support scopelys terrible practices.',
       'Been playing and I love it very addictive.wish they actually give u the dice on scratch off cards.. in the tournament\'s and the showdown after getting so far, it\'s like they want let you win any more the computer wins every time and I don\'t think it\'s right when it want let you see the last roll of the apponement, and they always show computer beating you by 3 points but never shows the last roll.',
       'Its ok if you play against other people but if you play any of the challenges they have against the computer  you lose. They give so many days and you get nothing and have 0 across your board but the computer gas 3 plus yahtzees and over 300 points everytime. Not just 1 or 3 this is 32 times I\'ve played and it\'s happened. Just not worth it if you can\'t win a single challenge honestly. Update they have issues now when you play their computers you can be 150 points ahead of them and the computer magically wins with 1 roll',
       'Too many ads, basically requires you to buy dice. Literally the only way to ensure a win is to have dice for re-rolls. This wouldn\'t be a problem except you\'ll hardly ever win dice with the scratchers, and when you do it\'ll be one.  It\'s all a cash grab, and the ads every 3 or 4 rolls are intrusive, frequently locked in, and always very annoying. Gameplay itself is simple but just way too many ads.',
       'Dice Masters cheat. Games are rigged. Too many ads! I needed one 5. Rolled 9 times and not one. Dice Dog is very annoying!! Dice Prize Claw gives dice you already have! Played 10 times and gave me dice I already had 8 times. How dumb is that?!?' ,

      'Was an awesome game Very addictive game! Was well done.. until the update. Needs more pens and new themes as I have thousands of coins but nothing left to unlock. Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don\'t register as pineapple hits for the counters. There\'s a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it',
       'Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.',
       'Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.',
       'Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.',
       'BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn\'t have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What\'s bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I\'m not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game.',
       'How can I say this? I can not stop playing this!! Everytime I set a new and higher record I want to achieve and I only stop until I get there xD atm with 6400 coins and everything unlocked 😁😁 please release new content for months and months!! It will make me so happy! Thank you for this game.' ,

       'Fab game. Wish you could have the option of it fixing into place as it turns the entire cube (diagonal facing) but brilliant otherwise. Saved me buying a real 5x5 since its pretty much the same as solving my 4x4 and 3x3. I like the timer too great app 😁',
       'The controls is kind of hard because when you try to solve the 5 by 5 and up it thinks you are pressing something else at the same t8me',

       'The idea of the app is very nice, however, I am disappointed in the fact that the app requests to access my calls, contacts, and other data. I fail to see why is that necessary for a simple game like this. Moreover, when I listen to music and play the game, the ads come interrupting my music with their own. When I mute them and press X, the music on my phone stops completely, forcing me to leave the game and start the music again. Again, this is inconvenient for an app which I expected to be very simple.',

      'It\'s a best game on playstore!!! I play it lot of.. and it\'s my favourite game.. but one problem is that when i start multiplayer match it says sercer not found or server overloaded. But it doesent matter for much. I give all 5 star for best graphics, bedt controls, and also bestest weapons. I love this game. Thank you gameloft. We expect that you will keep developing games like modern combat. I am waiting anxiously for next series. Thank you.',
       'I had previously given this game a 1 star but for this update I\'m blown away by the network rectification aspect. The game runs butter smooth even after post FUP data speeds. The game is currently saturated with lvl 140 players with all the prestige weapons, so I\'d request you to bring about a balanced match making in the PvP based on their matching levels and introduce some welcome benefits for the returning players',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s by Gameloft so it\'s bound to be a good phone game. It\'s not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn\'t hold your hand but it\'s not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you\'re also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it\'s definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I\'m stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)',
       'This probably the best FPS game in the Play Store. Graphics, animations, music, voice actings everything in this game are awesome. 😊  The game runs in my phone in full 60 fps on Ultra-high settings. But sometimes it crashes without any reason and when I run the game again, it starts to verify game data. My phone is not rooted and I do believe the problem is not in my phone, it\'s a bug in the game. 😕  Overall, it\'s a great game. ☺️  Peace out. 🤘',
       'This game is awesome.  But plzzzz ban clone paragon  first plzz plzz plzz.  Every match i see 2 or three paragon...  And mc5 is best game so far... One more thing this game turn into pay to win i think so plzzz reduce  the pay to win system and in match give 40 to 50 credit 10 credit is very lowest credit  to unlock items.... So plzzzz ban paragon first and give extra free credit  resources to earn in multilayer match....',
       'This game use to be my life. I loved it. Until u ROBBED ME i had all the guns all amour, suits, badges and money. I was a very very old player and you just take my stuff.....that is not right. You need to fix something with my account!Will there be a Morden Combat 6?' ,

      'This game is so good. But only problem I\'m facing is that after playing some time I can\'t control my bike, it keeps on going one particular direction (left or right).Guys please fix this issue.',
       'Nobody can beat the game without expending money. This is horrible. At last levels , with the best bike and full upgraded situation , you cant beat the no traffic side missions. It is unfare. There is some sort of "you shall not pass!" situation at last levels. That was bad. Very bad.',
       'Must note this:- Controls are a little bit glitchy. Bikes automatically moves towards a side of a road and crashed.. Besides police and some cars are sucked up the whole race.. Make a little bit easy races....and remove line changeable vehicle and police cars...they are motherfu****s!!!!! Disgusting!!!! That\'s why I have to uninstall it...Damn it.. I was so close to end!!!',
       'I am not going to spend a dime to get further in the game. Therefore I will never be able to progress. I would rather spend money to buy the game up front so that I know how much I\'m going to have to spend. The way this game works who knows how much I\'ll have to spend to Beat It. Good bye...your game sucks.',
       'I\'m almost @ the end of level 4. There is no more races after. When are you adding more levels? Also Nitro should be more visible when being used. Rain stages are to noisy. Can hardly hear the bike engine & even after the race the rain noise still goes on',
       'Great game just a suggestion. Like racing fever I think it would be a good idea for a daily spin that maybe you could win cash or a free motorcycle like in racing fever when you win a free car or money I think it would be a great idea and most likely you will have more people downloading this game thanks a lot.

      'I downloaded this game and tested it. The controls are terrible, I can\'t even pick up the scissors. Parts of the hair I found out that you could not cut it. I don\'t have a clue why they made this game when it is this horrible. I don\'t recommend this game at all. My rating will say 1 star because there isn\'t a 0 star option. My true rating is 0 star.',
       ',okay it\'s just that when I play the game in like when I cut the hair and stuff and messes up on me like that!! It would be great if y\'all will fix the game and make it like more realistic and more funner and make the controls work better cuz I\'ll be awesome',
       'This is HORRIBLE because it is so hard to get the middle piece of hair!!!    I just wasted my whole morning playing this game. Its kind of fun, but really frustrading. I don\'t know if I spelled it right but you should not download it.',
       'It was hard to use in general and the graphics a bad. I wish it was more realistic. You don\'t even really get to choose where you cut.',
       'Oh my God this thing is so awesome and I love doing hair so this is so great for me message love it like I love doing hair. I don\'t know why is that it\'s to me like I love her hair like I just like doing here I mean it\'s pretty fun and I and I like getting cuz you\'re here but and then I don\'t like games that like tell you what they do what you can just turn it and everything yeah',
       'The worst game ever! When I tried to touch the scissor\'s several times it wouldn\'t work! I RECOMMEND YOU TO NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS APP BEACAUSE IT\'S A WASTE OF TIME!!!!' ,

      'not gonna mention too much ads, doesn\'t bother me so much. what bother me are words that dont belong in certain language ( specifically  Croatian here). PAZL isn\'t Croatian word for god sake. Lose too much time seeking that word to finish level ,I\'ve lost my nerves. and thats one of many. stupids',
       'I don\'t know how good is game on other languages but in Croatian it sucks. I\'m deleting this game because of constant repetition of non-existent words in Croatian language... Even all dialects included. I even purchased few times coins just to see which word is it and it wasn\'t Croatian.',
       'An ad after EVERY SINGLE TASK? Really? Too much for me, thanks. Otherwise, the game is fun, graphic is good, I like the variety of languages to choose from. Battery goes to hell while playing, even with sounds off - that\'s also an issue.',
       'Why so much ads??? Continuously during game and after each level two more fullscreen ads. And I can\'t pay without providing personal data. Very bad',
       'Okay app, would have given more points but waaaay too many adds. After each level  an add pops up which is very annoying.',
       'Excelent game, but I think that I found something which is not necessarily a bug, but it might be a design flaw. I am playing in eng. lang. and if I need to enter 2 similar words, in my case these were "oar" and "boar", application recognized later, longer word first, even if i entered "oar" first, but system rejected it as incorrect one...' ,

      'Love this game! How about pet machine which gives you a random pet when you use it? You could pay 500, 750 or 1000 gems to spin, and it will give you a new pet! There could be 51 pets, 20 common, 15 rare, 10 ultra rare, 5 legendary ones with super powerful attacks and one golden for fully upgrading the safe,pet food, plant and books! Some ideas for pets are zombie, noob, turret from  the portal series, a cloud and mini versions of the bosses! Thanks!!!!',

I hope to sell items / weapons in traders. features in lobby and main menu games are very boring. the more cool if every artata that has been in can. can in pairs skin + nick name. just enough for the addition of me.

      'So I am a major mobile gamer.  And I must say this game is awesome in a number of ways. My cons however is: arena battles are way too long.     : more clarification should be emphasize on "finish daily or unfurnished daily", I can\'t seem to understand when my daily is completed by looking at the daily chart.  : too much pay to play going on. Mix it up a little plz.   Pros. Great story line.            Epic fighting styles.             Awesome mounts.             Super clean graphics.              Will keep u entertained.',
       'Its a good game. One of the nicest mmorpg on the market right now. However, my only nitpick is the lack of customization of the characters. You get new armor but your actual appearance doesn\'t change except with outfits, but everyone has those so at the end of the day your character does not feel unique at all. The combat and navigation are on point though. Overall a good game but just lack of personal input.',
       'Man I gotta write this again &gt;~&lt;... The only thing u need to fix is the bug that doesn\'t allows you to see the characters... It really anoys me b/c I\'m a girl and only the boy characters are visible so please fix tgis in the next game update! That\'s the only bug that I have experienced! Anyways everyother thing is *AWESOME* btw my character is the puppeteer if that helps in something',
       'It sucks! Idk why it seems force close playing for 1-15sec and I got out if of game! FORCE CLOSE ALWAYS HAPPEN. First day I play the game I got no problem. But since 2nd day till now ALWAYS FORCE CLOSE! AND U GUYS SEEM DONT GIVE ANY RESPONSE TO THE REVIEWS. SUCKS!',
       'Apparently, my first review is gone. It was just a few minutes ago. So basically, I wanted to create a puppeteer but it does not show the avatar in the character creation screen. Same thing goes with the bounty hunter. I\'ve restarted the app, my phone, and re-installed the game. It\'s the same thing. I only see the scythe and shadow for the puppeteer and shadow for the bounty hunter. I\'m not gonna play this game until this issue is fixed.',
       'Kinda like this game....BUT why i cannot see my character?? I dont know what im doing,i just look at the shadow moving..how can i control it if i cannot even see my char?? Just moving and tap the skill without seeing what my char doin,might be not sooo very satisfied..will gve 5stars if this thing fix..would be enjoy if i can see my char fight back there..😒😒' ,

      'This game is fun, but it seems like there are tons of attempts to get you to buy stuff. Plus you can\'t get Panda as a character. But other than that this game is awesome. I don\'t know why on the Dude Perfect channel they advertise it as just for iPhone, but at the very end say it is also available for Android. I recommend this game. It is very fun',
       'This game was good  but could be better. I wish there was something other than just basketball. Like tennis, football, or something like that. Graphics were good. This game is addicting but it\'s hard to get past level 20 if you don\'t have Facebook. So I\'m stuck on trying to get enough stars to get through. Good but could be better',
       'This is a very well thought out game and I love the positive comments when I finally figure out the  way I need to go first so that the next shot is easier to get. Some of these shots are really difficult, if you don\'t get the right basket first. Anyway, I love the challenge. Y\'all got my vote. BEST GAME EVER. Thanks man. I love your guys\' creativity.',
       'Firstly to John J - I have never paid a cent to play this game and that is why I love this game!! I have been able to complete the whole game 210 levels without paying a dime! That\'s truly awesome! It has been challenging because in order to advance I needed to get 3 stars on all levels to open up the next level for free. Then of course you have the energy bar that runs out, but that\'s ok because it replenishes in reasonable time. I would run out and instead of paying money I would go check an email, or post on Facebook and before too long I\'m back playing a few more shots on dude perfect 2!! So easy, so cheap, so challenging and so much fun and so friggin awesome when you completed level in 3 stars!! I can\'t wait till the next section opens to see what they have in store for us. Thanks.',
       'This game is clearly set up for suckers to pay ridiculous amounts of money to play.   1. Energy bar--- really? 2. Constant ads some of which you have to watch. 3. Want coins? Watch their YouTube videos, get them more views, more money, more endorsements. 4. Don\'t worry, after about $100 you can have everything and probably still have ads. 5. If you can get past all the BS posted above, after about level 35, this game gets so freaking hard that you cannot derive any fun nor entertainment at all.  These guys are entertaining but this game by the devs is clearly set up for money and sucking the entertainment value right out of what could be a fun game.',
       'Would be better if you could do everything without Facebook cos that sorta limits options for some people. Also could you please get rid of the energy bar? That makes things hard. But like that you put your actual voice in it.' ,
    recentChanges:  '- New levels.', '- Bug fixes and general improvements.' ,

      'Amazing game. Me and my friend spend hours on it. I get to shows him my mods. He has none though we both have completed the levels. The game NEVER AND I REPEAT NEVER gets boring. Definitely better than the angry birds series must download. The only problome is the metal flap things don\'t work correctly. They just float in midair.Apart from that  Please make a new selection of levels. My life depends on it!!!!',
       'I would give it a higher rating, but on those levels like 6-18. The button activated doors and platforms don\'t work right and they glitch out. I\'ve been able to get through a few levels without the doors but on 6-18 you can\'t complete the level without this door working. Please get this fixed',
       'Very disappointed that I\'ve had no response to my email and that there is no sign of a fix to the bug with El Porkado, rendering the levels uncompletable. Wouldn\'t be so bad if you didn\'t have some of my actual money!',
       'The game is really good but the bridge bug is annoying. I got stuck on a level and tried to reinstall the app but it did not work. It is so annoying that a really good game like this has a bug that prevents you from finishing the game. Oh and also, what is different about the HD version? It seems to be the exacted same.',
       'Generally great, but destroyed by graphics/world modeling glitches that render levels impossible to complete! Generally involving trap doors that aren\'t in the right place. Frustrating. AND the new cake race won\'t unlock rewards- 24000 hrs to go apparently so I can\'t play more levels.',
       'This game is still my favourite, since I first played it. BTW can you fix the glitches in The Road To El Porkado which where the grey moving panels are out of position' ,

      'I never pay for supplies in these types of games but with this one there\'s no point in playing anymore if I don\'t. You simply can\'t earn enough coins to keep playing. Additionally their ratios for resources are all over the place. I often found it didn\'t make sense to use the "higher" option when a lower faster option was more cost effective. I will be deleting now at level 6',
       'It glitches too much.  To actually beat any islands, you have to spend money.  I think that you should make it possible to play without spending money',
       'Too much waiting if you\'re broke. I was expecting to find the brain teasers advertised on Facebook, but it\'s more like Minecraft except it costs something to do most functions. I do enjoy the storylines, but it takes forever to get through them.',
       'It\'s definitely an adorable game and is one of the few games of this kind that has reasonable "waiting" times for stuff! :)  Sadly... There\'s one Major issue I have with the game and it is the constant notification to link Facebook with the game, which of course also has some great rewards locked behind it as well. :P I don\'t have a Facebook profile and it\'s incredibly unfortunate that there\'s no other alternative to choose (especially when there\'s plenty to choose from these days) Those are the reasons why I rate only three stars.',
       'Great game, shame is so heavy on the pay to progress.  Everything takes far to looking and not enough storage.  The option to build a stiff warehouse would be great.  Otherwise fun and engaging.',

      'Very realistic and nice game. Missions and descriptions are entertaining. Controls are also great.   Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!',
       'Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!',
       'Its quite good but a little bit of fixing will do. The part "Slow Down thing" can you please please place that where it can not block the view of the player. It is very difficult to see whats behind it so it causes us players to crash. T.Y',
       'Great game but more issues to address.  The longer flight durations are a real waste of time,  make them more challenging rather than waiting for the destination. Also add more controls as the ones we have are not effective. How do you tell me to slow down yet i don\'t have the option for that?',
       'Why the hell they add brake when we cannot see the brake option even after landing which forces us to crash. Total stupidity do not waste time in downloading. Previously was better when there were no brakes just reverse it and stop or keep brake button always active.',
       'Its really boring... You have to do missions you cant just fly around and do whatever you have to fly through the squares and make it to the end... And who wants stripes?! Why are they so important?! Plus its really hard to control!!' ,

      'Cross platform across Apple and Android and PC makes this game a fluid joy to play, without the feeling of a toned down mobile port - due to its 1:1 experience from the PC. It\'s the only Blizzard game u can play on Mobile. I\'m a legend (highest skill tier) ranked and totally F2P so the people who say this game is pay to win or random luck do not understand the game. Paying for is meant for helping you finish your collection fast. Overall highly recommended.',
       'Lots of fun over and over again. It doesn\'t get boring because of all the expansion updates that keep coming up. You need to readjust your decks to adapt with the new cards that get released. Didn\'t give it a full 5 because of the lag and graphic issues that keep coming up for me and others of the forums.               Playing on a Note 5',
       'I used to play the old tcg and this not  close to be a good card game. All it is is monster with power, moslty no spell, no artifact, no nothing. This game is boring and is lagging so much on the cellphone. Shadowverse is ways better for a similar formula, has a really good storyline and a waaaaay more generous. When you buy card for HS you get mostly nothing. They had the chance to do something good, everyone love the lore of warcraft, but they BS it.',
       'No way to begin the game without being decimated by cards I never see available to a new player.  Just geared toward getting me to spend money to HOPE to be able to learn and entice me to spend some cash.  Captive audience I guess..seemed fun but without spending money there is no way to battle other players to progress.   Even the quests are too hard to gain enough.  Just like WoW, which I couldn\'t keep up with monetarily for computer upgrades, good idea but not for the masses, only for the people without bills and responsibility.',
       'There\'s apparently no coming back to this game. If you stop playing for a bit and come back you\'ll never be able to catch up. I\'ve tried building decks but everyone playing has the best cards already and unless I buy card packs I\'ll never catch up.',
       'What the hell? I played this game about 2-3 years ago and i really liked it (on that time). But now when i came back I just can\'t win anyone. I tried to win on rank 25 about 10 times. There always players with full deck of legendary/epic cards, 25 RANK, DAMN!' ,

      'Spin my ride No more speed, I\'m almost there! Gotta keep cool, now gotta take care. Last car to pass, here I go! As the line of cars are going so slow! 5 star rad! Gotta get back to the game, all. See ya....Speed thrills!',
       'Can one also be able yo take turns??  I dont like it straight all the way to nowere. And brake should be fully efective one should STOP anytime he wants and also dont sale cars it should just be affordable by coins  Its really a gr8 game but only a little more work.',
       'Ok..but needs work No challenge n no real upgrade kinda wasting my time. And what\'s up with this buying the last car, there\'s no horn and way to keep the player interested that is why give it only three stars now if you fix it maybe I\'ll give give stars😶😴😴😴',
       'The game itself is very fun to play and very entertaining, however, the points system is a bit off. The reason for that is it not about the distant (which I like about) it about how many overtake you can take in a single game. That is what I dislike about this game. Also the cars... Not a lot of cars (need more). Few questions: Will there be such thing as upgrade speed or car customization? Will there be special event like special map that the highest rank get some kind of reward? And lastly will there be a competition of ranking ?  If all the that happening in the future this game definitely deserved 5 stars .',
       'Basic. You have to over take cars... That\'s it. When they talk about the physics being like simulation they are lieing. Left right go stop. Poor 16bit sound that you will want to turn off. It\'s like a game from the 80s. Uninstall.',
       'The game is very good but I really wish if the score is for the overtakes as well as the high speed that will be a lot better. I swear this game will blow up if you just added the high speed score. Also, I wish if there were more cars. That would be really interesting. I really hope that you listen to me' ,

      'I absolutely love this game. It\'s so addictive and a really good game if your bored. I\'m really curious to find out what happens when you have collected all the balls, does the game just carry on or is their more challenges?? Overall, this game gets five stars from me 😚',
       'Its a really good game. The only thing is, that I wish there was maybe some instructions that appear at the beginning, because I didnt know that you couldnt hit the black lumps etc. Maybe if you add little phrases that say what to do and not to do, then it would be almost perfect.',
       'Great time killer I love everything about it and it is a great game to wake up to. The only down side is that you fall off the ledge and that makes it harder to dodge the black. Everything else is 5 stars so that is what I think about roller coaster.',
       'Its really fun and addictive. Awesome game play and good for passing time. Not always so friendly to my battery and too many adds. Other than those little hick ups I absolutely love it.',
       'This game is amazing! It is addicting and fun to play!! The only thing is that I was hoping for some sort of introduction to the game, to tell me how to play etc. Also, I was hoping to be able to choose what kind of ball i use, the black one is plain and kind of boring. But overall its an amazing game!!',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH   I love this game because it is exciting and addictive, it has easy controls and it is so many different colors as you move on and on! Try to beat the next high scores and HAVE AS MUCH FUN AS I DID' ,

       'This game was actually better than I thought. I thought it was going to be one of those stupid games where it has a stupid amount of ads and stuff, but it was quite good. Unfortunately I had to uninstall this game (I\'m sorry Train Depo!) Because it I already have loads of games. This is a good game and I also love the way that you get loads of money when you go to loads of stations at a park. The only thing is I managed to upgrade all of the stuff for the coaster and don\'t know what to do with it. Other than that, it\'s good',

      'If there is anything that would make me quit playing this game, it would be ads. I don\'t mind ads but ads are just way too much and take away the fun of this game.  Apart from that game also freezes sometimes and there are some glitches too.',
       'Great game. Only after the latest update, it stopped registering my race wins and best times and although I did win many, they\'re not marked with a star and I can\'t move any level up.',
       'Really fun game. Lots of levels. Really like tournament and duels. I feel like there\'s some cheating in the tournaments. When I watch the videos some people seem to not be touching the ground. That\'s pretty lame. Other than that great game',
       'That\'s crazy you allow hackers to have the highest score and also show the video. Say that person isn\'t cheating and I\'ll show you a video where he shows how he does it. A-hole.',
       'Fun...until you had to beat an opponent to proceed to next level. These opponents are too much of a jump up on the difficulty of that level. So can\'t pass...no longer fun...uninstalling',
       'Have a problem touching the multi-tasking button Wichita spawn commercials while I\'m racing. And it\'s my favorite game. Thanks' ,

       'Filled with bots, there are very few real people I face, its far to easy because of this. I\'ve taken the whole arena 5+ times with ease. At least have the bots use bot as part of their name.',
       'Too many bots and the game keeps asking me to give it more access to my phone than it really needs to run.   Other than that it is fun.  If they fixed these issues it would be 5 stars.',
       'Okay so I like it.I mean I know I know it  could have been better, but I\'m going to be good with everything I say. If there is reality, this is what it would be: this is the worst app in the world! I hate it so much you,can\'t do anything with it it\'s just a boring junk app ,but that\'s not true I really like it just saying it could have been better!',
       'bug in goal: kill 8 total players outside your base. i can kill many with me and them iutside my base. plus i cant find someone that is not suicidal. are they all bots? or can you seed us based on average or max score, or percent?',

      'I have enjoyed this game immensely up until level 240. In this level, rated HARD, there are most often no options to make strings and you\'re stuck with only strings of 3 of just plain air. When you see the game itself changing the color of treats several times during one game to give you a move, you know you\'re not imagining that this level is designed to screw you over into making fruitless purchases to overcome it.',
       'Great game but it continually crashes and freezes and you have to force stop the app to get it working again. Seems to happen when the ads pop up, please fix this! **update - this is getting worse! Every time i lose or win a level the game crashes and I have to force stop',
       'All other games I switch sound and music off as I cannot stand it. Thus one I have left it on as it isn\'t as aggravating as the others.',
       'I love this game so much! It\'s so much fun to play when it\'s like there\'s nothing else to do so you can just play this! It\'s awesome and if you don\'t like it then well you are very weird and have bad taste in games',

      'Very cute and addictive. Loved it. It is somewhat similar to Talking Tom Gold Run. It would be better if you add some moving things like rolling snowball, fruit, candy, etc. Over some things the girls can jump but in some things they will crash like in other running games. Here\'s also a good point that we can buy puppies and girls from game money and not real money. Add more things which help us in running. Make racing also with other players from all over the world. It is in Talking Tom Gold Run. Also make a feature that with coins we can build the girls\' dream house like in Talking Tom Gold Run. Good game.',
       'I think its awesome. Tho I had one about 1 month ago and everytime it saved it, but this time it didn\'t. I had all strawberry shortcake characters. Not her friends. But now I only have the regular strawberry shortcake. I think it was because it was in a long time. But other than that I give ☆☆☆☆☆ stars. Please download!',
       'Great fun game. Similar to Super Mario Run. Pretty graphics. My daughter likes the sticker packs. Some variety in obstacles and tasks would be a great addition to the game. The free parts of the game are fantastic. Additional characters/pets are a bit pricey.',
       'My little girl (and myself) have been playing this game for a few years and love it. We\'re both disappointed that now the purple sticker packs have repeat stickers in them to sell. We used to get a new sticker after completing the daily challenges but not anymore. I don\'t think that\'s fair that she\'s gotten so close to finishing the sticker books to not be able to earn new stickers anymore. We\'ll probably uninstall now.',
       'If this took you so long to make the graphics then they look pretty good because when I bumbed my head then it had like pins on the desk I liked it so much BTW I don\'t care about that we need to pay real money I deal with it',
       'Graphics are bad. Gameplay is okay, although only a small child wpuld play this with enjoyment.' ,

I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.',
       'It\'s a fun game. If you\'re a COD player you\'ll love it. In general It does good on it\'s own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It\'s good that there\'s a grind to get them but I think it\'s a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.',
       'I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to "rent" which is an option in the game.',
       'Good game. Needs a seeding system. Getting bored of being killed by players 10-15 levels above me. Spawn points need looking at too. Keeps respawning at the same point I just died at. There appears to be some hacked players too. Just shot 1 guy 7 times in the head and he took it and shot me back once which was enough to kill me',
       'So many people using modified apk to paly... Very few gamers playing ethically.. makers must do something about it.    New update is not stable.  After Every 5 min. It shows that my wifi got disconnected, though my wifi is already connected. Didnt face any problem like this in Previous version.',
       'World War Heroes looks like it will be a great game.  It combines the auto aim feature of Guns of Boom with the realistic setting of WWII.  So far gameplay has been good, some lag in a couple of matches but overall works good. Definitely worth trying if you are into WWII FPS games.' ,

      'To many ads, and if you insist on all the red toy cats and spikes then you need to give free revives. And seems to me that on every new level  the mouse gets slower and the cats get faster. I thought this was a good game for children but if you make it to hard for them then they will not want to play it.',
       'It will not even let you get through the school portion of the game. Starts glitching at 7 in the school portion. Didn\'t even get to play the game that is so BAD, really glad didn\'t pay for anything',
       'I can\'t get the knack for controlling Jerry. He\'s sooooo slowwwww and Tom is so very FAST!  Very difficult to get very far past the School level.  Need more transport holes or vases and plants to hide behind. So many great comments, it\'s baffling to me.  Wish I  knew the tricks to get as far as a lot of the reviewers do.  Looks like it COULD BE A FUN GAME, but in present form, it\'s too challenging for me.  Bummer. Guess I\'ll have to uninstall it.',
       'Very bad game.I hate it i think i have to uninstall it.Jerry is very slow & tom is very fast.Need to improve this game make more bushes & vase to hide.This game is good for children but if you make it so hard they won\'t play it.There r two Toms make it one.Improve this game.Really.😡😡and too much of ads.Hated it.',

       'Good but buggy Good but buggy, one can earn infinite money in no time then u can upgrade ur vehicle to the max in the very first level. That destroys the fun of the game. Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.',

It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can\'t just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...',

I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don\'t read it before. I can\'t find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....',

      'Game became sluggish after update, the pads sounds only occur a few millisecinds afyer touching but its a noticeable difference. Makes all songs sound terrible. Sounds often mash together eg. In otherside, when you play the bass and guitar together, the bass becomes boosted and makes a sound as if a speaker is put too loud',
       'Some bugs and problems. It keeps saying "no space left on the device" even though I deleted some apps, tried to clear the cache and move the app to the sd card, still no enough, pls fix this. I going reinstall it though see if it fix. Also add more features and option to fits. By the way the device I\'m using is Samsung 355 4:3 screen ratio, 16 gb storage expandable',
       'Was good at the first... But.. When i create a  kit a cant hear anything even when i cut a part from my song i can\'t hear.... Can you  please fix the problem (my phone is oppo f3+',
       'Okay i will give 5 stars but please fix the problem that it will say like. There is no space left on the device? Why the hell tho. I got 2 gb of space left. Cmon. Please fix this i love the music guys there\'s no doubt but please fix this.',

      'Several times now I\'ve tried to type in a logo name and the app has told me I got it wrong but I thought it was right and couldn\'t see why I was being told I was wrong. So I hit "solve" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I\'ve recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you\'ve ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?',
       'First Level at Barbie and Twitter, even if type the words correct, the app tells me that there\'s a mistake. Solve shows me exactly the same word I\'ve typed in before',
       'Not a bad game, but would be great if you could simply type the name down, instead of slowly searching for each individual letter. Makes it all sluggish and takes away the fluidity of the game.',
       'Several times I have tried to use a hint and it  wouldn\'t take it off and it was difficult and easy. When I type in the logo it would tell me I\'m wrong then I hit solve and it was the same thing I wrote also and if people don\'t know some of the logos what is the point of the game.',
       'It\'s too easy to amass a huge number of hints and use them. I\'d like not to be able to complete every level without doing some online searches.',
       'This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further.' ,

      'REMOVE TANKS AND ARMOURED SUVS   The game is amazing. All the guns are balanced but there is one big problem... It\'s the TANKS and the SUVS   or make it a banable offence because all people do is camp in the last circle with a tank or a suv. Please fix this and I will rate 5 stars. And I know this is meant to be a minecraft version of pubg but pubg never had tanks or armoured suvs so please fix it. And is it just me but some of the players feel like bots. 😂',
       'Problem I have is that it promotes multiplayer use, but you cannot tell who is an actual player or an AI, there is no chat system like it says, and half of anything it talks about is unavailable in the game. The concept itself is great, the game itself is a great time waster, but I have to call it out on its false advertisement.   Now, if I may have been mistaken, someone please correct me, but so far as I can see there is nothing in the game that suggests multiplayer capabilities.',
       'Way to many ads. Ad to get to homescreen ad to get to waiting area, ad to get to arena. On top of that kept jumping back to homescreen and loading another ad instead of going to waiting area. Uninstalled, a shame because it seemed quite good.',
       'This game is so fun! I didn\'t expect it to be so good. I imagined that this would be like any other game remake, you know, a lot of glitches, bad graphics, and very high sensitivity. But, to my surprise, it was not like that at all. It was better than expected. I\'m going to be playing this game for a long time. I\'ll tell you that much!   This game is an instant🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟!!! - Andrew from Roboticfalcon21 Reviews',
       'All in all good game but only one major proble is too many ads.  Edit : uninstalled because my upgrades didn\'t stayed upgraded it massed up 🖕 my dopamine level.',
       'Overall it is a great game, but the controls are horrible. A lot of times, the game just won\'t let me move. I can\'t count how many times I have lost a game because of the controls messing up. Also, are the other players bots?' ,

      'The gas traps are way to op. No point in trying to get to the cab, when infected, you die in 3 seconds flat, no way to get rid of it. Alot of thief bugs, such as air support doesn\'t called in when used medkits when used are ignored. And about 50%chance it will not pick up cash from a downed friend. Fun game, just needs some tweaking. Update:it wont let you diffuse the bomb on a fellow thiefs back, even if you spam click it as soon as he grabs it. Edit: speed shoes impossible to hit, super fast cooldown. Cheap. Heres an update for you. Later ranks, snipers are dominate. Rifles take one blow to the body and your dead, level ups dont up your health. Not worth it',
       'It like everything else but I hate that we don\'t get gold from anything and that the sniper rifles and that the bags for the thives cost too much and i will love that the cases we get take less time and have even more slots for even more cases',
       'Update: server crashes alot ,its really hard to reach top 3 rank those player aare pay to win player plus the market sucks',
       'i am go to unistall the game bcoz please check me its not possible my ranking is 09 iam in 25 th level and i can\'t shoot bankers  5 to 6 time to kill bankers how can i kill 4 bankers and snipers kill me only one time shoot  how i archive? first place waste of time   & waste of anything. dot reply fast 😠😠😬   Customer care support was not good ... Irritating me. Not only me',
       'This game is so fun, it involves strategy and shooting. Who doesn\'t love those two things in a game!?',
       'As the updates made balances to the game everything is perfect, but feel bad for lower levels going against higher during ranked matches.' ,

      'I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the "mine" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it\'s nicely done!',
       'I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.',
       'Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it\'s just my phone. Also I\'m not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)',
       'Overall the app is really great. It\'s the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you\'re not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.',
       'One of my favorite games ever!  I am glad to see it available for my phone!!!  However:  I do not like the constant switching between marking a flag and clearing a space, because I keep blowing up mines I am trying to mark, from being in the wrong mode.  A tutorial to explain the settings and the flag/clear switch would be nice.  Using a long press to flag a space and a tap to clear it would be even better.  I would like to be able to set the bomb number myself.',
       'While this certainly is minesweeper, there are some serious design flaws. First off, when you click the first cell the board does not seem to generate around that, meaning that 80% of games on medium you will loose randomly opening squares trying to get a start. Hard mode is literally unplayable, as the mines are so dense it turns into a guessing game. There are better minesweeper apps out there.' ,

      'Doesn\'t like this new update. It ruin my gameplay. My hired buddies is not working at all. I manually put the toppings on the pizza. I did buy all the upgrades before the update. Now i earn less than before. Hope you bring back the one tap auto  toppings. Oh and I\'m glad that you didn\'t remove the auto slice buddy. It\'s the only upgrade that helps you slice better, not "MANUALLY".',
       'While I was playing, my phone battery died and my phone shut off. After turning my phone back on, I now can\'t open the app. When I click on the shortcut, it opens up a black screen for a few seconds and then exits it the app completely and I get a notification saying "Pizza has stopped" it\'s done this a dozen or so times now even after waiting a day. I would just uninstall and reinstall, but I\'m scared I\'ll lose my progress. If my progress is saved to my Google play account, will I be able to get it back?',
       'This is best game . Simple and challenging. Difficulty is too high but I managed to figure the real answers and it became good ovenist but to arrange the pizza very well it needs artistic skills.',

       'Game was working fine until I got to day 40. Every time the day ends, the screen goes black, and then the app crashes and I have to do the same day over again. Please fix',

      'This game has highly disappointed me.  It was super fun and interactive at first then it gives you the option to pay to continue to play or to complete free offers to unlock the game for free.  I have found that you can complete as many offers ad you want but the game won\'t ever unlock and emailing the support web site doesn\'t do any good either. They don\'t ever respond and it is a complete waste of time.  Don\'t waste your time on this game.  Go out and find yourself something worth playing because this surely isn\'t it.',
       'DO NOT DOWNLOAD CAN NOT BE COMPLETED DUE TO A BUG!!!!!!  After buying you eventually get to the accordion level just before leaving the prison roof only for one (or 2 on some phones) ball being outside the play area which makes the mini game impossible.  Many reviews all over the internet highlighting this bug but the developer has not bothered to fix it.  AVOID THIS DEVELOPER !!!!!!!!!!',
       'It was super fun and interactive at first then it gives you the option to pay to continue to play or to complete free offers to unlock the game for free.I tried  to complete many offers such as surveys, installing a playing another game for certain level, but this game never unlocked no matter what! They don\'t ever respond and it is a complete waste of time. This game has highly disappointed me.',
       'On a serious note, you need to give me this game for free. I downloaded and played two different games to get the game for free and 5 hours later I still don\'t have the full game. I\'ve had to install 5 different games just to get this one for free and I STILL don\'t have the full game. I\'m not impressed!!!',
       'Game is ok.  Tasks are sometimes unclear.  After a few tasks you have to pay to keep going or complete some offer.  Tried several times, but never lets me continue.  Should say it\'s a trial version in description.  No clue how it got a 4+ star rating.',
       'Game would have been ok, however I got to a point where you have to either complete an offer or pay to continue with the game. I completed 2 separate offers and was still unable to continue the game, after which I contacted someone about this several days ago and have yet to hear back or be able to continue with game, very dissatisfied. Horrible customer service.' ,

      'This game is not that bad but I agree with  Jeffrey  Wu apart from the second point.I really like where you can see your enemies.1. I\'m still with  either 4 or 3 aliens pls include all he 10 aliens.2.These aliens r kind of weak because I can\'t get even 6 aliens Pls producers u shouldn\'t make the game  more worse',
       'Everything wrong with the game 1. No Ar 2. Only 4 aliens (Please add XLR8)  3. No Transform button Everything right about the game 1. Graphics are ok 2. You can turn into aliens (Only 4 tho)  3. You can battle So it\'s a decent game, Just a few things you need to fix.',
       'Ben 10 is awesome.But there is a problem here.I played as Four Arms and I activated the yellow and white ball and after that I can\'t even use his powers!!FOREVER!!!(Okay maybe not forever but sometimes this happens)',
       'Hello this game was..nice... but onething that we all need more alien characters... and need more levels... and i believe that u cab bring some aliens.. to this game... and please add all the ben 10 aliens.. plss ..and give update.. and we all sure to update',
       'THIS IS VERY BORING GAME  pta nhi kaha se aaja he hai isme sort 4 alien hai stuck',

      'This game is dope I play it all the time! Alot of ads but I may just pay the 3 bucks to remove them. Only thing I would request is maybe an option to view the race stats at the end of each race. to see who we raced and their times rather than just a quick glance. So say I beat a high ranked player I\'d like something to show for it. Besides that I love this game!',
       'This game was worth 5 stars until the updates... More than half the time i try to connect to a race its doesn\'t work and doesn\'t give me back the 20 energy it requires to race. Also, I watched 50 videos to get the new car BLADE and i received absolutely NOTHING!!!! Until they fix this issue its getting a 1 star from me.',
       'So first of all way too many ads... When you click race you get Frozen and then sent to home screen and you lose your fuel... When you\'re "waiting on players" and they don\'t show up you lose fuel.. out of 10 attempts to start a race I play one',
       'I really like this game when it actually lets you play it. It has so many connection issues that most the time it wont let you race it just takes your fuel and kicks you back to the main screen. Very frustrating',
       'Still a lot of problems with the game even after the update. Nothing like watching colours go by as my race finishes. Somehow manage to watch the "crowd" most races. Hate finishing 1st and getting 3 medals in events, then finishing last to pickup 400+ a game designed for awful gamers',
       'I enjoy the game. My only concern is the regular bombing out of the game just before a race. It\'s irritating. And you end up losing energy as if one actually raced. Just fix it then I would be able to turn a blind eye to the constant adverts. I know you need to be paid too.' ,

      'It\'s a great game fun to play. But you should also have some mini games to like where you have to stack the food or swipe bad items off the table. And you need to have more mysteries out as soon as possible because I was really getting into the game n I didn\'t have anymore to play',
       'Game was quite easy since I\'m a teenager and its geared towards kids, but I still found it enjoyable. More levels need to be added. Maybe even unlimited mini game mode where you try for high scores. Not the hidden objects one but the one where you stack food and also the eating food one. The game crashed a couple times on me and froze but it was fixable by closing it and going back in.',
       'BEST app EVER made for mobile gaming! I personally can\'t thank you enough for making this game! It doesn\'t even need the stupid IMHO energy to play! You can just play forever :) The only "bad" thing i think its the "poor" voice over! It has all the quotes for all gang members but i just wanted to hear all the captions written in the script with their voices. Other than that it\'s the best game ever played on my cellphone. &lt;3',
       'It\'s cute. The tapping could use work. I would tap where an object was and it would take off seconds. Frustrating. When are more levels coming?',
       'This is a find objects game for kids. The objects are always the same. They change size and lighting, which changes the color making some objects near impossible to spot. The worst part of the game is the controls. Spacing of objects is often behind another object when you try to click on the object behind you are penalized for selecting the object in front. Also other challenges require swiping accurately and quickly but the interface is to slow making gameplay futile. The story is irrelevant and annoying. The voices are few and not all great. Music is unnoticeable. This should be cool and iconic like the cartoon. Instead it seems quickly thrown togetherm',
       'Had fun playing BUT only has a couple of levels! Would  be nice to have more levels SOON! Hate to have to delete game! Will not reload.' ,

      'Potential to be a great game but wayyyy to many ads, like every 10 seconds of gameplay there\'s a 30 second ad, and when you choose to watch an ad to get a reward you never actually get it. Waste of time. No idol earnings so you have to have the app open to advance and forces you to watch more ads.i get you want to make money but this app is basically unplayable.',
       'The game itself is good but seriously the devs are so greedy they have an ad every 15 seconds or so. If it was an ad every 5 minutes or so I\'d probably end up buying no ads and maybe even spending more on microtransactions, but I won\'t support this game or company when they are so blinded by greed they don\'t realise they\'ll have many more consistant players watching more overall ads with just a longer delay in between...',
       'Invasive ads, after most actions. Skippable after 5-10 seconds, but come way too often for this type of game. Games cool, but I uninstalled it after my tenth ad in about ten minutes',

    description: 'This baby girl is definitely asking for your professional help in this hairstyle game because either you are prepared to offer it or not you need to play it right away at least to try. First you are going to wash her hair to make it clean and nice, then you\'ll brush her to get rid of the extra hair, then you will make a nice braided hairstyle to make her happy. But the caring process is more than a simple washing, first you will cut off the damaged hair which has no chance of recovery. Brush the hair as long as the instructions will indicate and just apply the shampoo to offer that extra volume and shine. To prevent the dehydration and the split ends you must put on a special mask for the hair that you will do it yourself. Add the given ingredients, mix them and apply the final composition on the head. Wash the hair again, dry it and arrange the rebel hair yarns. Now all that is left is the braiding part where you will literally gather the hair and place it in the shown spot to get a nice and well arranged headdress. When you are done you can even add a nice head band with beautiful colors and details on it. Have fun and remember to play not only to get better, but to fulfill your inner passion.  You really don\'t want to miss these cool features presented by this hair styling game:- Free to play- Pretty easy to handle the control- Entertain yourself with quality music and nice graphics- Be a hairstylist as good as you can be in the braided area- Multitude of processes to accomplish- Take care of a dehydrated hair and cut the damaged hair yarns- Put together the strands that needs to be taken for a well executed braid- Moisturize the hair with a home made mask that you are making',

       'Great game, especially the fact that you can play offline. The only reason it\'s not getting 5 stars is because when the music and sound is switched off, the last bullet fired and the train\'s sound effects still play... Would be nice if i could switch all sound off. Thank you for listening, hope to hear from you guys soon.',

      'Uninstalling. The controls are imprecise (ball would slip off the desired direction occasionally) and the order of the colours would make it impossible to win on occasion. I can forgive the first thing (muscle) but making it impossible to win is not forgivable.  Work on the algorithm.',
       'Games really nice good mind challenge, great for color match making if color blind. You may not know what colors your matching however, ever since i started playing i\'ve also been getting better at matching my clothes and random day to day organising of colored items. Love the game however the ball simetimes seems to go where it wants to instead of where you released it... I noticed this a few times i would aim let go and the line would randomly jump to a new spot and the ball shots almost a completely diffrent location',
       'It was great at first. Addicting. I was really looking forward to more levels but they suck. Too many kinds of bubbles. Why did the update change old levels too? Major disappointment.  Edit 2/19/18: it was back to being great when they took away all the extra kinds of bubbles. But after a few hundred levels...they\'re back. Balls with three locks, slime, water bubbles or whatever that is. Lured people back in and then disappointed again.',
       'Too many ads. Devs are getting greedy with how many ads they put in, I got 3 before I even got to play. Don\'t bother with this junk.',

      'This is great! I\'ve had it for several months now. But I suggest making a few more bus stops, buses as such. And what if you could go inside ALL the buildings. I\'ve played this, and you could only go inside several buildings/houses. Also, can you please make more missions or quests to go on because they keep on repeating the quests you\'ve done a million times before. I hope you read this and fix and update the game. Thanks! 😘',
       'Hmm Ok the game is good everything is good but could you please add breaking windows to the game and make all buildings be able to go in. Next make more missions cause I\'m so close to finishing all the missions. That\'s my opinion for my next update,  it will make me enjoy the game more. Almost forgot some things in the game  look fake like the fences make them look realistic.  Thanks!!!',
       'Amazing keep it the way it is Everyone is liying because they don t now how to play. You do get guns you won\'t get chased only if u kill someone in front of police you can ride cars and you can go inside house and dance clubs and a lot more ❤️❤️❤️❤️!',

      'Would be nice if there was a redo button for the last move. I\'m very quick when playing and I often misplace a block. Also, why does the Apple version have stars and the android version doesn\'t? I was trying so hard to earn enough stars to buy the colour packs on my iPod, and I got quite disappointed that I can\'t do that on android. I guess I\'ll just delete the game off android since there\'s really no goal to the game now.',
       'Very fun and addicting but nice calm relaxing game. Ads only happen after each round and not a big deal. If you want to keep playing this game FREE then add up with the package. Quiet whinning about ads. Someonbe has to pay the creators for this game including the upkeep and updates. How else will the creator make his money? 2 choices, either gets ads or charge to download. So I can deal with the ads. It\'s a FREE APP.',
       'Way too many ads. I just need something for my fingers to do while listening to podcasts but this constantly interrupts my listening pretty much after every round. I really liked the game but I have had it with thw ads and am uninstalling. It\'s just not worth it.',
       'I really like the game but as many others have said their are too many ads. Ads after every round and sometimes in the middle of the round which makes you start over and that gets annoying. Too many of thr same ads. I also agree their needs to be a redo button. It does get a bit pintle after you hit the goal but still fun.',
       'Too many adds, and it makes me restart every time an add plays, I\'ve only had this app for 1 min, and have already played 50 rounds... Not. Cool. I would be okay with the adds if I could at least pick up on where I last left off.',
       'I\'m not quite sure what\'s happened to this game. It\'s very straightforward and strangely addictive. However, just today after Android\'s OS update, it performs much worse. Where before when you pick up a block, it is elevated slightly above your finger so you can see where it\'s going, now it\'s just under your finger, making this game frustratingly impossible. If this is due to an interaction with the OS update, then 1010 is due for it\'s own update.' ,

      'I love it! Out of all the 4 versions my favorite is this one. And it does say 12+ but it really isn\'t that bad once you get use to it. I just learned to play these games a month ago and trust me you see a pattern of where they go. I haven\'t played it one night. But then again I have never been jump scared. And parents if your kid is 9 or 10 and they want this game I say go ahead and say yes! One of the best games ever!',
       'It would be better if.... If you would be able to play MORE THAT ONE NIGHT. And when I used the flashlight I had to tap on the area a good few times before it actually worked. And no I don\'t have a problem with my screen.  I love the PC version of both the games, one of the best horror games in years. I\'ll definitely buy it IF reaction time on the flashlight would improve. I love the storyline and graphics of the game and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to work on night shift at Freddy Fazbear pizzeria.',
       'Best Game Ever! I love this game because the animated animatronics like toy Bonnie he trys his best to hug you. Example: mum is that you? Mum I love you!  The chicken is so weird she has a beak on the stage but when she is at cam 7 in the hallway she has no beak, why is that? Toy Freddie is quite scary but he kind of looks like a stuffed teddy bear instead of an animatronic. Well I love this game thanks for the game Scott Cawthon!',
       'Creepy and super scary game! Wow!  This games is so awesome and fantastic because it does not log on my cellphone and so scary game!  My 2 nephew are having fun  with this game and actually when the time now is 3 am and the animatronics is going to move, they\'re so tense to watch the cctv because they will see chica the color yellow  bird looking at the camera!  So I give 5 stars to this game and to the Creator of this game.. keep the good work creating a game!  😊😉',
       'This is the best game! Its way better than the first game because there\'s more anamictronics! Moreover instead of doors you get the hall and vents also you have to flash your light at foxy to get him away. You also have a mask to make chica,boany,mango,balloons boy, and Freddy. Mary and net is creepy as hell because she\'s kinda like Freddy in the first one like I mean she comes at you randomly like Freddy in the last one.',
       'Cool but... It will only allow me to play on my phone and I want to also play on my laptop but when I try to download it on my laptop it says its already downloaded on my phone i dont know how to download FNaF on my laptop D: Can you please make a download for laptops/computers? I wanna try it on my laptop (I have a feeling its gunna be scarier than my phone cuz its bigger screen than my phone O.O) Please make a download for laptops and I will rate 5 stars  and it also shows on the screen there\'s night 5 but in game 1' ,

      'Boring and repetitive and poorly designed. The obstacles are hard to see. After starting a (new) stage, you don\'t have enough time to avoid the very first obstacle. The rooftop stage is unfair, you cannot avoid obstacles because either the controls don\'t work or because you don\'t have enough reaction time. And restarting from the beginning gets very boring very quickly.',
       'This app won\'t load at all. My son really wanted to play it. He was very exited only to be very disappointed.  I tried deleting and downloading it again but it still did the same thing. I would not recommend this app because all it does is disappoint.',
       'This is a good game and would be great if the controls would respond every time.  When you are playing a game where responsive controls matter, having them fail about every 20th swipe is unacceptable.  The other disappointing thing is that Batman is the only one that says anything.  I worked my way to get Robin and when he didn\'t say anything, I was completely turned off from the game.',
       'Love batman, I live for anything lego... this is an utter failure. The first level is beyond difficult for a seasoned veteran. Game to difficult, plot line staging is beyond negligent and shame on the creators for designing such an impossible game to progress through.',
       'we love the game but it stop working time to time it starts over and closes by it self. doesnt let us report it. would love for you guys to fixes it. our five year old loves batman games. and this one makes his day.',
       'It wouldn\'t even load past putting in my son\'s age. He is very disappointed. He earned the game and I uninstalled a bunch of my own apps to make room for the app.' ,

Given how easy they are I would have wanted a timer to add some challenge to it. Also, while I fully understand that devs need to get paid, this game has way too many ads for enjoyment',
       'The game was okay. I felt like the puzzles were pretty easy to solve, even on the advanced levels. Also, there were a LOT of ads, which got in the way of the game. If you\'re looking to just kill time though, it\'s a simple app!',

      'Overall I liked the game. However, I have a few suggestions to make. First, could you please make it so the fish food is more effective or that you can upgrade it as another review said. Second, please make the time shorter because 1 hour is really long and gems are so hard to earn. Third, please make the tank more interactive. Like, you could make it so you can give the fish fish food or breed the fish or make the fish swim around freely instead of in their own level of water. Thanks!!!',
       'I love this game, it\'s fun, cute, and I love collecting these fish!The only thing is that I don\'t want to end up finishing this game too quickly, just wish there were more fish so the game could last a long time. Overall though, I think this game is awesome and you guys did a great job! And I know my opinion doesn\'t really matter since I\'m just one kid, but I really like this game.',
       'Adorable. I like how everything can be upgraded, catching the fish is the best part. Its very fun. You should really tell people that they can just swipe up in their aquarium to see their other fish because a lot of people seem to be confused by that. Other than than it\'s a cute game.',
       'I enjoy playing this game because the visuals are cute and the different fish you can collect are very interesting. I have a few problems with the game though, like how you can accidently waste your gems on getting a fish to come (It\'s hard to get gems in this game...). Also, there\'s not much to do in the fish tank. Other than that, it\'s a good game.',
       'The game is so awesome !!!! I love this game . It\'s very addictive . Can you add more fishes,  baits,  characters and more in the future ??.... PLEASE!!!! And the main thing is , please reduce the waiting time ..... You have wait like 1 hour which is too much .',
       'The game it\'s very entertaining for kids even I have a good time.. Gamepley is not too bad for children which is nice... but for adult it will be boring if you\'re not play the game with kids...🤗🤗' ,

      'The game is awesome. It is funny, has some challenges, it\'s community is friendly and you can collect familiars. Also you can use your equipment as costumes if you like a specific item\'s look. =D And I didn\'t even talk about the way the game looks like... It\'s the best pixel art I have seen in a while. =) So stop reading and start playing, have fun and thanks for making this game Developers! =D ( The only thing I miss is more coop gameplay =\'D )',
       'Great game and a lot of fun but... waiting for energy REALLY kills this game for me. I really don\'t feel energy limitations should be part of of a dungeon crawler where the object of the game is to run random dungeons for the chance of better loot.  I for one will never spend money on refreshing my energy in a game like this and the energy refresh costs are pretty high.   I feel like it be playing this game none stop if it weren\'t for the energy restrictions.   Otherwise good game and very enjoyable - when I can play.',
       'The perfect MMO RPG for your phone in my personal opinion. If you\'re a fan of dungeon games then this is the game for you. With its cute design, simple combat systems, dungeon patterns and loot systems, you\'ll find yourself easily sucked into the MMORPG world of Bit Heroes. Fight your way through the dungeons and gear up to strike fear imto the creatures who dwell within as well as the other players in challenging PvP matches.',
       'Spent over £200 in game and no legendary pet or accessory. This game uses RNG and it\'s extremely low you can\'t advance past a certain level unless you spend lots of money and even then you have to be extremely lucky to get legendary pet or accessory. Guilds won\'t take you without legendary pet or accessory. Don\'t waste your time on this PAY 2 PLAY game',
       'Perfect, very close to the perfect ultimate bit adventure rpg! I look forward to expanded versions. For this one the only issue i have is when i accept or decline a friend request, and i think duels, the request text lingers above for white someone even tho i already accepted/declined. Great work tho! I love this game!',
       'Was fun while it lasted. Now I can\'t even login to the game. "Disconnected from server" over and over. I troubleshot the issue on my end. No instructions on how to link the game to Kongregate so I can\'t do a fresh install of the game without losing everything. My network is stable. Never had this problem on My other game I\'ve ever played.  And if all you do think the account is sign in to kong in game, did that; then went to the site and it\'s not linked.' ,

      'Loading to start game is rediculus. Takes 1gb nearly everytime you load it. Story part gets way too hard to manage keeping up with the difficulty even when you pay the subscription unless you spend real money to move along. It\'s a kids game, people don\'t have the money to keep up with the difficulty. I will be unsubscribing, subscription doesn\'t justify the price, everything costs too much and can\'t progress in the game because of price. Great game, shame it\'s destroyed by greed.',
       'It\'s a great game but it\'s such a money pit. 9 out of 10 times if you want something, you better get a credit card out otherwise you\'re waiting 4 days to unlock it. If it weren\'t for that, I\'d have given 5 stars.',
       'The game is not letting me in the game. and i have wifi. So i thought i don\'t have a lot of space so i checked and i had a lot of space and my wifi is good. I don\'t know what\'s the problem please fix this problem. Overall the game is great.',

      'This is the best tap games out there. It really loves up to its word saying to timers, unlike SimCity and just about every other game out there. Its easy to play and advance so it sets a wide age range. I would like to personally thank the devs for coming out with this game, something a was looking for for a while. 10/10. Keep up the good work!',
       'I was very surprised  at the diversity of things you can do. And you can speed up EVERYTHING MANUALLY. Ads are optional with selective rewards of either money or one of the three materials you use to build stuff with. The exclusive currency can be bought with irl money or exchanged for materials or in-game cash. Not like any tap game I\'ve ever played, I\'m very impressed! This is a keeper!',
       'I adore this game, it\'s such a time waster (in a good way)! I wish that the camera controls were compatible with wireless mice. only reason being is because I broke my screen and I can\'t use too much touch screen. :( apart fro',
       'Absolutely love this game, its customisable and you make your city however you want to. One thing I eould like to see is alternative buildings, like instead of a power plant, a hydro plant. Also plz add buildings that can go in the ocean like bridges. Overall love it',
       'It is true that there is no timer but instead your energy runs out very fast! At the end it takes too much time to build a real city!  Also has nothing innovative comparing to other games.',
       'Absolutely excellent! I love the freedom of building whatever you like within reason. One thing that could improve it, and it might just be me thinking this, is that the buildings look different as you level them up. I do know that they look different at level 5, but at other levels it would be great, so you remember what level a building is. The idea that each building looks different, regardless of the type of building is still awesome, because it adds a slight feeling of difference and uniqueness. For example, I have come across at least 3 types of apartment and office, so my city/town doesn\'t all look the same. Keep up the good work! 👍' ,

      'Good simple nd great stress buster but at higher levels there is glitch. I got to lvl 570+ and game hangs  and way too slow . Even number on cell exceeds its size.  I scored in advanced part. Hope developers do something about it',
       'Its a really great game and I really recommend it! The only problems I had was the controls are a little weird and there a little bit of too much ads but I dont mind it but I\'d rather you fix it! Thanks for making me happy! ♡',
       'Really good game to sit and relax but would be good if the balls could go faster than 2x speed. If you have high points then it takes a while for every turn to watch them bounce around.',
       'Downloaded this game just to kill some time. It was fun at first but then once I started to play the challenge mode it would not let me see the whole screen during some challenges. So there is no way to win at the challenges that require you finish in a limited number of moves.',
       'Should be an option to lock targeting  and then fire, many shots were messed up from lifting my fingure at a very slight angle.  Also check points should last longer than once. Making one mistake at lvl 190+ and then having to go back to zero was so frustrating it was the main reason i uninstalled.  Terrible shame honestly, the game could have been really fun and is an original idea',
       'Its a great game i love it. The only problem would be that the speed X2 sign covers how many balls i have left and i hate that maybe try placing that top right hand corner instead of bottom right. I also hate that it only speed up X2 and not anymore but i can live without it' ,

Nytt innehåll kommer att släppas löpande så uppdatera gärna appen kontinuerligt för att få ett större utbud av underhållning.

      'Fungerar och har ambitioner Detta är tre svaga stjärnor. Jag vill gärna gilla detta men det saknas en hel del fin puts på appen och kvalitets innehåll för att jag ska känna att det är värt att spendera pengar på sådant mina barn redan har sett. Det är dessutom hutlöst att förstöra andrahands marknaden så här, att ge bort Bamse är något av det bästa man kan göra.  Installera bara detta om du kan tänka dig slänga bort 300 kr på ganska tråkigt innehåll.',

      'I\'m incredibly thankful for this game. Finally there is a game that is enjoyable, relaxing, calming and the best way to take my mind off of the worries all around us. Words cannot fully express what this game means to me! Thanks to the developers I look forward to playing everytime. The music is wonderful! I highly recommend this game. Thanks again ♡',
       'The latest update places advertising banners in the play area. You can\'t move them or play around them and I don\'t want to install the advertisement app.  They suck out loud.',
       'I absolutely love this game! It\'s not all that noisy kids stuff! I start my day off with my tea and M.J.! It\'s a great way to get the Brain up and running! 💜 I\'ve deleted the game 3 times. Alas, I just can\'t give up! Here I am again! And thoe I\'ve tried alot of other similar games, it\'s this one that is the most satisfying! 💜',
       'As much as I understand that you want to make a few bucks, the amount of advertising and the way the advertising is being presented has gradually become quite intrusive and annoying. I would much rather pay a one time license fee that this crabby implementation of user annoyance  / advertising. The other problem is that on the high end phones (read pixel 2) the board are so big that the tiles as a consequence are made very small so they fit with a final result that makes it very difficult to see/read',
       'Not sure if you can play with friends or not because I love this game to keep my self challenged!',
       'Was a fun game until  after the recent update. Used to be able to close the ads, but now they just keep playing instead of closing. Will find a better version somewhere else.' ,

      'Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.',
       'Absolutely amazing game!!! I\'m a huge petrol head and this ticks all boxes considering it\'s a phone game. Love the controls. Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress. Literally one downfall... upgrade costs when you get higher spec cars. Apart from that... GOOD JOB!!!',
       'Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning',
       'Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I\'m just going to name some things that I\'m sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I\'m just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!',
       'This game is brilliant. Have been playing it for ages. However the updates are messing with previous games, especially NASCAR I\'ve been playing previous events but with update they\'ve gone and replaced by new ones, I\'ve been working towards cars etc....all gone. Slightly annoying guys. Keep up with the good work etc but leave the previous ones alone please.',
       'Please, slow down with new cars and give us some time o get old ones. Also, add more classic F1 tracks, like Monte Carlo, Hungaroring, Sao Paolo, Adelaide, Magny Court, San Marino, etc. Or some famous rally tracks.. Think about it. Everything else is awasome. I played this game more than 4 years, and I can only give you 5 stars, but you deserve more than 5.' ,
