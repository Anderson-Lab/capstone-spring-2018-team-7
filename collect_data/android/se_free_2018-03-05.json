        "3 stars because the spins are not giving what is needed for the game. It's a cute game. I enjoy playing with my daughter. However, shields do not spin enough. Sometimes I will go a whole day with no shields and the whole time I'm getting attacked. The other thing is the bonus spin. Never have I won more that 250k coins. I know you want us to pay for another spin but maybe award a higher number once in a while. All in all cute game.",
        "This game was fun initially. But as you rank up, you gain coins and then before you get to even use them, someone is able to steal them from you (by random spinning.. no planned attack!!)   If you play this game,DO NOT SPEND MONEY TO BUY SPINS. People can steal your earnings... so you basically pay actual money, to give others coins...",
        "I need help so I spent $10 in order to get to the next level which I did where I could get my daily spin and hit jackpot and it gave me my fox but I closed the app and it took me backwards to the last level even though I already built in my new level. Please help and put me back to the level ahead of me as this is very upsetting for spending money and being right back where I was before. Fix it and I'll give it 5 stars for everything thank you",
        "I gave 2 star only because when i joined my frnd i did not got any spin..... Though that is shown in my village news...  This is the 2nd time missed the spin.. Do you know it is diffcult to get spin and when you convince a friend to join and you got nothing.....",
        "First everything went okay. But recently I can't download any special event. The game stall when you have  to raid or attack just loading the whole time. Even the spin is now stopping you can press the spin until your blue nothing. Maybe if this is fixed we could try for a higher rating.",
        "I'm  not happy there's no customer service can help to solve the problem. Waiting for the reply but no one care  try to fix this problem before you lost your customer."

        "Although this game is addictive and sometimes fun, it seems the producers of the game are greedily taking advantage of people and getting them to pay money for things not worth it(but they feel the pressure to do so, so they do it). Some things in this game are deliberately set up to make the player fail and become desperate to play on and spend. The Champions League is a poor idea which produces terrible prizes for high ranks, and is just a replay of previous played levels which is a let down.",
        "Update...as I go though the levels Ill get stuck for a day or two...even 3 on a level. Gameplay FUN has Dropped significantly. Moved to 3 stars as a result. If it does not change I'll continue to move to 1 star. Games are many to be played...not just stuck on a level forever!  Other issue with the game is that there's so much clicking and waiting once you win. I wish that it would just go right to the next level and it wouldn't have to wait for the splash screen. I just spend so much time wasted versus playing",
        "It's fast and fun so much better than the other new ones. I love playing it. Thank u so much for all your work and the time spent making it a blast to play.  PS getting past level 80 isn't  possible so I quit. Made me so sad.",
        "Don't waste your time playing this game.  I got too 300 + levels but you get 100 coins for completing each level.  Unfortunately it goes in a piggy bank, which you need to pay to break starting from £1.99, then next piggy bank was £4.99.  It's a con!"

        "I'll get the negative part done 1st. I'd give this 5 stars if there weren't so many ads!!! For the amount of time you actually get a turn, 30 seconds ads in between every turn is a bit much.  Outside of that this is a very fun addictive game.  Note to new players. Although the ball travels better with a perfect hit, there are too many obstacles if you got straight down the middle. Better to hit just left or right of all that.",
        "Needs way more bats i beat this in 3 days and can't get the ball any farther. Add more bats and I'll give 5 stars.  Update: need to make the bats harder to get i already had all the new ones unlocked when i opened the app after the update. Litterally took one swing with the now highest bat and now there is no point to play.  You should make it like 5,000 km for the next update or something.",
        "I think this game is GREAT and pretty fun but there is some things that I don't like about this game for example THERE IS TO MUCH ADS!!!! not just that but also when you do it perfect it goes straight right??? Well hitting perfect actually sucks because if you go to the middle EVERYTHING is in your way I'd rather hit it on the left or right.",
        "Need improvements! First of all, when you will make a perfect hit the chances are 99% that you will hit an obstacle. Secondly, there is no sound.Developers put different sound modes/effects based on the tipe of the bat and some background music! Finally, I think that the game is good and addictive but it needs improvements! 👍⚾️🏏",
        "It's a very simple game, kind of has potential but not a whole lot. There's way too many ads, it feels more like an advertisement trap than a game at times. The ads pop up at inconvenient times and interfere with gameplay. If you have absolutely nothing better to do, then install. If you have literally anything else to do, it's a waste of time",
        "It's fun. But an ad after every attempt is rediculous. I get the developer wants to make money but when you can't play the game without a 30 second ad after every attempt it makes it hard to play. Playing in airplane mode gets rid of the ads and it's fun to play that way. Reduce the number of ads and this game will be better."

Thank you creators of the game, I enjoy playing it so much, and I do hope that there's more.",

        "This game has alot of benefits, especially, the decision making, plan ahead, multi tasking, pattern recognition and many more. Thank to this game, its very addictive, plain and simple, make you relax and it doesnt stress. Deserve to be 5 star."

Now I have nothing to spend apples on.  But here is what i really wanted to say i really like this company and the games you put out to your users. I'm newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me. I own alot of your games and have spent alot trying to help. I wish I had more to unlock things in time. But Thank you very much.",
        "The game sucks it's alwful. It's gliching non stop for your bad. There are ADS everywhere! Ketchapp you getting worse and worse. There are ads of stupid games everywhere. What a game maker will pay to another game to show them in ADS! That makes the game in the ad even worse. Please ketchapp I was a big fan of you but you made your games so STUPIT. PLEASE FIX YOUR GAMES!",
        "Ads interrupt gameplay and are extremely aggravating. The video that you have to watch to continue your gameplay never works. The game crashes when xp increases. I personally dislike this game, and it would be better if these issues were resolved. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this review.",
        "I like the game, BUT it is glitchy. Most of the time when I hit \"continue\" to watch an ad for longer gameplay it freezes, so I have to close the app and start over. When I open the app and start playing the first round, an ad pops up and I inevitably click on it because I'm in the middle of playing the round. Please fix these issues, and I'll try to remember to rate this higher once they're fixed.",
        "Deleted all my data with no reason. Had a bunch of Legendaries and Rares that have now been deleted. I put a lot of time into this game, and even bought the ad-free package. If you don't want a load of wasted time, don't download this app.  Edit- Updated the app and levelled up a bit. The game crashes every time I get a free revive. Still a massive waste of time.",
        "The game was amazing! There was only 1 problem. Sometimes when i  started a game in the middle of it, it would just show an ad and it would make me lose. Unless you fix this my rating will be 4 stars. Fix this and the rate will be 5 stars"

The multiplayer is unfair it always matches me with MORE higher leveled and Faster players like the one I always encounter in multiplayer are Cross cutter‚ interceptor, and more way faster players and my only vehicle is renegade which is very unfair pls fix it this getting much worse right now."

I mean when I first downloaded it there was only 6 levels XD  I know that should be a good thing but I can't seem to finish them all lol. GREAT GAME!!! DOWNLOAD RIGHT NOW!!! LIKE... RIGHT NOW!!! IT'S AMAZING AND I BET YOU'LL HAVE IT FOR AT LEAST 4 MONTHS!!!",
        "Parents, be aware that though this game is rated E, the ads most definitely are not.  My 5 year old saw some pretty R rated ads so we had to delete the app, which broke his heart because he loves the game",
        "Awesome game controls are just great but the only thing I didn't like was that the balls other than the normal one was for real money u guys could make the others balls for diamonds that we get during the gameplay  so we could also actually make use of the diamonds  otherwise the game is awesome👍👍👍",
        "Loved this app so many choices and creativity it looked like you worked hard on it so I think you put a lot of effort in it and also There's barely any adds so this is amazing you all should get this app cause its fun and a great time killer !  :P ITS AMAZING AND I LOVE IT",
        "This game is fun but one problem.  My ball keeps randomly rolling off the edge for no reason. Plz fix this then u will get 5 stars.",
        "This game is great. The levels are challenging and fun but personally I think this game could be a lot better if you added a level editor so you could make levels and post them online for others to try. This would totally make your game a lot more exciting and fun."

        "Better game than the other similar. I know the other game was first, but they want you to pay hundreds of dollars upfront so you start at similar pace as this one. Or wait long time, and span of that game is years! Whilst this game is fast to start, cheap, and at free play you can beat it in months, while if you spend a couple of bucks, you can beat it in days, at the most weeks. So basically they sell out this genre for a few bucks, and good riddance! It was fun for a few days, spend few bucks to beat it in few more days, or wait a bit. And thats that. It is, how it is suppose to be.",
        "This app is quite addictive and fun! Not to mention how much of a time killer it is! It's cool to see how far you can get, upgrading and collecting money until you can reset for fame! I like the whole concept of the resetting for fame but it doesn't really make sense.. but don't mind that, it's just a game after all! I am having fun with the app so far, but I might get bored of it later. We'll see I guess! :-)",
        "I love who you added as the workers! I not good with comics or super heros but i think thats stanley? And i love how you added chef Gordon Ramsay! If you update this game i have 1 question, can the tech manager of the second floor be steve jobs?",
        "Good game, but they're some bugs that need sorting out. At random times the game just cuts off, sometimes when you are loading up the game it say ooops something went wrong write an email, Evan some of the videos freeze up or just shuts everything down. I would be happy if I could play the game without any problems at all. Thank you for your time and patients. Have a good day.",
        "Latest update messed up the game. Went to black screen that says debug. Uninstall/reinstall fixed it but now it says to update the game. When I click ok, it brings me to the game store, but no update is available.",
        "Tap your screen. Wait. Tap some more. Wait. Watch some ads and hope they don't freeze for a minute. More waiting. You're going to delete it eventually, just don't bother.  Reply: If real life were as banal and buggy as this game, I would have drunk a bleach smoothie by now."

Game doesnt work, on screen controls dont work on my tablet, bluetooth contoller joysticks work but no buttons work. No options for controller mapping. No real options for anything. My kid loves this game but i beleive it to be an unplayable piece of trash on my tablet. The only thing roblox accomplished was to frustrate and anger me. I do not recommend this game to anyone.",

        "LOVE IT!! But the controls for mobiles are... you know \"horrible\" and the screen are so glitchy and when I jumped or walked its a little late... and all of the famous games, I cant even play it... when I play it, it will load, it will let me play just for a second and then the screen will go freeze, and then BOOM! It will return to roblox home... hopefully the controls for mobiles can be fix and some other stuff that needs to be fix ≈) TY for this wonderful game and I love it!!♥♥♥ (BTW my profile is \"cutekittyloverMia25\") &gt;.&lt;",

        "Excellent fun and a fantastic way to introduce a new audience to some wonderful classical music as well as very talented contempory composers. My one gripe is that recently players have been given multiple oportunities to get 3 crowns or very high scores with ad powered resources. I feel this takes a lot of the challenge from the game. Anyone can get 3 crowns in 4 or 5 goes where us old guard of the game did if in 1 or 2 Still an awesome game though and well worth the download anytime.",
        "This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don't worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you'll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!",
        "I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who's better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn't seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don't think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.",
        "This game is honestly a great time-killer and even has it's challenging parts, but from what I've noticed as you get to the higher tier songs they just get slower and slower and are just flat with barely any challenge. I expected more of a challenge with a higher level but now this game is getting horribly boring.",
        "I'm in love with this game. It's challenging, you don't have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks.",
        "there seems to be a malfunction with sound. I've played several songs and each one has parts where there isn't any music. I'm not sure if this is a bug or just something wrong with my phone. other than that, though, this app is really entertaining."

        "The game is good, but the multiplayer needs to be fixed.  It hangs on load and results in the player losing money or gems with no recourse.  It randomly drops ships, and when one player immediatlely gets the best ship and the other player doesn't receive any ship until 10 rounds later, it is impossible to catch up.  Fix the multiplayer, then you get your 5 stars.",
        "Definitely not worth it. Was fun at first, but after the updated quests, the game took a serious nosedive in quality. Now you HAVE to beat the opponent in order to get anything, otherwise you're out 1000 gold. Before, you would get something just for playing. The new PvP just sucks.",
        "I got a new phone and I installed this game on it and it put me on level 5. I was on level 32. I had 56 stars and my combat power was on 72000. If it don't update the game with my current data I don't think I am going to play it anymore. I don't want to star all over again.",
        "Pretty decent game, shame you need to pay gems for the second last ship. The PvP is fun but half the time reduces my gold when I win. Cannot see the devs replying to any messages so unsure if they care",
        "It sucks so much. I would rather jump off a building and put hot sauce up my butt than play this game. DO NOT GET THIS GAME. IT WILL MAKE YOU HAVE BLOODY HERSHEY SQUIRTS",

        "I gave it three stars because not too far along in the game, it turns into a \"pay to win\" game. Some boards simply don't give you enough moves, so you're forced to use coins to continue or retry and lose a life.  I don't mind hard games, but I detest micro transactions being needed so soon into it.. I'm at level 24, that's it, and already the board doesn't even give you a fighting chance to beat it without using coins.",
        "Its a nice game! But it just takes forever to open a new level. Sometimes your on one for days. That's just to long. That's why I pay farm inland. You can play for hours with out bring stopped no lives. . I want a game that's fun and relaxing. No hard or extra hard ones. I really like cleaning and fixing thing. Be nice if you could do more area and less puzzle.",
        "I love decorating the rooms but I am having to pay too much to get enough points to do it.   I also don't like that each room requires more points to do the tasks than the previous room.  I have changed my rating to low because you end up spending too much of your own money to get powerful to get your stars to complete the tasks.  They also lose your purchases.  I bought a desk chair yesterday and now it is missing and the task is gone too.  Rip off.",
        "This game is awesome. But the stars, please increase the amount of star not just 1. Make it 2 for the Hard Level. And lastly, it's hard to download new rooms when it always appear the Technical Error. Better if you do not require to download it and the user can open it without connecting to internet. However, the game is great for relaxing. Keep up the good work!",
        "Never thought it would be this addictive! At first i thought \"Oh, its THAT game that always pops up in advertisements.\" but after deciding to give it a try, i am hooked!   I introduced homescapes to my mom as well and downloaded it for her and she finds it adorable and fun as well. We both take time to chill out and have fun with the puzzles occasionally when we are together.   I cant find a single flaw or critique for this game, its amazing :)",
        "Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it's advertised too much, but it's definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That's slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money."

        "I think this game is 5 stars because it is a exquisite game with lots of fun. It's VERY addicting with all the hoops and basketballs. I love the idea and concept of the game. It is nice and easy so any age group could play it. I just got it 3 days ago and so far it is fun. This is one of the games I have had in a long time that was actually really fun, and addictive. I suggest you get this game because it could be your favorite game. I hope if you do get the game you have a wonderful, fun filled time.       😄🏀🎖 Have a great time and get the game! Sorry I had to put the medal I tried to find a ribbon. Of course a medal works too.",

        "So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I'll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It's in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I've ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍",
        "The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn't make it better at controlling. I don't know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌",
        "this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It's so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It's just so addicting and I can't get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the 'play online' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊",
        "Should allow us to be able to control the speed with a bar level instead of the button. Should make online controllers like offlines. Faster and more sensitive to move. And add a special rare star that floats around the screen rarely that doubles your size by eating it. No matter how big you are. That would be interesting.",
        "Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃",
        "I'm highly addicted to this game. It's a thousand times better then agar.io in my opinion and it's really cool that you get to create your own skin. The only downer is that I just wish there was some music because you start to get a bit bored after a while.This game is NOT a waste of time, and everyone needs to download it to experience the awesomeness!"

It does this in the middle of a round, so obviously it screws up my gameplay. Makes me consider paying for no ads, but also makes me want to delete.",
        "Addicting and a good time killer, but there are a lot of ads, and every time I downloaded it, it gave my phone a virus. If you have a new and protected phone, get the game, but if you have an old phone, do not get this game. IT WILL GIVE YOUR PHONE A VIRUS AND YOU CAN LOSE EVERYTHING ON IT!!!!!!!!",

TOO MANY SPAM ADS SAYING MY SYSTEM HAS A VIRUS ALONG WITH ADS SAYING I WON A GIFT CARD.....JUST HAVE TO REGISTER ONLINE ETC... DO NOT D.L",
        "An unbelievable amount of ads in an otherwise fun game.   Ads after every match and spam ads trying to open my web browser multiple times mid match, somtimes when I'm preparing my shot which completely ruins it. Such a shame the devs chose to ruin their own game because of greed. Sadly this is more common than not nowadays.",
        "I WANT to like this game. It's fun. The problem is the ads (I'm fine with ads. It's a free game) but mid game it randomly opens ads. I'm talking the kind that take you to a whole new window and tell you your phone is infected and won't let you go back without closing that tab. It screws up your shots and it's just NOT ok. Please fix this mess and I'll redownload and give the game a better review. Ads are one thing but when they make the game unplayable, I have to delete the game.",
        "It's an amazing concept and idea that is very entertaining. The bad thing is that the ads interrupt the game so constantly that it messes up your shots and your online games too.  If that can be fixed so they appear after a match not in the middle of one that redirects you to a page full of ads and false notifications, then it will be a very awesome experience."

        "3142 has a glitch in which when you use a speckled chocolate booster to start and match a trio (3) next to it, it sets the choc booster off, despite no colour bomb or stripe candy being formed next to it. Have screen shots if it would help to fix. Won't waste any more boosters. Please correct, thanks.",
        "I love playing this game and would give this app a lot more stars, but for some odd reason I am not showing as completed the Goal of the level I am currently on. It's very frustrating to me because I have hit the targeted first Star and had recently hit ALL THREE Stars showing normally that I completed the Goal. No dice. I hope someone fixes this bug soon. It's making me not want to play anymore and I love playing this with my kids.",
        "Not so keen on the  graphics, the actual sweets are OK,  but, the puppets etc are not so good. It can take ages, days in fact to win the super hard games if you don't,  like me, buy help, and the free help you have earned are used up in the first go. So it takes perseverance.  Good game.",
        "It's great but like any app you'll find flaws in it. Certain moves will take away your colors bombs or other special features them on the daily wheel it pauses and won't give you what you would've won if it didn't freeze up. I just hate to be cheated",
        "If you like bejeweled Type puzzle games you will love this one. It's far more challenging with every level. Sometimes I wanna throw my iPad or phone at the wall...but I can't get enough of this game!"

Even if you don't mind to wait 200 days, you will not able to afford it (lvl 10 military Def, Atk, Health cost 100m gold each). DO NOT GO FOR HIGH MILITARY AND T4 WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE GAME.",
        "Ive been playing for the better part of a year, and this game started out great for a long while. But IGG not only panders and gives better deals to Chinese people, cheaper packs etc. But literally 99% of all mega guilds and players are Chinese or Vietnamese. If your not asain don't play this game  you'll end up like me playing forever just to quit because of the obvious discrimination IGG holds with its playerbase",
        "Not a good game for new players.  Was fun and  interesting at first but you qucikly realise that you are just food for high level players with no way to reach a defensible level.  High level players basically teleport in, raid everyone and teleport out.  They should lock servers to keep it balanced and give more guidance for new players. This game is  clearly weighted towards the people who have been playing it the longest. Dont waste your time",
        "Kingdom 249 is open before just 50 days back. And one guild have 2B might. Most of the guys have millions of might one of them got 700M might. How's this is possible. Kingdom 277 is opened before 15 days back but one guild K03 got more powerful. Top guys got 120M might in just 15 days. Does IGG employees playing this game. We are lover of this game please don't lose your credibility. This two kingdom which I observed only Chinese players are strong. How overall kingdom only Chinese players got higher might in less time.",
        "This game is fun but be prepared for the mother of all Pay2win games.  These folks at IGG are experts at crafting new and exciting ways at fleecing their customers of every cent they can.  You CANNOT compete if u dont pay and pay often.  Players here ...just regular people... dump hundreds of rl $$$ regularly.  You have been warned.",
        "The game is awesome and there is always something to do  so you're never stuck waiting around for powerups or new lives. Unlike other games it doesn't require microtransactions to get stronger, but they do help you quicker if you're interested in paying. I'm addicted and play every day."

        "I think it's a good game but sometimes the ball would go in but then it bounces out you should also add modes, one like there are walls all around and I like the game keep making these addictive games:D also all you guys stop with the adds just turn off your WiFi let them have some money after hard work on many game's like would you want to make a game and not get money and just get  ALL YOUR COMMENTS WITH ADDS! ohhh that would be soo annoying.",
        "I love the game it is so simple yet super fun. Just the only down side is that there are WAY to many ads. I stared playing a round and then an ad pops up.. Like really. At least put a 15 second ad up after the round is finished where you can choose to wat h and ad to continue after you have missed and your time is up. If that person skips the chance then put up and ad. Or just remove them. Thank you dev for the lovely game though ¶:",
        "Don't get me wrong this app is addicting and fun. The thing that ruins this app is ads. For a game were it is meant to be played in quick bursts and you aren't meant to succeed for long periods of time, i don't understand how you can put an ad after every attempt. Sure one per 3 to 5 games and the another 30 second ad, but at the rate they come this game isn't fun anymore. The craziest thing to me is that i can't find a way to invest a few cents into the app to perma-block the ads. Come on dev i know you can do better than this. I will adjust the rating when i am offered a solution. Until then this 4 to 5 star app has 1 to 2 star potential.",
        "Ya hate ads? Turn off wifi and play. Stupid phone/gaming noobs. Its a good game and dont hate on it for ads. The ads make the people who made the game MONEY. Give then a break. Let them have money while u watch something u might want. If u wanna turn it off, like i said, turn off wifi.",
        "It would be 5 stars if for one, the ball didn't just disappear more or less everytime it goes of the screen. And two, if the ball actually moved when i tap the screen rather than decide to just lay on the ground like a dead badger. As for reason three, there are waaaay to many ads. It asks me if i want to watch an ad to continue so then i press no and it still makes me watch an ad, that's just cheap. I understand they have to make money but this is a whole different story here. But  when it does decide to work and when i turn my wifi off, its pretty fun.",
        "Would pay for the game to remove ads. I get you can turn off WiFi/data but it shouldn't be necessary, and is unfair to the company itself. Please offer a paid ad-free version!"

        "So I played it on my iPhone e and loved it. Recently o got a new phone and it's am android. I connected to my Nintendo account and loaded it up. My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I'm not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr",
        "Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I'm paying £9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn't make it worth the price being asked.",
        "I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren't here. They don't connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw",
        "I love Mario games. I always think they are fun while challenging. It is UNREASONABLE that you have to purchase the second world and the rest of the worlds. You only have one world that you don't pay for. I get people need money and apps are a great way to get them but you could at least have a bundle that everyone wants. I only play remix 10. Because it's FREE.",
        "This would have got 5 stars had I been able to share it with my 2 kids via family share. I refuse to pay £30 for all 3 of us to have access to all the levels.  Great game though. Fun, quick and easy to play. Many hours spent between us. So many levels too.",
        "I'd say it's worth it even as a free game.  It's a fun game to kill time. Even if you run out of tickets there's many ways you can earn more on the free side. To purchase at 10 bucks the play becomes almost non stop. Good buy, good time killer, challenging, and overall enjoyable game, free or paid for.  5 stars from me."

        "I love this game and would have rated it a 5 but suddenly the pause feature isn't working and I lost a game that was over 8000 points because I had a phone call. After I unpaused it set me back to zero. So aggravating. Also the 30 second ad for 30 stars doesn't show up anymore. Not sure what happened to this game in the last 2 weeks.",
        "There are way too many advertisements every time I start a game or lose or win a game I instantly get an 30 second ad which I have to waste my time on to skip it until I am finally done. Overall except for the advertisements it is a great game controls and game play is brilliant I recommend this game but you will get a lot of ads. Suggestion: Lower the amount of ads showen",
        "This game was very addictive I used to play it everyday.This new update sucks. Nobody likes so you mise well change it back because you were getting better reviews. I am going no further with this game and deleting. Folks pleaseeeeeeee don't waste your time in this game unless your a lonely man or women with 30 cats",
        "Its alright but theres too many ads. All adds are 30 secs and mostly unable to skip. I dont mind ads but the come up even when I'm in the middle of a level, making it near impossible to do anything, so I'm uninstalling it for that reason.",
        "Sadly, it could've been a fun game if I could actually tap where I wanted to. The tap is off by like a few mm or something. I have to tap above the try again button to actually try again, or else I end up hitting challenges... So during the game play the exact same thing would happen, which makes the game unplayable.",
        "This game is a great time killer! It is really addictive and fun but almost every time you die you have to sit through an ad which gets annoying. Overall this is a good game bit watch out for ads."

        "I'm really enjoying this game. It beats the previous bid wars-storage auctions & pawn shop game I've played. Could you please add the opinion to change the cash to English pounds (£) and the chance to open more lockers and better chances on getting rare items. And tell us which cities we could find certain items we need to have in storage to complete missions.",
        "Have a problem, mutt's semi legal store thing won't work. The black screen to show the result thing shows up top left corner, but it's just stuck there. And the rest of the screen shows the normal background for mutt's semi legal store, and I pretty much can't do anything when this happens. I have to reset the game, and each time I try to \"show results\" in mutt's semi legal store, same thing happens. Please fix this",
        "What is wrong with the newest update? I can't acquire my item from the switch shop. Every time I click on get item, the black screen goes to the top left of the screen. And I can see the normal background picture. When that happens I have to close the game and reset. I've tried to get the item 20 times and it does that every time.",
        "Was a great game til the update. Now I have to open it twice for my energy to update and for the money in the pawn shop to change. Also when I bargain with clients now it's alway a negative profit compared to before. More annoying then anything",
        "My main issue with this game is the fact that a mission is requiring me to renovate a building but in order to do that I need to download an additional package which WILL NOT download. Rendering the mission unattainable and the game broken by default. Would this issue be resolved then there would be no need for such a low star rating and I would gladly rate it better.",
        "I enjoy playing this game. Currently I have two major problems with it.  1. I wish I could change orientation based on how my phone is tilted.  2. I tried to have Mutt trade something really expensive and now it freezes every time I attempt to open the trade."

        "Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "First of all It's joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱",
        "Likes- 1) The game is pretty addictive.  2) Graphics is good.  3) Variations are cool.  4) Game controls are awesome.  5) You need skills and timing. 6) Stats keeps you update how you       are performing.  7) You make friends while playing.  Dislikes -  1) It's also a game of money so....  2) When you win too many games       you get tougher opponents.  3) Despite having good Internet      connection the game disrupts in      between by disconnecting it.  4) The game starts controlling you        in winning or losing.",
        "I realize y'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don't pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I'm pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It's a pretty good app and I've sent many people to download your app.",
        "Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don't decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don't mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don't actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.",
        "8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don't win any games until those coins are over and I'm only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don't know why this is happening but it sucks because it's putting me off the game.. it's like 8 ball is making sure I'm losing hence the rate 3"

        "Good but £4 is a lot to not quite remove all the add. Some pictures are still locked behind and walls. Easy enough to unlock but for the price id expected all add to be removed. Also really would like the pictures to be sortable by category with more fantasy and space stuff in the complex pictures. Also there appears to be no way to sync pictures across devices. If I've paid £4 I should be able to switch between the phone and tablet at will. Both are android.",
        "I love it very much. I also have some sugjestons to make. I think you should make categories for Thu pictures (animals,people,food,ect) and also have a daily challenge where you have to finish a picture (that you say) and we have to finish it. You would get a prize of a amount of coins and you could save them up to buy new pictures or tools like the bomb. But i really like this game. So even if you don't do my sugjestons I will still love it. ❤❤❤",
        "In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it's just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.",
        "AMAZING GAME! I am SOOOOOO HAPPY with this game! ITS SOO ADDICTIVE TO PLAY! SOOO MANY PICTURES TO CHOOSE FROM! THERE'S EVEN A TRUMP ONE(which is EXTREMELY funny)! THIS IS THE-BEST-GAME-EVER THAT I HAVE PLAYED!I LOVE THIS GAME SOOO MUCH THAT YOU, YES YOU, SHOULD GO DOWNLOAD PIXEL  ART RIGHT NOW! YES RIGHT NOW! SO GO AHEAD AND DOWNLOAD IT!!! (also this is the longest thing i have EVER typed on my phone!)",
        "I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It's kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.☺",
        "I love this game and both myself n my grandbabies love doing the pics. It would b awsome to have n categories or level of pic. Didn't know about the bomb and other help. I would also suggest to move or when u r doing pic for the back button n save button to hide . I'm always intrupting my pic by hitting the by accident . N also to b able to open the pic at a spot by touches instead of expanding pic. Expecially for more detailed pics. Love it Ty ."

How about making it fair to level up and give better rewards. Make it so we can play offline too so its easier to check on our game",
        "I got something trouble again. I dont know this is bug or anything. But i lost my gold 15k. 2 days ago my gold 15, ... k but tomorrow 22 feb 2018 i realized that my gold became 693 gold. I didnt upgrade or buy something. I only bought wheat 10 pcs and peas 8 pcs on market and in that time i realize my gold become 693. Please fix it thanks",
        "I think over all its a good app maybe they should change the fact that you have to rank up to get more stuff but really other than that its a pretty good app i incorege who ever is reading this to download it but have in mind its a app that u need to work hard on to enjoy it 👍❤",

Since I use my phone for making real income, I need to swap screens to other activities, and each time do a four step log in process back into the game. I have never seen this problem before in any other game, no reason this game would be different. About the game? Well, I'll tell when this problem is gone 😅",
        "This is a great game. I have played it for over 2 years now and it's still my favorite game. Advice to newbies, take your time. Stay in one age and build up your resources before moving on. You can play in multiple worlds, join guilds, make friends and they have great quests to do if you choose to.",
        "It is  great game, for ages 10 and up even 9 is okay. It is cool that we are building a town from scratch, like from the prehistoric time, and building our way up. Not like other game that start you off with big present day buildings. It doesn't cost a lot to do things like building and removing things, some object are free, they give the right amount of money and you can always win some more diamonds. In other games you would have to pay to remove object and buildings are ridiculously expensive.  It is hard to make money in other games and to make diamonds. I personally at night put my hunters too make things that take 8 hours and in the day things that take 5 to 15 minutes but sometimes 1hour. It is a very good game, it is almost as a real life city town, empire.",

        "Started playing, made some progress, then the next time I went to play it wouldn't link back to my Google account and kept saying incorrect password. You get one star because that was frustrating and I couldn't get back to the game I already made progress on. UNINSTALLED...",
        "Fist of all guys I want to thank you for your great job at making this game better  Second when I have my gondola market of any other building with water...I can't conect it to the main ocean outside the map....which basically doesn't make any sense to have a huge sea ship at the center of the city 😂  So could you please make it possible to connect gondola market(and not only thing that has water in it) to the main ocean outside the map   Thank you for your attention :)   ❤ you guys )"

        "Its a legit fun game to play but...  For me I get streshed because when I need to do it over again then u  streshed by not doing it...    Its still kind of a good game though..  Also on YT thanks for...   !!!! 2 SUBSCRIBERS!!!!  I know its not alot but I am rlly happy and I'm thankfully to who subscribed to me on YT :)  My name was galaxy DJ but now..  Its AngelPlayz I haven't even uploaded any videos yet 😂😂 but thanks for the support!  I might be making new videos about roleplays bloxburg builds and games to enturtain u guys to not be bored!!   I LIKE TACCCCOOOOSSSSSSSSS.....  🍍🍍🍍 .. This is so long lol...   Sorry how this is so long 😂😂😂😂 Well yeah that's all I got to say..!!?  Cya peace GUYS🍍🍍",
        "Well, I admit, I'm addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn't be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can't Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍",
        "The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won't annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie",
        "It's a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it's super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.",
        "So rage inducing! But i am a comete noob at your amazing creations. When o first downloaded it 3 yrs ago i hated it a deleyed after failing the first level before getting halfway. Some how though my abillity for rage cam control itself and yea. So in a way you made a rage game that helped my rage. Huh. Anyways great game might buy full version. Only if i can become a good player though",
        "The game is great. I just have three words it's AAA Addicting annoying but awesome at the same time. The graphics and colours made the gameplay even better. I love it! And for all the people who have it u just need to practice cause practice makes perfect and don't rage quit !😎"

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "I hate that every time I purchase a decoration it goes more and more expensive it ridiculous can one stone wall go up to 10,000! I mean that's crazy. Also it would be good if you added a edit program that allows you to get rid of everything on your farm except of the house and other things like that and then you can put it how you want it so basically decoration or designing your farm.",

And then you have that \"Aha\" moment. There it is.  The trap is set. Lol you are not continuing to play because it is addictive. You play in order to collect coins so you can buy stuff to make the little fish happy. 💘 the graphics kind of a little like an underwater Farmville with the plants 🐟 and decorations you can get fort your aquarium. I do play with 🎶 turned off. Cute game so far.        Graphics make it better than Candy Crush.",
        "With an easy guide, on 'How to play'. Once you get going its great fun. Dare I say quite addictive. Fantastic animations. Amazing back ground music. Plus, no app freezes either.  Its an 'A☆' from me at least.  Only, what would be a great idea. Is all the piggy bank jewels you build up, should be awarded for your hard efforts. Should not have to buy them back.  Only purchase jewels when desperate.",
        "Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I'm 32 and play this often so it's not just for kids . Give it a try it's very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen 😉",
        "Fantastic game! It's great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.",
        "Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can't do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!",
        "I Loooove Fishdom!!!😁 I'm absolutely addicted to this wonderfully fun & challenging game. The graphics are very cute & entertaining. The only issue i have is that I'm up in levels 180+ & there's just NO way to make the amount of coins to purchase ALL the decos/plants i earn. Most are priced too high."

        "It's fun I love it but only Trump, Kim, and Vald are special? Why not Hillary or Obama. I would also like other funny costumes no holds bar let me play as people from sausage party too! This needs co-op and much more costumes. Don't limit it to just that I wan a ol Bernie sausage :D my favorite game ever. More than my kitty cannon games!",
        "Once an ad on an app tries to trick me with a fake virus warning I'm done with. Even without the fake virus warnings the ads do not give you a chance to say yes or no, you are taken straight to a site the Google Store. I find this extremely rude",
        "This game is fantastic! The style, sounds, and music set a fun and cartoon-ish tone, and the gameplay adds a sense of tension and suspense as the player does not know what the next obstacle will be and cannot stop the character completely as the sausage continues to walk onward. This game is fun to play and hilarious (specifically the sausage's dying cries/animations), and the obstacles aren't predictable, but the pace is initially too slow, making the game a bit boring at the beginning. I would like to see a game mode that increases the pace right from the start, like a speed mode, and new dying cries/animations and obstacles in future updates. However, as the game is right now, it's a lot of fun. Definitely recommend."

        "So nice to sit and enjoy a game of challenge. Almost as much fun as chess, but easier to carry. Great way to relax while waiting for the zombie apocalypse or the bus to come. Thank-you and keep up the awesome work.  *UPDATE* 17 FEB 2018.  Have started my friends and family trying to get Top Score. No one is really trying as they are all enjoying playing the app to care. Brought a tear to my eye. Once again, \"Thank-you\"  for a truly  wonderful game.",
        "Simple tile game with a nice learning curve. Easy enough to be able to relax while playing and challenging enough to not be boring.  Instant gratification for finishing levels, packs, and difficulty ratings.  There are 'rolling points' that I haven't figured out the use for yet. Coins to purchase hints and other stuff. The ball can have different 'skins' that you unlock as you complete grpups of packs.  TLDR?  I'm having fun. Maybe you can too.",
        "The graphics, controls, n the gameplay are ALL 5 by me. I was expecting this game to be boring but finally, i downloaded it n it was a BLAST! I could NEVER take my eyes off this game as its AMAZINGLY fun. I was not expecting it to be THAT fun, but it was!!! There is absouloutly NOTHING WRONG about this game. The only  thing that is wrong is when people say bad things about this game. But there are NO glitches, barely no adds n NO expectations! This game is absouloutly my MOST favourite  game OF ALL the others.👍",
        "Great game. Starts easy so you can get your eye in and then gets harder. Fun to play and not so difficult that you give up and uninstal. Ads are over fairly quickly and I like that you can choose to watch some to get extra coins.",
        "it is the best game in the hole intire world I think it's a good idea  for a game it is soooooo good when I play it I can't get my eye's of it it is stunning and amazing wow i love it 😁😁😁😁😁",
        "This game is awesome,  a great puzzle game. I only had it for about 3 weeks and already on pacgage 20 level 10 on expert. I  will have the game beat in a few days. Thanks for amazing game."

I just purchased the chainsaw blade, the DRAGON blade was a huge desappointment we was expecting phenomenal motions not that catoon flag . Also : all the good stuff are in mini game, the others dojos are kind very less quality, let us use minigame blades and dojos in arcade or zen even by purchase that will be nice. Thank you",

        "I used to play this game a couple years ago, and at the time, it had satisfying gameplay and great time killing qualities. I used to love it then and I still do now, but I've recently noticed pretty annoying glitch that's driving me away from the game. For some reason, a few hours after I download the game, it doesn't allow me to enter the game anymore. When I open the game,  it will run smoothly up until the point when it reaches the loading screen and simply returns me to the home screen. I try to reopen it and the same thing happens. I'm not really sure why this happens, but until this glitch is gone, I will be forced to stay away from the game entirely as the only way to fix this glitch is to download the game again which is quite time consuming.",

        "Think you should be. Given a legendary atrandom at start a,nd a random rare in chest would be cool was expecting that..but no just normal cards.hope I get  cool legendary one day.like. the chest idea hope you bring in armour card add on.like spear guy could have ice spear or flames.plus that's cool extract cards to collect to make your cards even better and unique. Thank you my supercell friend.this game oh almost,st forgot.bbbbbbbeest 2 v 2 game on mobile,!!!!!",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "I m lucky enough!!!!!  I just started playing 8 months ago and now I earn 7 legendaries in total and 2 of them are lvl2 where as my friend is playing since more than a year he owes only 6 legendaries and 1 of them is lvl 2..... So plz do something about this we(gamers) expect better from u  Plz don't disappoint them who has low no.s of legendaries....... This is request from all guys who have not got luck in this game I guess...",
        "Well after playing it for so many months. It now has not let me play for about a  week out of no where, it loads to 50% and then it asks to try again later I have uninstalled it many times and retried time after time. All of my other games work just not this one. Don't really know what to do. It sucks because this is my favorite game too.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖"

This can be done by a special doctor - dentist. We present to your attention an exciting game for children - a dentist (vet clinic). In this entertaining game, your child is a real dentist, under the guidance of which there is a hospital for animals. The kid is entrusted with a very important and responsible task - the treatment of teeth of his four-footed pups, whose teeth began to ache heavily because of their love for sweets. You have to treat them in a real dental office, use various medical instruments, such as tongs, scalpels, Burmashin and many others, to clean your four-legged friends of teeth from plaque, align them, do operations, remove cavities and fill them.

        "This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you're willing to go broke",
        "Its the best game I have ever played. The things you can build are amazing and it's great that you can build your own to. The controls and graphics are unbelievably amazing. Great animal sounds to, they actually sound exactly the same as a real animal. Its also great that you can have villager's and your own pets. Only problem is the packs you have to use diamonds and if I don't have enough then I have pay for the diamonds and I'm just a kid and my mom says no so please make the packs and the things in them cheaper. But other than that, this game is so AWESOME. 😃",
        "Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.",
        "This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!",
        "Great game but I have been trying to figure out how to chat. before any recent updates when the graphics were different I somehow figured out to chat with someone, but now I can't remember! plz plz PLZ tell me how to chat, and if u removed the ability to chat can u add it in again?",
        "Graphics are great. Controls are great. Variety is great but too expensive. Gameplay is awefully boring. As in, It's too easy, and you must pay for everything so you have no freedom. Also, there is no threat on you whatsoever. YOU can't kill animals or herd them and there's nothing to explore. All you do is build stuff your assigned to build. (Sorry)"

If you're trying to complete a challenge, every couple tries it will reset to free play mode and you have to go intentionally kill yourself which sometimes takes way too long. Then if you don't tap the challenge button exactly right, you have to free play again. Then every time you get back into the challenge screen, you have to scroll all the way through every one you've completed. The game would be fun if it wasn't so infuriating.",
        "I paid the 2 odd dollars to remove the ads since i really enjoyed the game. If you are thinking about doing the same DON'T. Paying the money removes ZERO ads. It simply allows you to skip most of them after 5 to 10 seconds rather than watching the whole 20 to 30 second ad. They still pop up just as often and are just as annoying. Personally I would wait for another developer to make a good clone of the game, shouldn't take long it's a simple engine.",
        "I paid the price to get the ads removed, because I like to support developers and because there were a LOT of ads. The ads were never removed. I have contacted the developers more than once and received no response. Then I contacted the Play Store and they rejected my claim. Now I have paid for the ads to be removed and they are still there at a level that makes the game unplayable. Worst customer service ever; what a waste of money. I will remember this developer and never download another of their apps.",
        "Terrible game. I can't pay twice without having to sit through a full 30 second add. I found it faster to exit out the app and go back in to avoid adds. But there are just too many adds that it made it not fun after the first few goes.",
        "WAY TOO MANY ADS! Its so frustrating that after three failures an ad plays for 30 seconds. Also, why are you asking for access to my storage and location and the ability to make and receive calls? As a developer, get with what your customers want. Then I'll consider buying something.",
        "Far too many ads. One here and there is understandable but after every single try, you get an add. Definitely uninstalled for that reason. As far as the game itself, it's really fun and could be addicting but I spent more time trying to get through the ads than I did playing the game."

        "Simply just needs more events. I get why trading isnt available yet, which is to prevent RMT and if you have RMT that's just the end of the game. But hope you could soon add the 1v1 battle feature, BUT WITH MOVES LIKE THE REAL GAME NOT JUST TAP AND USING THE SPECIAL SKILL.   Overall love it tho, been walking 2km/day for 2 whole weeks now. (Lookin for a gastly xD)",
        "Please have more legendary raid events with gen 1 and 2 Pokemon for new and returning players who want to collect everything. With regards to using GPS and joystick cheats you guys actually benefit by getting more players from rural areas or dangerous areas playing and spending money. Besides you still have to do all the hard work minus the walking so it technically isn't that unfair to others especially since everyone is level 40 these days with legendary Pokemon. The game is already balanced just needs more events. Please consider a premium service to pay for where we can use a joystick in game. We can pay monthly or something so everyone benefits.",
        "I love this game! Been just playing on my wife's account. Just recently decided to make my own, and it will not let me get past choosing my first Pokemon. They all spawn in the same spot and it quickly shows error 11 or whatever and won't even register me moving. I've tried everything to toubleshoot and fix it. Nothings working. Really sucks because I love playing. Can someone fix this or tell me what's going on?",
        "thx for niantic that always listened our sugesttion, but i wish we can trade or battling with other player around the world by staying at poke center or else... - and btw you should update the new gym and new pokestop... since when i was on holiday in Indonesia theres not so much pokestop and gym around :( even there are many landmark in there - another suggestion plz maked some item that can be used to summon legendary/raid battle in location that we want, so its much easier  for the communities to do raid battle in specific location",
        "Can you developers make it so people can trade pokemon and other things like items? Itll make the game sooooo much better if teamates could trade items and Pokemon. People did it with cards, atleast to trade Pokemon. My bf and i play along with his friend David and when one of them need something that i got and visa versa, we should be able to trade. If you guys can make it happen, ill give this 5 stars instead of 4."

        "Good game to pass your time. Upgrade costs and parts spawn rates are reasonable if you only use a few vehicles because it will take a long to yo max out everything. I think it will be better if league vs trophies distribution are reworked because its very easy yo reach legends. should give a higher win bonus at higher trophies i think to make it more competitive. And lastly, hackers should be deleted from leaderbord.. there are a few impossible timings on the board.",
        "I enjoy the game greatly. It's slightly different with  the chest and stuff but it is sure nice to get bonuses every now and than. There are new adds though which I'm not super stoked about like the brake time adds but they keep them short and can be skipped quick if you have already watched them. All and all great game",
        "I love this game. Every game I've had, I played for a week or so, and uninstalled. But this one? Ive had for almost 6 months. Been playing every single day. Finally reached legendary 32, I've unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so. Or at least a new adventure spot. Making a modded version of the rally car would be fantastic. Also, an upgrade on the formula car where it doesn't almost dead stop after it lands from a big air.",
        "If you don't want to give away free stuff from the chests, don't. But stop wasting my damn giving me these \"free\" coins for watching a video only to have the ad freeze %95 of the time. The are plenty of other free games out there, might be time for a change.",
        "Constant ads.  Excruciatingly slow progression unless you pay.  Game crashes more than I crash in the game.  Could have been a great sequel to HCR 1, but it feels like playing a money-grab instead.",
        "Superb game! Too bad, the elements of hate like to hack good things and cause frustrations. For this reason, constantly run constant updates. I wouldn't mind paying through my rather expensive data to diffuse the damage by these bored, small prick nincompoops! Africa😝😝😝"

        "Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!",
        "Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm's Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!",
        "Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I'm just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it's going to be good.  We'll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!",
        "This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10",
        "I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.",
        "Don't get me wrong, these new levels and songs are fun and addictive and all of the new stuff is awesome... but stop making new apps? Why not just update the original? It's kind of frustrating to have a paid version with stuff I've unlocked but have to deal with an unpaid version (aka, ads) and have to unlock skins and colors all over again because new apps keep being made."

        "This game is amazing! A real time waster and It's really fun! But it should really save to the cloud because I was on LVL 38 or something, I had everything, then I had to move to a new tablet and all of my game progress *poof* vanished!! Also, everything's a BIT expensive... Other than that, It's a really good game! Well done Outfit7 😄❤",
        "Everything players have asked for is added. At a ridiculous price.  But if people are paying that's on them.   HOWEVER you shouldn't have to buy the adult /baby formula more than once. If you bought it you should be allowed to switch back and forth as you wish.    It's a really zen pass time  game :) also cute and interactive.",
        "This would totally be worth 5 stars if it weren't for the ADS. I get it's a free game, but its one thing to put an ad on the top or side of the screen. It's one thing to optionally watch ads for coins and prizes. But its another thing when full screen videos pop-up, pausing your game and wasting your time. I was honestly thinking about giving this 3 stars just b/c of how annoying that is alone.",
        "I am so happy for the people who made this app!!!! You guys must make good money off of millions of things that are on this game. I respect you guys more than anything one who has this game. Have a good rest of the year. Love Braylynn Burke",
        "Its so cool and great \"WOW!!!!!\" to the very best game of all  Its bad because its to expensive crystals are so rare in the game and you want from us all the crystals i saved so i am talking about two players this phone and player Kaile ALL THE BEST OF LUCK TRYING TO FIX THE GAME PROBLEM! 👍✌🤘",
        "I do like the game. It gives me something to do with my mine. I DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT EVERY SINGLE TIME I TRY TO PLAY IT, IT POPS UP WITH ADDS SAYING I HAVE A VIRUS!"

        "Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death",
        "Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I'll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.",
        "This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can't seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn't be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it's not something you have to add, it's just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven't seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it's an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘",
        "This game would be great if it wasn't so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn't slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.",
        "The game is great fun. I have been playing it for a few months and actually still play it. The only problem i seem to have with it. Is the laggish performance when i am connected to internet. The moment the internet is off then game runs more smoothly other than that. Still enjoy playing it. Though I must say it would be nice if there was a gem counter for each ride so i know how many I have collected. Otherwise great game",
        "Love it. Only thing is there is a glitch when you watch an ad for 200 thingy things you get a menu that lets you get 200 more. Than again, than again. Its better on our side than yours but it would be a good fox so you have to earn them! I love all your games, wish I had all of them but I have limited storage!"

I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I'm making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.",

I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!",
        "I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn't show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.",
        "So far it's o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It's not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game",
        "The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.",
        "Not 100% sure how that works but the other person has their king and it's a stale mate and I have practically most of my pieces but to unlock harder levels I have to win. Does stalemate not count? I think its pretty stupid"

        "Seems like controls tend to be problematic, and synchronisation has to be adjusted for every song. However the game is wonderful, precise, compelling and worth spending time on! Everything is well thought, new levels and lines are frequently added. So far my favourite app ever, looking forward to playing some new levels and the match option.",
        "I originally had it as 5 stars, but I noticed the longer that I've had the game, the more bugs I'm starting to see. Sometimes the music won't line up with the levels, which is the point of the game, and other times the game won't register my touch and will screw up my progress. If this gets fixed that would be great, and I'd move the rating back to 5 stars!",
        "I really wish you guys didn't update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can't listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!",
        "Amazing game... Loved it...😍 The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it'll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it's okay 😊",
        "This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn't as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn't there but now it's forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.",
        "It's an amazing game. Sure I run around my bedroom screening every time I fail next to the end.... but there is something about this game that makes you happy. Is it the music? Maybe. Is it the back ground and the way it moves?possibly. It's all of those things plus more   In a nut shell I really really really really really really really really really love this game :p"

Im prob gonna try to get more ppl to play with me too lol. There could be more variety in the blocks, and there should be like different modes, just an idea",

The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.",

        "I really really hated it. Just freezes my phone n have to buy a new one  for 4954  dollars. Its just stupid n u really need more tutorial. Make this game have more tutorials n stop this freezing part for a better game n have  a 5 star rating from me n not a 2 star rating. Do u want a 2 star rating or 5 star rating? Just to be clear, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME IF U ARE DUMB. Tks😒😒😒",

        "This game is have potential, don't ruined it because of money. I have never been watching so many ads In my life just to get some 2 stars parts. Instead of being creative and making cool machines, this game is turning to - either pay to win or watch alot of ads to win. What's the point of \"playing\" in this game?",
        "I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I'd end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!",
        "Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It's reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis's and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I'm offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,",
        "I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It's fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn't want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.",
        "Fun strategy game, just wish it was easier to understand upgrades and easier to get a decent vehicle. Sometimes you have to wait for boxes other times you can watch ads to get thru them with no rhyme or reason as far as I can tell. The variety or maybe the lack of variety in boxes is pretty annoying. Sometimes you get the exact same part multiple times or with slight variations, which can drag out trying to get a decent upgrade on things.",
        "Game it self is great and a ton of fun.   But, the system for showing ads is so annoying.  It's not just your normal video ad no, they make you watch 3 different ads and a min of 16 or 11 sec each.  After you have watched the minimum time, you have to hit next and repeat again"

But please nerf the vehicles hitbox radius and how many people can get into a car all at once. I've been killed 6 times now by someone or some people using only a vehicle and running other people over. Nerf the vehicles and I'll rate 5 star.",
        "The game really ok. I love the feature where you can talk to your team online. However, since I've updated my ROS, it became super loggy and now I can't even open it to play. I tried to re-install the game but still, it won't open anymore. What happen? Please fix it immediately.",

Its a good game when it works, which isn't very often for me. And now when I was riding in a three wheeler and a enemy started driving and I crashed, then when I got back I was out of the three wheeler and in the middle of a fire fight and died",
        "Before the update its just normal lag that I used to. But after the update, its getting more lag + delay when try to look around. What I mean is you know when your finger is not sync with character movement (uhh how do I explain this). Sorry my english is terrible. Idk if you get what Im trying to explain. Like 0.5 second delay when look left look right look up look down. Its very hard to aim at enemy and looting and stuff. All of this happen after the Feb 28 update.",
        "This is F ridiculous!! I experienced more glitches after the update!! The updates didnt do anything much about the glitches!! People will just appear from nowhere!! I played this game everyday and every single day i always experience glitches!! The sound is also confusing even if you try to listen.You hear sounds that coming from the back but the enemy is actually in front.",

It's just that i lost my account today and i dont know what's the cause. last time i played it i closed the game when i finished a match by pressing the home button and left it there for a few hours. when i open the game again my account was lost. i forgot to bind my account to any social media because i thought i already binded it by sharing to facebook. is there any way you guys can help me ?"

Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can't join my sister and were only five levels apart.",
        "Absolutely great game ,but you made some far too powerful guns too accessible early in the game, so I went down two trophies after I ran into a bunch of wallet warriors. And for God's sakes put a more powerful gun at the end of the campaign, I worked my ass off and it wasn't worth it. Other than that large rant, I love it so much and play it every day. Make exp,gold and diamond easier to obtain though.",
        "I LOVE this game My only complaint is in campaign mode it's said more worlds coming soon for YEARS!!! If they're not going to add a world eny time soon  they should at least change the coming soon part. But overall this is a good game and it seems like Cubic Games really care about what the consumers think.",
        "This used to be really cool. If you want to be strong buy gem weapons. It is too hard too earn coins or.gems. Also your opponents must be with same armor or level. I once fought a guy with the minigun shotgun and diamond armor and before I rekt everyone with the demoman but now it sucks",
        "This game is so good! I have played this game when it was in its early stages, and it was pretty good. Now it has gotten even better than before, with lots of multiplayer game options and lots of weapons and gadgets to choose from. There is one problem, which is when I got this game about a month or two ago, the prices to upgrade guns were pretty low for coins but ok for gems, but now they are ok for coins and WAY TO MUCH for gems, so I ask of you developers to please decrease the amount of gems it takes to upgrade gem bought guns.",
        "This game is the best I have ever played on a phone tons of maps, game modes, hundreds of guns, different tools, gear, and lots of skins. There is just so many things you can do. I also like it because it is a challenge something I would play. That's why I rated this game 5 stars."

        "When it's not crashing, it's fun to play.  Sucks when it doesn't load of locks up during game play.  Also it gets expensive as you have to buy packs at $99 a pop after the 1st 2.  The game play is addicting, but no fun if you cannot afford the special offers they continue to throw in your face every time you log in.  I love final fantasy games but this particular one is a money pit!.  Not to mention the constant crashing",
        "Please understand that there is really nothing free about this game except the install. While the gameplay WAS very promising at first, purchaseable bonus packs take any strategy completely out of the game. Now, in addition, each new element of the game that has been released in recent weeks requires cash to unlock. I can only use about half of the games features now. Bummer. If you're willing to pay, have a blast with this game. Otherwise leave it alone!",
        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much."

So i was playing the game and i went downstairs. Then there was a button that said: \"Unlock All Rooms For 20 Minutes!\" So i clicked it and my game crashed. The button still shows up when i play the game tho. What do i do?",

        "This game could use better and easier ways to earn money for opening the chests and scoring or pay outs after each prize or game. So you can get better equipment and achievements. Would help keep players more interested. My only dislikes so far. I most definitely enjoy the game and think it's pretty awesome!",
        "Best game period. Not just golf or sports game, but any game. Wouldn't change a thing. All ya all who say, oh they need to change this or that, and why do I have to play someone who's better than me? Well it's because you suck, and you have no hand eye coordination. Just shut up and dribb, uh I mean play. #1 game for a reason peeps. Love ya. Dueces. Peace biatches.",
        "It's cool but everyone seems to be fairly good so all matches come down to a shoot out. Meh. And in the shootouts your opponent can see ur shot if u go first. Meh. All kinds of perks for FB. I don't have FB. Meh. Have to spend $$ to get decent clubs and balls or play this 24/7 and I won't do either lol. Nice try tho playdemic. Cheers.",
        "Just downgraded from a 3.  I just played a game were the other  player hit the ball out of bounds and wasn't given a penalty, then hit a miracle shot from over 100 yards away to beat  me.  I immediately uninstalled after that.  Was a decent game but the devs need to make some major changes.",
        "The game has too many glitches. On top of that there are people who know how to cheat. For example they will aim right at the woods make sure that the ball hooks and then they will be further down the Fairway than you, it makes no sense! Also playdemic is the cheapest most greedy app creator ever. Many people have complained about cheating and they never returned any of your in-app purchases. It's fun to play, but not a fair game.",
        "I think most of the time i am actually playing against a computer and and not a real person . And the computer is programmed to make me lose so that i am forced  spend money on the game. The whole idea of gaming online is to have a friendly yet fair platfotn for people to enjoy and unwind.  So you based on the above very brief of the begining of the end fir companies such as yourselves... i would recommend the following simple advise free of charge.....  Safeguarding  the companies reputation is everything.  The future of gaming ,NOT INCLUDING casino/gambling type apps, will be based on trust and have a more family type target market, and thus should have different business models."

        "What really drew me into this game was the the Pac-Man promotion, I love a good crossover and I can say with total certainty that I wouldn't be playing it if I couldn't play as Pac-Man, he's such a good inclusion. It's a super addictive game, setting it aside to do something else is quite difficult, hours go be seamlessly when playing it. The graphics as well are beautiful, very vibrant and colourful.   I have a few minor gripes with the game though, it crashed on me and when I restarted the game I had briefly lost all my content, that gave me a minor scare. The game is heavily geared towards microtransactions as well, unless you're prepared to pay money, get ready for a very, very long grind trying to get the stuff you want. Having said all that I absolutely love the game, very glad I downloaded it.",
        "Game looks good and it's well design, but far too many gimmicks and interruption. Hardly ever can actually run. Plus some silly hanging in the air for no reason. Got bored in 5 m",
        "Sonic Dash has a plethora of characters to unlock and play as. Some require real money, but most of them can be unlocked with Red Star Rings, and all of the characters can be won through events. You can even get Classic Sonic and Green Hill Zone! And every once in a while, they'll add some characters from different franchises to run as for a limited time, and if you unlock them, you'll be able to play as them forever.",

        "This is a very fun game. It got me hooked for hours. However, there are still some things that need improvement. For example, when walking sideways along fences you can get over them. This is an issue as once i did this and fell into the water not being able to get back on. Also, the spikes do not seem to have an effect on the shark so they are useless. I do believe that the developer needs to continue to work on this game and introduce new items and uses for them.",
        "It's honestly a pretty good game, it's fun, even though there's no real end goal and a lack of side quests. Although many improvements can be made to the game, the worst part is the ads, it's really bad, and it's insulting as a player that they try to milk this much out of us. You have constant random ads that take over your game at any moment. 5 ads per chest you craft to unlock each slot, ads when you switch to the map, floating treasure chests that require ads to open, even more pointless ads at every crafting bench, and the list goes on. I would gladly even pay to play an ad free version, but this is just ridiculous.",
        "I never get any mission do to. Give me an update plz",
        "You cannot walk on wooden fundations and you cannot walk on single or double foundations. Please fix this it is very annoying and im not able to play the game, because when the shark attacks in a corner you cannot hit him with your spear. This is the same for the zombie. I built a little house on the raft and it spawned behind the wall of my house. Please fix it",

And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.",
        "Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I'm sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP",

Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won't make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least",
        "I want YOU to read this Toca Boca I love it! But I have to ask, Why is there bread if you can't make a sandwich? Also can you make there a way to make soup? I really like your games but I am only 10,how do you expect me to pay for the games. At make 5 free like this!",
        "I like how I can give the guests disgusting drinks and food a see and hear their really funny reaction! Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!😆😆 I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!",
        "I LOVE this app! And I'm so glad it's free! Everyone is like 'it's the same thing over and over again' but they're not actually getting into this game. They're are tons of different options to choose from and like Toca Boca says cook it your way. I LOVE TOCA BOCA!!!"

Example: the total was 17.04m and I harvested 500k and the total didn't change even tho it should have been 17.54, seemed to happen frequently which slows down your progress.",

Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven't tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.",
        "It's my favorite app. I love it a lot. My only issue is that it doesn't quite accurately update my stats especially my highest score without using a 'save me,' longest run, most coins & gems. I would really like the developers to look into that but otherwise it's a brilliant game.",
        "Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a \"slide,\" I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don't compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.",
        "Nice, good, adventure game.but some times your team irritating who one completed thirteen level they will easily get diamond  your giving master challenge ( now the challenge Chinese New year )who one complete your giving thirty diamond only.this offer will useful only for entry level gamers. Most of players finished fourteen level so they no need diamonds.so think about genius players.",

Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.",
        "Brilliant game play with nice updates. However, certain things can be improved. For example, the gem powered power up is not clear. I am not sure whether the power up works only for one time use or for entire one run. Kindly, help to enlight users on this part."

Problem: i can't raise enough money and food and please make the tiara cheaper so i can save lots of money.     Note:It must be made when January 1 2018 thank you!                                             Email:knoxdune 2014 com. Nickname:Ichiko /Love it very much thank you! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤",
        "I was addicted to the game the first time I played it.  Still love it and have put it on every device I've had since I was first introduced to the game.  Pou has been a constant source of entertainment for over three years!  Love love  love it!  Oh and I almost forgot to tell you that I am 56 years old!!  Lol. It is really that fun to play!",
        "It's been more than a year that you haven't added any mini game in any update. You've written on \"What's New\" section that \"We're working on something big\" but you .haven't shown that big work yet😅..At least add more mini games...And I'll rate 5.",
        "I wish you didn't have to wait for a long time for a item. Like, for example, if a hat was level 60. Then you have to wait for a long time. Please instead of doing levels. Please just make them expensive. Because you need to wait.",
        "After I posted my recent comment, there were some angry comments pointed out at me. I apologise for that. I mean, this game in great! There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars. For someone who says \"too many notifications\", go to the settings and turn off that notifications button. Thank you for those hate critics you guys made. It really teached me a lesson."

But can msp add a private photo send so only People  you know well can see your photos! Thank you if you can and please add more things to app .Also can you add more chats games and shops to msp?:)",
        "I love this game! It's super fun on all devices,  but I find you are more privileged if you are on a PC/Laptop of some sort. Maybe if you could add a lot of things from the PC version to the mobile device version things would be a lot more fun. Mainly Wishlists because they are really fun! MSP is currently updating at this moment",

Oh well I ha e a new account and I've met am amazing friend myv my new bff YAAA lol k bye",
        "Hi movie star planet! I dislike something's on movie star planet like how people get bullied for things and how expensive VIP is! And also How expensive clothing and stuff is make it all free! And leveling up...On the app make a way to level up quickly as well. Also... BRING BACK SAMANTHA!!!! MEH AND HER A BFFFFFFFFFFFFFF'S!!!!",
        "The game is ok I mean it's really nice like I love it my friend introduced me to it. The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 stars is because there is not much to do although it's a beautiful gsme. It's addictive too. For those who said it's boring they should think again",

        "This game is very fun and addictive but should have offline mode so we don't have to deal with a hacker every game.  Also after new update I'm having issues getting into the game. It says \"check comnection\" and my connection is fine even tried uninstalling it and all. Other games work on my phone and so does my Wi-Fi. The game just worked last night for me now it doesn't! PLEASE FIX!!",
        "Please bring back the old brewery map. I have been a long time player of this game, and loved the original brewery map. The new update of the map is so radical that it feels like an entirely different map, with all the pathways and corners. The uniqueness of the original brewery map is that it is small, and relatively open, so that combat is focussed and fun. There is more time fighting others than moving around trying to find enemy players. The new update just ruins that uniqueness, making it feel like the Bureau or Legacy map. I am okay with the new brewery map being a new addition, but please make it \"Brewery 2\" and bring back the original Brewery.",
        "Just good. This game is great. The controls are completely customizable so you can make it work the way you want it to. Graphics are on point, better than 2nd Gen consoles, lesser than 3rd gen. If this game came out in the age of the PS2 I would have bought it. Also, buy a box because this game couldn't have been cheap to make. This game should cost like $25.",
        "Could you please add an offline mode...would be nice to practice on the go. Also please please please add more guns. I have been playing this game for a year and still no new guns but glad you are keeping up with the maps. I have this HUGE problem, it says check connection when I have good connection. I tried to restart my phone and reconnect but still doesn't work. PLEASE FIX.",
        "I loved the game before. It was one of the best fps game I have ever seen. But after the ban in pc you guys have lost a lot of players. And I too now hate the game. It was moreover greater than counter strike go, but after the ban you guys made all of us disappointed. If you would have continued with this game on pc I am surely telling that this would be known as people's choice game. So please consider to it and bring back this game on pc.  Thank you,  Your great full player",
        "I love the game, it's great and there's not many fps games like these for mobile phones. My only problem is I can never play ranked. For whatever particular reason I can't even find other players. The game just stays searching forever and I really want to play ranked. I would have voted 5 stars but thats the only thing that bugs me. Please fix and will be happy to give 5 stars."

        "I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.",
        "I think it would be better if you got more gems. You can barely win anything on that little slot machine. I also noticed that you no longer get gems for every day you log in to play. Sure, the money is nice but you can't upgrade with just the money you earn while playing. I spun that slot machine 80 plus spins and barely won anything. Do the gems even pop up as a winning combo? They used to but not anymore.",
        "I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It's pricey but we'll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn't need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get",
        "This game is an amazing way to pass the time! I love all the upgrades and different levels, especially the events. The game gets more challenging as you go along, and the events I previoisly mentioned make it just that much better. My only complaint is how hard it is to get the special currency of the game, being diamonds. Other than that, it is a great game overall and I am looking forward to future updates.",
        "I loved the game but after the first restaurant you need gems to upgrade things regularly and they do not come around often after the first restaurant. All the achievements are money based. Money is easy to come by and I have only won on the casino once and all the fun is lost grinding to make money to spend on the slot machine to try and get gems. I'm on the second restaurant and I'm bored of waiting for gems to upgrade now.",
        "It would be nice for updated casino with new slot machine games and also some new restaurants.  Last one was quite sometime ago?  Are you still actively developing the game or you called it quits like some other games I had to uninstall because there was nothing left to do in them.  Just curious....."

Overall great game when they game out with the sequel it addressed the main problem with this one mainly no other maps and you have to pay to get the female character",

        "It's a bordom filler but that's about it. Is kind of boring it's self but I like it. It's a pretty cool game. Good job on the graphics tho. The animations are really nice. The gameplay functions are really simple. I give it a good solid meh",
        "I love temple run  its a fun game it's a good idea I always play it,  I usually hate games like subway surfers I thought it would be like that too much,but I'm glad I tried it it was awesome the one thing I would complain about is you shouldn't  be stealing an idol and toward the 300,000 score I start to get very dizzy the controls are nice I just don't like the tilting for coins it's very distracting"

        "Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can't stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn't happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can't buy any of the bikes.",
        "After only playing a few short but addicting levels, I am already having a blast! The game may not look spectacular on a technical level. But the gameplay is so freaking fun! And the controls aren't too complicated either. Recommended for everyone!",
        "It's a fun little game at first, but has many, many flaws. You have to link it to your Facebook account if you wanna play all maps. There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can't play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That's just ridiculous. Not to mention it's very buggy. Sometimes you're racing someone who's in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it's just stupid.",
        "Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you're racing friends.",
        "Bugs and Glitches... Multiplayer links are not being sent back and forth properly. Some games keep giving me desert level 1 and not showing any replays or ghost bikes are doing a different levels then the one I am suppose to be racing against. Please Fix!!!",
        "I love it!!! Although it would be really really really awesome if there was like 3d tracks.   I don't want to pressure you but, that would be amazing!!! I've had this game on almost every device I've ever owned!!!   It's so addicting and fun I can not click off of it no matter how hard I try!!"

        "Very fun game. Multiplayer is awsome! Please add private matches so i can play with friends.   Physics still need work to hold up to real world standard. Rocks dont follow thru on take outs in real life as they do in this game. Also (rules), a rock needs to make it all the way over the hogline in order to stay in play.  Thank you for making this game!",
        "Best curling game I've seen Enjoy the graphics, controls, love the 1 on 1 against international players and career game options. Seems consistent and easy to learn. Needs a few tweaks like... throws that don't make hog line or touch hogline must be taken out of play. Have seen the bug that others reported, sometimes rock after thrown disappears , some kind of glitch that happens occasionally.  Sometimes the sweepers don't react to my movement to sweep. Would love to see 8 stones instead of 6. If you love curling, this should satisfy",
        "Great game except for hackers. There is a hack that allows some to bump or change finish of a throw. Yoy can go from having 2 scoring to opponent having the score, changing after the rocks stopped. Developers have not replied ti report. Fine for some fun but don't waste your money in upgrades",
        "The physics of this game are terrible. It's fatal flaw is if you have a completely frozen rock, you physically can't remove it, but this game you can completely remove 3 rocks even if they are all frozen. Also the free guard rule is very loosley applied. This game clearly was not created by someone who has ever curled.",
        "Physics are not like real curling, rocks are dead in the house when hit, physically impossible doubles and triples, improper use of the free guard zone rules (if a rock is in the house, it is free to be removed...not in this game).  Connecting people across the globe is a cool idea but you frequently lose people and you win without finishing a game.  I've played for 35 years so I speak from experience.",
        "Full of cheaters Started to play and it was awesome. But it seems that some people created cheats and make your pins move from their places without even theirs touching them so that they win points. I will not play it until its updated and try again. Too bad."

        "A giant mess of people who pay a ton of money to prey on anyone with impunity. Absolutely no rules regarding who or how often you can attack someone significantly lower in level. Even if you are stupid enough to pour money into this garbage, you will get your butt handed to you by someone else.",
        "Has alot to keep you busy. For that i give 5 stars. Minus 1 star because certain features in the game cannot be unlocked unless you spend money. To me thats a recipe for a slow death. For i will soon be leaving guns of glory in a blaze of glory based on that alone.",
        "You guys really need to do some balancing. It's ridiculous that a level 22 guy can just annihilate me when I'm level 10. Its pretty blatant that you're trying to force us to pay to play. You should make it to where you can only attack X levels below you and the further down you go, the less loot/xp you get, if you attack even or higher you get bonus loot/xp. Good game but needs rebalancing asap or your game will slowly die.",
        "This is for the makers of this game you need to introduce rules so that players who either work for the makers or spend 100's to become strong very quickly... cannot destroy the enjoyment of the game for those of us who would like to grow in the game and play the game properly to become strong through perseverance and hard work... the cash rich players are ruining this game for everyone...",
        "Need some updates like 2 simultaneously upgrade option. Less but more extensive research. Lengthy process is boring. I know by spending money u can get rid of it but money making shouldn't be always a concern.",
        "Game is absolutely nothing like the commercial on you tube. Kingdom #152 never wins in the INN at the mystical raffle. If you have ever played an MMO game on a cell phone app you'll know exactly what to do. Spend money to advance. Great for killing time."

Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It's a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It's very competitive!!! I swear my husband can't beat my score no one has lol",
        "It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone's or tablets I find it hard to control I don't know if anyone else thinks so but that's my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company",
        "It's good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it's my opinion so don't get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don't have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn't play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀",
        "Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface",
        "A very addictive game that's great fun! The only problem is with the controls. It seems to go too fast without even hitting the speed button (if you have played it you will know what I mean). IMO the speed function is uneccesary, take it out of the game and it's 5 stars all the way!",
        "Great game however I wish there was a way to avoid the button that makes you speed up suddenly.  This us partially because you use your fingers to maneuver it and your fingers can get in the way of your view of the screen. It could cause you to kind if lose control of your worm."

        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "Addictive, colourful and charming. I love it because I've spent zero real money on it and am at over level 280! I only use my in game coins when I'm desperate and I'm fine only playing a few times a day to let lives regenerate. Some levels are so frustrating but that's why you save the coins!",
        "Addictive, waiting 30 mins for a life is a pain. Also some of the levels are redicilously hard, esp when u get a rubbish sequence, always happens on lemonade levels!  Reason for 3 stars is mostly because, when u have struggled to get the stars for a task, when u open it, it's all chat & u have to get more stars to complete the actual task, I think that's unfair, 3 stars for a phone call, then another 3 for the job?  And the safe task? No option not to do it & can only prevail of the gamers winnings if u spend real money to buy the coins you earned.",
        "Should make the money in higher value as it is very hard to accumulate.  Poor marks because it takes so much of your hard earned levels and drops you down the ranks if you don't solve immediately.  I was at ruby level and have so many points taken away now I am back to silver....uninstalling thanks for nothing.",
        "I really enjoy this game, its quite addictive but i find it very satisfying. The only problem with it is that once you get into higher levels (i'm at 300) you start needing tons of stars for small things and for instance to get rid of one stump takes like 8 stars. Anyway I like the game and am going to keep playing it.",
        "If I could give it 0 stars I would. There is no way to contact support and you can't restart the game. I got a bad download and now I'm stuck with it. My personal information should not be part of playing a match 3 game anyhow. Game crashes at least once a day and my controls only work about 60% of the time. Horrible experience! Playrix should be ashamed of their programming here."

        "I really like this game, kind of wish the progression system was a bit quicker though, other than that, the tight controls, open world and variety of creatures you can eat make it a solid game. The special sharks look really cool, and I even considered buying one until I saw the 50$ price tag.   On a side note, what's the difference between this app and the Hungry Shark World?",
        "Winnings suck. Instructions are very vague. Way too many ads. Feel like in order to play you have to pay in order accomplish levels and continue story campaign. Sorry guys but I bet my criticism has been said over and over again. Result is boredom. Too many other games to waste my time playing. Need to fix these if you wish to keep this game on the market people!!!!",
        "It's a really fun game, but sometimes you'll play a video to revive your shark and the video will play but you don't get another life afterwards. It's hard to believe that it is a WiFi problem because if it was an ad wouldn't be able to load at all. Also, I have paused the game before and come back minutes later and the game had kicked me out and not saved any coins/gems gained from that round. They clearly have a few bugs to work out.",
        "i would rate 5 stars... but.. something with the cloud save broke, i used to have the megalodon, without any cheats.. but now i have the mako. could you fix this somehow? And do i email the support team? Im not good with all the emailing stuff.",
        "I thought it was SUPER DUPER AMAZING. Keep that game like this and don't change it. But whenever I would eat like a lot, then I don't get bigger and it said the more you eat the more bigger you get. So I think you should make that better. If u wouldn't have done that then I would be impressed by the game.",
        "Amazing game. I completed this game in 48 minutes Hahaha! Because I used luckypatcher :) I downloaded the luckypatcher in Googlechrome But it can harm your Device..... And the last shark is Moby dick His baby is as big as Megalodon."

Bcoz most of the player i encounter is mexecan or spanish.. 1 more thing i hope you add a larger map i guess for team battle i think 4km x 4km is enough.. And 30mins of total playing time.. All in all fantastic game.. A two thumbs up for you guys. Keep it up",
        "I could have given five stars. The only problem is the number of players per drop/game. Please change it to 80 to 100 range. Pretty sure youll have a lot of players and ill be glad to recommend it in my facebook page if youll be able to increase the max players. It tends to become boring when you see only 12 players left when the safe zone did not even appear yet. You will look like a rat looking for a cheese around the map. More players means more fun. If you'll take this suggestion seriously, you will thank me later.",
        "I love this game, today i jus download the game, cause my friend ask me tooo download this game and he also said it was fun! So I download it, and he was correct, this game is fun, I just become level 4! Not so soon I will become level 5! Yay for me😁 And I already bought the 1500 Diamond suit! It is so expensive!😲 but I just want to show  I am not a noob and I like to show at people who dosen't heve it, lol😂 and also I loved the game very much, so thank you for making this game and shout out to my friend Imbran! And bye😁",
        "The best survivor royale esque game you can find on the play store. Takes up immensely less space than others like Rules of Survival. Anyone can play this, no matter the quality of their phone. It's intense solo, duo, and squad gameplay will always have you coming back to take a shot (no pun intended) at another win. An amazing feature is it's voice chat communication system. You can talk to your teammates (though unfortunately, I find most players speak Spanish. You may have more luck.) though i wish there was a text chat as well. It will hopefully come in the next update, bur I would definitely recommend getting this game. My only other suggestion is new maps, a night mode, more weapons, and attachments.",
        "This is a really great game, I think it can go to heights where it'll have a PC version with a bigger city, more weapon's and kill tactics. It should really consider creating a store which has more item's though . Also can you add gas cans strategicallyy to the game, I'd love to blow up someone hiding in a factory :) . Other than that, its a gteT game , I'm at Level 13  and have tons of kills already in all modes so I figured you deserve a review at this point.   Keep up the great work, I love this game so far.",
        "good game. but I think u garena should add more trees, buildings, and others. and I thinks its good if we can play 5-10 players in one team in squad game cause in GUILD the max. members're 20 players. sorry for my bad english"

I got afkers on my team in 4 consecutive classic games, and I still get feeders even though my rank is quite high.. why do I get paired up with feeders, I have no clue.  Goodbye mlbb, was great when I acually got a decent team and is actually capable of winning instead of having no chance at all and get trashtalked by opponents thinking they are all that.",
        "It's a pretty amazing game, like league of legends but what makes it amazing is that you can play it on your phone. The only problem is the prices of the heroes and skins. Most of the heroes are 32k battle points.. So it would be fair if it was at least 5k cheaper than that. Also the game lags sometimes which interups gameplay which can cause you to unexpectedly die.  For anyone who is reading this, I highly recommend this game to anyone.  It's amazing and extremely addictive!!",
        "I think this game is great! I play It Almost Everyday And My Mum Always Has To Scold Me For Playing Too Much! Its Addictive And Fun To Play! Just A Few Things You Guys Could Work On. 1)I Hope That You Guys Will Let Us BE ABLE To Sell Hereos And I Bet Others Agree. 2)I Also Hope You Guys MAKE IT EASIER For Us To Get BP'S I Really Really Hope You Guys Get To Fulfill My Request! Its a good game!",
        "Not enough with unskippable tutorials now you want us to level up till lvl 8 to be able to change account? Here's some suggestion, make a button just before the tutorial, for login purposes for those who have old accounts. I mean, people sometimes reset their phone and you want us to play till level 8 again just so we can play old account? Be realistic developers.",
        "I like the game. My low rating is because I had to reset my phone and now have to go 8 lvl again just to reload into my account. It's bad enough you are forced to play the practice modes over again but lvl 8 is almost to ranked again. Why put that time in again. Lvl 5 maybe/understandable. But you've made me not want to play this game anymore and it's sad because I enjoyed it",
        "Quite simply a super fun game. This game does exactly what it is supposed to, which is provide a fun portable moba experience condensed into short bursts of fun. This is one of the few games where even losing is a fun experience for me. Pros - wide range of heroes, fun over the top cartoon graphics, multiple game modes, great community and incredible speed of matchmaking that still some how retains quality of matchups. Cons - I am personally not a fan of the joystick based control system, the heroes require quite a bit of time playing before you can get enough in game currency to unlock them. So if you haven't already started playing this game then you are definitely missing out"

        "I love the game, the crafting system is awesome, the gameplay is great. However, there are some points that I suggest  1. Nerf the Damned, also the Lepers, they are strong for beginners. Club or Cart Thills can't beat them easily 2. Make another way to find leek seeds 3. Lepers can detect you sneaking to them, and they spawn out of nowhere. I don't know if it is a bug to me or not. 4. Cooking meat uses too much wood.  I look forward for more updates. It's a great game to be honest.  Edit: I love the events, especially the cart one.",
        "Honestly it's a great game and lots of fun but that energy mechanic needs to change. I know you can walk but it's still such a strange thing to gate your players out of playing.  Maybe if you could always travel at the same speed but if you didn't spend energy you could be attacked randomly while you travel. Or if energy was used to speed up crafting. I dunno but it's the only thing holding me back from a perfect score.",
        "This game is awesome but here are the things like really want in the next game. 1. I need to disconnect with Google play to delete my old saved progress full of mistakes. Please add this feature. 2. Zombies are too hard to beat . Please decrease some of their capabilities. 3. There must be an increase in chest slots . 4. Please decrease the quantity of wood logs to cook. Otherwise all of our hardworking to gather logs while be replaced by only a few meats and others. 6. Please add another source of getting seeds. They are too hard to get.",
        "Very good idea but lack of some stuff like improvements. Right now the demolition system not work and we cannot move the walls or floors. The energy should be more sustainable and will be good if the trees on the base and some stuff randomly spawn. I will drop the game for now and on the future i Will give another shoot",
        "The game is ok.. i love the idea.. but in all RPG and similar games you can accuire your items from when you died from your body in that zone.. also its good when you enter the inventory to pause the game.. when entering a zone the game should give some time before reseting the material and monsters if the player re-enters the same zone.. These are the most critical points so far i have encountered.. please take these in consideration.. thank you",
        "It does look good but I get the feeling it's a \"stolen\" idea of the game Last Day on Earth because it's almost the exact same thing with a few minor differences. But I'm ok with that. I have both games and play them both. But this game has very sketchy game play, even with the graphics on low on my device, it's all fidgity while collecting in the resource areas. This game, though I think has better overall visuals that LDON, it still has a ways to go to get to a better game play as LEON. Keep up the good work!"

It says it failed because I would not allow them access to my friends list. Something doesn't seem right about that. Never had a game NOT allow me to login, after denying access to my friends list. Sorry, would prefer you not send messages to all my friends with my name tagged on it.",
        "I think this game is a really fun addicting game. The main reason why I got it was because of 8 ball pool. That game is also very fun. The only thing I don't like about football strike is that when I get on sometimes it won't let me click the spinner. So it's like my phone froze. But my phone didn't freeze. It's just the app. So can you guys please fix this.",
        "At first I was skeptical about this game. I had downloaded it and went without playing for a couple of weeks. Then,one day I just happen to open the app and play. Best move I ever made for an app! This game is just flat out addicting, fun and challenging.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much fun it is and that there is, most of the time, something new.  Chalkenign friends and new people always makes for a challenging and fun time waster. Even if I don't have the time to play, I still make time!! Haha",
        "There is a bug in your game I went first of my league, supposingly I am entitled to 350 cash, but it wasn't there.  How could you make it so unfair for someone. Why bother having a prizes if not given to the right person.",
        "I am in love with this game.. But the only bad thing happened today and I'm very disappointed. I won carnival cup so I should get the announced price which includes 2 VIP  cards also. I didn't get my prize and I'm really very upset. I have a screenshot of winning cup also.. I hope miniclip will help me. I'm expecting my prize from you. I really love this game.",
        "Awesome online multi-player but less choices of kits and bags take too much time to be opened.Also there is some lag faced while playin with data connection hope you'll fix that for my device. A little optimization would make it better"

        "I've liked this game for years. Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you're still coasting or you're in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You've had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven't fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!",
        "The best racing game ever, I've played this game along time ago. the first version it has 4/5 cars it was so fuuun.That was 5 years ago now I want to play it again.I feel the nostalgia ooohh the good old days.Now I'm going to install the game.U guys change my life Thank u guys soo much guys. I hope my tears will help u guys. :)",
        "Great game, but I only have one issue which prevents me from giving 5 stars. This issue is that the hot rod doesn't go as fast as it should, I know this because I have grown up around hot rods and Rockabilly since birth. This is only a small problem for me, but it prevents me from enjoying the game as much as I'd like to. Please improve it.",
        "Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it's just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............",
        "For this game to be so simple compared to todays games and grafics, I love it. I spend hours sometimes playing this.  Not to mention they keep upgrading and making it beter and better, keep it up fellas....i havent experienced any of the problems mentioned withthe updates others have but until then great game",
        "Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!"

It seems like in 38 years with all the technology we have today , someone would finally figure out that when you go up, You go up and not right and when you go right it goes right and not down. Not the case here. Man we have games that live life for you basically. But still cant figure out how to fix pac man. REALLY? And the ads an ad after every board. Ads ads ads and then guess what? Another ad. Very shameless",

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I've progressed it's just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I'm not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "Honestly gameplay and all is good but the game is so p2w it's not funny, it would cost u over a hundred dollars just to complete every reward for new Valentine's event. If you like this game play private server instead this version is a giant cash grab. Not competitive for f2p at all",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend."

But when I was in a house in the game, I found a hilarious thing ..... Doritos the chips, hahaha it was really funny! Also when I went to the supermarket in goat simulator I found lays, Doritos and Oreos..can u imagine??!!!?!?!? Then I hit a girl and a boy with a gas car but they didn't die??!!! and that's a little bit creepy and weird. If u r asking a question why goat simulator got all of those downloads the 500 million I will answer u, cuz it's perfect and no 1 can do a game better than this. The graphics and gameplay and costumes!!",

        "It's nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it's not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It's just not fair.",
        "A lot of Numberlink programs have \"fake\" puzzles - they have multiple solutions unless additional non-standard \"rules\" are followed... which are NEVER fun. This app doesn't do that. These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.",
        "I have now completed a 365 day streak... During this past year of playing this game daily, I've had an idea. What if once you hit a certain amount of streak days you unlock a new something? Like a new pack or flow color? That would be nice so that you are working towards something. :)",
        "I loved flow free from a young age. I've played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I've tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs",
        "Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.",
        "Was a great game until about 48 hours ago. I didn't mind the ads but now after every level I complete there's a video ad. Even then I would deal with it but it closes my music player. So after the ad I have to go to the music player and start it again but then when I switch back to the game I have to relaunch and reselect the level. Gets annoying to have to do after every level"

Can you please make changes",
        "So far, I dig this game. Although, the individuality of it is scarce. I still play it and enjoy it. It's not identical to other games of this type, as the challenges are similar yet different. The scenario of the game is basic with the others. I have a variety when it comes to games, this one has similar sound affects to other games that I, personally, downloaded. (But they're also from the same makers.) This game is over all.... Good so far.. I would recommend, linked my account to this game and invited friends and family. (I only do so, if the game/app is worthy. I'm a picky bull!!!!) Overall, you'll have fun! Cute toys and  unique power ups, with a slightly (10%) twist.",
        "Definitely addicting. The levels are challenging, the tools are fun to figure out and the reward set up is not unattainable. The only other thing is they grew more wise  for the latest update, you can't change the time on your phone to add lives anymore! Probably better that way, one (read: I) should pace themselves when playing....",
        "This is by far the most fun I've  had with a game app! Its so cute and  colorful!  And each increase in difficulty  makes you want to keep coming back for the next challenge.  What also makes it awesome  is a no brainer,  its great for children and adults alike.  BIG THUMBS UP!",
        "Really enjoyed the game until I was entered in a two week tournament.  Now, the boards are incredibly difficult and I can no longer earn prizes on a regular basis. Of course, I suppose that's by design so I spend money. Which I won't do. I just want some \"bubblegum\" to past the time.  Now, it's making my blood pressure rise...  Also amazing how many 5 ⭐ ratings they get in one day without the user giving explanations on why. Seems suspicious...",
        "Not happy! I'm up to level 1521 and for some reason it's taken me back to level 1. What is going on? I've been playing for about a year and NOT happy I'm back to level 1 again. This has now happened to me 3 times where I have been at maximum levels into the legends arena and BOOM! All my levels are gone all my boosters  - which I have paid hundreds of dollars buying are gone. Support do not respond to my repeated requests to resolve this. Very disappointed I've been playing this for almost 2 years."

        "Horrible. The only reason people say its good is to get a reward in the beginning. This game is terrible it give viruses. It makes my phone slow and all this might just be my opinion but it really is a terrible game that I wouldn't recommend. One game everyone should get if they, yunno, ACTUALLY WANT FUN NON-VIRUS GAMES, is hellopets. And BTW sorry for the grammar and stuff I don't wanna go back and fix it.",

        "lnstaII 'VEARN' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won't make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It's also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII 'TOYOCASH' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.",
        "I love the game play and graphics. But I payed for adidas female clothing and an aquarium previously on the game, and then when I restarted, they have gone. I spend £3 on it in total and I actually spent more money on other things that didn't come back in the next game, but it's understandable because they were lifestyle points and you know it's currency not clothing or furniture. I uninstall sims sometimes a bit of always go back and before my items were there, but now they're not and that really frustrated me. I actually ended up in 2017 spending  £10 on sims freeplay and that's the only money I think I will ever spend on ot now because if you restart,  you don't get anything you wanted. Please fix this because I spent that money and I could've bought something else with it but I didn't because I like sims.",
        "Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools \"playable\",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it'd be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.",
        "First, I don't like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don't like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you're just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!",
        "Love it addictive,if u like the sims on the pc you will like this.If you are a patient person you don't need to spend money either. Update it has lost stars as I don't want to spend money and now you need vip to get to the next stages of things. Disappointed with this. If you didn't have to pay for anything it would be 5 stars.",
        "Im hardcore addicted to this game. I have only 2 complaints about this game. The first is that there isnt a cheaper $1 or $2 life point pack, just for like 5 life points. I love this game but not enough to spend $5 on the cheapest life points.  My second complaint is that babies almost seem to be the defult sim that you switch to as soon as you make an adult do anything. Because of this i end up just making the babies hibernate constantly because of how annoying it is if you are trying to make all your sims grow crops or something.  Other than that, i love it."

Rest it's surely one of the best game of EA and undoubtedly for the football lovers..Keep updating... I would like it more if you improve the physics of the game like curving the ball etc....please make it....",
        "After the last update, vs attack mode has become more frustrating. Before update I could compete with teams with higher rating. Now I'm losing to teams lower than me. The camera angle at corners is terrible. How did you make it worse? Before update would have given it a five star rating, now three.",
        "Vs mod is so bad after update. I have ovr 99. After update i lost many games from some guys who have ovr 94-95 because u didn't give me as many great chances as u predict. Once i played against 98 ovr player. He had 2 great and 6 good chances, i had 6 good chances and 0 great. It isnt ok.",
        "Had been playing this game for past 5 years. Its probably the best game in playstore. I had gone through lots of new events, campaign. The new updates are getting even better and better.    The only problem is league tournament needs to be worked on. The tournment matches between two league must be a equalised in terms of their player and team rating. Sometimes leagues tournament are so hard..",
        "Hey fifa, it been like this even before the Toty event Almost 2 months, no adds, no stamina for me, this really unfair, all of my friends are getting adds stamina, TOTY, Carniball, and now Lunar year Those eventy went extremely terrible and useless to me with no stamina!!  Please help me and fix this, my app is up to date, and i even re unstall it a few times desperately trying ro get adds back! But it was no good 😔😔",
        "My stamina is never getting increased for every 10 minutes... I never knew there was an option like that until my friend said to me... And the update, the quest possible thing that can ever happen to this game was that update, it takes around 10 seconds to open a pack and the gameplay, the worst of the worst is the gameplay, everything is messed up and in news i get message saying considering your reviews and feedback something is changed, now consider these feedback of the update and change, if it doesn't change, there is no use is continuing this game and uninstalling is the only option. I wish to get an reply for this problem! Thanks in advance!"

        "Love that you can now earn gems from reading.  However part of the fun of games like this is the outfits and personalization of your character. Outfits and style choices should be free to choose the best one that advances you in the story. It's not fun playing a game that forces you to fail/have a negative outcome. Big decisions/game altering choices should cost gems that makes it fun spending your savings but ultimately free outfit/style choices please",
        "I LOVE THIS! But, just a thing, you could like ask on every episode (that the app creators make) like 'what's your gender and preference to date' because all the creator made ones at like just girls, and I know males play as well. Not hating AT ALL,I LOVE this app SO MUCH! Just tryna help ya improve! Luv you episode! (Or make more that are inclusive of gender) MEOW LOVE U",
        "I really like 90% of this game. However, the way the passes are done really suck. I absolutely love when the 30 days unlimited ad free pass comes up for $9.99. Without it I practically refuse to play. It doesn't seem to be available as of a few days ago. I'm glad I recently purchased. Would also be cool to have a feature where you can send passes to friends.",
        "It's an ok app and this is my third time redownloading it, the character designs have gotten better but there only problem I have, the tickets, like really? 2 tickets? First it was 5, then 3, now only 2. Not everyone has money to waste on games, especially tickets, not only that but their overpriced, like any other add on pack/item. I wouldn't even be surprised if I deleted this and redownloaded back in a year and they only give you one ticket a day.",
        "Love this game! The only part I don't like is that all of the best options cost diamonds and you literally have to pay for them. It makes sense for an app, but it happens to often. It ruins the story because I won't buy any diamonds. I'll rate this 5 stars if they at least change it to not as often.",
        "I LOVE IT except in pitch perfect, ALL the good choices cost 20 diamonds and I'm not wasting my money on all of that. Can you make it less often? And the passes take too long to come back. Or at least make it more passes every 3 hours"

        "i thought this was going to be a really fun game...until i realized that there are only 2 game modes that are available to play, and you have to pay for everything that would be somewhat fun in the game. i was very disappointed in what i found when i opened the app. why not just make the game cost $3.99 if that's what it costs for all the features?",
        "Awful. Have to pay to do anything. You can only play two game modes and only have two teams to play with",
        "I like it...but I hate how you have to pay for the game modes like you can only play 2 modes",
        "Why on earth can I only do 2 game modes what they actually have included for free is great but I can't understand why here is only 2 modes and only 2 teams on face off it also forces me to have ads",
        "Worst game I've ever played and I've played a lot of rubbish games",
        "For some reason it wouldn't let me load the game it kept crashing."

I suppose it is quite addictive but I lost interest after a few goes. It wasn't my cup of tea so to speak. I hope this review was helpful and remember to give it a big thumbs up!!! Be sure to look out for my trade mark \"Xxx\" and I'll see you next time!! Bye! Xxx. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍",

I'm disappointed, expecially for the \"restore purchase\" button that not works. Despite this I think that as a game is fun but monotonous in the long run, defect of 90% of apps of this kind. I hope developers will add something with updates that are not other challenges that ofter go to luck (and waiting time should e removed also). Sometimes there are some bugs but irrilevant for gameplay. The development house has made other interesting apps too. Sorry for errors, is not my first language.",

Till now my highest score is 74 & I'm in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️",
        "A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!",
        "Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there's nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.",
        "Fun little time killer. My only problem is that daily rewards fail to show up most days. It could be a problem on my end, but I don't know, and it's a pretty small issue so I don't really care.",
        "Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn't respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I'm willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.",
        "I've noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don't think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying."

I've got to about the 7th and had enough of trying to get further and not progressing much. It's okay for a few days but after that, and like someone else has mentioned about the ads, too many to get little rewards",

Other than that it is a good game that i like.",
        "For a game so heavily reliant on ads to deliver benefits to the player, it is a gamble sometimes whether or not those ads will crash the game and therefore cost you the prizes. The game itself is all right, but this gamble drags down the experience when it doesn't work.",
        "It's like owning your own transportation service like Uber or Lyft, but in arcade Crazy Taxi meets Monopoly. If you hire drivers to your service, you not only make more money, but you expand your  territory. I love the diversity of the characters, how you have new with the classic arcade characters like Axel, Gus and Gena. And I also love the concept is modern, but has the classic arcade concept and feel with the scratch cards, gems, and money. Bonuses are earned through accomplishing objectives, and of course, ads. Thanks Sega. 👌👍❤",
        "Outstanding game. My only fuss is cars get trapped in some buildings during attempts to retrieve funds. Going back to another stage and returning to the stage I'm engaged in usually resets game play. Otherwise, great game.",

        "Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?",
        "I would have given this game a higher review than three that I have given it, the problem is that I have noticed a problem when trying to save some money. For me at least when trying to save money through the daily giveaway/present of playing the game everyday it has stolen money from me discreetly whenever I get around the 1000 coin mark sometimes it is one hundred sometimes I have lost 400 with no explanation as to where the money is. It is for this reason that I have lowered my rating. (Besides the disappearing money I enjoyed the game.)",
        "This game is pretty good, for the most part. The only problem is the bots you go upagainst are  way to hard. I can never win. I would have gave them 5 stars but I gave them 4 stars because of the bots. And the game is kinda hard to control. When I move backwords on a veichel it goes up.",
        "Good for killing time. Some of the computer driven opponents seem to have a very decisive advantage at initial start of certain stages, and some of the smaller vehicles are too sensitive on the controls  but overall decent game.",
        "New update stucks a lot and 1st time my mobile hangs a lot due to this game and btry drains faster than ever. plz crt these mistakes to continue njoying this game",
        "This game needs major fixes, on mission mode, I get my reward after completing a level but I can't ever go anywhere after it. So I never get to move on the next level. 😒"

        "All in all it is a really great game there are very few ads, its fun, the graphics are crisp. Its amazing except for one thing. On one of the levels all of the monsters have exactly 666 health and im not religious or anything but I'm pretty sure that if some one who is religious see's that, well lets just say that it might not be good for the company, so I suggest you fix this.  Thanks.",
        "It stopped working on my One plus! Help! I was excited about the side games! *********************************** Excellent, addictive fun. I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn't level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can't progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.",
        "Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It's nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don't want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn't get a key.",
        "Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion.",
        "Fun game but takes forever to get gold to upgrade. The cost to pay for the gems to buy so you can buy gold is really expensive. Not much dynamic to the game. Same stuff on each level just takes longer to bet enemies cause of higher HP.",
        "This game is really good.  The more you play the harder it gets but it is doable and you can watch ads to get you trough without paying.  I am around level 35 & haven't spent anything.  It is a hard to put down game.  The visuals are super satisfying,  especially when you get your little bombs kicking butt on the upper side of the enemy and they get faster and faster.  So satisfying!"

I kinda felt like it was a lot shorter then the other games. But other then that I had fun playing it and I'm super excited for other to come out so hurryyy!!!!!!! Lol",
        "This is just like the other game you guys made, the one with the doctor in the hospital, down to the exact same thing of \"play the first couple of levels for free but if you like you pay\" I bet this one is for the same price. On a side note, the story is different but the game play is the same, go have a look if you want. I will say this is a good game and I take nothing away from the hard work you have done. Good looking graphics, good smooth game play. A game you can get into and do try the other games of this developers you may like it as well. Over all a good game I just do not think it is worth $15. But best of luck guys.",
        "Great game  I don't normally spend the Ching on many games. . This has a different take of an old favorite.  But none of the challenge levels are working on my game.  Once it's over, nothing happens.  I don't get credit for work achieved and I have to restart with same result. A glitch. Waiting for update",
        "I absolutely love this game. However I had to order a new phone due to mine being replaced for insurance purposes and I was logged into my Facebook and lost all my progress and the app is NOW wanting me to repay. I don't wanna have to pay another 9.99. If there's anyway I can get my game back.",
        "Sometimes the game did responding to my tap. And what makes me very angry is i had to redo challenge several times because of the game stop (no \"level complete\" appear), lily parker just stand still, nothing happens...all i can do is tap setting button and choose : back to map or rerty the level.. i counter this issue on challenge mission only, not yet in normal mission.. And it's very annoying",
        "Love these games. I've purchased them all from different sagas. I'm just encountering a  problem with this one in particular. At the end of every challenge it glitches and I can't get my rewards. It stays on the challenge and I have to go back to the menu and play again. Pretty frustrating. Hoping it can be resolved."

Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels \"fixed\" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.",
        "This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.",
        "I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn't really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don't know how many more points you need.",
        "This game has many issues! It continually freezes and shuts me down. I can no longer play on my tablet, which I purchased just for games, and have to use my phone. I don't like using my phone because it drains my battery. I am so ready to quit this game and return to candy crush instead. Latest updates have rendered JP and other perks useless.",
        "Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the \"boards\" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it's addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It's becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.",
        "I don't know if a review is still available  after a game has been deleted. The game was fun to play I'll say that. I didn't need 5 push notifications coming @ me in the middle of the night however. The one that came through @ 3:17 a.m. was it for me, I'm out."

        "(REAL REVIEW! NOT A PAID REVIEWER) Really enjoying the game. It's a good time killer. Some levels are a lot of fun and actually require a little bit of skill. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is there are way too many ads. It will randomly make you watch a video to upgrade your ride or character, and/or to play a level. There's been a few times where I had enough tickets to play, and coins to upgrade my character the two points recommended, and I had to watch a video for all three. Three ads before you can even play a level is ridiculous. I understand that it's a big part of making money for the developers, but I've never had a free game with this many ads. Get rid of some of the ads and I'll gladly update my review to 5 stars.",

        "Just way too many ads. Eventually you start having to watch an ad after every second other level. Its a free game, so I get it but the levels are so quick sometimes I'm watching more than I am playing. Fun game, though. Easy controls and great graphics and sound.",
        "Good fun and very addictive. I see people moaning about the adds 😧 but what can you expect from a free game? You get an add pop up after about 5 puzzles and to be honest it is only for a few seconds....just close it if you don't want to see them.",
        "This game is outstanding. Love the graphics, simple to understand. Some appear quite easy and then you suddenly get a level that looks like it should be but has you scratching your head for AGES!!! Love it. I can live with the adverts, just wish i could put the phone down.",
        "Wonderful game, excellent graphics, its a free game, I solve 2 puzzles and a video ad plays I cant get over it, ad's are repeatedly played and I can't skip, but uninstalling cos too too much of ad's... after 2nd level game is very easy didn't find much interesting..",
        "Agree with other comments. Great graphics, fun to play, but the ADS!!!!!!!! eventually destroy the fun. Very repetitive after a while and challenge levels seem quite mixed. Have decided to delete the game mainly because of the ad onslaught. Other games have a much better ad/play psychology approach.",
        "Great time killer and keeps the brain ticking good fun. Ads are annoying but it's free and you can pay about £1.50 to get rid of them if your that bothered 🤔"

However when it comes to completing the quest, resources get over quickly and as per the time we need to wait for 3hrs for getting the refill,or buy it with the diamonds.... Lower the time limit for resource production like in different expeditions..as that will unable us to play more and complete it too on time.",

        "Such a great and fun game but you can't do anything without buying food, money and diamonds with real money. No videos or exchange options. Would have played a lot longer if these options were available instead op purchasing with real money. Such a shame.",

        "It's not my favourite game because resources take FOREVER to get. I cannot spend real money and its expensive to purchase the package. It's so difficult to get diamonds and other resources. Please make it easier to get the needed items for the events.  PLEASE  !",

        "Why I liked it? Because it's a simple game that doesn't make you addicted to phone but rather enjoy going forward focusing your attention entirely on your finger. What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven't listened to this game's. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I'm entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.",
        "I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it's meant to be \"skillfull\" but thats harder than skillfull, you can't even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don't care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.",
        "This is game is ok if you are bored and don't know what to do.... however it becomes irritating after playing for a while.... overall its a nice game",
        "I would like to report a bug. When you pause the game, moving obstacles keep moving. Someone would use this as a cheat",

The AI got worse at the same time, so it's not really harder... just more random.  I now find that this game stresses me out instead of helping me relax, so I have to give it up.",

        "The game is alright. Still too early to give it a proper review. Only here to say that the timers are way too long in the early stages of the game. Waiting an hour or four for thirty seconds of gameplay. They need to work on scaling the progression timers. A game like this is okay with long timers in late game when you have more than one thing to keep track of. But for these pay to win games to be profitable it helps to bait the hook a little harder before making you wait hours for more content.",
        "This game is a solid mix of \"clash of clans\" and \"fallout shelter\". Just like COC, you have to learn to let the timers cool off. The long term time investment can be very rewarding. The questing/pvp is also well done considering you can't choose what to attack or when during battle. Wholeheartedly a good game.",
        "GG easy. everyone whining being pay to play this that. i never bought anything and I'm loving this, just need a little patience and you can do many things untill one thing gets done or upgraded. I'm high in ranks, have a clan dedicated to non buyers. its all cool. been over 4 months and i still play this its amazing! great work guys, keep it up and keep adding new stuff.",
        "I love the game.  The thing is, this game just gets boring.  For example,  all you can do right now is to vanquish invasions. That's basically it. The portal is not always open.  The tournament? Well the match ups are way too oblivious.  My in game friends already have started quitting coz of these problems. You have to add something fun soon. Well it is still a fun game tho.",
        "Would be a great game if it wasn't blatantly pay to win.  Everything in the game is designed to push you to pay.  I enjoyed it at first and usually toss about $15 since it was decent.   But then, the system pairs you with opponents you can't defeat which then hampers your progress greatly which then means you either pay or hope you don't get attacked too much and lose all your resources.",
        "Been playing since early access relese. Game is very well built. But like all other games. The ads now bugged. The daily quest for the ad has never worked for me. Starts ad restarts app no credit. Oh well its an ad right. Well now your forcing me to watch them. Please fix So can i atleast finish those 2 daily quest?!?!?!  Also since update my androids menu buttons overlay all buttons on far right/left hand of screen depending on tilt. Phone is an LG stylo 3. Please address and i will rerate later."

The entire screen goes black after playing the game for 5-6 minutes. That's pretty irritating not to mention how much slower the phone gets as well. Didn't have these issues with the last update. Fix it please!",
        "I've been on Township since 2015 and I absolutely love it. Its the first game I play in the morning and the last one I play at night. This game has so much personality. From the characters to the animals, it is by far the best game that I've played so far. Keeps me busy for hours and I recently got my boyfriend hooked, keeps him as busy as it does myself. I don't have any complaints about it. Thank you GPG for coming up with a game so super fantastic. Kudos to the developers.",
        "This game needs the ability to gain more township cash. I have spent way too much real money to buy township cash and im not doing so again at this rate. Farmville isnt this bad and hard to expand.  You cant expand the barn without waiting on products by train or paying in township cash to expand. And that costs over a couple hundred township cash for each expansion. Getting a dollar or two here and there takes forever to collect. Plus the expansion makes small expansions so it doesnt help much.   If something dont change i may quit the game. I enjoy it and would like to continue but at this rate i dont see much point. I cant afford to pay more money to play.",
        "Fantastically animated time-killer, very detailed and interesting to watch when you actually do pay attention to the stuff that happens around a well designed town. The co-op portion of the gameplay is just enough social interaction that I like in games like this. It isn't forced. Nothing really is, and that is rare for games like this. Keep them coming, I'm enjoying them!",
        "The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen",
        "Great game very addictive, and I don't know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats's kind of ridiculous. That's the only bad thing I have to say about this game."

However, it is getting frustrating not being able to view videos for coins.  I'm game ad breaks are still working, so what's the deal?  The # 1 thing that keeps me in a game is not having to spend real money.  I a star simply because of this.  Fix it please.",

        "No matter how hard I tried, I would end up crashing on my head.  Round would end, and it would ask if you wish too see an ad.  Expect that after every round. Even if you say no, it will do an ad break every 3 rounds.  I wanted to enjoy this game, but it was not challenging, and so many ads that I uninstalled it.",
        "Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can't just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can't advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it's basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.",

        "Overall the game itself is pretty good and worth the download for a good couple hours of fun even with a few friends. However I would highly recommend not spending any money on the in game purchases. I got ripped off, luckily with in game currency only and the \"game team\" is adamant that nothing went wrong. If that is the type of support they give I wouldn't want something to go wrong with my actual money. So long story short as long as u don't spend money u should have a good time playing",
        "I give 1star not because that game isn't game is awesome I give 1 star because of support team. I tried many time to contact them to short out my problem but they don't reply. My problem is my trophy points are above 1500 but I always find a enemy with 900 points and it takes more than 1minute to find a enemy please guys tell me what do I do it is so frustrating I can't take it anymore",
        "It was fun....a year ago! Now I can't trash 🖕This bad joke of a game enough,  HARDCORE🖕 Gameaftergameaftergameaftergameaftergameaftergameaftergame No PROGRESSION, To be underleveled,  To be overmatched, to be cheated, to be robbed, To be lied to! To be insulted & ignored,  & To be taken for a fool😤BUT most importantly........TO BE UNINSTALLED 😋!",
        "This had already been done much better. This game allows you to play about 30 minutes before you need to shell out money to compete. Not interested in these crooked games. When are we going to get back to some honesty and not trying to screw customers to get rich?",
        "It's awesome game with wonderful grafics. First I thought it's an exact copy of clash of Royale but when I started to play this game I thought that clash of Royale is a worst game. My suggestion is don't waste your 94mb while downloading clash of Royale better use 94mb +2mb =96mb for downloading this miracle and a wonderful game Castle Crush.🏰🏰🏯🏯🏰🏰🏯🏯",
        "Love the game defiantly 5* just a couple of comments I hope get read it would be nice to gain some coins through friendly battles with people in your clan. Also if you could see when your group member's were last active it would be easier to sort out our clans. Thanks"

        "GAH! They've over complicated this game with unnecessary graphics and gifts and prizes etc. I couldn't even figure out how to get into the levels for a while haha. I'm sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn't want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn't change it. Uninstalled after 1 day.",
        "I really think the tower is rigged. 1 in 4 chance of getting the pig but it seems to happen ALL the time. Cant get past the 6th or 7th floor. However if you spend lots o money to buy gems I guess it can be done. Not for me I am out.",
        "Can no longer watch ads to get an extra rewards chest plus, I logged in for 90 days and did not get my legendary chest. My screen froze up when I hit the claim button and had to restart my game. Now my chest is gone and the next level has appeared without me being able to chose what I wanted from the chest.",
        "Caution! Needed access to my personal files including photos to play the game.  I denied and could not start the game unless it had access. Uninstalling after this review.  Don't let programmers and hackers get a hold of your personal files!",
        "Graphics are good, game play can be lame at times when you get birds that are incapable of completing the level. You can't buy the game and that bothers me. I spent $20, (to support the effort) but am trying to keep it at that.  Others have spent $100 and more. Greed ruins this game. Just finished a level that was designed to be beat only by spending money. Spent hours trying but finally paid and beat it. The game play is not consistent. If you have a bad day it will let you win, if you're winning, suddenly an opponent that should never be able to beat you, kicks your ass when you've played perfectly.",
        "It won't let me watch videos. Every time I click on the TV to watch a video for a free bird or arena ticket, it restart the game instead and I lose a life. I hope this gets fixed because other then that it's an addictive game. When the Glitch is fixed I will give a better rating."

        "It was good but then this happened. I was playing just like any other day. My phone had died while I was playing, so I charged it and left it untouched for about an hour or two. When I signed in, all off my progress was erased! Please respond and tell me what happened.",
        "The game was great than EA got to it with there sticky fingers and put adds everywhere, it isn't the same game I enjoyed ages ago. It's just another add infested game now, even if you do pay for it l. The charm is gone",
        "Irritating. At first it gives you an option of playing a video to receive additional help. Which works only for the first time. Next time onwards no way to cancel the video in case you don't want to install it. It is so frustrating. Either allows to cancel or tell the users what to do next. Worst way of promoting other apps.",
        "Why ask people to pay to have ads removed and still have so many features that you need to watch ads for? It just seems like a rip off to me very disappointed in this purchase",
        "I had to update it so I did and when I wanted to play after that, it says \"watch video to get extra seed slot\" WHICH I ALREADY PAID FOR WITH THE COINS I COLLECTED ALL THESE TIMES. Even before the update, it has so many ads but this is much worse. Definitely not happy with the update."

        "This is overall the best golf game I have come across or any app, in general, relating to sports. My only problem is that sometimes people do not want to, not do not have the ability to create a facebook account. I wish there would be a way to play with your family; without the facebook account users perks.",
        "I like the game, and it's addictive, but the mechanics are absolutely flawed. There have been tons of instances where the game has unfairly screwed me or other player's over. 1. Places mystery boxes in front of the player who drives second, but not the first player. 2. Hills like to stop a ball, that is being shot full force by an iron club, in it's tracks. 3. The swinging spike balls only affect some players golf balls, but not others.  Things like this piss people off, because they expect the game to be fair. Those small things easily aid a player in losing a match.",
        "This game would be awesome if it matched you with people equal to your level but it doesn't. So I spend more time trying to get to the higher levels and not able to upgrade equipment. Of course you could always purchase money but I'm not big on doibg that!",
        "Game cheats, puts you against lower lol players with better equipment who make ungodly shots, or much higher level where you don't have a chance. I hit things that aren't there, and with a crossword my ball will fly into the wind with no action. Opponent Always get better wind and direction, and will outshoot you work lower equipmeny.",
        "I love the game I find it very entertaining. I also like being able to interact globally. But the only one thing that I would change, would be to make the analog where you pull back your driver smaller screened devices. Besides that I have no complaints. I love the game! 😊😊",
        "The game doesnt allow you to get a proper pull back on your swing. To much clutter on some stages. Plus those who play too win always beat those who dont"

Along with finishing a constant 16th about 95% of the time make me think it's rigged. What's up with that??",
        "Sometimes it makes no sense. You are coming from quailication as 7th, you jump to 2nd position so surely you cant finish worse than 8th? WRONG. You end up on 16th place which is impossible. There is no in between you either win or you finish 14th or lower. You have 30 pts lead in front of number 2. after 1st round, you slightly fail your 2nd jump, guess what? 18th place for you! If you jump for example 120m on a K90 in Q, you finish first because everyone jumped 20m less, sudennly in 1st round you need 130m to secure your first place because everone managed to jump extra 30m. All in all fun, but still needs a lot.",
        "Fantastic concept and artwork and potentially amazing game ruined by a half arsed tutorial and lack of information, pure laziness.  The fun of the game turns to frustration as you get good distance and terrible scores, but why? You assume landings but the game gives you no information on correct technique. Also same for takeoff and mid air lift.   Come on devs its lazy and ruining a game with huge potential. Uninstalled...",
        "Took me a little while to get the hang of the controls but it's fun once you do. Could maybe do with some hints to help get the best body position in flight, as this took me a while to figure out. Otherwise, it's a good time sink.",
        "The game is fun but you really can't win the early stages so that you can grind the coins and bc of that you only finish 1st or 16th and that is the thing that makes this game so incredibly bad.",

        "I'm totally addicted to this game! great graphics and lots of fun games that really make you think.  I just wish that it used up lives rather than credits because the credits can run out so fast and take a while to build the pot up again unless you want to pay £",
        "It's a really fun and addictive game with one major flaw. After you start getting to the harder levels, you might as well quit and find a new game unless you only want to play one or two rounds an hour or pay to play. Every level costs coins to play and if you fail a level you are out pretty much your whole hourly allotment of coins. Winning a round doesn't make up for even one loss either. Love the game,  but really annoyed that I can't actually play it consistently enough to truly enjoy it.",
        "Love it and it really made  my brain thinking like do I want to risk lose money on wild card or go ahead to pick card from deck. When I won love that dog jump over three stars. I try to recalled did dog jump over two or one star. Maybe not. But still love it. Keep it coming",
        "The game is so much fun and great game play and graphics, etc. But it has one fatal flaw. When you get to higher levels, it becomes way too expensive. I paid for extra credits twice but then realized how worthless it is. Sad because I'd be willing to pay for packages for bonuses but it's way too expensive to have to keep paying for rounds just to play.",
        "Like it but costs too much to play. Can only play a short time before I run out of points. To bad because great graphics.",
        "The only thing I do not like about Grand Harvest Solitaire is not being able to earn more coins to play longer. Games cost 2000 coins to play and you don't win much more than 2000 so you're always relying on harvests for coin & unable to play until you build your coins back up by harvesting every hour..."

        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",
        "Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don't even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.",
        "Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn't be putting people in the \"club\" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this \"club\" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they're INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game"

        "I rather enjoy the game a lot. It feels balanced for the most part,  leveling takes a while which wouldn't be a issue if it didn't take so long to go place to place. Gets sort of annoying to go back and forth trying to get resources and the game goes from fun to grindy quickly.   My main issue is the battery life of my phone. While charging my phone and playing this game but battery was being drained.  Graphics are good, I enjoy the crafting and base building, the combat is nice, and the auto harvest feature is a life saver.",
        "**UPDATE** Is an awesome game. Could use a few more perks (ie. Weapons and hard to get items) in drop boxes and yellow zones.Now the down side is if you die in a level your last position is no longer there to try and recoup some of your items. Players killing you as you open trunks in inventory. Oh ya and the free spin box...give random prizes instead of coins and rope. People will get really into it if perks are awesome. Great game could be the best with a couple tweaks. Awesome job.",
        "I love this game...graphics r awesome... The whole thing is very captivating n keeps u entertained for hours... My only issue is that it can't be played offline... I don't always have Wi-Fi connection available to me so that alone is a headache...otherwise it is the best game out there under thist. Keeping them coming please!!",
        "Just another game that either makes you wait to play it, or pay not to wait. Why? Don't make me pay not to wait. Entice me to pay with cool things, otherwise it's an instant uninstall. Poor business model. Imagine paying double to get them to make your food faster at a restaurant, or just wait a long time. Would you really keep going there, or somewhere else that makes something just as good but in a reasonable amount of time?",
        "2 stars just to draw ur attention...  I love this game.. Its the best game... Just wannna say..  Name that Unknown free  box to #coin box...  If u dont wanna give any other thing.. Just don't show fake thing if everytime it is gonna end up on a coin..  Else i love the game.. Get more updates fast",
        "Anyway i edit this review... The is nice and graphics are cool. But there is the problem on the game. Could you pls remove the energy bar so i can still play the without waiting to fill the energy bar... Cause otherwise i less play this game in days... that you know you must wait your energy bar to fill again in a couple of minutes if the energy is gone?. Pls Remove it so we can play all day along.. Thank you."

        "DON'T INSTALL THIS GAME...it's just another money machine. I'd played this game for 4 month and the amount of money you have to spent to be able to level up your teams is endless. You will pay for an lootbox system and be sure...it's just a money machine with ridiculous prices...this is far away from free to play... The leveling management and so called game meta is simply stupid...\"Do you wanna lose a raid-match when your team is on 3000 and the other on 2200 points.\" ...ridiculous. Updates are just \"price enhancements\" and new modes which are only playable if you spent more money.",
        "I just did 4x 10pulls and didnt get a single 5*. Seriously, that's just poor management. Last time I spend any money. Don't spend your cash, it wont be beneficial. I wish I coukd get a refund.",
        "Despite the balancing improvements the game particularly in Raids still needs lots of improvements since someone with 400 less power than you with characters in lower tiers can still completely kick your ass. Serious detriment to wanting to continue to play if no matter how you level them up you still lose.",
        "Installed to the latest version but the screen now remains blank after the initial launchscreen.. as a paying customer (I just purchased a monthly gem pass and am only into the 4th day), I expect the developer to resolve this issue ASAP!",

Anyways but i still love it Ninjago is my  favorite have you guys watch the ninjago movie even there episodes. Thank you for creating this game.👍👍👍👍👍👍",
        "I'm a big fan of lego ninjago♥. Its just hands of time I fight serpentine and when master Wu spoke I saw a timeblade. When I was chilling looking at my mission's then Lloyd hacked into Zane's computer he said something I just have a bad memory.",
        "I think the controls are horrible because I Am left handed and you've got to use your right hand to go forward and there is not much of fighting or ningargo feeling",
        "It's awesome! I am a huge fan of ninjago. I love defeating enemies, changing my look, and even having so much fun!",
        "No controller support on Android TV. Very buggy playing on a tablet. Character gets stuck behind/in objects and you have to kill the game...",

        "Think about playing all day Ridiculously good graphics for a mobile game, excellent soundtrack that matches the intensity of each level, and never gets boring. The free version makes you restart from the beginning instead of checkpoints, but I don't even mind because it's still challenging and fun with each replay. I do wish I could play in a different mode for free though. This would be an awesome Zen game.",
        "The gameplay is unique and challenging and fun but this game feels like a demo as all the other game modes (PvP , co-op etc) are locked for free users. And you can't even use checkpoints without paying them( like SERIOUSLY?!) So once the game is over you have to start all over again if you are a free user. Apart from that this game definitely deserves a try from people looking for casual , relaxing yet challenging gameplay.",
        "Great game This is a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing aesthetics and highly addictive. Totally worth the $2 for the premium version. I do have one problem though: even though I am pretty decent at the game, Google Play won't give me any achievements even though I'm sure I have earned some. It won't even let me open achievements or leaderboard pages. Is anybody else having this issue?",
        "Smash Hit Smash hit is awesome because it has a lot of intensity in the game so I get to let my brain work a little.  It kinda let your brain decide if your should hit it or not. I also really like this game because the game is kinda hard so it challenges me a little bit. So who ever made this game I appreciate it. One more thing about Smash Hit is that it brings my family together because we take turns playing the game to let our brain think. Thank You!",
        "Spectacular Shockingly Good Game This game is addicting and amazing who thought breaking glass could be so fun. I mean somebody thought of something random when they made this. I I love it it is just so amazing. If only the person who thought of it made the game so that you didn't have to pay for some stuff like extra levels. Still if you're reading this and you're questioning if you should download this or not you definitely should.! 😉😀☺",
        "I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I've decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I've upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!"

The only reason I made a real purchase was so that I wouldn't have ads, so can someone please remove the ads from my account. On another note, I really like this, and nice to see Shadow playable again.",

Please KING fix this problem!  UPDATE as of 21st February: the message \"go online for more episodes\" is still showing everytime I try and play. So still not fixed in the new update! PLEASE FIX!!",
        "U want 5***'s, well hard is ridiculously too hard, it has impossible levels that  you only win,  when king wants you to, this is so utterly ridiculous! Really makes me want to uninstall the game. I will give it another try, I'm waiting for the game to divvy out more tries.. I mean 35 tries is stingy for a hard level, how about 45 tries instead?",
        "I'm a addict when it comes to all the candy crushes I'm currently on level 1060 (a really hard level) and I'm  upset cause I get almost threw with that level and the app just close very upset fix the glitch please.. Other then that like I love candy crush but it still get 4 stars!",
        "I love this game but after the latest update I lost things. I had logged in 150 days in a row and loved getting the bonuses each day. Today I logged in and it put me back to day 1!!! I know I logged in yesterday and didn't miss a day. I also was moved down a bubble level. Updates should not make you lose everything you've earned.",
        "Game won't let me move forward. Again. Keeps saying to go online to download new episodes. Only way to fix this is to redownload the app but then I lose all my items and I have to restart my days of prizes.  Last time I was at almost day 200 and had to start back at day 1. This needs to be fixed cause it's the 2nd time it's happened. Only happens with this game. The other candy crush apps don't do this.",
        "One of my favorite games, but after the most recent update, just like most of the reviews in the last several days, I'm stuck at 705. I should be at 1153. Tells me to go online and download new episodes when I'm constantly online. Need to patch it or rework the coding.   Edit: finally fixed, everything is running smoothly. Thanks!"

Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don't get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don't mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!",
        "Ugh look people if u start playing this game oh wait if u had any sense u wouldn't. these adds are outrageous every time I die there an add I'm not even kidding. My dad rates tones of games and I'm the one playing some of them and I told my dad that these adds are so horrible I even had to report it. Now here me out great game but the adds. And in the beginning there is no instructions on how to do the game so like I said in the beginning there is a add at the end of every round so in the beginning there are many adds. Now i think there are more adds then game in this game. I'm not trying to be mean so don't go crying😢 to ur boss.",
        "I think there is to many ads like u have to watch a ad after u die. And then if u wanna continue u have to watch ANOTHER ad. Its just so annoying. But other wise I love this game. It keeps me entertained while I am bored or when I am on the bus on my way to school. But there are way to many ads and I hope u guys please fix that. 💜",
        "tbh it's a really good app! The only problem is that it gets a little boaring after a while (obviously that's my opinion) And I don't know if it's just me but there or tons of over 30 second ads.",
        "I like this game  very much cause you dont know what comes in front of you which makes this game more interesting. But 1 problem is there that the second i crash to any obstacle an add popups",
        "I really do like this game. It's a good way to learn to think quickly with what side you should move to. Although, it would be even better if you didn't have so many adds, but every rose must have it's thorns and I'd say the adds are this roses thorns."

        "On mobile, the ball often ends up too close to the corners for you to aim or see any trajectory. It clearly needs bigger margins, or you have to see lots of balls wasted. Apart from that, might be a fun game",
        "Overall the game is great and super addictive. I probably would have continued to play but the sheer number of advertisements and some coding logic that makes it annoying after every game to wait for the ad to go and to even after selecting the Google account, it keeps asking for that... It's become annoying beyond the point for me to continue. Otherwise, great game.",
        "A geometry based game with messed up geometry, especially interaction with corners. Add the fact that block addition on each level is set up to fail you - 'it's ok' is a pretty accurate overall experience",
        "An addictive game! Frustrating maybe at first but once into it it difficult to stop playing 👍",
        "Excellent game but the purchases are not clear at all. I have two devices and the purchases did not sync between them! In my tablet I have 2 balls and in my mobile only one. No point in purchasing if this is not fixed."

And this is first time i'm very exited when i managed to finish a level, even after that, i repeat again till i can surpass it perfectly. Even i haven't sleep for 2 days, felt like an alien or zombie, etc. But this game cheers me up alot. Recommended ? Yes! Good job dev, just download it guys. Lu pasti hepi dah! Keren!",

        "Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it's only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that's bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it's a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I'll rate 5 star$",
        "For a shoot 'em up racing android game it's really addictive. I'm always playing it. It's fun. My only complaint is the time it takes for the fuel to charge, 30 mins? Come on! Otherwise very challenging. Challenge accepted!",
        "I really enjoyed this game until it started crashing mid game. Happened to me just recently and I wasted all my available fuel trying to frantically restart the game.  I was just completing the assigned jobs when the game suddenly stalled and I had to restart it again just to find it stalling again, all the while consuming the fuel with each restart. Hope to see this problem rectified soon, otherwise it's an enjoyable game nonetheless.",
        "This app is absolutely the best game I have ever downloaded on this device. It lets you pick the music you want, customize your car, add drones, and you can have a chance on the leader board! It's really really addicting, and when I first downloaded it, I quickly climbed to first place. See if you can beat me,    and download the app.",
        "Epic old school arcade game play meets mobile app heven  This is a great game for any one that can look past In app purchases. Its loaded fool of great charectors and cars that have a usable MP3 player with some tracks . With great leveling up abilities from weapons more powerful weapons. To Nitro 2x points Health and more cars. 5 gas tanks and your either waiting or buying diamonds. What ever it is this game has even more levels . jobs for other charectors. All I now is some of the best old school arcade stand ups with that mobile app. Non stop Rockets and machine Gun blasting with some jams playing in the stereo and little cute pug dogs giving you Xp. Great FUN .....!!!!!!!"

        "A very good puzzle game. Worth the few dollars for no ads. Literally just used my Google Rewards to pay for it. I have only really played Connect.   My only gripe is that the squares or hexes are too small so it is very hard to navigate the puzzle without breaking previous connections. My other issue is that at times connections randomly disconnect. Fixing these issues would make the game more relaxing",
        "It's so addicting and fun. Really makes your brain work. Though when your playing, chances are that your friend sitting next to you will jut their finger in there if your stuck on a puzzle. Not my problem, I don't have any friends. Still fun",
        "I hink this game is great! It is fun and super addictive and has helped me through boredom. The only problem I have with this game is the tangram graphics as it tends to bug quite a bit. Overall I think the game is amazing and I hope to see more stunning content!",
        "We kept getting a big black box which covered the whole game so could not play. It would disappear and you'd try to start but then it would come back straightaway. Could not play it for more than a couple of seconds. Otherwise it was great at first before it started doing this. Is this a glitch that can be fixed please?",
        "Love how many different types of games there is to play very addictive and if you get board playing one game you just pick a different one. It's great for those who don't sleep very well like myself. The only fault is there is far too many adds please get rid of them 😊",
        "Absolutely love this app. Its a great way to pass the time and the fact that it has multiple puzzles all in one is fantastic, since my attention span wavers. This keeps me constantly bouncing around to different challenges so its hard to get bored. ❤"

I enter the details, it tells me that I've already logged in, I go back to the game and it just does the same thing over and over..... Anyone know how to solve this issue? Website is no use at all",
        "Between ads completely over running gameplay and the new requirement of having to earn stars to proceed, Rovio continues to run this once great game into the ground. **Update** game now freezes randomly requiring a force close. This is beyond ridiculous. I HATE what this franchise has become. Rovio should be ashamed.",
        "This game used to be awesome, sadly I have just removed it due to the star issue. I used to be able to play for fun, however, due to the its current standing, one MUST achieve three stars in each level in order to play other levels. Madness! Great job for taking the fun out of a game!",
        "This latest update keeps freezing up. I have to close it out completely and restart it. I lose any powerups I was using when it freezes, too. I cannot even finish playing the mighty levels the last few days because of this issue. Very annoyed.",
        "This new version for me takes the fun out of playing angry birds. It sticks. And the locked levels are no fun. I want the other version. Not this one. Im sick og having to ginish one episode before going to another. I am lodging a big complaint. This new version is a waste. Gix this  now or I contact gamers.",
        "Pls add on more levels... If it is possible pls update this particular game every month... But over all the game is awesome... But still my mother only play all the games she finished all angry birds games... She is asking more angry birds games... So I'm giving this as a request to u ...the CEO of Rio pls add on more games like this classic angry birds 😜"

You need cross compatability between PC and smart phones. Also, you constantly beg us to buy stuff AND you have alot of annoying ads. Be like clash of clans and just sell stuff. Yall are too money hungry for a game that isn't even that good.",
        "Good idea, poor execution ok on the mobile version. Constant lag, hard to control, the view is zoomed way in so you never see anyone bigger coming your way, full of adds, and the game constantly crashes and kicks me out. When I try to log back in, it says that I'm trying to log in to an account I'm logged into elsewhere. It has potential, but it needs work...",
        "fix the laaags please. I have high speed internet but still facing lags. I spent a lot in this game and don't want to loose it. Still lagging :(. It works with only high speed internet. Can't play with the data packages only strong wifi.  You didn't fix this in the new edition of the game and the rush mode is not working. The new party is sucks big time. Fix fix fix",
        "I love this game on laptop but when i play it on my android mobile the display area is very small compare to its area on laptop. You must built application in a way it can shows up more area on 5 inch display screen so we can see cells comming to eat us. And it can be done effectively by showing things smaller.",
        "What is this???? After every 1 or 2 game when the main menu comes I touch screen just frozes I can't even touch any button. Neither I can play nor I can go to shop it's nothing I can do but just to quit the game. My phone is Samsung S6  Pls do something it's really irritating",
        "This is a nice idea for a game but needs a lot of work. First of i couldn't even understand how the game works. Always saying \"connection is slow\" every damn time. Controls? Terrible. Before i even learn how to move i get eaten. Please look into these and you might have a good game there."

        "Amazing app! My sister broke my old piano 2 years ago and I gave up. When I started thinking that I need to start again in my piano career, I started looking for piano apps that I could play my own music. Unfortunately, a lot of the apps didn't work for me until I came across this one. Just to say thanks for making this great app. :)",
        "This, after 6 years of playing piano has narrowed all my work down to half the size.. I've been a musical genius, and then tragedy struck, and I lost my ability completely half my life... wasted. But this app helped me to relearn how to play. Thank you. Thank you immensely",
        "This app is so good! I've never had a piano and wanted to learn but couldn't but I started writing my own songs on this app and it's so good. The graphics are like a real piano and I love the magic tiles and everything about this app!!! ❤❤❤",
        "Fun to noodle around on, but significant delay when using Bluetooth speakers or headphone (since I haven't this issue with other apps I can only surmise it is exclusive to this app) which isn't great considering wireless audio is quickly becoming the standard.",
        "Its a good app, has many sounds, keyboard is easy to use. All thats missing is a built in metronome to keep tempo",
        "Need more time other than 1 song to give actual feedback..."

        "Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren't enough. And one of them didn't work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.",
        "I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.",
        "It's fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I'm bored. I love the songs and dance moves it's awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it's awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don't know how to dance then you should download this game it's perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.",
        "It's a good game overall but the songs that are supposedly meant to be free aren't. I would rate it 5 stars but I can on play 3 songs every 24 hours. I'm trying to workout while doing this but a workout isn't a very good workout if it's only for 6 minutes. Please give us a higher coin  limit and cut the wait time down some. Then and only then will I rate it 5 stars.",
        "Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn't have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!",
        "I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn't make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun."

        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Please reduce the cost of things on store and do something in your next update so that the player can get more and more diamonds from the hit list. Please reduce the cost of jet pack.  And when I watch videos for reward, it doesn't work. I have watched over a hundred videos but it's only two times that I got a reward.",
        "Honesty its just like GTA which a great thing but the thing is the installation time let me share my experience to one and all reading hear... When I was downloading it at the first its done but it starts downloading once again but I am not sure is it my problem but I just wanted to share with you guys... The game is boss",
        "Best game I've ever played! In fact it is the only game I've had on my phone for 2 years. But there are some minor errors that keep occurring, such as when you are running or driving any vehicle, the control pad keeps stopping and I have to lift my thumb up and put it back down to regain control. Now I know it doesn't sound like much, it can mess up your drifts and the gas will stop as well. PLEASE FIX. Thanks",
        "It's a very great game,Nothing but love.   But I got a notification  that there is an update,I updated the game but I still can't find the new added missions in the game. Secondly I am on day 87 and my day 90 supposed  Reward changed after I downloaded the update.",
        "I don't understand why  diamonds are required to craft materials. As a F2P player it is difficult for me to craft new materials. The old updates never had this rubbish. Please fix ASAP.Will install again if it is fixed."

I'm sure it's perfect for everyone. Any where, any time. I don't know why, but when l play this game l feel like l am the boss who commands to that minion who runs. I see that wonderful worlds and l feel like l'm doing all that job. When I was a little bit small, l was playing this game with my sister and the minion was ower slave. This game is very funny and, like Janise Palmer said, now l realize that l made a huge mistake. I have instaled it back and it's ok. I'm level 10 now.",
        "The game used to be fun, but not anymore.  More than that, after i did a factory reset on my phone, I've reinstalled the game, but surprise... I couldn't sync the game to my Google account. All my progress in game was lost. All the money invested in this game was lost. I have sent them emails, tickets about it but no answer what so ever. The result is ---&gt; uninstall",
        "I like this game but there's so much cheating going on. It doesn't resister some of the moves you make or it's lagging and when you smash the minions they should fly away and not stick to the screen for ten seconds so you can't see what's coming next. Just stop cheating! Don't take 20hours to give the necessary tools when doing a double task in the jelly lab.",
        "Really cool. Its just  too WEIRD. And sometimes when I try to Dodge an obstacle it won't do it. And  when the lanes bend its really Hard for me. And why do you Have to watch an ad to get free revives, get some tokens, refill the Battery for the special Mission and to open the green and blue prize pod AND to Double bananas you collect? GREAT GAME I JUST HATE THE ADS.",

You could make things like characters and stuff less expensive. It's  Ike....I go on SHOP and it says stuff like (random minion) 1234 tokens!!  Dats 2many bro!"

The actual content is fine, but the business practices are deplorable.",

        "Too late to join this game. As soon as you lose your newbie protection you become a farm for higher level players, preventing you from progressing. Every morning you find all your resources pillaged and your troops dead or incapacitated. Maybe I'm just in the wrong timezone.",
        "The game has the same problems as the other versions. The events boost strong players which makes the gap in strength larger. The premium items are overpriced. Probably the worst I have seen, there is no protection for your silver. This means stronger players always have a reason to attack someone weaker and there is no protection in place after being successfully attacked.",

Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.",
        "The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don't get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new \"enemies\". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you've lost some lives. But that's not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.",
        "I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It's more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.",
        "Remember the old days when platformers taught you through trial and error how to interact with new game mechanics? If you don't like that, you'll hate this game. So much fun, so creative, and once you start to get down one of the new features, it ramps it up and keeps you learning creatively how to beat the level. I love this game, it's a fantastic platformer that will challenge you to learn as you go instead of giving you a tutorial every time something new comes up.",
        "Completed all but just couldn't get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I've ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.",
        "I love this game 😍😍 it is my favourite but.... I don't like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it's a great idea😋😋 btw i loved it 😍😍😍 ill give it 5 stars then😊😊"

Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I've tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It's the only maze puzzle app I've found worth playing! 😀💜",
        "Time killer. B&W colors are a bit hard on the eyes after awhile. I wish the controls weren't so touchy. Even if I'm using my stylus it's easy to move into a wrong corner by accident when you know it's not the right direction.",
        "I'm not far into it, but it's fun so far. My eyesight could be why it's not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It's still a very good game though.",
        "I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven't played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I'll have to download a separate kid version for her.",
        "5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes",
        "I like the mazes. Strongly dislike that the game plays half the maze for me. As a player I have the right to do the work myself. Cannot find controls to turn that off. :( :/"

Otherwise it's a fun game, but you won't get past the ads for too long without uninstalling likely.",
        "Won't let me continue playing unless I pay, connect fb and bug friends, or I watch 3 videos,1 video every 24 hrs. So now I either wait 2 days to play or I deleted this. So disappointed. Was enjoying it.",
        "I thought this was a kids game so why do I have to pay money, connect to Facebook, or wait 3 days to move forward!? This game is for young kids right? So do you think a little 7 year old has money or Facebook, and everyone know the are not pacent!",
        "It kept crashing right once I click on the first level. It doesn't work at all. Don't install this app, it is terrible.",
        "It is nice game . Can anyone tell me after 30 level how can i reach to next level  beach to soap factory. It says required 3 keys. Please tell me how can i get this.......",
        "THAT IS THE BEST GAME I JAD EVER TIRED BUT ATLEAST DONT PUT 6 DU DUCKS"

You can pay 2 bucks to remove the ads, but isn't necessarily going to make the experience better.  The ads are short, for the most part, but still can get annoying if you've played 10 puzzles in a row.  And considering you can complete a puzzle under or around the 2 min mark, those ads add up.  Worth a dl if you enjoy this type of game.",

        "Smooth control. Awesome idea . Not Much more I can say about it.(First Review). Now, my first thoughts about this game was that it was very good but as I have updated the game it has just been very slow and overturns when you tap. It also randomly takes you to the play store without tapping on an ad.",

        "The game was awesome and I loved it. But the latest update ruined it with ADS. They put the banner exactly where you mostly tap with the fingers to change direction, the game got laggy which it was not before and has started getting way too many pop ups. Uninstalling. *Sigh*",
        "A lot of frame rate issues. Lost many runs because controls become unresponsive while gameplay continued. Ads are incredible intrusive. That said, it can be really fun if they cleaned up the coding on this simple game."

The only down side is that the spins cost alot of coins and those coins can be hard to earn. So 4.5 stars i would rate it is that was a option but its not so i rate it a a big fat 5",
        "I love this game a lot. The only problem is that when you do the Dailey spin, you only get like coins. And then with the coins you can buy another spin which is what I do. And I get even more coins. It's really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and",

This game all in all soooooooo fun and you should totally get it. just say no if you want to write a reaport on this game because it will ask you is this game is beautiful which it is not. GOOD LUCK, good  night, new york city. at late night talk show with stephen colebert......jk",

        "I used to play this game a long time ago with my brother. I thought since after all these years so many new updates have come, the game must feel different. But it's the same. I love the tune that plays as you play it. It's so nostalgic. My brother isn't anymore with me but playing this game makes me really very happy. It's just like I am back in those old days. Specially for me, as it has so many memories, this game is the absolute best.",
        "I have a problem with my account. My punk zombird was maxed out. Level 3. Then when I opened the game, my punk zombird was gone... I obtained that by waiting patiently and gathering 90 diamonds. I had to watch 3 15-30 sec long video for 2 diamonds each. After watching the 3 vids, I had to wait another 8 hours for it to be available again. It took me a month to obtain that bird and then all of a sudden it dissapears?! I obtained it again but I had to start all over again. I uninstalled this app because of that issue.",
        "The game is really addictive. but repeated zombie birds are generated and diamonds are getting wasted. Please change that. One bird one time please. One bird should be at max 3 level not another set. It's wasting my internet to watch video to get diamonds for collecting birds",
        "I personally loved this game. First off,  u cant jump for high periods of time cause u to run into the bombs. Secondly, whats sup with these prices? Thats ridiculous. You cant level up with prices that high and u have to buy 💎 gems and coins just to get a level up... But tum... Very great game overall.",
        "I love this game cause it kills our time when were bored. Yep, we, my mom also is addicted to this game hahaha, shes always getting my phone and play this game whenever im sleeping. Love it, I recommend this game to everyone💖 you'll be definitely love this game. MobiGame you slaaaay hahaha",
        "I was confident to delete the app from my phone cos it says that the game will be saved on my fb acc. But only the highest score remained and the potion got back to 1. I was already at 56! Deym! Ayusin nyo buhay nyo! Sayang effort ko! Aba!"

Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "One of the few games that I don't mind spending a bit i.e. $10+ every month. Requires team guild effort to achieve stuffs together definitely gives a good feeling. Event is weekly and community is lively. Card's artwork feels like Rage of Bahamut but using matching puzzle style to deal damage. Skills of card matter as well increasing the complexity and fun. Only thing to improve would be cheaper ingame currency to encourage more people to have better decks thus higher activity rates.",
        "It's a lot other games of this type. I haven't been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you're looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn't find any more connections, that would be great!",
        "Dont expect any support for this game. I've been locked out and i am still waiting on a resolution, like many here. I've paid money and i know i wont be getting any compensation let alone how long its going to take to fix it.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition",
        "Its a match 3, pay to win game with heroes. Its pay to win lootbox style pay to win mechanics enures that unless you are extremely lucky or9 intend to pay alot, you wouldnt win jack. The match 3 RNG can also make the game infuriating, such as when there is little to no matches or the matches are for colors which yohr team doesnt have. However, unlike other match 3 games, it is fun for longer."

        "I really liked this game when it had only 20 seasons & I uninstalled it after finishing. I again installed it and started from the beginning and after completing 573 games & 1487 stars I am giving you just 2star rating because game lag all the time sometimes the ads got struck or maybe during rewind I lose my $1 but the game didn't rewind back instead crash and auto shutdown and I ahve to start the application again. Before adding 30th season please update your games stability it will be more useful.",
        "Like most other games, there is too much effort to bait you into micro transactions. The older games were so much better. It's a shame the Devs have resorted to such money grabbing standards.",
        "I like the tactic aspect of it, pretty good time waster. Took me a while to beat it, but didn't have to spend a dollar to do it. The story itself is very unrealistic and after 15 seasons I completely stopped following it and focused only on the games.",
        "There should be a full match game like this that isn't scripted. I love it! Should be an energy free mode maybe? As its a bit pay to win\\microtransaction heavy.  They've made some changes, if you like ads and Facebook popping up after everything you do, then this is the game for you, dropped my rating 1 star as a result.  Also took out the ability to watch adverts for in game currency, now you have to pay. Even more of a cash grab now.",
        "Really good game but just wish you didn't always have to go back and start from scratch on certain levels. Oh and maybe make buying the boots and haircuts etc a bit cheaper! Otherwise love it.",
        "Basically a pay to win game. Would be more enjoyable with ads rather than forcing people to wait for 15 minutes to gain less than 1 minute of gameplay as a reward. It's an enjoyable game but not enjoyable enough to pay for."

        "If you've liked the first game you're probably gonna enjoy this one. It's more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it's built around microtransactions so if you're feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don't understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it's likely you're going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.",
        "Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren't aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don't expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!",
        "I love this game! One thing though, I believe that there are too many plants that cost real money to get. Could you please make some more plants that you can get them by being able to unlock them by playing the game, instead of ones where you have to use real money. Besides that, this is a really great game!",
        "Love this game so much! I am a huge PVZ fan anyway and I love playing this. You do need some boosters to get past levels, which feels a bit like cheating sometimes, but you can earn plenty of coins. There is always a new quest to play so even when I'm stuck on the other levels I can still play. This is a great game, well done devs!",
        "Ok its annoying and frustrating if you accidentally press a power up button and waste your zombie coins can you add like a thing lile when you press the power up button down below there would like something pop up like \"Are you sure your gonna use this power up?\" \"Yes or no\" to lessen accidents :(",
        "Please help! The game crashed so I reinstalled it, now none of my progress is saved even though I'm signed in to Google+, this is the 2nd time this had happened and I can't start from scratch again. Can someone suggest a resolution Please?"

        "I kind of miss the old version because isn't that why they came out with a 2nd game so if we eant more we got it.  Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.",
        "I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I'm playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can't complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍",
        "OMG BEST GAME EVERRR IT HAS SO MANY NEW GAMES IN IT & A SPECIAL VALENTINE'S ADDITION! U CAN EVEN CREATE YOUR OWN DUMB WAY TO DIE CHARACTER!!!! PLEASE DOWNLOAD DONT MISS OUT! And about the ads there are a lot of them but if u turn of wifi and data then u won't have a problem with the ads cause they don't show up!              Please pledge to be safe aroun trains",
        "This game is both funny as serious it's a great way to make kids understand the danger of some things around them. Like trains and wires and different things. As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.",
        "This game is really good and fun but strate after you lose all 3 of your lives it goes straight onto an add. There are loads of adds and I don't think it needs that much adds for a game like dumb ways to die, on the other hand it's a grate game and it's a laugh and a joke, I think it's a really good game☺",
        "I like it a lot this game is so good but there is one thing that really bugs me.  There is way to many ads.  Every time I play a set of games to get a good score and I click play again or main menu or practice it gives me an ad.  This really bothers me please put less ads or at least do not make them quite as long."

Why is it i had completed some of the achievements but it still shows zero progress??i don't know if it is just only me but i really want this to be fix or any solution can the developer suggests. It is a big deal to me since I enjoy playing games with a purpose to achieve something haha btw GREAT GAME!",
        "This game is so good! Far too many ads tho. I am addicted!!! Dont get the wrong idea guys  from other reviews - ads dont come up in actual gameplay its just when u lose or inbetween levels",

        "Great game of my childhood. Unfortunately, had problems with award when you connected Google. It's okay that game didn't count some levels, but I replay all suburbs and didn't receive any medals and there is no progress. It's really sad :(",
        "When I play this game on my friend's hand phone ,I felt this is the best game.  So, I download this game with my mom's phone n then share it. But it not like the picture ,itu just black and white! The graphics also. Can you solve this problem?",
        "Nice  game.....too good 👌. ..but only one problem I have noticed is that when you are caught and replay the  game from the checkpoint there's still a penalty  that you are caught. ..really doesn't makes sense....but the rest of the whole game is Awesome 😍. ..i recommed to also play Robbery bob 2"

There have been several updates that I love (the new maps, new sharks, equipment, etc.) and I'm glad I'm playing it now. In game currency price for items has been balanced out which I love and the missions system is much better now. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes progression-based time-killing games like Hungry Shark World.",
        "Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it's so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I've had to start all over again... but the fun continues!",
        "This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don't play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don't make us wait foreverrrr!",
        "It's a fun game and I'm enjoying it. However, I've come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.",
        "This game is amazing! Everyone needs to play this. I would've given a fifth star however you need to not only buy all XXL sharks to unlock the \"!!\" Sharks but max them out. Definitely download this, just one tip. Don't delete when you have progress. I've downloaded, played, got bored, and deleted 3 times. Now I'm never deleting it. I have so much progress, if I never deleted it the first time I would have everything in the game",
        "This is the great shark game I've ever played. Ive also played the other one either this or Evolution, it's good by the way. I enjoy all the time and is addicted to kill the time. But, it's so lag when my internet is on but when offline, is good. Maybe my phone sucks or I don't know why."

        "It is so amazing i love this game and have had 3 accouts before on it. on my ipad but now i have it on my laptop. I have allways loved it and allways will.    Update suggetion: can you please add  more lvls and every time you go up a lvl you get the same stuff but can unlock more of the game but you can diside what you can ulock as i think this will make it much more funnier.  can you also make the game better by letting ipad users join laptop users in clans as i have wwr on my ipad and laptop but on my ipad i cant join my clan that is on my laptop and its unfair so please can you add this in too. I think it will make the game much better thank you   PLEASE READ!!!!!",
        "I totally like the game and all but there must be balance between different robots especially..... some robots have a big advantage like the haechi with 3 medium slots and its dash ability.. its like u cant even aim at it......  Also please remove the components so that everyone is able to buy newer robots... u can make them available in gold or silver or even workshop points",
        "They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It's definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you'll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.",
        "Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don't be fooled. This is a pay to win game.",
        "A great game that brings back the old Mech warrior days. One of the few good theme fps shooters on this platform that is \"FREE\". You can pay to win but it will cost you alot. Investing afew tens to smoother the growth? But you can still have plenty of fun without spending a dime.  Until it slowly draws you in deeper.....",
        "I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that's cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!"

Awesome😒 Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don't reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie's handling. You killed it, literally. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.",
        "The game is good. There are problems though. D-muscle is absolutely useless. It's the worst car in the muscle set and has no business being the fourth car in that set. The final upgrades for the fourth car on all sets are far too expensive. It requires an insane amount of grinding to unlock the last cars. The prices of supercharged upgrades are all over the place. Why do all of Haulinator's cost 100 coins while Dune It Up's cost 1000-2000?",
        "Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I've never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.",
        "My 2 almost 3 year old and I really like this game. It's pretty fun BUT it seems to freeze up after a few races and I have to shut the game off and restart it to play more. This obviously frustrates little man and I'm sure I'm not the only one this has happened to. Other than that, we think it's a great game.",
        "I've been playing this app for a while now and up intil now I loved it but ever since the daily race-off challenge the game has been full of bugs. The daily race-off is a great idea but there are just too many bugs in it. I lose lives when I didn't even lose the race or I lose all my lives when I only lost one race.",
        "The game is my little boys favourite but the recent batch of adverts in game (Yahoo specifically) don't close - meaning you have to force quit the game. Lazy programming and terrible QA process from the developers. Avoid."

        "I'm really fond of this game and love the gameplay and quick paced matches. The new update is AMAZING!   There are a few things that would make this game extra perfect for me!   Must have character customisation. This would be of big amazing to me. Char customisation makes me bind more to certain characters. The rings we get don't have much value to them except for upgrading the characters.  Could have non-ranked matches. I would love the option to play/practice against rivals or my own friends.   Should have quick chat responses. Would like to communicate before and after the match with simple reactions. Like Good luck and I win, tee-hee!",
        "This game is if Sonic Dash mixed with Racing. And I LOVE IT!!! One suggestion I have that I don't think many online multiplayer games have, add some sort of singleplayer mode. Otherwise, great game! I like that it's free with ads being removable via in game purchases (which I did), controls, graphics, and soundtrack are outstanding, overall, I love the game, and I look forward to more updates in the future.",
        "Please add a custom character, there is one in the main game so there should be one here to. Also please add infinite, cubot, orbot, and eggman. Also some more variety of music and areas would be good. Thank you for reading and for the great game! :)  (Edit): we need a friending system and to be able to customize our characters so that we have SOMETHING to spend rings on. And Espio needs some serious buffing because right now, he is pathetic.",
        "Until the previous update, everything ran fine. But now, with the Cream update, the game lags a TON. I get frozen on one frame while everything's still happening. I start off in first, then the framerate drops to 0 temporarily while I'm bombarded with obstacles I can't see to do a thing about. Fix these performance issues and I'll put my rating back to 5 stars.",
        "To many ads unless you make some kind of purchase. Loading screens seem to take longer than I'd like. You can't at this time play with friends as Opponents are automatically chosen. There is still some characters ability noise in the game even if you have music and sound off. I'd like to see characters abilities not to be so similar, but it isn't taking away from the game at the moment for me. With all that said though the graphics are great, the game is fun, and it's worth the $1.99 purchase I made.",
        "This is one of the best mobile games I have played I a while. I probobly have a bias sense I love Sonic so much. However, if one thing could be added I would say it should be a converter for the Red Star rings to normal rings. Unless you want them to be payed for. I don't really care either way I'll just buy the Red Star rings but I brought up that idea because I currently have 23,000 rings just kinda waiting to be spent. Maybe incorporate phone backgrounds or some customizations for the game that cost extra rings? Thankyou so much for the new update and if anyone I'd debating on installing it just get it. You'll have fun, trust me."

But the race is done before it . Please fix this problem.",

So when the most recent (3) babies were available for purchase I bought them, but now those babies don't work!.... I'll give five stars when you get them to work. In the meantime, I think I should get a refund on my money.",

        "So, this is an awesome, addictive and fun, satisfying game to play and it is really good if you want to become a nail artist. I would of gave it five stars but it is a bit unreal like you can just rub the nail varnish everywhere but it only appears on the nail but that can stop you from being annoyed because it is not as hard as it is in real life and one of my designs didn't go into my album because the game just got stuck and randomly stopped by its self and it went back to my home screen. Also there is too many ads. I am not interested! And you can't cross them off unless you download the app! What point is that?! And I cannot move and make the stickers bigger on match this so I can't complete it. Help! Sort this out!",
        "I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn't get me board everytime i have different desins to do.",
        "A really nice game which also got me hooked up! Nevertheles, it frequently and automatically shuts down, deleting what was there.....this really broke my litlle sister's heart, even mine. For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....",
        "Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!",
        "I  am finally at the final last level! Before I thought it was boring but after I reached some levels farther I thought it was awesome! And it is the best game ever! YEAH!!!!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💙💙💚💚💛💛💜💜💗💗❤❤ AND when I was playing my 1st game all things were opened but when I played in my small sister's tab all, things were closed! I got everything for free!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA",
        "Buyer beware, I purchased the \"unlock all manicures\" option less than a year ago, not only to unlock options but also to remove Ads for my kids. It's less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed."

        "Honestly, I like this one the most. I like that it keeps the mini games present, but it has a new game style as well. I also love that you can play as the characters, as well as the fact that they now have a backstory! The game itself isnt too difficult, making it a nice game to play at all times. The only thing i dont like is the amount of ads, but it is a new game, and ot needs its funding to stay up and running. Overall, good job Metro! Keep it up! :D",
        "Nice game. I like the concept of rebuilding but this game was meant to kill time, I hope so. Keep adding characters and what we require is a hell lot of mini games so that they may keep coming and coming and coming. I do not intend to harass you but try to add more and more mini games after each update. I'm sure that in the course of  time you may be able to compete with the best games ever created but do not make the game larger than DWTD 2. Add more new locations too otherwise we will not be able to consume the tokens. The game is nice because you do not have to consume money for characters and get them through gifts instead. It is also nice because tokens can be collected easily. Please think about my opinions. I❤ this game.",
        "Brilliant! It is absolutely fantastic! Bit of lag and ads but apart from that it's perfect. Also it's very different from the other dumb ways to day which goes to show how much effort the creator(s) put into making them.They didn't just quickly make a few quick games for the money. No. They put effort. It is amazing. The deaths are funny and the characters are cute and so is the art style. Creator, GREAT JOB!!!",
        "The character models are cute and all, but the games are getting a bit repetitive. WAY too many ads. Like, ridiculously too many. The app forces a couple right after you finish some of the minigames. You have enough to offer us - forcing even more ads on top of that is tiresome. Get rid of them.",
        "Dumb ways to die 3 gets 3 stars. No, seriously, I loved the first 2, but this one is not good. Only 4 minigames, not really different each from another. Remember FASTER FASTER FASTER ? It disappeared (I miss it), and is now ADS ADS ADS. The goal here is just to use money and play as often as you can for ADS ADS ADS. The main thing here ? Minigames ? Nooooo, just getting (or buying) tokens and use them to repair houses (no impact on gameplay). Why would this game be nice ? The graphics are still good. Yes, that's all. Have a nice day. ADS ADS ADS",
        "To be honest, I don't think this game updated at ALL. Dumb ways to die 1 and 2 were GREAT but this one... not so GREAT.  First of all,  there are only for games that you could play.  Second,  it's not as creative as the other ones. And third,  the only good thing about it is that for ME there are no ads.  The list goes on but that's for you to find out and for me to uninstall. 😐😐😐😐😟😟😟😟😢😭   Im VERY disappointed"

Its sad my girl was so excited to play this game but instead is frustrated.  Stay away from this app. Cash grab. So far not even an opt to buy to get rid of ads...",

        "Let's talk about ads. I downloaded this for my kid. She would love it except for the fact that EVERY 30 SECONDS THERE IS AN AD! I realize that's how money is made, but that's ridiculous. One at the end of each level would be fine, but this 4-5 inside the level is overkill. And they play upside down. She spends more time trying to exit the ad than playing the game.",

        "Don't buy anything in the app cuz it doesn't sinc with other devices and when you complain NO ONE responds back! This app won't get another penny from me cuz you're a rip off! And if it wasn't for my granddaughter liking ponies, I'd delete the app all together! Seriously crappy customers Service!!!"

        "To many ads, even if they make the game free.. Pathetic. Conflicts with game when trying to back out of them and even crashes. Inconsistent game play, twitchy controls at times. Unplayable shots where one number on power scale is to hard the next one down is to soft.  Multi player has a feel of being rigged at times.  Potential for a good game but not yet in my books.",
        "Used to be so much better. Cameras are now not fluid, it doesn't show the hole prior to shot anymore. Truthfully, it was awesome before you made changes... It goes back to the old saying, \"why fix it if it isn't broken?\"",
        "Super fun game, but WAY TOO MANY crashes. I've been struggling with a level several times only for the game to crash mid-level and I lose all my progress getting booted back to the beginning. Infuriating!",
        "This game is good. You should try to make it a lot more like golf with friends (the Steam game). Try to make the graphics look more detailed and better. Add more maps too.",
        "Some observations: ball does not rebound off rails as they should, especially the back and side rails near the hole, where the ball hits the rail and stops dead. Part of miniature golf mastery is using the rails but not in this game. And when the ball is against a rail a shot is allowed as if the rail was not present. After a shot the screen should automatically rotate close to what the next shot would be expected so as to minimize manual rotation. I was making a long swipe to rotate almost 180° and my finger hit the power slide and an errant shot was made. Most hills are not smoothly sloped but instead very angular. Hitting the bottom of the slope causes the ball to jump in ways unanticipated rather than roll. This is golf, not basketball. I uninstalled the game because it just wasn't as fun and realistic as I had hoped.",
        "Awful controls, heavily focused on buying coins & watching ads just to play matches. Not recommended!"

But when I'm connected to Wi-Fi there's too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you'll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I'm playing the game??!! It's too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.",
        "Well before I say my review, I would like to clear out a few of the negative reviews. There are not very many ads at all, in fact I barely ever even get any. Second, the controls don't suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.",
        "Nice game but became boring in just one day! 2 options of controls: Spin (Steering Wheel) and Tap. Tap option is easier than spin. You have to complete the damn missions but the coins are only available in Normal mode they aren't available in arena mode. For making easy highscore follow this!! 1. Switch your controls to tap mode. 2. Open Arena mode. 3. In the beginning take the U-turn. 4. Keep driving in the middle line i.e in between of lane 1 and lane 2. 5. Just keep driving on that small line dividing both lanes and you'll get your highscore until and unless you get tired, I've made it to 3,887.  Normal mode is quite harder than the Arena but it provides coins and you've to play it for getting your missions accomplished!  Thanks",

        "I love this game, i've been landed surface in every celestial object few times, included Sun. I also recommendation to other friends in forum to play it.  But, I want suggest to add some simulation like : - Rotation planet. - Perihelion/Aphelion. - Perigee/Apogee.  And also some feature : - List for delete few space trash like empty booster in orbit. - Name rocket every launch (it make fun & realistic).  Thank You",
        "I am so addicted to this game. I love everything about it. I just wish there was a place to donate to you (developer). Also, I would love it if there were more rocket parts. Also, I wish there was a thermosphere you had to get through to get on planets. All in all, I love it! Can't get enough!  Edit: Thank you so much for the reply. I'm sorry I wasn't clear on the thermosphere part, but i think the reentry effect would be lovely. I just can't stop playing. And I'm SOOOO excited about rovers and things! Thank you so much again! :)",
        "I absolutely love this game, but I keep having a bug where either the close up or the tragectory map goes completely black so I can't see or control what I'm doing. It started  becoming more frequent after a few days and even after uninstalling and downloading again the problem persists. Please fix this! Everything else is amazing: the gameplay, the allowed creativity and the ease with which one can learn new techniques.",
        "Trajectory in orbit I really love this game you made. It would be cool if you could make the rocket face the direction of it's trajectory during orbit. Edit: Can you add re-entry effects when going to other planets? It would be more realistic. Also add heat shields for re entry situations. And when is docking gonna come? Hopefully in the next update. Also, can you add a feature where you can control rockets remotely? It can reduce the weight of the rocket",
        "Very addictive game.  Next version here are some thoughts:  show some flames on re-entry.  Docking clamps so you can put fuel into orbit and pickup additional fuel so you can go to Venus and return to earth.  Put the rest of the planet's in there.  Make it so you can take cargo such as rocket parts to moons and other so you can build a rocket there that can go further due to low gravity at launch.  I really liked this game and a lot could be done with it.",
        "Excellent game, very addictive Would be great if larger rockets could be built though. Also maybe someway of allowing multiple components to be linked to command buttons (i.e) 1 button that could be assigned to all stage 1 separators so they all detatch at once, then another button to ignite all stage 2 rockets, and another button which could be linked to multiple parachutes so they all deploy at once rather than ending up in a crazy spin"

        "I absolutely love this game! As a person who enjoys strategy games, from RTS such as Stronghold, Supreme Commander, and C&C, this game takes my top 3 for the phone. The match making system is very good at keeping same skilled players together, as well as it isn't very much a pay to win game. The units are decently balanced and the game isn't to slow or fast. Definitely a game I will keep playing for a long time. I do want to ask, if you guys will be putting in a \"survival mode\", and withstand against waves of enemies. Great job FourThirtyThree",
        "Its a good game, i like this kind of games and i love when i play with friends too! The game its really easy to play, a strategy game and simply as destroy the enemy base... Love it! Its true that not all are going to like this but for me this game its 5 stars. Btw i have started the game and i said i love to play with friends, does this game has a Couple/Duo match to play with them (Not versus them). Thanks in advice, keep staying great!!",
        "The game is okay it has a lot of faults. The matching system is horrible it always puts me against people that are hundreds of levels higher than me. And somehow their money regenerate quicker and they're able to send  out more and bigger and better units out on the battlefield. Even when the matchmaking system puts me against somebody my own level their money regenerates quicker than mine and they send out a lot more units faster than I can for whatever reason. Uninstalling this game",
        "I'll update whenever I can actually play the game. It's up to date. I get to the screen that asks if I'd like to use my Google account or Facebook account. I do not have a Facebook. Obviously I have a Google account. I'm writing this review. I click Google and both options disappear. It sets at that screen where the two options were previously available and nothing happens. I made sure to wait around 5 mins to see if it was a loading issue.. dunno. I'd love to try out the game.",
        "really good game i love it but just some ideas that might make it even better (I think the menu on the left side could have a higher contrast (text and background)or I think the trophy chest amount could be adjusted to the player amount in the clan +to participate in trophy chest you have to be in the clan since it started (midnight)please do some balance changes soon... some untis don't feel to be used enough or some just are OP like the steel saw mech or another idea :to have some way to delete (locked) chests )please reply if you (4:33)see it and want to give a statement",
        "This game is awesome, it reminds me of Guns Up! . The ONLY thing I don't like about it is it's basically pay to win. I only have 5 slots to open chests and it cost gems to open the chest and money to get gems. Other than that, the gameplay is solid. It's very unique in it's actually a wonderfully crafted game and not some thrown together garbage. I probably will end up throwing money at it only because it's made so we'll. But like I said I do feel the process for opening chests is a bit too cash hungry..."

        "I think it's a great app because if your bored just play on it you don't even need Wi-Fi plus I like the music on it so that you don't even need to put music on your phone so you don't have any probs that is why I think it is the best game...five stars anybody else?",

        "As others have said, the longer you play, the worse it performs and the more space it takes up, and after a while ads start causing the game to crash. However I've managed to get around it by reinstalling every couple of weeks. Other than that it's a good little game.",
        "It's a pretty fun game, better than I thought it would be. There is one problem, you don't really need to buy \"Flooz\", but if you do. The prices are a little outrageous. Like 5$ for 100 Flooz, seems a little money hungry. And 100 Flooz for 15 days is 29$ is outrageous as well. I've played other games with better things to do besides upgrading and usually 100 \"diamonds\" of anything would last 30 and would cost 10-15$. Seems like you're trying to rip people off. Besides the money hungry creators, good game to kill time.",
        "The first idle game that caught my attention. At first, i thought that it's just \"one of those idle games\".. But, the more I play the more i get hooked because of unique game mechanics. I might give this 5 stars in the future.",
        "I think the game would be enjoyable if it did not crash ALL the time. Get to a new level? Crash. Watch a video? Crash. Crash Them All might be a more fitting name for the only game that has ever crashed more than once on this phone.",
        "It has bugs. Like how sometimes skills don't activate right away, and on rare occasions, not at all. The currencies are pretty fair; I don't feel like have to buy anything (sucks for the devs, but it's not like I can buy anything even if I wanted to). Events keep the game fresh, and I always feel like I have something to do at all times, so it does a good job of keeping me occupied for 20-30 minutes at a time.",
        "Incredible game play it for hours and love it soooo much only good things to say other than server connecting but it's no big deal love the game the style the graphics the game play is all awsome I do have some ideas for the game if your interested number one being adding carnivore and herbivore types into the game so you could have dinosaurs and number 2 is world bosses were the entire community can all defeat one boss and 3 to have the ability to friend people not through Facebook. Love the game it's so good thanks for putting so much hard work into it and adding awsome features cheers"

        "It's cool and awsome and all that but  not that good of a game. It's rrealy boring first of all but next of all it is rrealy tiering and I just am not a fan. So as I'm really generous I will give it lots of stars and a it's okay game plz remove all adds and yeah that will be fine okay ☺😙😘",
        "Been playing this on android forever and its great but now the ads between games ruin it. No longer relaxing. I'm going to stop playing if this form of advertising doesn't stop",
        "Update: the game keeps stealing coins from me. I had 227 coins, won a single prize, immediately play a game or two with the character, and the next time I looked I only had 16 coins. And that is not the only time it has done that. Very frustrating.   Original review: The only real thing I'd love to be changed is the ability to switch it so the game slants upwards from the left to the right. That way, if you are using your right hand, your thumb doesn't block the view of oncoming traffic.",
        "Game unresponsive to any input on Nvidia Shield / Android TV as of the Feb 28 release.  It worked great before. Now the game starts but then it’s unresponsive to any input (controller, remote, keyboard). Other games work normally. I tried everything. Running latest version of OS, cleared game cash, game data, uninstalled game, restarted Nvidia Shield then reinstalled game. Same thing, not accepting any other input.  If this problem is resolved, I will edit my review back to 5 stars since I love the game."

But then it has lots of ads everytime i arrive at the green light and also when purchasing weapon at the weapon shop😣😣 its also difficult to climb up the hill or mountain especially when i accidentally fall into the sea.  Maybe add some extra moves like to able to grabbing thing, and speed up the ability to punch or kick people/thing.",

        "I have only had this game for a few days, so I can't write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it's up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.",
        "Most awesome wolf simulator game I have ever played! The graphics are absolutely beautiful, and the controls are pretty good. Although getting attacked by several animals at once when you only go for one makes completing missions pretty hard. And you should be able to run from a fight if you're losing, instead of having animals come at you until you're dead. All in all a great game play experience though. I love it!",
        "Man i love this game!!! So much better than wolfquest!!! I do hope tht this game soon be added new things like more animal to play as, better in performance. The ad free guys...keep it up!!! Just wondering if there's a add as mate system in multiplayer in the future? Anyways....this is the best wolf game tht i played!!! Do hope tht you guys one day add more animals to play as (like a snow leopard for example)",
        "Could you add more animals to play as? And a world idea could be a dessert. I love this game, and the others you've made, so I know you will make awesome updates soon! Keep up the good work. If you fixed the glitch were you eat and jump at the same time you fly, if you fixed that can you please put it back. It was fun... XD",
        "Love it but pleeeeeaaaase make it possible to play as a boar or a rabbit or deer. Also I think it would be really nice to have a hunger and thirst bar because there is no real point in drinking. That way if you dont have enough food or water you start to lose health.  Also I don't think we really need stamina from the food we eat.  These are just suggestions but I really really love this game.  Best simulator out there.",
        "It just lags now. The new update made it to where my chat, my character, and my animations won't work. I run about as fast as a turtle, and I am not pregnant. Please fix!!!! I love this game. I have a few questions if you don't mind... Can you guys add in multi-player mode, like single player mode, that we can pick up our pups, it would be cool to add that option in the top left menu. Thank you guys so much!! Love the games!!"

I swear this game will blow up if you just added the high speed score. Also, I wish if there were more cars. That would be really interesting. I really hope that you listen to me",

        "First up the images used as what the game looks like are fakes. I saw too many polygons.... (Shudder) Secondly there is no start menu. NOPE! Just some fancy loading screen and boom you're in the game without a chance to look at the controls. Plus your first mission is ruined by the tutorial at the worst places on the track.   Bad game knockoff. If you download this just delete it. This game is [EXPLICATIVE]",
        "Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that's excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.",
        "Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?",
        "Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can't without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.",
        "It would br better if you could exchange coins for diamonds, not just diamonds for coins. I also have a screen shot which shows that I should be the 1 place, yet another car which was behind me and crossed the line 1 sec later got the first place :/",
        "So many ad's, there back to back ad's. When I am finally able to select a race, guess what...another ad pops up and takes me to the play store to download it. I go back to the game and I gotta start all over again from the first screen. Ad's ad's ad's I was only able to play on the first day I downloaded it, after that..... Ad's ad's ad's                    \"AD'S!!!\".... But i did like the game when I played it"

To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed",
        "Awesome Game... no need to spend money to get best cards you can easily earn them... Can play offline too... There is a glitch though in season 7 - save 8 second stage... even after finishing it wont give 3 stars and fails me.",
        "I hope in the new update you can upgrade the engine and body kits as well. That would bring back the fast and the furious Season 7 track 6 nexts to be check it says three lap but you are basicly doing lap 2 twice and it says wrong way. Third lap starts when u finish three laps and doing 4th lap counts as 3rd lap. Needs to be looked at this is cheating  u guys are doing",
        "I have a one plus 5T with 8 GB ram still the game hangs at the finish line and all my progress is lost. I have to restart the game to get it going. Please fix this I can sent you the screenshot is you want. I love your game and it would be great if these small thing is fixed swiftly !",
        "Fix the detection when you touch/hit in perfect drift mode. There's been hundreds of times where ive definately not hit and yet it ends. So Infuriating, love the game but that one detail could definitely be optimized better. The drift should not end unless you actually hit and it screws up your direction. 4/5",
        "I love this game and so do all my mates. It dose have a few light glitches as most games do. I would love a night track of some kind in the future but other wise great game all together. Also out of all the drifting games this is the best one at of all of them."

I went over other reviews and the developers wanted to know which ads. Seriously?! How about all of them?! They have to be aware yet refuse to fix the problem. Do not download this intrusive app. Also I get a migraine with the annoying \"Ready? Let's go!\" voice when the sound is on.",
        "Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.",
        "Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you're given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.",
        "I've reached on level 93 been at it for almost a week now. And it makes absolute no sense no matter which way I go. For example I will shoot a blue colour to burst the same colour and another colour shoots out. Can you fix this? It's frustrating. It's a game I selected to relax my mind but it quite becoming the opposite. I cannot give a 5*",

        "The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item."

        "The game is fun, but results take 2 and 3 days and if other people are on higher levels they have access to better tableware and vases, pictures etc, so their rooms stand out more and they have a better chance at getting 5 stars. And some items I've purchased don't work it gives a message saying they couldn't find it in the warehouse. But the game never gave me my gems back and of money. NEED TO FIX IT",
        "I love this game!! \"it helps a lot\" with my shopping addiction because I feel like I'm buying real merchandise. I really enjoy the updates and how you guys added more room to be designed!!!! Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))",
        "I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.",
        "Entertaining. It's easy to spend a lot of the free money and diamonds on design, then you may have to wait a while to advance if you want to play free. It's clear there is no switch up on the top players, so when you go into competition, it's all about how much money you have to spend. Even when the rooms have a theme, people tend to vote for their taste, vs. if the request stated i.e. Mid-century mod, or traditional. Addictive unfortunately.",
        "Great application. Very enjoyable. Only complaint wish app had more international design furniture to match the themes and settings. Also need to fix the bug so that the design loading screen appears.  This is the only app that I have to reset my tablet to get my results, since the last update I have had this issue. I have made an inquiry adressing this issue and it still has not been fixed. I have changed my rating because of this issue, once it has been addressed and fixed I may change my opinion.",
        "I have been playing for a year now and I'm still in love with Design Home! True, it's hard not to spend extra money but I do believe that the makers have formed a game that can be enjoyable by those with money to spend to have fun but, also have developed a game with really beautiful items that one can buy very inexpensively, and even pieces that are in between. You can't get more thoughtful than that!"

        "I like it a lot but I hate how the drawings are so linked with pokemon go. I hate pokemon go!!!!! The graphics are okay but I wish they were a bit better quality. It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn't like how easy the drawings were and I don't think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn't recommend this game if you don't like colouring. It's ok!!!!",
        "I love this app! It's sooo good. And its brilliant for when your bored. But its a little hard sometimes to go over the lines with our fingers as the lines are so thin. But overall I think it's a fantastic app!",
        "I love this game but i don't like the characters tho .but it's fine . I like the way you can colour it in and then do the glow pen around it and at the end it looks amazing . You just colour and then press the pencil button ontop of the rubber in the pictures right bottom corner and then do the glow pen thing . Some people may don't know so that's why they don't like it . It's good when your travelling or when your bored . O THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!I like it",
        "I think there should be more cartoons to draw and color. And it should not always be right colors to trace it in. Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn't color the whole background, because what if you didn't want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!",
        "It's a great app however it keeps crashing and I have to start the drawing all over again. The whole app stops and my drawing starts over and it's really annoying. If this gets fixed I will definitely rate 5 stars",
        "I like it because it teaches young artists how to draw animated characters such as Pokémon Avengers Princess and loads more characters from movies like Snow white and the seven dwarfs and Toy story 2! Overall it is a brilliant app for boys and girls of all ages!"

        "Been playing game for couple of days, enjoying it so far. Lots to do, build times not to long at start, graphics good. Love the fact that in game purchases are there if you want them but you are not pushed to buy. Game plays well on my Samsung tablet and LG phone. Been playing for months now, still love it, definately not a play to win if you get into a good alliance",
        "The usual city builder game that's easy to build up your castle/city way faster than it's other counterparts. The people I've met on this game were pretty kind, the battle simulating is a nice touch which I haven't seen anywhere else. Sad that I only get to see like 3/4 models of the same monsters though.",
        "After playing mobile strike for a solid year, that game is really expensive if you want to be at the top with the big dogs. And this game seems great to where you don't have to spend much and actually enjoy the game. The graphics on her are amazing. I would suggest playing this game to all. 👍👊",
        "This is a war game where no one wants ts to fight. Don't try attacking anyone bigger than you. They won't fight you back, they will just attack your buildings, which you won't be able to defend. It costs real money to avoid having them destroyed. Spend your time and money somewhere else.",
        "When I first downloaded it promised you didn't need to pay to win and that hackers would be felt with - that was a lie. If your not prepared to spend a lot of money your just going to get wiped out by those who do or their hacker friends. This game isn't worth the time and data needed to play until there is a level and fair playing field.",
        "It is a scam game. You have users that work for the company and set up different realms but same players the force purchases. They then sell old accounts and start New realms. Money goes over seas to like turkey and russia."

Really developer?, ya cant wait a tad longer to stop the game and make us stare at a cat puzzle? The worst. I didnt even play it long enough to appteciate the poor controlls. Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.",
        "Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)",
        "I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn't have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it's Definitely Not a game you'd wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!",
        "Overall....Great Game, but with Controls of Shooting & Moving around....It's Not Exactly Easy to Around. And when it comes to Movement just in General....my Main Problem, But NOT the Only Problem was the Movement in Exactness of where I'm Trying to Move my Guy (My/the Shooter) just Stinks!! - The Game itself....I Love It!!!",
        "Good game and all but the pictures shown for the view isn't what it seems, and this game has some flaws, such as inaccurate hitmarkers. When an enemy shoots from behind me, for some reason, it points to the front, I almost died one time, pressed medkits, I got back up, and I couldn't turn the camera for the rest of the game. Also, add the guns that are actually in the pictures... :/",
        "Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout"

        "love this game!! The control are easy, the graphics are amazing, really well made!!! I would LOVE to see some BIG updates soon, like able to somehow earn gold plz?!?! And maybe have a little more variation of parts u can change. And hopefully some new tracks will come out Right?!? But GREAT JOB to the developers and everyone who put effort into this game. Thx guys  :D",
        "good improvements, make more tracks and some challenges to do. also remove rocket bunny cars and make just rocket bunny parts, make more parts, last exhaust is curved but flame goes straight, let us tune engine by putting different parts, like intercooler and turbo, let us change tire graphics, also let us put different wheels on front and back. this game got very big potential, try to involve some multiplayer, with ghosts and rankings, or open multiplayer room for more users live. high graphic option need very powerfull phone, my nexus5 doing 10fps, on medium i got stable 30fps. after update i had to buy last track even when i buyed it before, save file keeps my cars but no track data. let us make layouta for parking track. thanks and thumbs up for you :)",
        "Well... Ive bought all the cars that you can without gold... All you have to do is get to 50x and you will have around 120,000cr and thats enough to buy all the cars... And put what you want on it... Add more cars and add tuning, also remove the god damm machine gun exhaust not all drift cars do that... Fix it because its annoying and it also over powers the sound of the car...",
        "It's an okay game. The customization is actually really good and the physics aren't too bad either hit the optimization isn't great and there aren't that amen cars. Would love to see an MX-5 though. For some reason my upgrades don't seem to be applying though.",
        "Its got great potential, the physics are pretty good and the game stops lagging if you put it on low graphics. The fact there is only one option for steering is upsetting as i would prefer tilt steering to be a bit more precise but all in all its a great start to something big",
        "Iv been looking for a desent drift game for ages and now i found it. It has great gameplay and controls and good grafix to this game has hella potentual keep up the good work i cant wait for future updates IL RATE THIS GAME 11/10"

        "I like this new update. Hanks now have His own happy meter like Tom and Angela. Nice. Also this is just my suggestion. Can you guys also make My Talking Ben and My Talking Ginger. Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that's it. You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It's not fair. Lastly good job guys.",
        "Great game, probably best talking animal game out for adults n kids... but sometimes u watch a video so u can spin the wheel n win gems or coins but the wheel not always comes up... ive had approx. 20x it has not happened in last 4 hrs... would like it redeemed n fixed plz...",

Sorry I am re-downloading my talking Tom and start from scratch that only take pics feed and sleep on this game",

Bad I can,t see his face any more road pups also look good  but hank is 😫😫😫 when he is in level 1 to 14 at that time he looks normal but at 15 😫😫😫 all other games.

        "Good game but Everytime I Try to watch a video to open a chest for free or hatch an egg it just stops working . The game keeps going but the sound cuts off and you can't click on anything you have to restart the whole app. Quite annoying actually",
        "I used to love this game, but the changes make me HATE it now. Like it's so hard to get a premium hatch ticket now, yet y'all still throw two star and three star Birds in there. The Halloween event is impossible with the numbers set so high, and the amount of skulls you receive in a battle is 5-10 max. This game has become a money pit, and I think I'm out. Rovio got greedy, and I don't appreciate it. You ruined the game for sure",
        "Players are bailing from this game like crazy. My clan has lost nearly all the higher level players, most from leaving the game. So the clan is all low level players who can't contribute as much. Arena player's list shows everyone but the top 3 not playing all week. A ton of other issues that you can find in any ABE forum and even in the comments on posts on the ABE Facebook page. I think Rovio's stock trend shows it all.",
        "I don't have any complaint whatsoever about the graphic of the game, it's simply wonderful. I wish I can change the view of the battle, so if I want to use some tricky shots, my finger won't block the view. Some birds are (almost) impossible to get, I spend many premium tickets only to get two stars bird. Must use the internet to play. Heavy use of power, battery powers are drained...fast. Simply not enough gems aquired through normal playing, and the game simply an overwhelming use of it. Insane mode is really impossible to beat without dying once or twice.",
        "OK. So, it started off fun. But, now all I get is lost connection, slow connection or some other BS! I'm not going to be able to get any further because I won't pay for stuff. So, it's going to be uninstalled. Of you must, play for a week, then ditch it",
        "The game keeps closing during play causing player's to loose prizes and money. It's having more problems with every update. Support staff are pretty useless when reporting glitches."

        "I love Beat the Boss 4! But there are some things that I would like to be fixed. For example, when naming your custom boss, the name duplicates. The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can't go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.",
        "I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i'm asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting",
        "I'd happily purchase this game but that doesn't seem like an option. Tge ads, especially the LOUD BLOW UP EXPLOSIONS game that go on for 30 seconds are especially annoying. I'll gladly buy it, if only to not deal with Fing ads all the Fing time!!",
        "Too many ads. It's annoying especially when you are connected to the internet. The King Boss is not working and is always saying \"Something went wrong, please try again later\" and crashes the whole gane. On the other hand it's a super addictive and fun game to play.",
        "Game is now unplayable due to ads and KIIP rewards popups. The ads bring up my status bar so I can't X out of the ad, and the app hangs when trying to load the KIIP program. I have no interest in trying to play something that shovels ads in your face more often than you can actually play.",
        "Recent updates have made this guy unplayable. Now you have to wait  through a 24 second ad that keeps reoccurring.  Not fun for kids and worse for their parents. Kids loved it before these updates."

        "By a stroke of luck I got my old game back in February 2018 after a span of a year and a month. Good to be back. A suggestion : why don't you have something like a banking system wherein you can exchange the different currencies in play in the game. There could be a selling price and a purchase price which gives the bank a margin",
        "The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I'd like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.",
        "Thanks for new upgrade . Even when the game was slow i didn't stop playing. I love this game. It's not only a game for me...i am a President of my club and i have to lead my members... in less than one year i reached level 50 and almost all land expanded...just  you have to understand how to play... be smart... some advice for beginners  start participate in mayor competition...this way you will grow faster",
        "Great game. But what I miss are written below.   1. Direct search & contact any city.   2. Invite a city to be friend from within game.   3. Direct private message with a city from within Game.   4. Make a city tagged as favourite city or liked city.   5. Want a clean viewing mode of own city without those construction hats and other info symbols on top of  building being constructed.  I think they are massively missed. And if you can provide these facilities then it will be the best game of it's class.",
        "Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It's very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again",
        "I love this game but I want to tell you. You Simcity global HQ building have a problem . And I think all through the world of simcity player face this problem . Your global HQ trade only  View u wanted things like if I want Cement than I searched one HQ building than HQ bulid view me More  And more same thing like burger and sugar and franch FRi and etc things  And few other things like glass and etc I want that the HQ building show one type.

        "Pretty good for finding it on Facebook. I'm liking it so far, but there's no tutorial or anything like it, so you're on your own figuring things out. Some item descriptions aren't in English, and the text after you gain things in combat for gold and souls goes too fast. Still don't know what it's saying.   Would recommend though just for a quick thing to do when you're bored and have time to kill.",
        "A hidden gem. Premium currency is handed out in enough amounts to buy important things. Easy enough to figure out but a lack of a tutorial could turn away some. Only reason I took a star away because musketeer class line has high dex and str scaling skills..??",
        "A surprising find, i really don't expected this game to have this level of quality. This game successfully give me the feeling of discovery and exploration while in expeditions, and i feel compelled to build and better the manor. But a disappointment is how there are no differences between characters other than their classes and aesthetics.",
        "There is the basis of a good game here. However the fact that the grammar is atrocious makes it very difficult to decipher what areas you should be investigating for certain quests.   I find myself having to just randomly walk around hoping to come across what I'm looking for. I enjoy the game but feel that this matter needs addressed to avoid wasting time aimlessly walking.",
        "English translation is a bit funny to read. It's still understandable though. There's no tutorial so you have to trial-and-error things out at the beginning but after all of that, the game is pretty addictive. Hope I can play it w/ friends or as a clan in the future!",
        "A surprisingly good game and relatively easy to pick despite the lack of any guide/tutorial. I would have given it 5 stars but not being able to play same game on several devices brings it down. Fix that, and some of the English grammar, and I'll up my score."

The game is challenging and fun if you like a challenge. If your a lame, whinny, expect nothing to be hard, and can't handle a challenge as tough as making toast, then this game isn't for you.",

        "I would get to the title page and that was it. It won't let me go further. I have turned my phone off and back on and I have uninstalled it twice and installed it 3 times. Please fix.",
        "The game controls are very annoying. The character won't go where you want him to. During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don't want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn't want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.",

The only thing that I don't get is the new content community, it would've been great if we'd gotten some clarification on that, but oh well.",

The game is like vice city that's good but in vice city their will be boats bit in this game their is no boat, air port , bus ,trucks and people are always firing hero always and fight skills have to improve. The irritation thing is mainly adds when starting or completing the missions. U should remove adds and have to update the game play",
        "Your game is good but i want a bus and  bus stop and please increase the people in your city also show them in different fashion dress. The people should travel in that bus and our hero hijack it . I want to say more but till than make such changes  guys also bring sea vehicles thank you! .",

        "Funny It's funny and fun but doesn't quite make sense. He is a rope man....That's like making rope wear underwear and a cape then calling it ROPE HERO!More or less 3 is good for me. ALSO it always says ads if there are ads ppl adept that will ya!",
        "One of the best games I have played on Google play. Or rather it is the best games  Cons: 1. There should be a storyline with this game like a real superhero(and not someone who helps bad guys too)something I found awkward.   2.The area is descent but please add the underground train terminal with some action there too. It will just take the area to a whole new level   3.There are no days and night. No whether change, nothing.   4. Add more fighting style for the protagonist.   5. Please add more buildings and the climbing up is lethargic.   Else it is a great 100 mb game. Keep it up!!!!!! 😎 😎 😎",
        "Major problems with the Rope Hero games. ALL OF THEM. First problem: Leaving the game at all shuts it down completely; any quests you may have been in the middle of, will be dropped. Second: By tapping any of their many ads, you leave the game. Which in turn, shuts it down, and whatever you were in the middle of. Third: there are far too many ads. Anything you do? There will be an ad. Fourth: There are major grammar problems in any speech within the game. This shows a great neglect during the creation of the game."

        "They made me misspell Rabbids, including \"games\" like Sword Art Online and Attack on Titan, and had obscure art that gave really bad visualization of very simple things. Just play a better trivia game. Moreover. Don't give us awful games like Unity, Watch Dogs, and League of Legends. Anime is anime. Video games are video games. Video game adaptations of anime are still, at there core, anime. Leave those out of these kinds of apps.",
        "Legit only mobile games its not I gaming quiz. They could of at least put more console or pc games who would even know all of the mobile games out there.aswell if you don't know it you will have to watch a add that can be 1min long. You might as well just watch youtube or twitch.",
        "Overall super fun game and I'm really enjoying it, however some of these levels are really easy, and then there are others that are super challenging and nearly impossible to find out. I just wish there was a difficulty setting so you start off with easier games and then it could get harder as it progresses, because at the moment I can't pass 70% of the levels without using hints.",
        "Very great game, had me thinking of the gold old days of gaming. SPOILER: One issue I had was on the section of main characters where I did not sufficiently have the letters to spell Dragon Ball Xenoverse",
        "Overall... Amazing game but some games are very obscure and others are blatant. I love these kinds of games and can't wait to see the next update, hopefully more games to guess from! I love the diversity of games though",
        "The graphics were awesome and now you can barely tell what the image is I loved this game now well not so much because um I can't play it without asking myself who in their right mind would downgrade the graphics?!?!"

And I LOVE how you can change the hair colors! the reason I didn't rate this game all of its stars is because, I can't find the pictures of the girls I made and saved, and you can't change the girls outfits, but don't let that stop you from getting this game because it's great!",
        "you need more choices for style like maybe theres  should be clothes lvls too and maybe more hair coloring the colors that you picked are kinda un useful you need more hats  too  the three hats hats are kinda ugly an dwere trying to make it pretty so maybe a funny section of hats and a modern section of hats and necklaces they need more like maybe you could costumize one for your character     and maybe you could choose more charcters  for your desighns i know i know this isnt a quick review but it was just som ideas",
        "I I like it a little bit. but it needs more choices of the hat. I like changing  the hare. it is a very short game. so I am a little sad.",
        "It's a good game I just get easily bored with the same thing plus I wish it had a razer so you can make a hair to the side style that would be cool but other wise I liked it",
        "It's an OK game the reason I gave it 3 stars was it gets a little boring after a while and the controls are kind of hard to use but if u like these types of games then u should absolutely try it",
        "The controls are kinda all over the place , not that many options to choose from, graphics could be more realsitic so sits up like that while getting their hair washed ? 😊"

        "Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.",
        "Very simple. Gives me a lot of nostalgia. Two things though, it seriously needs music maybe some Celtic tunes or shanties. And secondly it needs more stuff to do. When I first saw a whale I was excited about doing some whaling but nope. The whales do absolutely nothing. Maybe even some treasure hunting puzzles or something. Good game just needs a little more content.",
        "Good game however, once you've taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world's and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.",
        "It's a really great game! I'm really looking forward to an update. I think it'd be REALLY helpful to be able to purchase an extra boat that just goes around and picks up boxes.. Having to turn around all the time gets tedious. Also an online pvp would be awesome. Maybe have the ability to make clans with your friends that can attack other clans. I'm looking forward to see what you guys do!",
        "This game is great overall and you have a great sense of progression as your ship gets bigger and faster. The problem is the controls themselves. I found it very hard( I noticed this when I reached HP or ship level 6 ) and sometimes close to impossible to fire at other ship even at point blank range. The game has a very hard time trying to focus on one ship and would often shoot at where the enemy was 3 seconds ago especially when there is more than 3 ships at once which often happens. I would recommend a fire button option to compliment the controls and the gameplay experience. As I said before, it is indeed a very amusing game and would be even more enjoyable with this added feature.",
        "Great game in all honesty I can actually see myself playing this game for weeks to months. Everything about it is perfect and I  love how it is not based on a story.   Note devs: for some reason after playing for 10 min strait my boat gets to the point where it can't hit a single shot so I have to restart the game."

        "Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.",
        "I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.",
        "this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It's a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that's it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame",
        "Great game, addictive, in a good way. This is one of the few games that is addictive, but does not take up a large amount of your day, unlike some game (Clash Royale), I feel it's not Pay to Win. Great job guys, thanks for making an entertaining, relaxing, non time consuming, free to play and win game. Graphics can be bested.",
        "Funny characters, endearing cartoon aesthetic and enjoyable game play, but after a couple hunts forces you to wait over 8 minutes before you can actually play again (in order to entice you to pay to make the wait times go away). What kind of game compels you to QUIT out of BOREDOM after playing it for 5 minutes?",
        "Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn't came in two years it probably isn't. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don't pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges."

Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don't register as pineapple hits for the counters. There's a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it",
        "Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.",
        "Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.",
        "Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.",
        "The games controls,  features,  graphic are really good and can't get your eyes off the screen once dart playing BUT, They are advertising companies that pop up there add moment we open the app... And whenever huge pineapple is on the move these things pop up please patch this immediately.",
        "BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn't have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What's bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I'm not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game."

        "Everything about this game is great, but this company/developer really differentiate themselves from the competition with their customer service and support. Any issues I've ever had with adcap or any kongregate apps were handled extremely quick with the most professions experience.   Try the game, it's addicting, challenging, and very fun. It is a freemium game but don't forget to support the devs but purchasing a gift pack or even just downloading a game you like for $1.  Thank you for the hard work guys/gals",
        "Yes this is addictive, yes it's fun, and it's great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don't have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it's not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it's clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.",
        "About a few years ago, I had this installed on a Droid phone. I never was able to open the app to play. Recently, I glanced through the apps I had & remembered this one. After thinking it over, I decided to get it. Now, I am happy the developers decided to upgrade the game. This is fun. I am contemplating letting the 💰 accumulate for one full day just to see how much I earn. Thank you developers for providing a fun little time waster. I recommend this if you are the type of person who 💘 s making fake money. Try it out & hopefully you enjoy it.",
        "This game is enjoyable, but like many have said, it drains battery life. Moreover, it hangs too long when switching planets. I suspect, like many areas of technology, performance testing new updates with older devices is not even a consideration. If it runs smooth on the latest and greatest then it is ready to ship.  Like many mobile games this is a casino. It's main existence is to make money. I do not have a problem with this so much, but the events give rewards based on leaderboards. Unfortunately, they are pay to win. You are bombarded with options to pay cash. Making the top charts without spending money is not likely to happen.  This game is a time and battery killer, so keep you charger close by.",
        "I really like this game. its really fun. so i figured  i should tell you that all you have to do is change your date and time and the game doesn't know. Like i change it to the year 2036 and i get all of those years of profit in secs and then my phone fixes the date its self and i can do it again. I've restarted twice cause i felt bad for cheating lol. Well hope you can make it were we can't do that anymore.",
        "You should be connected to facebook. So when people change from iPhone to android, we can keep our levels. I just had to restart again and I had 6800 lemons and not much longer to complete the game. What an accomplishment I'm going to try to receive this time"

        "Love the concept but ads after every round? And to make it worse.. Bloody too blast ad 4 in a row. Lower  your ads, get rid of the too blast ad and I'll uprated 10 fold. Also you could make the game better with a timer ;)",
        "I LOVE it! It's a great time killer, relaxing, challenging, and really fun to play! I don't know why people are complaining about the ads. There really aren't a lot of them and they aren't too annoying. I love the game!",
        "It was cool for the first few levels. Every couple of levels you would get a pop up ad but the higher you get in the levels the ads start coming in the middle of the level and they pop up like every 10 seconds.  It's ridiculous.",
        "Since the update on the game I can not get the ads to go away. You have to completely exit the game then go back into it in order to go to the next level. Little frustrating, aside from that I really enjoy the game itself."

It allows you to do two or three levels at the beginning and then it's been two days and I haven't been able to save up or accumulate enough resources to go any further. The only way to go further a little more prompt would be to pay money out of pocket. Not going to f****** happen.",

I have also bought recruitment and premium recruitment is still not many staffs i earned. I hope that this problem can be fix as soon as possible because I am very excited to play with this game. Thank you",

I don't get it cause I thought all my games save on Google or facebook all my other games are were there left off so please tell me I didnt waste all that money to start from the begining. I made this comment like 5 days ago I emailed provider of game waited 2 days then called Google only for them to tell me I need to get in touch with the game provider. Then I sent another email with purchases I did and my email and my phone number and nobody still has got back to me or commented on my review. So what do I do now my patience is running out. I even called the number that Google has provided for me for the provider and all I get is a voicemail which I cannot leave a voicemail."

Battlefront 2 is about to be banned in Germany because of the card system. I hope you look into it.  Edited: it's still the same. It feels like a pay to win. I'm going back to shadow fight 2. You know. The good one.",
        "I really like playing the game. It has great animations smooth gameplay and isn't too easy or hard. The one thing I dont like is you can't sell your old equipment or skills. If there was a shop to sell them or add runes to them or be able to combine them to make either new or more powerful ones of the sane type I would give this game 5 stars.hopefully the Devs will take this and add this feature in a update. Speaking of updates, I just installed the latest one it was like 403MB but nothing changed! What was the update for then?",
        "Hey NEKKI i have the best suggestion ever. WHY DON'T YOU add a grab button separately or at least give the option. Also make the side quest more satisfying. Just giving me commons just isn't going to work. Please nerf the herlad faction. 1 its crit chance is to stupidly high 17 percent is to much. Its also so quick and has long range",
        "Would be great if there were a better sign in feature. I had to restore factory settings on my phone... Now the game won't allow me to log into my account. Which sucks a lot, I have spent money on microtransactions and a bit of time into leveling up. But now that seems to be all gone...",
        "The game is a lot of fun but there's one big problem the only way to advance in the story mode is by leveling up and getting better armor but the only way to level up is in story mode so your other option is spend real money on better equipment. So it's kinda just a money grab. If that was fixed I'd give it 10 stars",
        "Amazing graphics,  smooth gameplay.  But the biggest problem is upgrading,  why the hell does a common chest need 3 hrs to open?  Do you want us to keep playing or play only around 5 times the whole day?  And only four slots for chests and then 3 hrs to open?"

        "It was fun to play earlier but as you reach the higher levels it becomes frustrating it seems like purposely it is not completing the challange ,.. my level is 1629 how much I try it is failed by single ball   ... It looks that they are not having further challanges  but  not agree to accept",
        "I'm about ready to give up on this.  The 'laser' balls introduced around level 1260 are both unplayable and completely pointless. The game is all about popping bubbles, well... it was until this point.   I was hoping to push through to the final levels but as long as these are in the game I really can't be bothered.   Honestly, when I have to guess the best time to launch balls based on totally random evidence... and lose when those balls are gobbled up for reasons I cannot fathom...  Following on... I've reached level 2082 and cannot possibly see how to  get further than about half way through with the balls provided!  I guess if I stick at it for a month or so I might be able to accumulate enough bonus balls to have a chance!  And there I was thinking that 2076 was tough!     And I **still** hate the laser balls!   Been playing for a year now... on the free version... you guys must have earned a motza from all the adverts that I've displayed!!  Update - I think I've found a bug in level 2215 - whenever I launch a ball it is immediately invisible and doesn't seem to have any effect on the balls it's aimed at. Randomly a ball will cause others to drop... sometimes invisible ones will appear as they drop.  I've rebooted the phone... problem still here.",
        "Way too many Ads! As soon as you finish a game Ads , ads, ads!",
        "Very addictive game. Just finished level 2530. I am getting ready to upgrade my phone. Is there any way to capture level data so i can start at my current level on my new phone?",
        "Great for leaving your troubles behind and having fun doing it.  Thanks for making this game free for those or us who would otherwise be unable to play.",
        "It's not fully free. It's designed to make you pay for extra bonuses otherwise it would be very difficult to pass a level. Uninstalling for this reason."

        "I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance",
        "I LOVE THIS GAME This is good game design. It rewards you no matter how high you go with a beautiful little tower. The colors are really satisfying. It keeps me engaged since you can \"regrow\" your blocks. That creates tension too--something to strive for. It's so simple but soothing and really addictive!!",
        "A Great Game For When You're Dumpin'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I'm in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren't too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I'm happy to say that. I don't like to stay too long. Great game!",
        "So,  basically it's a pretty fun app to play when you're bored. It's a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It's a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don't really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!",
        "Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn't have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic.",
        "Good, with a major flaw I've ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I'll tap, and the game won't register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I'm on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I've closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It's an issue I'd like to see fixed."

But if I can beat a level first try, not knowing the course at all, that's some easy stuff. I highly recommend geometry dash sub zero though.",
        "I think this game was made because with new levels in original version they added new effects, but the levels were very hard for normal players and they were designed for pro players, so they decided to make easy levels with new effects (like wave...). The goal has been met and this is very good game.",

        "I think this game is going to change your life once you start is going to test you all you know you need to be focused to pass the whole entire thing and make sure you try to get all the coins good luck out there and may the best guy win or woman",

        "The is very fun because I have been playing since I was a kid and I still find it fun.  In the future sometimes instead of race can there a event where multiple players fight a power boss like dragon and the people are given prizes depending on there rank and they have to do a certain amount of damage to get the rewards instead of just letting them get it without trying",
        "Don't waste your time with this game. It started out as a really awesome game until I found out that the developers only care about getting your money and after they get your money they don't give you what you paid for and you spend a week fighting with the developers to get what you purchase. After you get to a certain level in the game you can either buy the gems so you can continue your progress or stay stuck where you are. I am uninstalling this game and I suggest that you don't waste your time with this game.",
        "I'm hoping the update today fixes the glitches.  I got kicked out of a league match cause my device froze.  Never did that before til yesterdays update.  Please fix and I will give everything a five star",
        "This game is awesome, i rly like it a lot. But i see a problem in Arena battles since the latest update. Theres so many Heroic dragons and legendaries that are level 30+, and now they all use the right \"hits\" everytime, and when you don't have any \"good\" dragons, it is very hard to win. Previous battle system was rly good, when those dragons used random hits.",
        "Broken game!! While its a decent game to spend time on, it always bugs out so the graphics dissapear and dragons turn blue, forcing you to restart. Also your gem spending confirmation is not active even when its enabled!! I just lost all the gems I saved up for because of this issue!!",
        "It is a good concept, but it is literally begging for money. I didn't log into Facebook so I have to pay like 20 gems just to be able to get my level limit for dragons +5. To get a metal habitat, I need to pay gems. To expand, as I am not logged into Facebook and so cannot pay by gold, I have to pay gems. It is so frustrating."

Is it possible to fix this issue?",

        "Fun & super adorable match 3 game - the only game I've kept playing for years (3-4?!) Variety of different mechanics and choice of animal helpers keep it interesting, and less frustrating than the Candy Crush games. Then again, maybe it's just because everything is so darn cute! So nice to see the New Zealand birds/animals in there too, go kiwi! :)",

What a joke a bit like the stupid pig you gave us for gold bars which you made out to be free but no... Of course you have to purchase so why put that rubbish in the game! If I wanted to check if I have PPI I'd wait for a cold caller, not an in game advert! You take the living p*ss!",

Additional to that i saw therr locked 200 diamonds i clicked one of that and all my 420 diamonds gone and onlu 220 diamonds left and its showing me 2 big circle white and pink.. that's not fair....",
        "Found a game called \"Infinite Balls\" on my friend's iPhone, we loved it. This is the best Android alternative we could find, but it's not quite as satisfying. Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls. Would be nice to turn off the help lines, too.",
        "Super fun and addicting, the beginning levels are pretty easy but they get to be rather challenging after a while!  The only thing I don't like is the frequency of the ads.  Game itself is great though.",
        "Poor controls, continuous adverts, and blocky poorly created graphics.  This is one of the worst versions of this type of game I have played, there are other better versions out there.",
        "Good game.  Wish I could purchase ad- free version.  Deleted! I turn volume off for a reason, but then volume is forced in ads, which makes turning volume off option pointless.",
        "I found a bug. If u are playing offline and game is over, you choose to watch video ad while internet is off, it gives u the life anyways. Without watching ad. May b your developera forgot to call the reward video function on that UI's onclick () 😂. Overall a nice gameplay"

So I will give it sadly a 👎.",

Could you add a button that you can press that alows you to make your own custom paint job for any vehicle that would be amazing 3rd. Can you make and road that ends come back into the city at the other side example the road behind the hospital 4th. Could add like 5 houses around the city that you can go into 5th. More vehicles   If you agree with what I have sead in this comment like so the developer can see!",
        "Ok I get it but why do the army kill you for no reason? I like this game because you can do roleplay and I'm a girl and there is girl skins which is amazing but can you start with a girl skin and a boy skin to be fair with the girls  Pls do these. Love your company :-) but can you add a roleplay mode that would be great DO MORE:-) but now on my new tablet it won't let me play it please fix that and reply",
        "Good. However, the apple versioned platform overwhelms us by many advantages: They can earn coins and cash quicker n easier. They get options on what currency they use to purchase things. They get to higher leagues easier. Their weapon description overpasses ours as ours literally gives us damage and capacity whereas theirs comes with fire rate, trait etc.",
        "I love this game. But for the next update, u should give each skin there own special ability. Like the flash and hulk skins. Give the flash super speed, give hulk super strength and etc. So that everyone can get a different type of advantage. Plz make this happen next update also make a goku skin. So u can turn super saiyan. And have other transformation. So can u plz have every skin to have different abilities that match the skin",
        "I have been playing the game for 6 or 5 years and it has been the best game i have played. So, i  think you have to make this game better in the next update.Here r my suggestions 1 make the graphics better. 2 day and night shift. 3police attacks bandit in adventure mode.4 add a clan.  I hope u will add these in the next update.Also too many players that hacked their health so plz fix it.Thx",
        "Well while there is nothing wrong within the game, that being that everything is great, there is one thing that I don't like. This game is full of hackers, and modders who make it so that the others lose their stars, lose what they have earned along with my self included. If you could punish these people in some way to show them that it's not okay to cheat in the game then that would be amazing for the people who ACTUALLY promote the love for this game. Thank you."

        "Ok game, but bingo mode is a huge pain.  My shots filled out the opponent's card better than mine.  Stupid way to lose a lot of progress/coins.",
        "Love the game, BUT there's a glitch in chest bow where it locks up for 1 shot, multiple times a day. After you shoot without being able to aim, the bow works normal until the next jam. Looked for a place to submit info for possible fix, BUT game doesn't provide a place for feedback. This is only place to air complaints :(",

Thing I DON'T like is you don't get an average..... IF you do, I've yet to find where it is in the game. That's in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯",
        "I love this app its better than any other bowling app I've tried before.",
        "Quick fire is the best but theres only one down fall, the seconds. When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..",
        "Great graphics and realistic feel to the lanes. Controls are a bit wonky, however, and purists won't like being being able to steer the ball after it leaves your \"hand.\" LOTS of attempted upsells, but its free to play features ain't too bad on their own, either. All in all, a decent little bowling game.",
        "It's a  fun game but it's rigged. I think if you have a billion chips you shouldn't be able to play on lower lanes. I thought you were supposed to be matched up with people who are the same or close level. How is it I'm bowling against someone who is level 171 and 8 billion chips and  I'm level 43 .",
        "Amazing.  It's just fun watching the bowling hall whizz by and get a strike.  I've played and uninstalled this game, but the only reason for the uninstall part is storage.  For all of you who are new, try getting the ball between the front pin and either of the pins next to it, it usually gets strikes, but by strikes I mean doubles against level 7 Russians."

This gqme has been removed and i have reported it to the video standards board that apply ratings on these games. Not sure how these things are even possible?",

They know Legos are awesome enough that playing with some digital versions is enough to promote buying the physical bricks. ~~~~ NO ADS - Just Fun! ~~~ Even the adults like this one. It's comparable to minions paradise but with all the waiting and advertising removed.",
        "I would put a zero if I could. This is by far the worst LEGO game ever, and like always it's very boring and has poor graphics and gameplay. What is anything creative here? The fact that you get to choose what you build? It is so stupid on so many levels. I do not recommend this game.",

By this time you will have poured hours into it, so I do not think it is unreasonable. Save your gold until later levels (player level 15+) and you can get by without in game purchases for quite a while.",
        "I absolutely love this game. Turn based tactics are one of my favourite types of games. Since playing the game more I've decided that there's not enough gas for me to be able to enjoy the game like I want to. I think the car should either hold more, or gas should be easier to get. This is just a game that already has inconsistencies with reality. Otherwise I love the game",
        "Just loved it... I am at council level 18 now... Weapon upgrade xp cost should be reduced or just remove workshop. No use of WORKSHOP with such high xp cost because its REASONABLE to upgrade your SURVIVOR than their WEAPONS.... Please for next update reduce weapon upgrade cost....",
        "Great game, been playing for five months now and have managed to get all but 5 hero's unlocked. Lots of chances to save up radios for hero calls and love the different types of game especially the guild.  Haven't spent a penny on it and don't think you need to if you have a little patience and use your resources wisely.",
        "I have this game, and I play this more than watching the actual show. You can bring together a motley crew of survivors for missions and get gear to make them stronger. Build a camp, in order to multiply resources, because you will need them to improve other buildings. Also, to note, this game will not allow you to get stronger unless you improve your camp. I have survivors who cannot level up until I Improve the council. The training grounds will not be built any further unless you improve the council. Its like a city/fort building game with tactical rpg feel to it.  There is a leaderboard, that actually awards you for being at a certain tier. You can join guilds to help get better gear. I love this game!  ...The con that I have with this is that every time of logging on, deals are thrown in my face, and it is enticing too.",
        "I've been playing this game for two years now and I can never put it down. It's such an amazing game. I'd like it even more though if the characters we originally fell in love with were available. Like Andrea, T-Dog, Lori, etc."

        "I freaking love this game but I do recommend more energy or at least less time to wait for energy. Please and thank you :)  P.S. We need more diamonds some how like. Maybe you should let us watch ads for 2-5 diamond's each ad. Or do a daily login type thing. I know you guys wont but I've been playing this game a ton and for a long time. i restart everything because when you guys make new stories it makes me want to use diamonds but I don't have anymore. I restarted the game like over 10 times honestly. Thanks for a great game though.",
        "I never thought I would find a game like this that would work so well and play so easily! The only things I would change would be adding videos to gain more gems, or getting 2 gems after each chapter. Maybe even some extra gems after finishing a story? Getting gems on previously finished stories as well. I would also add the option to replay a chapter from the menu, not only after playing the chapter. Other than that, THIS GAME IS A MUST PLAY!",
        "I really do love the stories this game offers. I just wish the key and diamond system was better. I feel like I've purposely passed up some great stories just to play through them quickly so I could get back to the current story I'm really hooked on. Not to mention I've put money into the game as well. But being on a budget, I'm limited with what I can do. Sadly I think that is what will eventually make me stop playing such a great game. It's just too expensive in the end.",
        "Amazing! I love it but I absolutely HATE that you only get 1 key every 2 hours. And once you get 2 keys it stops giving you them. I love the freshman and I'm on chapter 11 but it will take me ages to finish all of them as the lack of keys you give. I think it should be 2 keys every 1 hour and the keys come non-stop. I will change my review to a 5 star if you consider and use some of these suggestions. Thank You.",
        "I love this app! I just wish you could collect more than 2 keys at a time. Sometimes the chapters feel short and to only be able to accumulate 2 keys feels like its not enough. 3 to 5 would be way better! Its already a bummer to not have enough diamonds to unlock cool stuff. (unless you want to pay more.. Not everyone has money to spend on phone app games)",
        "I actually really like this game. It's fun, it's time killing, all that good stuff. But the diamonds are what really kill it.  You get one free diamond at the end of every chapter, which would be nice if it didn't cost 25+ diamonds to make a choice. So to get all the options required to have a truly full game play experiance you must buy the diamonds, which also wouldn't be a problem if they didn't cost so much. (For 5 dollars you get 60 diamonds which is ruffly 2 choices and really they should be lasting longer then that.) There isn't even the option to watch an add for more diamonds. Buying them is the only choice if you want to have those certain experiances. I understand that the company has to make money, I really do, but charging out the ass for something is not the way to do it. In short, I would love this game if it didn't cost an arm and a leg to play."

        "Well... sometimes when I play some people I think mite be hacking the game or cheating. they don't miss one shot and I make none or sometimes one or two, that is the only down side but other than that it's a good game (suggesten have people by gold or game coins with the money in the game)",
        "The game would be better if you could do anything with the cash you win besides just play in different courts.  Making the player use gold bars for EVERYthing is lame.  I'd rather watch an occasional add and be able to buy cool gear with my cash..",
        "The new bags won after a win are meant to get you to spend real money to open them up quicker by using gold. It's so obvious a money grab for mini games, it's sad. Also, the more real money you pay to get a better in game basketball, the more skills you'll have to beat anyone. That's why so many people scream about cheaters. There aren't any cheaters, just those who paid real money to pad the pockets of miniclip and make the game a true pay-to-win clustermuck.",
        "I liked the game more personally before the recent update. I have a newer phone & since game play mostly in shooting basket race is glitchy, along with buying things on the app, I hate that you can only have room for so many bags it makes it me want to stop playing after a bit. I can see waiting 15 min, 30, 45min, maybe an hour but not up to 12 hours. I used to like being able to buy the standard bag for old gold bar gave me something to look forward too if I won gold in a match.",
        "PLEASE STOP STEALING MY GOLD BARS! FIX THIS SINCE EARLY LAST YEAR DAM IT !!!!!! Great game being for free. But Dam it, DAM IT, DAMMM ITTT !!!! Please STOP  The DAM STEALING !!! many reviews in the pass especially while you were coming Down from being new. Today I worked simple math with a calculator. The calculator verse your after math results answer did not match the calculator. 2nd i have a $1,000. Game cost $500. Entry fee / winnings $1,000. I win I only have $1,000 on my account. MY GOLD N FUNDS. where to complain?   No Fair!"

        "There's absolutely no way you're able to go through all the levels unless you spend money at some point or you just wait out the lives recount. It's a good freemium game, but don't bother redoing levels unless it's to earn more coins for essential upgrades. This game WILL take your money if you let it.",
        "This game is soooo fun!! Its better than Cooking Fever. I love this game!❤ the levels get harder but that's the fun of it. And the food makes me really hungry🍔! But the thing is that after a few days (when i first got the game) it didn't let me play the game, it just stayed at 89 percent. So I got the game again but it still did it😭.",
        "The game is fun when it works. Every time I unlock a new restaurant or a new region or bonus level or ANYTHING it won't download. I get a \"connection error\", and the only way to get past it is to delete the game, re-download EVERYTHING (which clocks in at over 100mb) and try again.",
        "I loved this game until today so it gets 1 star. Too many glitches or prompts. Right after I spend money on in-app purchases in order to use during a stage, my game froze. Another time, a prompt for an update popped up as soon as I used an in-app purchase and froze the entire game. Keep in mind, I'd already been playing for a good while. I won't be spending any more money in this game and some levels are set up to where you'd have to spend so I guess I'll eventually be uninstalling. It's fun, addictive but glitchy and steals your money.",
        "The game really very good.. it really liked concept nd i play it for hours.. but after unlocking paris I am facing difficulty to complete the levels.. even though i play efficiently some levels just cant be completed they require special add ons or purchases.. this makes game frustrating..even after giving my best i am not able to complete levels.. if its due to any error plz correct it asap otherwise i have to delete it coz i cant go any further in this game with this nd its frustrating me.. thank u",
        "I want an explanation for not being able to win the gold ticket in level 100 in Rome. I have spent 3 bosters on it and is impossible to go trough no matter if i make 1000 or 3000 coins i wont win the gold ticket and i cant go forward because of it. You need to tell the players whats the criteria to win this tickets because it changes all the time. I have played several levels numerous times and it feels like you give the ticket whenever you feel like. 22 likes 22 customers and sometimes you have to play the same level 5 or 6 times doesnt seem right. Level 100 in Rome asked for 1500 coins i played got way more than that no gold ticket play second time and changes to 1650 i play again and no gold ticket go and play again and it is 1800 coins.  IMFORM YOUR PLAYERS OF THE CRITERIA TO WIN GOLD TICKETS."

        "I'm loving these updates really bring more life to the game. The new car is really fun because it can flip over really easy. Please don't change that. A few suggestions: When you go to winter wonderland you can't go back. Would be cool if car panels would become detached like the hood or the trunk. Adding a police cruiser would be cool too. I like the breakable rear lights on some of the cars. Maybe add deflatable tires? Very good game all in all",
        "This game is fun and entertaining and you can test drive all the vehicles which make it quite cool. Wish there was a camera view which you could zoom out so you can see from a better angle of all those around you. Reversing auto changes the camera. Some times multiple simultaneous button clicks don't work. And I wish they had one of my favourite cars here, the Lamborghini Sesto Elemento",
        "Its a very addictive and also a great time killer would like to see a spoiler selection for the cars. My favirote car is fury. I would like to see a (1963 Ferrari 250 gto WITHOUT smoke stacks) the thing i dont like about the game it is not letting me into the city i bought it and i tried over and over again but its not letting me its gliching a lot and exits me out of the game other than that it is a great game would like to see some new buses and trailers for  the semi's out in test trive mode and a new land area in the mountains.",
        "Need a 67 Shelby mustang gt 500 fastback \"Eleanor\". Also needs a hand brake for sharp turns and drifting and maybe an inside view with steering wheel and stick shift. Very fun and addicting game. Great job here. Multi-player would be cool too.",
        "This game is really fun and additive I play it EVERYDAY. This game is by far the best demolition derby game I,ve  played. For my free car I would like a lykan hypersport please!!! ;-) If you do not know what it is please look it up and please try to make it they are really cool, fast, and exotic cars. If not I would like tank. Thank you for reading.",
        "Cool game! Good grapich! Nice control! Fun Game!  Well, this game need more jumpy track and smaller road for racing. Imagine if you race and the car jumping through the track. Idk why straight maps its not very fun to play. I want downhill track with ultra high jump im sure lot of epic moment will happened there   And jumpy map for derby mode with more obstacles and every maps must have its unique\u200b thing like falling rock or bouncy bomb im sure this will give more fun.  Car? I want the car have accessories like extra headlight, bumper or weapon? 20° arc ram in front of car will give more fun and and rear mirror and driver POV camera  Well, i want ice cream truck, the officially derby monster truck, hot wheels car and F1? :/"

        "I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there's only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can't beat them! Keep making more awesome games!",
        "This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn't always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing",
        "I'm really loving this game it's simple but still a ton of fun. My one complaint would be the sometimes the grind is too long and I almost gave up... I wish the developers would throw in some kind of experience boost in the store instead of just being able to buy coins. I would pay real money for an exp boost and would love to support the Developers! just give me the chance!",
        "I can't help but love a mobile game that doesn't constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it's tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.",
        "I absoblutly(i think i spelt the word before this wrong...oh well)love this game but i do have some suggestions.  Firstly  it think there should be more diverse boss like mire enemies having boss versions of themselves.  Mayve hell mode should have bosses every ten to fifteen waves ir maybe just a hardcore hell mode.  I would really appreciate even more of a challenge.  Lastly i think acheivments to earn things like more hashes or bitcoins would also be fun and add a little bit of flovor to the game.  Well that is all i got.  I hope yall read all of this.  I really love the game.",
        "Excellent game, can't wait for a new map. There isn't any tutorials but it's quite a simple and fun game, you will catch on quick just be patient. Hope to see new maps soon don't make it too easy on us high levels now : )"

        "My favorite puzzle/physics app. After I reached my goal of 3 stars on all the levels, I was sad my conquest was over. Then I discovered a whole other area of the app that consists of user created levels to solve. Now I've got new puzzles everyday thanks to the active fans in the brain-it-on community and I submit my own levels on occasion by using the level editor. If you like solving puzzles this is a great way to escape for awhile and exercise your brain at the same time.",
        "I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.",
        "LOVE this game!! Literally, I don't think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it's just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜",
        "Calling this a physics game is a joke. Sure, it has a physics engine that handles things like acceleration, \"mass\" and magnetism... But it's really just a very limited drawing game. Want to draw a ramp because it would lead to the most elegant solution? Sorry, can't... Because your \"pencil\" is too thick and the ball just hits the base of the ramp and bounces off. Know a simple solution? Well, have fun drawing it fifteen times while you get the exact dimensions needed in a very inexact system. I really think there are far better games to practice problem solving that don't get in your way as much as this one.",
        "this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates",
        "A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it's really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it."

        "A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it's a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you've done them and reached level 10 on both, there's really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.",
        "Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!",
        "The game itself is awesome, really awesome. But my god, there is too many ads, It is okay to have ads in a free game, I totally understand, the dev has worked to build a game so it is fair to receive money back for the work.  But here there are too many ads, there is ad in game, there is ad when you lose a match and there are the famous win coins for watching a video.  Couldn't find an option to buy the game and remove the ads, hope the developer improve this, because the is really awesome...",
        "Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I've basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I've got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.",
        "It's a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the 'colony' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you",
        "Its a great game but ive fully upgraded my earth space ship and i am level 10 on earth and mars. I have about 8000 people on europa and theres no more planets to discover so its boring now. We want alot more plants and diffrent upgrades!!"

        "I had previously given this game a 1 star but for this update I'm blown away by the network rectification aspect. The game runs butter smooth even after post FUP data speeds. The game is currently saturated with lvl 140 players with all the prestige weapons, so I'd request you to bring about a balanced match making in the PvP based on their matching levels and introduce some welcome benefits for the returning players",
        "It's a best game on playstore!!! I play it lot of.. and it's my favourite game.. but one problem is that when i start multiplayer match it says sercer not found or server overloaded. But it doesent matter for much. I give all 5 star for best graphics, bedt controls, and also bestest weapons. I love this game. Thank you gameloft. We expect that you will keep developing games like modern combat. I am waiting anxiously for next series. Thank you.",
        "This probably the best FPS game in the Play Store. Graphics, animations, music, voice actings everything in this game are awesome. 😊  The game runs in my phone in full 60 fps on Ultra-high settings. But sometimes it crashes without any reason and when I run the game again, it starts to verify game data. My phone is not rooted and I do believe the problem is not in my phone, it's a bug in the game. 😕  Overall, it's a great game. ☺️  Peace out. 🤘",
        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "It's pretty good for what it is, but the controls suck. It's hard to aim and you risk firing instead of moving your aim. Rules of survival has a better fighting setup however it's a battle Royale not a traditional fps. A bit sad that they did it better really. Final nail in the coffin is the pay to win aspect. There's multiple classes in this game and by far, the paid classes provide incredible perks. I don't recommend this game.",
        "This game is awesome.  But plzzzz ban clone paragon  first plzz plzz plzz.  Every match i see 2 or three paragon...  And mc5 is best game so far... One more thing this game turn into pay to win i think so plzzz reduce  the pay to win system and in match give 40 to 50 credit 10 credit is very lowest credit  to unlock items.... So plzzzz ban paragon first and give extra free credit  resources to earn in multilayer match...."

        "This game is a game I can proudly say I will never delete. I hadn't played this game for very long but I have loved it so much. The game is incredibly fast paced so you can play up to about 4 games in 10 minutes. It's never boring and always keeps you on your toes. Both sides are fun. (I feel the sniper needs a buff but this is just my opinion). Other than that small compliant  I love this game.",
        "Its greedy from the developer to make bigger price of silver and other chests every time when i get close enough to amout of gold needed for buying it. First the price of silver chest was 80 then when i got 60gold price gone to 110 then when i had 90 gold it got up to 130 its like they are pushing me to spend money and i never did that. Good game but so greedy that it deservs one star!!!!",
        "It was very fun testing the early access! And the thing that i noticed was the new token system. Im not saying the token system was bad, but i liked the older system better. On how there were bronze, silver, and gold stars, and the star depended how good the item was. I was wondering why you changed it. благодаря!",
        "This game has been amazing since early-access. I  have loved it for a long time and will still love it for a long time. One suggestion though. It would be cool if one could emote inside the van once you have got away or have been arrested",
        "Excellent game. Highly replayable. Fun and challenging. My only issue is that emotes switch from one side to the other when playing as a thief vs playing as a sniper. Plus, having to hit a button to fire vs just hitting the right side of the screen is a bit more difficult. Otherwise, almost perfect game.",
        "WARNING: YOU WILL BE HOOKED AS SOON AS YOU START THE GAME. The game is really cool, I love the gadgets, the replayability, variety of maps, and how this could be free to play. Even though there are alot of glitches, these improvements will make up for them"

        "Everything costs money. You'll be playing then run out of grenades. That'll be 30g. Don't have that? Well enjoy losing until you figure out a way to win. Love this game though. Made a purchase right off for a gun. Then I saw how much grinding is involved for the upgrades. The jump between a level 2 and 3 upgrade? Then the outfits, 2nd and 3rd weapons. Man. Sorry no thank you. This shooter however is very fun but the paywall is so well thought out I am not prepared to drop that kind of money. Learned my lesson losing 1k to Megopolis.",
        "I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn't have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn't get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren't vigilant of their customers and don't take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.",
        "I love this game so much. I have been looking for a good shooting game for years and I never found one until I came across this. This is perfect. Me and my friend would spend hours on this game. I have been playing this for about 6 months now. It's perfect. I think the best thing about this game is how organized everything is. It is very self explanatory. I found everything and it was easy to do so. I also love how they update this game very often. Great game. I haven't had any problems with it. I can't wait for updates later on to come.",
        "Great game with a lot of potential.... There can be so many more additions to make this fps better. More grenade varieties? A spectator mode? Clan levels that allow more players to join when we reacher higher levels? Gun balancing changes? I feel like the Cerberus should be buffed. It is expensive, and the 3 shots at once doesn't allow for many attempts for kills. Adventure mode for more gunbucks? Death match option? Allowing us to pick the map? I understand the game is fairly new, so keep on adding changes and new improvements. Thanks for listening!",
        "Great game to play, fun and exciting. But not F2P friendly. P2W guns will always be better and it's near impossible to get end games gear for F2P. But still bearable for F2P. My advice would be maintain F2P take it as a grindy F2P games and don't spend any money. It seems this game had an issue that you might not get the item you paid for. You will be charged and not receiving the item and when you try to contact the support. Oh boy... No body will be replying. It seems it's a trend here where there take your money and kick you out.",
        "Game is really tooo gud, graphics also nice n smooth controls but u guys released only one game mode(Team death match), but in lot of fps games they provided free for all, bomb mode, Flag capture n many more modes.. If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games 😀 n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area."

        "Okay listen, this app is surely good and relaxing, but I must say, i am having trouble with getting the game right easily. What I am trying say is sometimes the game freezes and I am coming upon some glitchey reactions. I would really appreciate if you made the game a little more calm or just review some things you can edit. I would like to keep contact with you. So if you have any suggestions on how you can make the game a little better just let me know. I'm looking forward to some edits here so I hope you can figure something out. I'm not trying to be bossy, I'd just wanted a little arrangement for your game. So just keep working hard on your games. Thank you very much! Okay now I gotta play the game. Bye!",
        "UPDATE- STILL NO MORE LEVELS ONCE I'VE GOTTEN TO 1190.. IF THIS IS THE END PLEASE LET ME KNOW SO I CAN DELETE APP AND MY HUSBAND CAN STOP WASTING HIS TIME PLAYING IT!!! ITS BEEN COUPLE WEEKS AND NO NEW LEVELS HAVE BEEN ADDED, SO RATING IS NOW GOING DOWN. FIX THIS PLEASE! I love this game but I'm on level 1190 and there is not another level after this. It did this before on a lower level and after a few days there were more levels. I shouldn't have to wait for levels to load up or the game itself reload levels.... my husband is going to catch up to me!!! Fix this please!",
        "I'm not trying to be a hard ass, but I take issue when games like yours automatically goes into a tutorial mode instead of offering it as a choice. It drives me crazy. If your game gave the user the choice of either to use the tutorial or not my ratings would be between 4 & 5 stars.",
        "It was exactly what I was wanting to play.  Also unlike other previews, yours is what you show right away not after a bunch of other games that are not worth playing to get to the game you thought you had downloaded.",
        "Plays fair - at least, so far. By that I mean some games like this stack the deck against you. This one seems to realize that if I lose too many times I am likely to uninstall it. No ad income when that happens.",
        "Its a fun game but the animations move very fast and it's hard to tell what's going on. Also, there are way too many ads"

        "WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you",
        "Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It's pretty decent. I'm enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I've raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn't a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)",
        "First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I'll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC's (and MK's) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.",
        "As expected, it looks and performs amazing. Fighting mechanics and modes are pretty innovative and thrilling. It is quite stupid to compare the console version with mobile one. Each one has its own unique style, so they should NOT look the same, cz' each one provides the fans with a different gaming experience. This surely increases the already huge number of fans of Tekken. 5 🌟 game",
        "I played this game and it has a best graphics play on the go,but i played it more then 10 day and the daily reward again started from the beginning the day one after updating the game of 175 mb data from playstore. Its not good, One more que my Koed fighter were locked by arrangement somewhere JODO records ,anyone will help me out to rearrange them again.",
        "Am I ever going to play this game?  All it does is download stuff Update:. Graphics are great, game play is ok, seems like I'm just hitting random parts of my screen.  Healing component is going to make me uninstall.  There's no area to practice to figure out what you're actually doing."

Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!",
        "Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!",
        "Its quite good but a little bit of fixing will do. The part \"Slow Down thing\" can you please please place that where it can not block the view of the player. It is very difficult to see whats behind it so it causes us players to crash. T.Y",
        "Great game but more issues to address.  The longer flight durations are a real waste of time,  make them more challenging rather than waiting for the destination. Also add more controls as the ones we have are not effective. How do you tell me to slow down yet i don't have the option for that?",
        "What is this. I was on level 1 and i just got to the last checkpoint and when I had to land it crashed when it took so much effort into going through them checkpoints. I recommend you do not get this game unless you are good with airplanes and have experience (which I do but this game just ruined it). I shall see this development soon.",
        "Why the hell they add brake when we cannot see the brake option even after landing which forces us to crash. Total stupidity do not waste time in downloading. Previously was better when there were no brakes just reverse it and stop or keep brake button always active."

It is both good for Iphone and androisld users. The only thing bad about it was that your profile picture takes super long to load, so I gave up on that.",
        "I love this game, however recently I've been seeing a ton of video ads. It pops up everytime I go to choose my playlist. All these years playing this game and I've never had this issue before. It is very annoying",
        "Very fun.  I wish I could just do the Party games though.  They are much more fun as I prefer competing with a number of people, not just one.  Too hard to get enough tickets, though!  I get discouraged when no tickets/videos are available.",
        "Forced closed every five minutes in the middle of a game. Slowed my phone down. And made it extremely laggy and hot. Said I would put a bad review if it didn't stop. Here you go!",
        "Would be fantastic but it's sooooo damn laggy. My net is super fast, as is my phone but there's so many games the song plays without letting me click the answers or the answers are still sliding into view. Taking me 10 secs to answer a song I knew within the first damn bar. Absolutely infuriating. Surely the app should preload everything before making you start or perhaps it's just poorly made. The original was never like this and I'm sure it had a different developer. Also, I can't even change my pic, whenever I try it just freezes up. Very poor when it could be so much better.",
        "I hate it, I thought it would be a perfect game for a music lover like me but it's not. The game just keep loading and loading ( both practice and Normal mod), i wastes 30 minutes for nothing, hope you guys could fix it as soon as possible. Tks."

        "Good I hope they fixed the bug where you double buy a car and it gives you the same car but still takes your money. But its still a great game. Ohh! And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.",
        "Good, but has some bugs I'm sorry if I'm being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall",
        "It's good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn't too much skill involved but it's a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I've lost countless games because it doesn't stop or doesn't back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!",
        "Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it's a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can't go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I'm out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!",
        "Shalom there, The game is awesome. I liked it very much and hoping that in the future they will be more cars to be added. I really hope that \"military helicopter\" can shoot something, it is funny...so idle. Last thing, a HOVERCRAFT can go \"river mode\" ! Wrecked... because of...water. Hope you'll add the \" police boats \" in next update. Overall, abundant of thanks and good luck.",
        "I LOVE THIS GAME. It just need's some work to do. Like, you guys need to fix the glitch of the lines by the road. And you need to fix when we explode the oil truck and fall on the ground and you disapear. And can u guys please add some new prizes like to change the color of ur car. And when I have 100 dollars u can spend it on colors  theirs a button to choose what prize you want. Like say I get the color blue for a red car. And I like the red car so I go to the prize machins and choose to buy a color than I have the button to change the color of ur car. That will make the game a lot better. And I'm sure when u do it there will be more downloads."

        "Great game, Love it! Very creative, fantastic graphics. Not so difficult or loss of life's to where you can't even play.  Yet still challenging.  Only negative is lots of ads. Would gladly pay nominal fee to get rid of them.",
        "Love it !!! Caught my eye when I saw \"pick 2\" vs. pick 3. I'm a stay at home mom kids in school 6 days week that gives me time to burn   (lol) They did a couple small tweeks which  made the \"typical pick 3 concept\"a thing of the past (FINALLY) BUT WAS ENOUGH change to make it a keeper",
        "I love playing games like this to relax, but on other similar games I can't stop myself from buying the stupid in app purchases all the time which makes me more stressed! This game is perfect because it's not so difficult that it's not fun and I don't have to worry about wasting my money on imaginary things!",
        "Not a clue if there's a story line, how the power ups work, the difference between the levels or what the deal with the chest is BUT it a cute fun game to pass the time with and relax with. It's challenging but I've yet to get completely and frustratingly stuck. This feels like a game designed for fun not to make money though \"buying lives\"",
        "This is a rip off of toy blast!  Peak Games went after hashbro MLP Puzzle party for ripping off the gameplay of toy blast by peak games. I am pissed off that they went after hashbro but not other knock offs. I liked MLP Puzzle Party this game is so boring. Not only they ripped off peak games they ripped off the music from Genies and Gems from Jam City. I will uninstall!"

        "I think this game is pretty cool! Also they added more houses to play in. I love multi-player because I like to see all the scores and I don't like the office because their's spiders and I hate spiders. I beat the Christmas level and I'm trying to beat the other levels too. But when you start the game, it says choose cat and press it and there's a skinny cat with the ears    down. I choose the kitten. But I LOVE the garden level because you go on the slides and you can go in the house and go out of it and go on the carousel and more! But on the picture when you download the game, the cat is in the washer and in the fridge. But you can't do that in the game. I tried too. Its boring at first but it's fun! I also don't know where the cats house is. Is it in the first house? I TOTALLY love it.😀😀😀😀😀😀😁😁😁😁😺😺😺😺😺😺😸😸😸😸😸😸😻😻",

They really have thought everything thru and keep improving the game play consistently. Other than not explaining a few parts of the game enough I really don't have any complaints.  You really don't have to spend money, as long as you are an active player an devote enough time to it. And from what I have heard about other games it's not quite as crazy of a $$$ spong as some other games my brother plays. Over all I think this if a great game and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for that new game to occupy your boredom & spare time. I give it a 9 outta 10.",

It's simple to click the ad off before the game commences. *wink* The background is lovely and the graphics are wonderful! So relaxing. The happy little \"card dance\" animation after each win is nice, as well. Thank You!",

There are some flaws, mainly in the fact that there are only a few maps so more maps would be nice. Also, it would be nice if you could change the name or if there is a way, tell me. There are other slightly bad things but overall a great game.",
        "Great concept the only thing wrong with it is the slow movement's that happens some Times during the game hope  that you all fix it. Another thing is the lack of stages there are only four to three stages and all of them are with ice add more and I guarantee your that your ratings is going to rise. Finally the option to change your name at the main screen and better control's than just jumping. Would love to play it once these issues are fixed and I don't mean to be harsh hope you all got my opinions",
        "This game is good awful DO NOT INSTALL. The graphics are the only decent thing in this game and they are ripped off of the real game. The controls rarely work. The ads are always in the way. The AI's are OP and there is no point in playing the game. Its a much better idea to just buy the real game on steam instead. 100x better",
        "The graphics are perfect for the style, but attacks should be more under your contract with weapons, and variation without. I also can't find the Bluetooth multiplayer hinted by the Bluetooth connection permissions. Is that a later feature? If so please add soon!",

        "As much as I really love the artwork and gameplay, there is still an issue: can you please make all of the current and future makeups compatible with all skin tones? It's not really fair for those who aren't of pale skin. Thank you for all the progress and work made so far, & I really hope that there's a way you can make this happen. Thanks!   (I would give a full five stars if everyone could have equal ability to wear different makeups)",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events.",
        "I love the game. From its cute and addictive style to its unique and original dress up gameplay, it turned me from a dress up hater to lover. But I feel like there's a Paywall especially during events, and diamonds are forced to be bought, but they can be earned, which is good. But so far, you seem to have listened to feedback, from the skin tones to the bug fixes. But I love it still.",
        "In depth in both gameplay and attention to details of awarded items. Continuous hours not required but with once a day of incentive activities. Controls are  sometimes unstable. If a glitch does happen, its fixed fast and your also awarded for time spent. Very happy customer. Enjoyed the best dress up game I've played so far. Thank you makers!",
        "I've been playing this game for about 5 months now, it has amazing graphics and wonderful gameplay. My only problem with it is a lot of the times its very difficult to obtain the events suits. I feel like the only way for you to complete a suit is to spend some sort of cash. I get that you have to make an earning but it just makes the game annoying to play. I would also like more skin tone options and would like the makeup to be compatible. Anyways thank you for creating a wonderful game.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted"

        "I really enjoy this game, but I have found a flaw in the design. The game speeds up as you go and after a point it doesn't go faster, but after around 10,000 you notice the ball start to move forward on the screen and after about 20,000 you don't even have to move the ball to not die. It just misses the spikes. I know you might be thinking Its not on the leaderboards, but that's my next complaint. Im currently 6 on the leaderboards, but I've gotten a better score and it won't update. I quite frankly destroyed that score and it doesn't show up. Thank you for your time and I hope this helped",

        "Game is great, far too many ads, after each level AND major issues with the videos giving rewards. I watched 4 and only received 1 reward which makes the game unfair and not worth playing.",

The actual game itself is amazing despite having a hard time trying to beat the bacteria level but, what's the point of a good game concept, if the game won't work properly",
        "I thought the new scenario was a free-trial only like the simian flu. (At least you can unlock it after being a brutal pro at the game) I'm gonna enjoy playing this a good few times and unlock even MORE scenarios. Keep up the good work! I wanted to make a suggestion, but I just can't remember now. Oh well...",
        "The game is addictive but when you get to a certain point the cure kicks in and it stops giving away DNA points and it makes it hard to advance in the game. I have read the hints in the news it gives, but I still can't manage to beat the game. I want to delete the game. Butim going to continue to try. I just wanted to mention it idk if its the game or just me. I won't tell others about the game only because its frustrating to play. These games are not good for people to play that has any type of mental issue unless they want to buy a new phone.",
        "Fun game. I wish the rate of death was more consistent. 37,000,000 a day at one point, but waiting 6 months for 100,000 to die towards the end. The disease didn't change, the rate of death shouldn't decrease just because there are fewer people. Good game otherwise",
        "From beginning to end I've been pleasantly surprised and let down but mainly let down. I was all for this game when it came out but now you wanna make a quick buck on a scenario app... pay more for something that should be part of the game. Overall good game business practices not so much.",
        "I didn't buy the new plague, i might need to. The first 2 difficulty settings are easy, the 3rd not so much. Good game to me! Just have to read what it is that you spend your DNA points on and you should do just fine"

It's just hard okay to win this dinosaur.",

You have to wait 30 minutes between each attempt but its not like I have the time to play every 30 minutes just to be disappointed. So far I have been attempting the same dinosaur for over 24 hours."

        "Such a bad game. Nekki never gets enough of money so they show ads nearly after every fight. You can't earn gems from watching videos as it's never available. Tapjoy offers have been completed, but never awarded. All the weapons gets worser as you level up. Nekki wants you to BUY the good weapons. Bad game. Shadow fight 3 is worser than this one.",
        "Great game, my only problem is that it took a long time grinding for the money you need to buy items. It took me about 5 hours of grinding just to upgrade each weapon/armor, 6 hours to buy new ones. Still a great game, loved the way it's in shadows, making it harder to tell who you are.",
        "Let me just say I don't mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high",
        "The game crashes unexpectedly even in the middle of a fight and when I return the energy I used for the fight when it crashed is already consumed when I didn't even finish it.  It evwn crashes in the middle of a raid =(    The game is good but I hope the crashing is fixed. I restart my phone and it works smoothly after that but I can't have my phone restartung every time I want to play. Please fix this",
        "This game is requires you to spend cash if you wanna get strong or atleast equivalent to the game difficulty scaling. It requires spending more gold or gems rather than actual skills with over priced weapons and gears. The controls are not sensitive and clunky. Overall. Could have been a great game but greedy developers."

        "I love this game but an issue im having since the newest update os why im giving 2 stars at the moment. Ever since the update the game will not load. Says \"loading cantina\" then closes the app completely. Im gonna end up getting kicked out of my guild...please fix this! Soon as its fixed it will return it to 5 stars bc the overall game is badass!",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info.",
        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "Good game but be warned to really get any good characters you're either going to have to pay lots of real money or you'll find yourself grinding forever the same nodes to upgrade the characters that you have. With that said this game is a big improvement over heroes of dragon age of which in many ways this game is modeled after . It seems very clear that some of the devs from that game migrated to this game to start it up. The last update at 02-26-18 freezes at loading screen and then force closes come on devs get on this!",
        "Really good game. I love games where you have to grind to get the best character with a slight bit of luck if you pull them. The only thing i would change is how long it takes to get your energy back as. I feel like when i run out i cant play the game gor a long time as it takes a lot of time to get your energy back. But overall would fully recommend"

For one month it's 7.99 and may I remind you that Netflix (10000% better) is the exact same price as that for a standard pack. Episode (story app like this) is much more cost-efficient and over all better because at the very least you can make your character resemble you, don't have to spend so much out of your pocket, and Episode also isn't prone to crashing like this one.",
        "The stories are addicting and exciting. But you make us watch several ads and THEN ask us to pay for EVERY THING extra. From clothes to hair to what to say next to new chapters. I get the world revolves around money but you are getting paid plenty with these big name ads. Let the game be more enjoyable and make it free or a set price from the start for the app. You lure people in and then ask for money if they want to continue. Nah, I'll wait an hour for the ticket. Great game concept though.",
        "I've only read 1 story so far. The story itself wasn't bad. The characters are kind of goofy looking but I like the app. You're able to earn gems as you go. It does give you only 1 ticket at a time, per hr. But it also gives you the option to watch videos to speed up the clock so you can get it sooner. Which NONE of the other apps like this do! However, at the moment, it isn't working for me. No matter how many times I try to speed up the clock, it isn't budging. It was working 2 hrs ago. So, IDK if there is a daily limit or what, because I didn't get a warning. There is something about the videos I don't like though... After you watch them, it automatically brings you to the app store to download whatever game you just watched the video for. Sooooo annoying! Otherwise, not a bad game thus far. It is a great time waster!",
        "Subscribed for a month..cost me $9.99.  Not bad I thought...until the game stopped working in the middle of a story. Had to restart game and it went to loading page....stayed at 10% and will Not load any further. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling ...no luck! Asking for my money back . Funny how it stopped working a couple hours after I paid!!!",
        "So addictive I couldn't stop playing it. Only thing I will say is you need to get to many diamonds for the clothes and some of the decisions you have to make. X Is there any more books after Mona series study abroad ? As it did say to be continued",
        "well, first the characters are goofy- looking and the the choices to customize your character are limited. Most of the stories are intriguing and actually enjoyable, however I would personally stop playing this game after a couple of days, because it is difficult to earn passes and the game doesn't hook you enough to return to the game like other choice games such as episode. Episode,on the other hand is extremely addicting which is what makes it so popular. It's not terrible, but please accept my request to change the characters appearance because you have been receiving complaints about this and it would definitely attract more people to your game.  Thanks"

        "Cross platform across Apple and Android and PC makes this game a fluid joy to play, without the feeling of a toned down mobile port - due to its 1:1 experience from the PC. It's the only Blizzard game u can play on Mobile. I'm a legend (highest skill tier) ranked and totally F2P so the people who say this game is pay to win or random luck do not understand the game. Paying for is meant for helping you finish your collection fast. Overall highly recommended.",
        "Lots of fun over and over again. It doesn't get boring because of all the expansion updates that keep coming up. You need to readjust your decks to adapt with the new cards that get released. Didn't give it a full 5 because of the lag and graphic issues that keep coming up for me and others of the forums.               Playing on a Note 5",
        "I'm trying to link my account to my other one by using my blizzard account that I already have. But it just makes me do the tutorial and after I completed it, it just keeps on doing the starter stuff. Even though I already have a blizzard account with my hearthstone rank 20, but it just restarts me back to ,25. I'm not sure its a glitche or I'm doing something wrong but It just wont let me log in my account.",
        "I used to play the old tcg and this not  close to be a good card game. All it is is monster with power, moslty no spell, no artifact, no nothing. This game is boring and is lagging so much on the cellphone. Shadowverse is ways better for a similar formula, has a really good storyline and a waaaaay more generous. When you buy card for HS you get mostly nothing. They had the chance to do something good, everyone love the lore of warcraft, but they BS it.",
        "What the hell? I played this game about 2-3 years ago and i really liked it (on that time). But now when i came back I just can't win anyone. I tried to win on rank 25 about 10 times. There always players with full deck of legendary/epic cards, 25 RANK, DAMN!",
        "This game is about alright. Its very fun. Period.  But 2 major issues it's gonna face problems with is we can not add friends. Says friend request sent but no request found! Plus this game is very very Pay 2 Win! In the start its fun but than deck goes so unbalanced since money hungry creaters wouldn't allow good rewards for free! So kbviously knly the rich win? Ahh this sucks"

        "Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.",
        "Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don't get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a \"Create a Player\" option under 'My Club' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It'd be so nice if you add that.",
        "I will love it if i can send players on loan and be paid some coins instead of directly selling them off. Also switching players for a few or no coins will be great. Since players like pogba likes changing his hairstyles, it will also be great to effect some changes in some players hairstyle. More leagues are needed, if possible, German,  Chinese, Nigerian and south African league. Lastly, commentators find it difficult to call the name of a created player, work on these and this game will be perfect.  Thanks",
        "DLS is one of the best games on Android. Just need some improvement in training mode, Training is full of bugs. And where is Ball change mode?? Please add new stylish Match Balls. AND PLEASE ADD NEW CELEBRATIONS IN NEW STYLE!! Need more realistic Gameplay. Really hope that you guys fix all small bugs soon. I'll rate 5 Stars!! ❤👏👏",
        "Very good game. There are lots of players but Manuel Neuer is missing. Some extra things need to be done for this game to become the top football game. German Clubs and many clubs of other countries like those of Poland, Denmark, etc. are missing. If these clubs are added, then the game becomes complete. Hope this changes are done by the \"First Touch\" as fast as possible.",
        "Great game. I suggest that every team plays each team both home and away like in the Premier League. This makes each season longer and gives you the chance to beat teams that beat you the first time round.  Also, you should be able to bid for players instead of waiting for them to be up for transfer. You can form a dream team better that way, settling on a certain price for a player."

        "Perty good Edit: We're in the middle of an event and the game won't load. Finally says down for maintenance. It would be nice to get a heads up on when that happens. Gonna put a hindrance on the event that's over on Friday. Do hope it's resolved soon. Still like the game tho, but would like it better if I can play.",
        "Right.  First off, If you are not a fan of Idle games, then don't play. This is the epitome of an Idle game.   The Early game is pretty simple. Click, Collect, Make your way to Level 80. You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn't bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn't been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event's are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events'  All in, pretty good.",
        "Actually love the game but I am furious. I linked the game with my Facebook to get the 3g% follower boost and it ERASED EVERYTHING. I have 45 gold I was ranked 3,000 in the presidents day event had A LOT OF ENDORSEMENTS FOR IT it ERASED my progress I hate that I have to start over again. Seriously need to fix this because this sucks never would've linked the game if I knew this would happen, fix it and I'll give 5 starts",
        "This is probably the first time I'm giving only 1 star to a game, without the reason being that there are so many ads. I hate this game from the bottom of my heart. This game uses the same old overused investing format, that Kongregate has used in their previous games. Unoriginal concept. No point in playing the game. What I hate even more is how the game looks. The visual design is horrible. It makes me sick. Everything just looks so cheap and placed in the wrong spots. The design was very nice in Adventure Communist, which is why I don't understand this excuse of a proper design. C'mon, Kongregate. You're better than this.",
        "Well guess they deleted my last post cause I complained that the game took up 1.8 gig till I uninstalled it and reinstalled it then lost my saves because of bad programming.   Don't waste your time or money on this company.",
        "Not a bad idle game, but feels very \"pay to get anywhere at all\", let alone \"pay to win. Gold ingame seems a bit overpriced compared to most other game currencies and the offers to earn free gold don't work, either the offer just happens to no longer be there once you've done it, or it is still there and just doesn't register that you've done it, and this is after a few days of waiting, not the hour or two the app promises."

        "I think the shooting range should be mechinary the bullet shouldn't be reloaded . It should be going as many as it can. Nice game. Really I don't play games but for cover fire am in love with it. And please there should be no end of it because am playing it. Till I lost my phone. 😂",
        "This is very nice game, but problem is all time it's will show the upgrade the card's.. So do some change.. game and graphic are really good.. but card updation is boring, I will give one opinion please change the updation of card's system....... And energy need to play its taken so much time.. So we are not playing these game for long..... Please change some of these problem.... Except the card updation system and energy systems... The game is really challenging. please improve some changes",
        "All good and I've completed all ur levels in 10days. Now I'm awaiting for ur new levels and one more which I'm surprised is that.. I'm expecting some stories to end it. I've understood so far that there are other side people who are building some thing and they r trying to stop us but I have not understood why these 2 group are fighting and who is the leader in my group and theirs too. U need to make some more realistic stories so that we can take it part of action movie.. Thanks otherwise",
        "I am rewriting my review and giving 5 stars for all. One of the rare games where it is possible to play without paying real money. If you want you can pay to proceed faster but not paying doesn't mean that the game will be unplayable. Bravo!",
        "This is my most honest review..Never have I ever played a game truly this fantastic where you literally don't have to spend real money if you could wait 4 hrs for every chest. Gameplay is amazing and then there are events which make the experience even more enthralling. Give this piece a go."

The program component can be a standard score from the AI judges yet will be under review by fans (other players who can add to the overall score, max 4 points only). Lastly, there should be a season that features state, regional, national, world, and finally olympic competition based on the current judging system for the short program and free skate [150-164 meh, 165-174 is okay, 175-189 is very good, 190-199 is excellent, and 200+ is \"strictly Russian\" (Weir, NBC 2018 Winter Olympics)]! Each event should have qualification rounds to add to the nerves of each skater! ( =",
        "Its a good game and i enjoy it but the graphics are bad because my game gliches and i dont know whats going on. Also i dont like having to pay to get the thinks and to many thinks are whach a vidio to get the thinks it takes to long so i dont l0play it that often. I hope u understand what I'm going through please fix the game up a bit 😄",
        "What a nice game coco made, love the pair mode. Amazing ice skating moves too. But what i don't see from the app picture is the holiday (Christmas) items in the game? Other than that, make more gamez of this...😄😉👍👌💙",
        "Ok lmy phone then I fell asleep guess what they did they put the game a start over then what!!! Nope I ilwill not play one of games I will play Roblox and Roblox good fame but I still have cocoa and the point is that I can't delete it bye bye Coco",
        "So It's a good game and all but after I reached 1687 fans my coach keeps saying after each round \"let's make me the best skater ever!\" Shouldn't it be changing up? And also should it be me saying that instead of the coach??",
        "Very dissatisfied... I unlocked almost everything I could through watching videos yesterday, and I open the game today and NOTHING is unlocked! So EVERY time you close the game you have to start over? No thanks! Good bye! YOU SUCK with your ad ridden games! Will not be downloading another of yours!"

        "I love this game, it's simple and sweet. However, there was a middle row in the item-picking menu in which I had invested many coins into to help me level up faster. Today, when I logged in, the row simply disappeared without a trace. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the backgrounding of my app, but nothing seemed to fix it. Now I only have the Training row and the Fun stuff row. It took me quite a while to get those coins and I'd really appreciate it if you brought the row back or gave me a solution to get it back. If it helps, you should also know that the 'I' on every icon which used to let you see how an item was used has also vanished. Please fix this, thank you.",
        "I wish I could give this game 10 stars. It's amazing all around.  It's adorable and fun. The graphics are amazing too without any glitches so far. Haven't noticed any bugs either. The developer's done amazing. It does get repetitive after a while but so far by the time it happens something new unlocks so it's still fun. Can't wait to see what else you guys do to improve the game play since everything else has been flawless so far. Great job, keep up the great work!",
        "This game is super cute! I love my lil ninja friend! Lol. Nice story, and plenty to do to keep you busy. Will def take time to master, but it def has the potential to keep you interested in playing. Even got my wife playing it, and she usually only keeps games for a day or 2, cuz she gets bored with them. I think she'll play this one a little longer than most of the other games she's tried. I'm really happy i found this game!!",
        "This one is probably my favourite, with minecraft and clash of clans. If you don't have this Virtual Friend game, then it is you who is missing out. Install and enjoy. There's nothing bad about this game, and if Naturalmotion do want me to suggest an add-on, then maybe enable me to link the game with a new device. I was LVL 52 once but I lost it. Now I'm level 17. Hope you liked the suggestion. :)",
        "You should add a dog and a cat wearing ninja suit they can be like the chicken and the squirrel the dog can run around you and bark and find bones and sell them for coins and the cat can find fish and sell it for coins. It just sounds like a good idea  the dog should be a husky or a smaller dog like a beagle so it is small like the other animals and it can sleep with the ninja the cat can just be a cat please look into this *^* looking forward to this",
        "This is a great game that I've played off and on over the years. I just redownloaded it, and it'd still fun to play. My only gripe is that there's no place to save your progress. Cloud, Facebook, etc. I hate having to start from level 1 every time I have to wipe/switch phones. Even an account that saves your data would be great. Fix this and it'll be 5 stars all the way for me."

Not sure if it's a bug, an Easter egg feature or what, or if it's because I completed challenges but I don't appreciate the inconsistency especially when playing against friends and I don't feel evenly matched :(",
        "Its a fun game, really, however in my opinion its too easy. I got 150 First try and 346  my second. and maybe consider adding things to unlock like different balls or hoops. other than that its a fun game to kill time",

        "I like the game and the idea of it, but the only problem I have with it, its the ads. Dear God there is a lot of ads, even when I'm in the middle of a game, an ad pops up from the bottom. Just try to lower the amount of ads especially on the challenges, I hate to be asked and forced to watch an ad everytime I fail a challenge or complete it",
        "I absolutely love the game the only.problem I'm having is when I'm playing I keep knocking the ad advert at the bottom where your thumb goes to move the net and keeps ending game and making me.lose cause of that will change rating if gets sorted",

This game is not bad at all.....so far. We'll see! I can't wait too long to decide though! A new series has a time limit, Thanks for that!",
        "why do u keep showing use pictures of cars that have decals and graffiti on them even though we can't put decals or car skins on are car in the mod shop I t even shows on the picture that says tons of customisation with a car with graffiti but no in mod shop there's no decals its just solid colors? :( why? I still like game though I just hope u add that",
        "UNINSTALED   Need alot of gold (money to get it) to finish special even its true...!!! you can't finished that even if don't have it. yes it's a MONEY MAKING GAME..!!! actually, it's pretty good game but you need to improve your server, it's fu**ng so long... need 5 minutes to enter the game. please even if  I got a good internet, still to long long time to enter the game. please\u200b fix it up.",
        "Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won't reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.",
        "The game starts off good in the first couple levels. But once you start getting to the faster cars, it becomes way harder to keep up with the cars PR points, to get to better races. Unless you spend real money to get the parts. One question I do have. Is about the blackridge rivals. Why put some one with a car at a way higher level against a person who's car isn't even close to the car at a high level, and one more thing... make the races longer. 20 seconds a race isn't fun at all. Thinking with the name \"Need For Speed\". You guys would of done a lot better. The only thing that I seem to like are the  graphics... But that's about it...",
        "Goog game, adddictive infact. But I don't understand the concept of PATANJALI adds. Whenever i choose to see adds to reduce the waiting time, you comeup with Patanjali adds of 10 and 20 seconds and the irritating part is the time doesn't gets reduced even after watching the whole add. Please fix this. When you say reduce wait time by watching add, you need to actually reduce the waiting time after the add instead of insisting to watch the add again and again."

        "I think that the game is silly yet good!This game does not have another level of playing. I think that the temple ruins and waterfall and the other levels are the same!e but the description given to it is a little too much. The levels do not have anything more than just the same setting. I think that the creator of his game should've made the game in such a way that it has different levels and it helps us to get more bananas or something like that. But overall, the game is pretty good. Good job on the game.😁😁",
        "My kids enjoy this game however I think there should be an option where you can use your bananas to skip a challenge as some are quite hard to do. This will make the game better as it's pretty pointless without the challenges  Cheers",

But, this game needs a little change like, Now you can skip the adds ,than not get hanged easily or like that And etc.!!! ThaNks I think you can do better !!",

        "So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn't find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren't extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don't know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I'm not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.",
        "Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it's not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I've survived 24 nights but I don't even have the achievements for\"survive 5 nights\". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don't because some of the zombie achievements I'm not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I'm currently at 59. GG!",
        "Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh",
        "I wish there were more commands. Like maybe you could command the miners to garrison while the rest of the troops guard. Also, redesign the swordwrath helmet. It looks like someone spray painted their hair gold and then glued jewels on it. I also wish there could be more types of zombies. The idea of endless is cool but please add the zombies to the campaign.",
        "This is one of the most awesome game of all time and thanks to the creators you can play it on mobile too. But it still lack some awesome components, 1. Add Chaos Empire, 2. Add multiplayer!!! Overall still AWESOME!!!",
        "You know,  its a shame because this is a fantastic game. There is ZERO balancing. The entire game is designed to force you into using gems and micro transactions to get past abnormally difficult gameplay walls."

        "Love the app. Great time killer. Certain times of the day when playing I notice a change of cards I get dealt usually the after noon I start losing every hand forcing me to get off. I have a straight the next person always has a higher hand. Seems suspicious. I know u can't win all the time but still. Also private tables where only friends/poker buddy's can join would be a definite plus to add to the game. As some of the randoms just f around and bet all in from the start.",
        "I recommend not to install. You can get banned anytime even without a warning or any explanation, and when u contact support you will get auto response. Bad customer support. I got banned a second after reporting two cheaters or bots idk and they took my 12 billions.",
        "I've found it very disappointing when  other user's connection is bad and their counter time takes forever while they're not even active. IMO if it happens twice they should be kicked. No one likes slow poker, especially when the player isn't even playing.  Other than that everything else is pretty awesome.",
        "Had trouble restarting sit and go. Returning to lobby and reentering addressed problem. Pretty good app. Challenges are obviously based on bankroll making it more of a player's game instead of a winner's game because poker is not a winner's game. Long play on shootout can be annoying but why you buying in at 2k? You get to play daily if you like to play for free and can even complete challenges when you went bust.",
        "Hands dont seem to be computer greedy to take your chips. Nor give higher level players generated wins with getting obvious flop or river cards giving them a win on a ridiculous hand they go all in on.",
        "Much better than years ago.  So far nice players, no problems with bad play.  Disconnects once in awhile but recovers quickly.  I do not like the betting is done but maybe I have to use a lighter touch so it doesn't expand the window so I can't see the game"

        "Your game is cool and addictive. Just what i was looking for. Nice graphics,decent gameplay,fun racing and awesome rewards. It's my favourite game, i play it everyday. But only one problem, everytime it asks to download additional files. I had already downloaded it but still i recive this pop up message. Is this game online ?? If it is then please make it offline..plzzzzz.",
        "Its an overall addictive game but instructions wise it needs to be more giving. You dont really understand whats our task sometimes. Also i think there is a problem with the sensor or something. I mean i do swipe my finger across the screen but the car doesnt move. I have to literally do that twice or thrice sometimes. This makes me lose out. Its not really my phone as everything else works fine.",
        "It's a nice game to play, i always play with my son.  But do u hv new update on this game? Ive reached lvl100 and my cars were fully upgtaded few months ago.. and it start getting bored already if there're no new lvl",
        "The tracks have unnecessary curves that makes the whole game very disorienting when at high speeds. Also, the app seems to not sensing my finger and never switch tracks at the right time. Hope you can improve.",
        "The update has killed what was a great game. You now can't pass a level unless you get 3 stars. Meeting the objectives for 1 or 2 stars causes a glitch, where it tells you you're out of time, offers you the opportunity to buy more time (fuel?), or recommends you upgrade your car. The daily log-in prizes don't worry either. Please fix it, you broke something that was very enjoyable.",
        "Good for 5 minutes but no more. I was sad enough to get to level 99 but it's impossible to complete this game. The final boss is too fast for me having a fully upgraded lightning McQueen."

        "Several times now I've tried to type in a logo name and the app has told me I got it wrong but I thought it was right and couldn't see why I was being told I was wrong. So I hit \"solve\" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I've recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you've ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?",
        "Love testing my knowledge but I recommend a change. Upon entering the last letter you should have the option to view before the answer is submitted. My big fingers cause me to select the incorrect letter occasionally and then I get the wrong answer and my streak is reset. Please correct this.",
        "Several times I have tried to use a hint and it  wouldn't take it off and it was difficult and easy. When I type in the logo it would tell me I'm wrong then I hit solve and it was the same thing I wrote also and if people don't know some of the logos what is the point of the game.",
        "It's too easy to amass a huge number of hints and use them. I'd like not to be able to complete every level without doing some online searches.",
        "My 6 year old son is really enjoying doing this with me! Just a little frustrating with the American logos that we're not so sure on!",
        "This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further."

        "Amazing game. Me and my friend spend hours on it. I get to shows him my mods. He has none though we both have completed the levels. The game NEVER AND I REPEAT NEVER gets boring. Definitely better than the angry birds series must download. The only problome is the metal flap things don't work correctly. They just float in midair.Apart from that  Please make a new selection of levels. My life depends on it!!!!",
        "The game and level desgins promote and foster a great degree of creastive thinking. With very unique mechanics and obstacles that actually require thought and consideration when building. It has great art, along with many bonus levels and content. Fun game overall but level experiences do wildly vary sometimes. From simple to extremely  difficult, sometimes you win by mer luck and not strategy. Along with all that I don't know if anyone else experienced this but the levers on lvl6 were buggy and never worked. All in all good game to play.",
        "Great game but el porkado is broken I can barley ever get any crates, they are in levels that are literally impossible to complete, fix now also the king pig system is garbage. I accidentally piled up about 100 of each cake and then spent about an hour dragging my finger hundreds of times. Power ups are too rare. There should just be a feed all button or something, can I please improve the king pig system",
        "FIX THE ROAD TO EL PORKADO I swear this is frustrating to the point of unplayable. No, those levels ARE unplayable. They cannot be done with this platform glitch at all. Also, sometimes in sandbox mode when I click the tick it disappears when it hits the ground. Occasional and not as game breaking or frustrating as the moving platforms not working but still",
        "Generally great, but destroyed by graphics/world modeling glitches that render levels impossible to complete! Generally involving trap doors that aren't in the right place. Frustrating. AND the new cake race won't unlock rewards- 24000 hrs to go apparently so I can't play more levels.",
        "I don't  understand why people complain about ads and call Rovio money hungry. If may be a \"free\" game but really nothing is completely free. Developers deserve to get paid. It costs to have a game. Free games have ads just like TV. And you don't have to make the in-app purchase. GO buy a game."

The cloths aren't that bad, but they can be a little more pretty. They should make it for boys and girls, so you can dress up boys, and maybe the boys can take a girl on a date so, they could get married and then they can have children but, it would be a life cycle! They would start out as babies and grow on and get married!!! Hope you like my feedback!! P.S. Plz update the game!!!",

Couple due to pieces not moving or stuck. Very happy to be able to skip levels.  Would have been great to have a certain bank of hints for some of the  difficult ones. I found the later levels easier than the ones around 100. Max levels 120. Great fun!",

Level 89 doesn't work, as well as other levels where touching the same place over and over and over might get something to work.  Most puzzles are extremely easy,  it's just a matter of the game not working.",

The dude takes literally the longest route possible to get to the evac! Nearly finished it just to do so but the amount of ads/repeats you have to go through just gets worse",

It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can't just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...",
        "Yesss. I complete this game in 7 days. I can't understand the ending why that cantenar shake. It's mean the zombie are in the cantenar? It's mean part 3 will exist? Awesome game. I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don't read it before. I can't find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....",
        "Good but buggy Good but buggy, one can earn infinite money in no time then u can upgrade ur vehicle to the max in the very first level. That destroys the fun of the game. Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.",
        "You guys nailed it with this app. ;) It may not work properly for every phone out there but for mine it runs smooth and goreish to the max! Too bad we can't use our previous upgraded rides passed by level but overall.. 5 stars!",
        "Ad heavy. I understand watching ads to get extra money for upgrades, but are ads after every single race really necessary?  The game itself isn't bad. Really good time killer. The ads kind of make me want to stop playing, though."

        "I have only had the game a few hours and I am already falling in love with it. It is great to go on when you have a spare 10-15 minutes. The grid is larger than others so I can read the words fluently and quickly without them being hard to see. You get points after each time you complete the grid so if you are really stuck you can receive a hint for some points. I would highly recommend this excellent game.",
        "Only been playing for a few days now, and so far, I love it! Forgot how fun Word Search puzzles can be, and to have it on my phone is priceless lol.. No complaints with the app so far. I will say though, maybe they should tweak it just a tad, instead of giving a hint only after a short moment, possibly creating 'the option' to have a hint may be a little better. Not a big deal to me. It truly is a great app, love the simplicity of the graphic design too. Glad I came across this game.",
        "I enjoy ALMOST the whole game, being a word find and all, simple, yet deceptively hard at times. Still, I wish there was a way to turn off the 'hints' it gives, as they get annoying... unless there IS a way that I haven't discovered yet...otherwise, I REALLY like the game, and would suggest it to all ages, as it's not too tough for the young ones, but still challenging enough for experienced players.",
        "It's a good game but there needs to be a way to turn off hints. If you don't find a word in the time it thinks you should, it keeps giving hints which ruins the gameplay. I pause for various reasons like talking to someone, cat catching a mouse, watching tv at the time, etc.. Or sometimes it might take longer to fins a word than seconds allowed before the hint.",
        "I love this game. Really nice and well thought out game. It's educative too. But I have just one issue with it though: The flashing hint. This gets me distracted each time it flashes. Maybe there could be a hint button at the bottom of the puzzle. That way instead of it flashing and getting us distracted, we could just click on it whenever we need help. Apart from that, it's just perfect. Will give it a 5 when the flashing hint is worked on😁",
        "Other reviews are accurate  for me.. hints become irritating in that they only flash on for a second and you miss them rather than find them useful.  They also appear too soon so you have little time to search.  I also found the occasional issue registering a word and having to go over it several times. But it's a free game, it's fun, it's addictive what else is there to say ? It's good."

        "I really love this game. Of course it WANTS you to spend real money on it, but you don't really have to to make progress. Just set stuff up then go back to it later. As per other reviews it does take a while to load, but due to the excellent graphics, music and overall feeling of happiness I get playing this - they are forgiven.",
        "SO HAPPY!😀😀😀😀😀😀 This is really fun! It is really magical. I love disney ever since I saw this game. Just it lags when we collect rewards and it kicks me off. Rather than that it is perfect! Great game, I need more games like this! Why do companies  do not make more games like this ?! I had been playing since the second month it came out! So 2 years. Who cares about money I do not use my real money and I am progressing a lot! Maybe it is some phones and tablets. When I do not need the characters I put them in long missions and get a bunch of magic. SO HAPPY!",
        "Okay, this is probably the most honest review I will ever take the time to write. The game is beautiful and entertaining...just like everything Disney does. The other thing Disney does EXTREMELY well is suck money from you (I live in Orlando - I KNOW this, Man). I'm not proud of what I'm about to say but I just spent $30 on essentially a \"Russian Roulette\" for Alice in Wonderland characters. It's like this...the game is entertaining and enjoyable to an extent...but if you're money concisious don't download this game. I've played a lot of app games and this one FAR surpasses the need for real money. The game is entertaining and fun if you semi/kinda love Disney stuff because of nostalgia or whatever...but if you're a die-hard Disney fanatic...this game will bankrupt you. So, fear it.",
        "I used to love this game, but, I don't anymore. It can get kind of lengthy and sometimes tiresome. They make it near impossible to get some characters and attractions without spending real money for them. And if you don't, you will take a very..very long time to progress through the game.You may not ever get through it all. After almost 2 years, I'm tired of it.",
        "I did love this game. However since the jungle book update, it takes forever to load, which is very frustrating especially when there's an event. The events just keep coming so never get a chance to catch up with main storyline. Some special characters are unobtainable without spending huge amounts of real money. Gameloft are just too money grabbing and don't seem to care about gameplay.",
        "I really love this game. My only complaint is when they have special release items every 2 hours or every 4 hours. They release 24 hours a day, so if you want to rank high on the leaderboard you have to wake up multiple times a night to play! I'm sleep deprived!"

        "Cutest virtual pet game around! I've never had an app so simple, yet it never gets boring. The controls are simple and user-friendly. It's easy to earn money, food and useful items just by shaking trees in the community or watching ads. I've gotten many things from letting my Boo sleep and watching ads, then getting to pick a gift. The customization of your personal boo is also fantastic. Great way to entertain children or unwind at the end of the long day.",
        "Do you have a pet? If not, My Boo is a great way to know how it feels to have something to look after. With loads of awesome mini games, it's so fun to dress your Boo up in cute outfits and hairstyles! Feed it and play with it and it will love you! Honestly, I don't know how else to put this: My Boo is the best (and cutest) game ever!",
        "This game is really fun and cute!! I love it, its great when you're super bored, or something. The only problem I'm having, is the when I go to change my boo's name, it won't let me delete any of the letters. Sooo... Yeah, um, other than that, its a great game. Also... WHY NO DELETE!?!? 😲 plz fix.",
        "I love this app. I have searched long and hard for a perfect virtual pet, and I found it in this cute little game. I LOVE the minigames, and the cute little sounds and faces the boo makes add to the charm of this game. Also, I love how there are a TON of options for customization, and even different kinds of food. I only wish there weren't so many ads and in app purchases... Oh well, a little thing like that won't stop me from loving this app.  My little Boo is named Marcellus, and I care for him as though he were a real animal. Lol",
        "Me and my daughter have both loved this game for years! Entertaining with so many games and ways to decorate boos...although we wish coins were a bit more for gameplay. Some if the outfits we've never been able to afford!",
        "I love this game. It is like taking care of a real child. I'm glad this is a free game bc now that ik how this app works I don't think i would be able to live without. The only thing I don't like is how it takes so much time to move to the next level. 💖💟🖤💜💛💚💙💞🐞😻"

        "Boring and repetitive and poorly designed. The obstacles are hard to see. After starting a (new) stage, you don't have enough time to avoid the very first obstacle. The rooftop stage is unfair, you cannot avoid obstacles because either the controls don't work or because you don't have enough reaction time. And restarting from the beginning gets very boring very quickly.",
        "Love batman, I live for anything lego... this is an utter failure. The first level is beyond difficult for a seasoned veteran. Game to difficult, plot line staging is beyond negligent and shame on the creators for designing such an impossible game to progress through.",
        "we love the game but it stop working time to time it starts over and closes by it self. doesnt let us report it. would love for you guys to fixes it. our five year old loves batman games. and this one makes his day.",
        "It wouldn't even load past putting in my son's age. He is very disappointed. He earned the game and I uninstalled a bunch of my own apps to make room for the app.",
        "This is a good game and would be great if the controls would respond every time.  When you are playing a game where responsive controls matter, having them fail about every 20th swipe is unacceptable.  The other disappointing thing is that Batman is the only one that says anything.  I worked my way to get Robin and when he didn't say anything, I was completely turned off from the game."

        "This is the most addictive flight simulator I have ever played. The game is fairly easy to progress through without having to spend any money. If I had to find one fault it would be that you can't reverse when on a runway which means some times you have no option but to crash your plane as there is very little room to turn around.",
        "So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game",
        "Pretty cool app. I'd like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it's pretty cool so far.",
        "A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job 'fun games for free' 👏👌🖒☺",
        "Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you're having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.",
        "I've been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn't force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game's development! :)"

        "This is all I needed: another Criminal Case game to take up my free time! I love the whole four of them. The the hidden objects tease my brain to no end. Each game  is intriguing with an original story line. I do have my favorite crime scenes,  and plenty of friends(all over the world) whom play as often as they can too!",
        "It would be nice if you level up and get full energy but your energy had some if not all left before you got it restored that you just increased by the full amount, the way it is now I lose energy when levelling up because it doesnt add any more to the 110 that is standard. I dont think it is fair to those of us who play daily. I never know when my pet will find that last batch of XP and cause the level up to happen. If I am over the 110 already, I don't even see the new energy. Some concessions need to be made for this. I love the game though, it is fun and challenging.",
        "I love this game. I have all of the criminal case games & love them all. The only things that I don't like is that when when ur energy gets refilled, it only adds to what u have, instead of adding an extra 110 to what u have. The other thing is that u can't buy none of the hamburgers, orange juice, chips or anything with ur tokens",
        "Love Criminal Case and a True Fan!! One thing I think should change is that whatever score you have when you level up, the 110 should be added to it. We deserve it  because we Earned it and the only reward we get is to share juice with other players. Give us a Happy Meal and 110 pts.!!",
        "4th instalment of the Criminal Case games. I love playing them all excellent time wasters intriguing story lines. I'm well & truly hooked on the whole series. Gainsborough, Pacific Bay, Save The World & now this Mysteries Of The Past........ all brilliant",
        "So I completed Grimsborough, Pacific Bay, and World Edition. I was Commissioner with a 3/4 full sticker album, well over 5 million coins, 52 hamburgers, 43 bags of chips, and 7 bottles of o.j.  I followed the prompts and clicked to go to this version. Every time I've transitioned to a new game so far, my progress was maintained. But not now. I'm an officer again with no coins, no history, no stuff, and I can't even watch a few ads to earn energy! I synced with my fb account, and yet it's like I'm starting from scratch! What's the problem here? Or, do you just give up all you earned to start over? Someone please tell me!!!!"

If I can determine that I wanna pass my high score who says I can't get better grades....... I love the game keep doing  what your doing and make more games..... To everyone  I advise you to play this game 💖💞",
        "Very fun, I love it In this game you can choose your players, Tom or Angela. Then you can ride and you try to get as far as you can throughout the obstacles and challenges. You also try to collect stars along the way. However many stars you collect determines your score. This app will keep your scores and will let you know if you get a high score. When you run into something you have the option to keep going if you watch an advertisement. This app is not boring at all. It works great and doesn't take up much space.",

        "The thing that makes this game great is the visuals and the audio. It is absulutley beautiful and the art style works so well with the type of game. Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I'd very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there's a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style",
        "Alright, so the game is pretty good. All I ask for is more tricks, and the ability to upgrade some bonuses (coin magnet, feather hover thing, and the third one that I haven't grabbed yet.) All in all, if you could do that, it'd make the game so much greater. Apart from skipping missions and revives there's no use for coins.",
        "First off, I'd like to give a big thank you to the developers for this game. It's amazing.  However, I've been encountering quite a few bugs lately. One day, picking up a hover feather crashed the game. Today, I can't pick up llama horns, and the background blur that happens when you go into the workshop stayed into an actual run. I took this as a challenge and continued playing. I'm on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 9.7 running Android Marshmallow.  This is just to tip you guys off on some bugs.",
        "Good graphics, but can get boring after only like 3 minutes. Also the makers of the game should add a another different mode where your running away from a villager/camper and see how far you can get. You could improve or modify this mode that i have made if you want",
        "This was the must have game- I think, for a while. Then the newest update came out. Now it has ads you must veiw (before totally optional for more coins or an extra run) and added FTP elements. Took from a 5 star classic, to barely 2 stars. Thankfully, the base game play was untouched, and still well worth the advertisements, but I'm very sad for this move on the part of the dev team.",
        "I have 'noisy' brain and anxiety and sometimes the world is too much to bear. This game keeps me calm and collected all the time. The music and gameplay soothe me up. I do get frustrated over the goals but I have nothing but praise and love for this game. Thank you to everyone involved. You all helped a lot. Cannot wait for Alto's Odyssey for Android!"

        "The game is enjoyable but I don't care for the new animated Charlotte. Instead of adding \"realism\", she is simply annoying. Other than that, it's fairly good. The number of coins needed to continue a level with 5 extra moves is a bit much compared to the number received when you complete the level (300 vs 25-30 or so). I understand, though. It can't be too easy or else it would be boring & nobody would ever spend any $ to advance!😁",

        "This game is very nice! But I would suggest adding a single player, so that you can find your mate, make pups and bring them with you on multi player! Also add more wolf colors and designs! You could also make different landscapes if you want and if you can, you shouls also add bosses and dens for us to live at, this game is very nice and addictive, but I think that if you add all that I mentioned it would become even more popular and addictive! Please hear my plea!",
        "I think SA should do a better job than what they are doing. Including me we all be screwed not once not twice but at least five times each player that did not mod and/or hack. You change the damages on skills that should be left alone and over half my friends is in Hacker Hell so my question to u guys fix this and give us some gifts cuz we've been faithful for giving you guys money and it be nice to receive some compensation.",
        "If you're looking for a great game, this is not it!!! It's a pay to win, with NOTHING to win. Unless you're into running in circles chasing woodland animals for months, having your money stolen, or having your stats lowered by the devs after you've worked on it... I suggest finding a different game. Really look at all these reviews if you don't believe me.",
        "Well, the graphics are amazing! There are nice views in the game and the animals look cool aswell. There are a few things I would like SA to add and the first one is: mates and cubs. Second is: add friends. Third is: you can eat your own prey and drink water. The Last one is: to make your own separate packs (atleast 5 wolves in each.) That's all! If you do any of these I will rate 5 stars! Other than that this is an amazing game. I like the way you can choose your wolf. Recommended for sure!!!!",
        "ok the game is great and I love it but why can't you play with lower levels and higher levels? It's not fair when you have a friend you want to play with and help them with their levels but you can't if you are to high of a level it's really not fair and I think you should remove this part of the game everything else is amazing though! I really love this game but I also don't want to have to level up or wait for someone to level to play with my friends so please fix this!!",
        "This game is amazing the best game I love it so much. But I wish the game look like loading screen and plz plz plz make them the wolf better like the white wolf should be fast and stronger where as the the grey wolf should be strong and have more health and the Mexican wolf should be good in defences and health and black wolf should be good in strength and health and speed and there should be multiple maps and are there holiday skins. And it will be nice If you can add friend plz add some different skin for the white wolf. Like the mighty wolf should be in the white wolf category. Edit- I would love it if you .ca  make it night with different animals. And one more thing the creates of this game can you plz plz plz plz make a Dragon game like this cause there are not a lot of nice dragon game out there. Like the white wolf have an ice dragon and plz make a lightning Dragon it is my favourite element.  If you can do all of this I would be so happy ."

        "This is a very entertaining game that is simple to play. It has provided me with hours of fun! The only thing is that I wish there were more combinations, there are things I've tried that you'd think would make something but don't. For example, Crayon (or Pencil, or Charcoal, or Paint) + Paper does not make Art.",
        "This game is pretty addicting. I get stuck sometimes but I always find something new.  Small issue though, I it won't let me pull rust out onto the screen for some reason. I've used it before, but now it won't let me use it anymore. Perhaps it is an issue with my phone rather than a glitch in the app.",
        "This is leagues better than the original alchemy game. There were a lot of bugs but they've all more or less been patched out. It took me 2 months of playing everyday to get all of the items and combinations cleared.",
        "The interface is not so good. Big icons are not convenient, we have to scroll down long everytime, I could only imagine how much effort would it take if I had 500 items discovered. Please make icons small or a different tab just for icons or just make it like little alchemy one.",
        "I love this game so much. I'm stuck on trying to make life but it's not frustrating it's challenging and I like it. Also, for all the people getting pissed off because the items disappear and you cant 'use' them anymore it's because you can't combine them with anything anymore so it is put in your encyclopedia so that doesn't waste space for the things you can use, it's actually a very smart game mechanic. I'm pretty sure it even says that in the tutorial. I also like how they didn't take the same combination formulas from the first game and instead added new ways to achieve the same product in a more realistic way, also there is so many items to create! So I think that this is an all around great game. Good job developers. Good job indeed.",
        "I love this game. At first time I open it after download, it still okay. But after that, at second day I open the app, my phone will be turned off immediately. I try to uninstall it and just redownload today, but still same. My phone keep turned off if I open the app. Please fix this, I really really want to play :("

        "Great game but more like a sandbox game. The way you are looking will go off in random directions. Few glitches. Wish the sniper rifle had a scope. Wish there was different shooting mechanics. A little lag and too many damn ads there is even an ad for no ads.",
        "Great game, but it's annoying how you have limited ammo, I mean yeah! It's realistic, but Ammo is also expensive, and I hate how You can't jack a car because if they're at a red light, and you're trying to jack their car, they may start going, or when you toss them out of the car, they annoy you and sometimes KILL you. So even if you do kill them when they're inside of it, you're doing damage to the car, not to mention you can't even Rob stores like I thought you could. But still. Awesome game!",
        "I love it! Except, when I blow up a police car while it's parked, it respawns and about 18 police cars are after me! Although, when that happens, I get killed and spawn on top of the tower with the helicopter and when I do, the police car that I blew up is driving around, crashing into walls, blowing up and then going back! I couldn't stop laughing. So... Nothing wrong (except for the load of police after me when I blow up that car), I love it, C ya!",
        "I hate this stupid game I have just played this game and you know what happend it crashed everybody do not play this one game and the second one of this it is a stupid game i never even got to play it and i still think it is stupid sorry for the words just fix it plz JJJJJUUUUUSSSSSSTTTTTT fiiiiixxxxxx ittttttt if i could put no stars i willllll",
        "I loved it because you can get into people's car and then get out again then kill them because they are trying to kill you so kill them. and there is a tank and a helicopter in this game and I like it so you could kill people walking and get money or there bullets and wepends. that is why I love this game."

The only problem that stops us from giving this game a 5 star rating is a small bug, on the fact that he can't get through to arronville which upsets and annoys him when the game crashes, please fix this problem as it would be a brilliant help to us. Thanks. Btw I would recommend this game , just beware of some small problmes but dont worry as they always update this app to sort these problems out.",

        "Cute game, but not without it's flaws. I forgot the reasons I deleted the game in the past, but remember them now. It drains your battery, the life refresh time is high (20 minutes) and starting at a certain level (30) you really can't progress WITHOUT friends (this is not a positive for everyone. I personally don't like it), or money, or a ton of patience. You need keys to progress. You can either buy, ask friends, or play for one every FOUR HOURS. This is the exact point where I uninstalled the game last time.",
        "I would taste this game higher if the only way you could progress wasn't by having to purchase extras. Having to waste all my extras to get through a gate with 3 keys sucks and so does knowing that really the only way through is to buy your way through.",
        "I'm uninstalling game! I was really happy with game when I started,  now there is an ad every next life and sometimes more! Same ad over and over, enough to drive you CRAZY! Also you can't answer quick text or do anything off screen without the game totally rebooting,  it's supposed to be relaxing to play on phone,  NOT IRRITATING!",
        "I would give this 5 stars, if you could select a level of difficulty, like easy, medium and hard.  It is not relaxing at all, once you pass the early levels. I hate the levels with bullies, you should be able to skip them.",
        "Was great at first, but is now so slow that it takes around five minutes to load the next level - or just to return to replay a failed level. Shame, as I've stopped playing it because of this fault.",
        "Why bother having an X on the Level Rush notification if it doesn't work so you have to press Begin and wait for the animation to finish before you can carry on with claiming the Daily Challenge. Also 'play with friends' on the tournament never does anything. Otherwise fun."

First you are going to wash her hair to make it clean and nice, then you'll brush her to get rid of the extra hair, then you will make a nice braided hairstyle to make her happy. But the caring process is more than a simple washing, first you will cut off the damaged hair which has no chance of recovery. Brush the hair as long as the instructions will indicate and just apply the shampoo to offer that extra volume and shine. To prevent the dehydration and the split ends you must put on a special mask for the hair that you will do it yourself. Add the given ingredients, mix them and apply the final composition on the head. Wash the hair again, dry it and arrange the rebel hair yarns. Now all that is left is the braiding part where you will literally gather the hair and place it in the shown spot to get a nice and well arranged headdress. When you are done you can even add a nice head band with beautiful colors and details on it. Have fun and remember to play not only to get better, but to fulfill your inner passion.  You really don't want to miss these cool features presented by this hair styling game:- Free to play- Pretty easy to handle the control- Entertain yourself with quality music and nice graphics- Be a hairstylist as good as you can be in the braided area- Multitude of processes to accomplish- Take care of a dehydrated hair and cut the damaged hair yarns- Put together the strands that needs to be taken for a well executed braid- Moisturize the hair with a home made mask that you are making",

It is  also the most generous option to gain coins. I think the adds blocking colors some reviews mention must depend on your device. I play on 8 in samsung tablet and have no problems. I  have two requests. Would like to play in landscape mode and would like the  ability to turn off the highlighting of the selected color like Cross Stitch world for a little extra challange.",

I love the spin the wheel feature where you can earn bonuses such as gold, protect, etc. I actually don't mind the ads as they offset paying actual money for the patterns if you are a bit \"broke\" at the time and the import feature is great! Totally addicted.",
        "I love this app. It is very calming and fun BUT there are soooooo many ads. I will raise the rating when you stop having me click/watch so many ads.  Update: there seems to be MORE \"+80 coins\" ads that block out areas to work in so I eventually HAVE to watch them to get them to go away.",
        "I'm using my Samsung galaxy s7 and I LOVE this app! Such a great time killer, anxiety reducer, stress reducer. You can even upload your own pics! I just wish the spin would land on things other than 60 coins, unpick and shield. There was a day where I got 5 prizes every spin! That was AWESOME!!!",

I'm sorry but I use recolor and I can change the color anytime!! I wouldn't down load this unless you are a really perfectionist and close to a perfect I'm not sure typer I'm not sure case like it was a mistake!  As I Chuckle! I'm sorry cross sticherz,"

        "Its a really good game. The only thing is, that I wish there was maybe some instructions that appear at the beginning, because I didnt know that you couldnt hit the black lumps etc. Maybe if you add little phrases that say what to do and not to do, then it would be almost perfect.",
        "Great time killer I love everything about it and it is a great game to wake up to. The only down side is that you fall off the ledge and that makes it harder to dodge the black. Everything else is 5 stars so that is what I think about roller coaster.",
        "Its really fun and addictive. Awesome game play and good for passing time. Not always so friendly to my battery and too many adds. Other than those little hick ups I absolutely love it.",
        "I think that it is ok. I don't play it a lot because its not really fun to me I think that I am going to cleat it because I don't like it that much. I don't like it there are to many adds. They always happened at the beginning and I hate it. I don't think you should not install it its not fun.",
        "This game is amazing! It is addicting and fun to play!! The only thing is that I was hoping for some sort of introduction to the game, to tell me how to play etc. Also, I was hoping to be able to choose what kind of ball i use, the black one is plain and kind of boring. But overall its an amazing game!!"

        "Well, I loved the looks of it. Seemed really fun so I downloaded it. Then I spent 30 min downloading the patches, to find out at the very end I didnt have enough space on my phone. Uninstalled as much as I could, and still didn't have enough space... Could have said in details of the game how much space it REALLY takes up... Would have been really nice to know.  -a not so happy consumer",
        "An amazing mmo that really does a great job of handling farming, the game play although has an auto feature still utilizes the controls. The depth of all the items and armor and weapons is awesome. I've been really happy playing this game. The clans are great. The 30 vs 30 opensiege is a nice feature. This game is super fun even for the people that want to play for free. Netmarble does a great job with daily rewards, login bonuses, and events that all allow for players to get great items for free!! Best game I've played in a long while. Only thing is constant crashes and bad story line. The game keeps me turning it back on and I haven't went one day without logging in.",
        "Addicting game with auto-questing and battling. You can choose to do it manually, which I do for boss fights. I don't have to buy anything from the shop, in fact, you get free gear every day! The graphics are amazing for a mobile game with it being an MMO. I have a Note 8, so it does run really well. I play with my monitor using SideSync for full screen awesomeness. There is a lot to do for all types of players, being in a guild doing dungeons reminds me of the old-school MMORPGs of sieging and doing weekly raids.",
        "The game had me hooked as I spent a week trying to find a character and job class I liked. Keep in mind that you will be doing a lot of grinding, but leveling is not surprisingly unreasonable.  There are some aspects that will make you believe you have to pay to win, but it is not necessary. Although it would be cool to help the devs or too. All in all love the game and can't seem to put it down ( I let it auto-grind while I live my life. Haha).",
        "Everything about this game is really good, but since this update today I can't even open the game it keeps closes and sending me to my home screen on my phone... Doesn't give me a error report or any messages just closes the app. Id really like to continue playing please fix . Galaxy S8+",
        "I saw this game and was a little skeptical. Felt like my phone would never handle such a thing if it was as good as it looks, well I'm honestly surprised. Between the nice controls and not having to worry about grinding. To the somewhat intriguing story and overall playability of this game. I'm very impressed. 5/5"

I've played this, and you could only go inside several buildings/houses. Also, can you please make more missions or quests to go on because they keep on repeating the quests you've done a million times before. I hope you read this and fix and update the game. Thanks! 😘",
        "Hmm Ok the game is good everything is good but could you please add breaking windows to the game and make all buildings be able to go in. Next make more missions cause I'm so close to finishing all the missions. That's my opinion for my next update,  it will make me enjoy the game more. Almost forgot some things in the game  look fake like the fences make them look realistic.  Thanks!!!",

Kid's can play it because there are no killing in it, well other than if anything hit' s the guy's hed he/she (I really dont know) it will blow up and you will have to start the level all over again. If you want to go faster on the moter cycle just hold down on the aro key that has an aro pointing down and push down on the aro pointing up at the same time then go.",
