      'I hope you take the time to read.   This game is amazing, and it just keeps getting better. I do wish you would change the video knives to apples or video. Now I have nothing to spend apples on.  But here is what i really wanted to say i really like this company and the games you put out to your users. I\'m newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me. I own alot of your games and have spent alot trying to help. I wish I had more to unlock things in time. But Thank you very much.',
       'The game sucks it\'s alwful. It\'s gliching non stop for your bad. There are ADS everywhere! Ketchapp you getting worse and worse. There are ads of stupid games everywhere. What a game maker will pay to another game to show them in ADS! That makes the game in the ad even worse. Please ketchapp I was a big fan of you but you made your games so STUPIT. PLEASE FIX YOUR GAMES!',
       'Ads interrupt gameplay and are extremely aggravating. The video that you have to watch to continue your gameplay never works. The game crashes when xp increases. I personally dislike this game, and it would be better if these issues were resolved. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this review.',
       'Deleted all my data with no reason. Had a bunch of Legendaries and Rares that have now been deleted. I put a lot of time into this game, and even bought the ad-free package. If you don\'t want a load of wasted time, don\'t download this app.  Edit- Updated the app and levelled up a bit. The game crashes every time I get a free revive. Still a massive waste of time.',
       'I really do like the game. There are two things that get to me however. Knives should all have individual names other than the boss ones. There are also alot of ads, I do understand they need to make üí∞. Otherwise the game is great.',
       'I bought the remove ads purchase and it screwed me. I still get adds and i still have to watch videos to remain in the same level. I want my money back since the game is the same. DONT BUY THE REMOVE ADS PURCHASE.' ,

      'This  was really  fun! Starts off easy but gets harder, not near the ads of the  other games I have played. Takes extra words, hints are reasonable,  earning money is reasonable.  So far the best of the word connects !! Really happy with this game, will add to my phone  and get rid of the other word connect games that seem to have ad, after ad not to mention the high amount for hints! There is one reason I didn\'t  give it a 5, because some of the ads get stuck and you can\'t  exit,  overall  4.8!',
       'Child-friendly! And, as an adult? I love how am yet to see an advertisement. üòä  Unlike other word games like Word Connect, it also lets you find and play words that are not necessarily those found on the board, storing it in an "Extra" slot, which generates added points to your score, rather than telling you to choose the word that\'s only on the board.  ADDENDUM: After reading the comments, it appears there may be ads after all. Am yet to see any though. Perhaps because am still in a lower level.',
       'Not a bad time killer - quick paced and not too taxing on the brain. I wish it had a more comprehensive dictionary so you would still get bonus points for valid words like \'cad.\' No matter - still basically a four star, though almost three for the number of ads.',
       'Game is fun. But giving me pop ups to bring me back to the game while it\'s not open is a nono. Especially when it takes up half the screen. I\'d give 5 stars cause i had fun playong this, but this one thing is annoying. Especially with the amount of ads, it shows you just wanna push people to keep playing for that ad revenue. Won\'t be downloading any of your games after i delete this now.',
       'OK, this word game is the bomb! It actually uses words that I know! I have played so many word games that use strange words and won\'t take common words! Thank you, WePlay! I will be trying your other games and telling my friends about them!',
       'I turned off the notifications on this game and it still gives me pop ups that cover up anything else I\'m doing including navigation instructions while I\'m driving.  This is dangerous and unacceptable.  I can\'t be fiddling with a game while I\'m driving in a whiteout blizzard in the middle of the night.  Uninstall.' ,

      'I love this game!  It\'s challenging yet not too complicated.  With some games it gets so difficult to play the higher you go and very dew helps are offered for free. This game is still fun and challenging but the levels are not impossible to beat. They also offer ways to earn helpful tools to assist in beating the levels.  The community is great also. You are able to request and give extra lives to one another very simply with minimal interaction Try it and see for yourself!',
       'At first, this is a fun little puzzle game. The levels are entertaining and simply addicting. But... This game takes quite a turn. I can\'t say for sure when it began, but I\'m on level 85 and it has become hilariously impossible to proceed. The levels become so ridiculously difficult that you need to spend real money to move forward. In other words, simple fun levels to get you hooked, followed by insanely difficult level to get you to pay. Over all, fun for the first 20 - 40 levels. Enjoy it while it lasts.',
       'Very fun and entertaining. I really like slow paced relaxing games and this is just that. There is no time limit so you can play at your own pace. Also there is minimal ads for a free game which is part of what makes this game so great. Such a great game for killing some time in a waiting room or just sitting at home trying to pass the time. This game truly deserves 5 stars. I love it!',
       'This game is great until you reach the upper levels. At that point, like most games, it requires purchases of boosters in order to progress. It\'s addicting, but I refuse to spend a fortune on games. I guess I\'m old-fashioned that way. ;) I suppose I\'ll take my bag of quarters and go elsewhere.',
       'I do enjoy this game but certain levels don\'t give you enough moves to complete the level. The ones you have to match the cubes with the colors makes it impossible to pass when the game doesn\'t give you moves to do so. You waste your moves on areas that doesn\'t give you the opportunity to pass the level and then you don\'t have any moves left before it does give you the moves you need it does get frustrating you get stuck on that level and can\'t pass it. Which will just make you want to unistall the game cause you will never leave that level.',
       'This game is great. I like blasting all the cubes. It reminds me of Super Collapse From back in the day. It is a cute game, with cute graphics and characters. Although I might not play it too much because it doesn\'t require enough thought, it\'s definitely something to play when I feel like relaxing.' ,

      'Love it! It just needs some adjustments. Too many levels that are way too hard, that takes you 50 tries to beat when you only have 5 lives in the first place. And it should only be beat one level to unlock one task instead of needed to beat two levels to unlock one task. If it\'s going to take 2 stars to unlock a task it should be something big not 2 stars for unlocking a task for cleaning up a little mess!',
       'The concept of this game is pretty cool and it is addicting Until you realize that the Candy Crush part of it is way too hard way too early. It basically forces you to make you want to pay for it. I would never pay money for Candy Crush or this game. But if I\'m still in the first room of that huge ass mansion and I can\'t even pass one of the levels, that\'s ridiculous. I am glad that there is an idea out there other than the Candy Crush concept, but this is way too hard. And I am in the 400 Something level of Candy Crush. Good luck, I\'m deleting this app',
       'Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it\'s advertised too much, but it\'s definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That\'s slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.',
       'Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I\'ll be playing this for a long time! I\'m working on the living room right now, getting close to level 600. Can\'t wait to see what the new character, Jerry, has in store for us! Thank you Playrix!',
       'I really like this Game so Far. I will play for awhile to See how it Works & If I like it. Absolutely Love Your Game. Play it ALL THE TIME!!! I Must Admit that I Really Do enjoy this Game! Sometimes I find myself Having a Hard Time With Certain Levels. I Could be On that Level for Days or a Few Weeks. I think with Some Improvement that Would make People Play. This Game More. But I Must Say Hat\'s Off to The Developers',
       'I loved the game until the last update. Until then, I found it relaxing and challenging. Since the recent update it\'s just aggravating.  The boosters don\'t act upon the same set of rules since the update. I\'ve been on the same level for nearly a week. I\'m on 280, and looking at the number of tasks coming up makes me feel that I will likely uninstall rather than spend my entire life playing. I wish Playtrix would go back to the older version.' ,

       'Its great and all,  but it still have a thing I hate most---the way to get robux. Not every people can buy those robux, so why don\'t just complete quests to get robux instead,wouldn\'t it be better. It might not only attract person to play this game often but also get robux more easily...',
       'It\'s a awsome game I like it.but I am a chrome book user u have knocked people with chrome books out. 1.st the controls. apparently, on Chromebook to roblox you go backwards instead of forward and forward instead of backwards. and the rotate you camra it walks that way. 2.nd aswell, you can not see your mouse when your moving it. and if you hold your moving keys then let go apparently, it moves on it\'s own? I haven\'t play roblox since 2 months and 1 week . please fix this I love roblox and if you fix this it will be full rating from me',
       'I Feel Like its so unfair that we need to pay for robux at least make robux free so children like me can play  heres an idea: when you play a game you will get 10 robux. Please accept my suggestion because everybody in Roblox have been calling me a noob and being mean to me thanks.',

      'I spent 3 consecutive days grinding to get most of the skins. I start liking the game, so I decide to pay for the premium version to support the devs. But ads are still showing so I decide to reinstall the app to see if that fixes the issue. After reinstalling, I have lost all my progress (skins) and 3‚Ç¨ because ads are still showing. Hehe xd  Edit: I had to ask Google for a refund and I got it immediately. If you want to know how I did it, just search for "Google Play Refund" in your browser.',
       'Love it! I play it all the time! You can play online or offline - online gives you a chance to revive. Has course like game play or continuous. No pause which is understandable but kinda sucks. Once you get the hang of the controls it becomes  addicting. Would like to see more land and background options... maybe on the next update??',
       'Entirely too many ads.  Look I understand as a free app you have put time into this and some money back is nice.  But this is way over board with the ads. The game is fun, easy, and plays well. However it\'s not worth paying to remove ads. Ads are a necessary thing if you are looking looking to make money from your creation, however this mean is just ignorance and the main reason I uninstalled.',
       'Holy Ads Batman!  This is ridiculously too much.  It\'s a fun game but it heats up my Google Pixel XL insanely hot too.  Can\'t play for long.  And you pay for no Ads and you still get the ads between games??  I PAID FOR NO ADS.  NO ADS doesn\'t equal SOME ADS',
       'A good concept, I love the gameplay and have a highscore of 589. But the ads are way too common, it\'s always a 30 second or 15 second ad after every death; It\'s like our motivation to keep the ball going is just so we don\'t have to watch an ad. Plus, sound would be good to add for Dune.',
       'It\'s a really fun and Addicting game for when your bored, and best part is... IT DON\'T NEED WIFI AND IT\'S FREE WOOO and there\'s not many ads, witch I think we can all be happy about. Sure there is a few ads here and there but nothing none of us can\'t handle, üòáüòáüòá' ,

      'To everyone complaining about the ads, quit being so cheap and give the $2.49 to buy the game and remove them. Once the ads are removed, it\'s addictive and fun to keep getting the ball further. Fun concept and well executed. I\'ve already gotten more than my $2.49 worth of fun out of this game, and continue to play it.',
       'This game seems like it could be a great time waster... If it weren\'t for the whole crashing after every round when it tries to load an ad or when you try to watch an ad to upgrade something for free. I see nothing wrong with having these ads here.... As long as they don\'t affect app stability',
       'It\'s ok...not something I am going to keep. Good for like 5 min then the adds getting a bit much after every other at bat. I understand making revenue but a bit much after 1 or 2 hits. Plus I don\'t know if it was my device but the only sound I got from this game was the adds. No hit sounds or music or even hearing the sound of the ball hitting anything. Good concept, could have been designed and presented better.',
       'Way too many adds. The game its self looks rather fun. But after 5 minutes in the game, and spending 3  minutes of them watching ads it was time to delete. I have no issues in watching a couple of ads to help the developers, but this was way over the top. Other than the ad frequency though, looks like it could be fun.',
       'It\'s ok. The game is fun, but they didn\'t give it any substance. I\'m not a developer yet I see so many missed opportunities. Would be better if you could get powerups, say to make the ball really bouncy. Another thing is houses. I don\'t think you can break windows with the ball. That\'s disappointing. You should be able to and get some sort of bonus. Fun little idea, but lacks real substance. Also way too many ads christ',
       'I really love the game but the game needs some more optimisation because it eats a lot of battery. Also the game needs some sound effects and more options challenges so players don\'t get bored of it. When everyone reaches the last bat they might delete the game because is nothing else to do. So more updates and more stuff added to the game. Great work until now. Keep it up VOODOO!!!!' ,

      'Let\'s be honest. This game is very similar to every other choice game. You have to wait 3 hrs for another ticket and I don\'t mind that BUT the storylines are CHEESY! Like damn, I don\'t even feel  the chemistry between the characters, you all should work on that. Also, the why you all draw the Black characters is simply awful. Work on the way you color the lips and draw the face. I hate to say it, but overall, this game is basic. It\'s a work in progress, READ your reviews and actually listen to what they are saying.',
       'It\'s pretty good. I am going to save this application for now. Right now I am reading the Campus hacker story. I really do like the humor in it but I kind of find the characters rude LOL. I\'m only on the first book so I don\'t want to give up yet. I have four other reading applications and this one honestly is my least favorite as of right now but I would definitely recommend it and give it a shot.',
       'So far it has been interesting. As far as these games go, at least they have missions that allow you to win some diamonds unlike choices, what\'s your story and episodes. With chapters you can watch videos, but that only gives you one diamond, so this is still better . I also love the memory quizzes and living out my Nancy drew fantasy. The characters faces are a bit odd though ( especially their teeth ) but there is a similar problem with all these games. I am so drawn in by the mystery and fantasy stories that I hardly even notice the faces now. Also I love the aggressive lover options. For me fantasy means getting to do stuff I can\'t do in real life, like solving mysteries and aggressively pursuing my supernatural love interests. What\'s up with untold darkness 2 though, I wanted to spend more time with alex',
       'I kinda liked it. I finished untold darkness book 1 before giving up. I also started reading a couple others to be fair. I didn\'t really like untold darkness until later on in the book, and was eager to start the second but very disappointed in the second one. I felt like my choices didn\'t really effect the outcome.',
       'I hate this game. Just like all the others you need diamonds to make a certain decision. And what\'s the point of having an earn option if you never get the diamonds you\'re supposed to get!? I\'m not paying for them either! I also think 20 points to equal one diamond is a bit rediculous. Either 20 points is to high or 1 diamond too low!',
       'I really like the game and would have give 5 stars if darkness untold 2 would have been the following of darkness untold 1.... It\'s like the 1,you start from the beginning... But with another with the story taking another way... Very disappointing' ,

      'Very much a top game, graphics are in your face with colours and speed. It\'s a" please don\'t stop playing me mi kind of game" Thank you. üò± Wicked game. Top buzz. For some unknown reason, the creatures aren\'t rolling. Still good. One of the most enjoyable games you can play with 1 finger. Thanks again. Not working is the bonuses you get playing everyday. Brilliant wicked. Excellent. Top one digit game. üëÜ Great. Can\'t stop playing the game. Bravo. Thanks again. Wicked. Great. Funtastic. Brilliant',
       'It\'s a good game to kill time with, though it doesn\'t offer much. Touch controls work well although a bit finicky, and it hits the difficulty spike a bit sooner than expected. It might have you buying some upgrades through micro transactions. I\'ve also experienced some lag that caused some unfair moments to happen. Still, it won\'t stop you from trying to beat your or your friends\' high score every once in a while. Overall, it\'s fast paced fun (Pun intended).',
       'Simple, but the increasing difficulty gives the game an enjoyable skill curve that keeps me wanting to play. The unlocks are nice and the pressure to purchase things isn\'t too bad, so far anyway.',
       'Hey Sega, where\'s Monkey Ball? I LOVE THAT GAME! PLEASE RESPOND! But everything is good. The only thing is, I had Espio, but I don\'t have him now.',
       'No Wi-Fi needed.   Keeps getting better. Can unlock more characters as you play. Free to play style which mean you buy what you want. Looks like the game is always being worked on. Which in my opinion more new stuff or improvements to come later on ; as the game gets older and people keep playing. Which has been proven in more then one occasion.',
       'This game is one of the best out there. Now I know it might seem like a remake of Subway Surfers or any other endless runner game out there, but I must say, Sonic Dash is much more than that. You can do way more in this game than you could in Subway Surfers. I would recommend this game of you haven\'t tried it. It\'s occupies time and above all else, this is a great game!' ,

      'Would of gaven 5 stars. But there some bugs that need to be worked out. Like connection and handling. But other then that this game is really close to PUGB for the phone. Massive open world. COULD do little better on the mechanic of the game but nothing to major. Would like to have a better money earn system like small amout per kill or something. This game is well dont. Ive played almsot all games on gogole play and when i say this game is fun I MEAN IT!!..',
       'I like the game, but I have a few things I would like added. One thing is instead of joystick controls maybe there could be an option that allows you to have buttons to move like in vehicle mode where you can switch from the gas pedal to the four buttons. Also I would love a first person mode, I think that would make the game so much cooler and better, just a new way of playing. And Maybe a mode like a TDM would be cool. Just some suggestions, thanks for reading love the game!',
       'Thank you for constantly improving the game. Id say at this point not to add more but to fix and adjust what you already have. Fine tuning before more additions would be great. Optimizing sounds, movements, vehicles, rendering, scoping, responses, all that good stuff would be great. Its a little laggy but thats just what you get for a giant game and 100 million+ players. Love it either way.',
       'Why is there no controller support!!!!! For a game like this it is imperative for good controls. Playing on a touch screen is alright but I would like to be able to use a controller and considering controller support has been out sense android 4.0 this wouldn\'t even limit your customer base as I doubt any 4 year old phones can even play your game above 10fps. It seems like it is deliberately being left out and it is baffling me. Please can we use our controllers it\'s such a simple api to implement!!!! Seriously I think monkeys can implement controllers in games quicker then you guys what the hell!!',
       'The game has so much potential they just need to make it easier to see other players and easier to shoot people close to you. Also the game doesn\'t need to look realistic they should make it more like fortnite graphics and gameplay wise.  My main point is that it is too hard to see others in the game. still a good game though',
       'honestly a great game. but dont get diamonds to buy their packs. not only are they really expensive but the chance of actually getting their special clothes is so small I bought 10 packs of the monkey king and I got the same 2 grey items from all 10 packs.... like wth???' ,

      'Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!',
       'Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm\'s Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!',
       'Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I\'m just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it\'s going to be good.  We\'ll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!',
       'This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10',
       'I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.',
       'Don\'t get me wrong, these new levels and songs are fun and addictive and all of the new stuff is awesome... but stop making new apps? Why not just update the original? It\'s kind of frustrating to have a paid version with stuff I\'ve unlocked but have to deal with an unpaid version (aka, ads) and have to unlock skins and colors all over again because new apps keep being made.' ,

      'Sooooooo addicting ,I love this game so fun,  relaxing and has great music. I can\'t stop playing. So awesome,they should make more word searches or word crosses like these kind of games. All though  you have to pay for some parts of the game but out of all the games I have ever played this on is #1üòçüòÇüòÉ',
       'Game itself is good but to have an advert appear everytime you get to the next level is a bit much. It\'s always the same adverts and it\'s not easy to close the advert. It directs you to playstore to install the app that is being advertised.  I know you need to make money for making this app but the ads are spoiling what was once nice to play. I use it less and less each time I see an ad.',
       'The only bad thing about this game is the sheer volume of ads. I understand it\'s to push you to spend money but it\'s more likely to stop me playing. Tone them back a little and it\'ll make for a much more enjoyable experience that I would be happy to recommend to friends. Ads are a fair trade off for a free game, but not at this current frequency.',
       'Fabulous word game. The whole family is addicted. Could do with a slightly wider vocabulary in that sometimes you find a perfectly good word that is not in the grid but it\'s not allowed in the bonus bank. But that\'s just being picky. Overall, well, well worth the modest price to go ad-free. Highly recommended.',
       'Got me hooked way too easily, then got so many people I know playing it too. The simplicity is what makes it work and the irritation of finding a word you (should) know makes me keep playing, over and over and over.  One of the best games I have played in ages!',
       'I love this game! It\'s a real challenge and better than the normal ones because of the backgrounds and how it\'s a crossword. You could add an online player vs player thing too. I love the daily challenges. Maybe add something to win instead of coins? If you love a good daily challenge defiantly get the game!! üòä' ,

      'The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool üëå but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn\'t make it better at controlling. I don\'t know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work üëå',
       'this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It\'s so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It\'s just so addicting and I can\'t get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the \'play online\' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sin√©ad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie üòäüòä',

      'I think there should be option of chatting with guild members and other players not voice chatting but message ones.  There should be some research option in every guild or either there should be some Commander talent points by which we can increase some of the tactics of team & player.  Main Idea :  I think there should be some event in which 2 guilds can fight with each other & there should be option of ally & others.  I know it\'s kinda different game but it will make fun to game.   Overall this game is best and addictive,  Thanks for making this game.  Great effort by dev team.  Love you.',
       'This is a great game. My friends and I love it and it\'s probably the closest thing to PUBG that will ever be made. One thing though.. How do I add people to my guild. üòÇüòÇüòÇ  And considering improvements, maybe you could expand the map a bit, get it to 100 people on the map at a time but that\'s not exactly an issue, maybe something to work towards. Also, maybe add a chat room for guild members and not just the voice chat.',
       'One of the biggest online game I ever played...Graphics is a bit low and others are awesome... The Main thing I like in this game is the voice chatting with team mates... Commonly Only PC games has this program but now Android also has... And again i am saying that graphics could be a bit more good and I love playing this... Its a great game',
       'This game is so good! I love it but could you add some binding account so account will not be loss. Im in a high level almost level 37 and I accidentally delete the app then when I download the game again I cant play my old account! That\'s horrible try to fix it admin or whoever. And last thing try to put some servers country by country so we could play against other countries. Try to do this admin. I assure you that after you made this comments or suggestions this game will be the best ever!',
       'The game is developing good so far. Hope you\'ll add a feature wherein we can make a game with our friends and play against each other. It would be cooler üëç   This is a shoutout to the 5th friend that we have to sacrifice when we go play on squad lol, thanks!',
       'This game is good fun but pls can u stop peoee from running u over as when 8 get in top 3 some keeps running me over. It\'s still and amazing games but when people run u over its boring and wish u could stop people from doing this   is th8nkthere u should maybe be able to drive places but when u want to fight they have to get out and shoot and have a proper gun fight . Overall this is a great game my favourite mobile game and it\'s really enjoyable. But pls can u make people not being able to do this. Thankyou' ,

      'A great time killer with well-written, diverse, and addicting stories. I\'m far from the first one to say this, but my one critique is how often diamonds are needed to make choices that are interesting/clearly crucial to the plot. I don\'t mind paying for diamonds or playing chapters of other stories to save up, but 20 diamonds should last longer than just one chapter. I suggest either introducing a subscription based option that frees up all choices for a one time or monthly fee or reducing the amount of diamonds needed to make a special choice. An alternative way of earning diamonds, such as watching ads, might be something to consider as well.',
       'Great game but the only downside to it is, some choices need more diamonds to make it all interesting whilst you only earn 1 dimond per chapter which basically leaves you with no choice left other than reluctantly pick the one that is free.  If there could be more diamonds to earn ,without spending real money to purchase game ones, it would receive higher rankings of course.',
       'The stories are great but to enjoy them properly, you have to spend diamonds. Free diamonds at the beginning is way too less (25 diamonds). And you earn 1 diamond per chapter, which is less because to make premium choices you have to spend so much more diamonds (min. 12 diamonds for a choice). And you have to make at least one premium choice per chapter. Buying the diamonds is way too expensive. I think the developers should allow users to earn more diamonds in the game. Maybe make them watch a video to earn free diamonds. That would certainly help...',
       'Really fun but I wish you gave us more than 2 keys. I\'m not going to spend actual money on a short story but I\'m sure a lot of others will, which is great for you but I think 2 keys is a little low since there are numerous chapters to play and many stories to choose from. Would be cool if you would match most other games and give us 5 keys for gameplay.',
       'Love the story lines, the graphics, all of it. Would have liked to seen something that can be done to regenerate the diamonds or do something to earn more diamonds other than finishing a new chapter earns you only one. Did experience my diamonds disappearing and the timer of keys along with the keys reach zero and not returning. Hope this issue will be resolved. Other than these issues really enjoyed the game, it\'s highly addictive.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a few days, so here\'s my review. I enjoy the stories even though they use a lot of archetypes, and I don\'t mind waiting for keys. The biggest issue I have is with the gems and premium choices: not only do the premium choices cost an unreasonably high amount of gems, but every time there are choice options with at least one premium choice, the premium choices are always presented as the better ones. This is less like making my own choices and more like reaffirming my assumption that the premium choices are always the better ones. I\'ve come to the conclusion that I would rather pay once to have this app installed rather than install it for free and pay money for gems just so I could pick the premium choices.' ,

      'I love this game!! "it helps a lot" with my shopping addiction because I feel like I\'m buying real merchandise. I really enjoy the updates and how you guys added more room to be designed!!!! Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))',
       'I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.',
       'Great application. Very enjoyable. Only complaint wish app had more international design furniture to match the themes and settings. Also need to fix the bug so that the design loading screen appears.  This is the only app that I have to reset my tablet to get my results, since the last update I have had this issue. I have made an inquiry adressing this issue and it still has not been fixed. I have changed my rating because of this issue, once it has been addressed and fixed I may change my opinion.',
       'The game is fun, but results take 2 and 3 days and if other people are on higher levels they have access to better tableware and vases, pictures etc, so their rooms stand out more and they have a better chance at getting 5 stars. And some items I\'ve purchased don\'t work it gives a message saying they couldn\'t find it in the warehouse. But the game never gave me my gems back and of money. NEED TO FIX IT',
       'O.k. the game has been fun. Love decorating. My gripe is why can\'t I keep the furniture that I have purchased with my own money? And why do I have to repurchase items that I have already bought? And why am I limited on purchasing if I spend my own money.  You guys say that you don\'t enhance the voting process but I tend to differ. Many times rooms that have scored A 5 are all in the same color tones and almost look the same. It has been fun but unless you give me more options to purchase I\'m? out.',
       'Great game! Love it! Only voting system is not accurate. I think  designs that not reflecting the theme should not get  5 stars. It would be nice to have experts inside the game who will review designs for THEME and reward those who follow the theme and get great result  in designing. I suggest to  give one point for those who is following theme, and get one point out if someone not. Fairness is important.' ,

Love you all! Morgan ps it just did it again I\'m deleting it if you run sausage run crew arnt going to fix it. Love you all!Morgan',
       'This game is fantastic! The style, sounds, and music set a fun and cartoon-ish tone, and the gameplay adds a sense of tension and suspense as the player does not know what the next obstacle will be and cannot stop the character completely as the sausage continues to walk onward. This game is fun to play and hilarious (specifically the sausage\'s dying cries/animations), and the obstacles aren\'t predictable, but the pace is initially too slow, making the game a bit boring at the beginning. I would like to see a game mode that increases the pace right from the start, like a speed mode, and new dying cries/animations and obstacles in future updates. However, as the game is right now, it\'s a lot of fun. Definitely recommend.',

      'This is the most ridiculous game ever. I love it but i do have one suggestion can you make at least one new free map or make other free for a month during their seasons( for example: the buck to school map is free at the staer of july or august).p.s keep up the good work',
       'The gameplay is of course billion perfect and also the graphics!!! If any 1 wanted to play any interesting game....THIS IS THE ANSWER: goat simulator!! But when I was in a house in the game, I found a hilarious thing ..... Doritos the chips, hahaha it was really funny! Also when I went to the supermarket in goat simulator I found lays, Doritos and Oreos..can u imagine??!!!?!?!? Then I hit a girl and a boy with a gas car but they didn\'t die??!!! and that\'s a little bit creepy and weird. If u r asking a question why goat simulator got all of those downloads the 500 million I will answer u, cuz it\'s perfect and no 1 can do a game better than this. The graphics and gameplay and costumes!!',
       'Most rediculous game ever and I love it! But could you at least expand goatville (put more stuff in it and make it bigger) since you can\'t play in the other levels without buying them and a lot of people can\'t?',
       'Good o\'l goat sim put into mobile, maps cost money which sadly I do not have but it\'s still enjoyable until you find all the trophies and secrets on the first map, great nonetheless but gotta uninstall it, loved it while it lasted',
       'Guys it\'s a great game but when I start playing the first level the controls don\'t work plz work this out. Otherwise it\'s a really good game with great graphics! Plz fix the problem.',
       'This amazing sad that you need to buy the levels though but nice goats this is funny and ridiculous but I love the the game this made me laugh so put a multiplayer so you can join people and instead of getting your goat at a customize so we can make our own goat I LOVE THE GAME üòÑüòÑüòÑ oh I\'m still typing ahhhh' ,

      'This was a great game before the monster updates, now it just sucks because it\'s adding extra numbers to the blocks and all the timers and what not. I used to play it for hours and now I can maybe deal with it for 10 minutes before I get sick of it.',
       'Super fun game! However, I don\'t know what you put in the update, but the balls hit corners wayyy more often and get excessively redirected when they do - its annoying af, please revert.',

       'Used to be great! But the new update is awful. Hitting the corner causes your ball to go straight down, which essentially ruins your play, and the monsters are just random and ruin any strategy. Gem bonuses for clearing are good, but it\'s impossible to clear if you hit a corner and your balls just vault back to the start!',

Graphics very bad like watching negative image,  someone can\'t change to another easily even at the end of the week as you so stipulated , The ads keep on stalking and crashing the game Unnecessary difficult missions, for what??? And many more.  For crying out loud, this should be a fun game, something to ease stress not cause one. Not to mention if you install it to a new device and login with your fb id, you can\'t start from where you stopped with your achievements Its becoming not-fun-anymore.',

      'Definitely not worth it. Was fun at first, but after the updated quests, the game took a serious nosedive in quality. Now you HAVE to beat the opponent in order to get anything, otherwise you\'re out 1000 gold. Before, you would get something just for playing. The new PvP just sucks.',
       'Pretty decent game, shame you need to pay gems for the second last ship. The PvP is fun but half the time reduces my gold when I win. Cannot see the devs replying to any messages so unsure if they care',
       'The forced ads are so frequent and annoying. Pvp either freezes and steals your coins or you win and lose coins. Probably over 100,000 coins lost this way. Game has potential and is fun, but company took this fun game and made it not worth playing',
       'WAY TOO MANY ADS. PvP matching is terrible. The disparity in ship level, ship strength and player level/experience is also terrible. It is a P2W (pay to win) game. ther than that, I enjoyed it.',
       'Multiplayer locks up every 2nd or 3rd game during the connection process causing you to lose your coins or diamonds without ever playing.  If you get the option to leave the game waiting for the other person to connect, the next game will be your ship frozen in the middle of the screen and you never get an option to leave without starting and the app must be closed and restarted to do anything.',

      'I really like the game, but as soon as I played multiplayer my phone crashes. I know it\'s not my phone itself but the program because my phone never crashes to anything. Please fix the multiplayer mode! It\'s really nice but constantly crashes!!! Only because of that, I\'m giving it one star. As soon as it\'s fixed I\'ll be sure to give it 5 star and share it with my friends.',
       '1. The online mode isn\'t letting join a match 2. There should be special moves, like when you fall down, if you press the slide button, you won\'t lose speed (like in Mirrors edge) 3. The courses/levels are too easy, make it more harder',
       'The game is good. I like this game because of the fact it\'s parkour. The fact I don\'t have a life means I can take time on the game,the graphics are great I can clearly see what and how I\'m doing. So the game play is good. I know what controls to use, what to do, and it\'s a good. But I can\'t get over the fact that there is not a lot of color. There is only red and black. So I think they should be color.  Good game otherwise',
       'Some of the player crashing in the game pls fix so they can\'t cheat no more and when you do that I can give you 5star',
       'So I turned on the game and I did some steps, maybe 30 passed and I laughed, I turned it off and I uninstalled it.  It is without a doubt hilarious.',

      'I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It\'s pricey but we\'ll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn\'t need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get',
       'It would be nice for updated casino with new slot machine games and also some new restaurants.  Last one was quite sometime ago?  Are you still actively developing the game or you called it quits like some other games I had to uninstall because there was nothing left to do in them.  Just curious.....',
       'I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.',
       'This game is a bit boring at first since it is really hard to serve your burgers because they take ages to cook.  I, after 1 day,  got totally addicted to it as it gets really fun and especially when it lets you purchase the automatic cooker for just 10 gems it is easy and cool! You will see what I mean when you hopefully download the app as I would definitely recommend it! Thank you for making a fun, addictive app that I enjoy. üòÑ',
       'Omg I have just realised that it was 1 year ago since I wrote that! So I\'m going to write a new one!. I love this game so much it has such good graphics and I recommend this game for any age I am addicted to this game and I think that you should definitely get it. It is a great game and I love it! So what are you waiting for go ahead and download it right now!',
       'Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn\'t need to have the internet on. Don\'t know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.' ,

I\'m already making lots of gold with automating potatoes. Potatoes give away so much gold! Good update.  Keep up the good work. Thanks, Idle Farming Empire. What a good replacement for Farm Away.  Idle Farming Empire is like the best simulation for farming. I gave the game 4 stars for a reason. I liked the game! Look under the review! There\'re many people rating the game 5 stars. It should really be rated 4 stars.  Over 97,800 people rated 4 and 5 stars. I like this game. Thanks for everything.',
       'This "game" is like empty calories. I ingested it ate it up and left hungry.  There is no goal whatsoever to this game. It is a glorified add campaign intended to keep you going on and on with a false feeling of accomplishment in order push ads on you or make you buy perks. Want to double your earnings for 20 seconds? Watch a 30 second ad. Want to improve earnings for four hours. Watch an ad. You get the point. Of course you can buy these perks but why do any of this? The "game" never really does anything whatsoever. No milestones, no real goals, no anything. Well after about 3 hours of game time and the equivalent of add watching time I am off to ingest something with more substance.',
       'AMAZING! I love this game. It is so addicting and a great way to pass time and boredom. I think though for one small improvement you could add a thing where there are like \'mini games\' and you earn coins for that. Using those coins earend in the mini games you spend it on things like watering cans, fences for live stock and more! This was only some suggestions for a bigger game if you can have or make a new game called like farm life or something like that....LOVE IT...',
       'I LOVE THIS GAMEE!! It\'s so addicting and once u get used to it, u can\'t stop playing it! It\'s a great time killer and it auto saves (not of u connected to Facebook.) Again, I love this game and I would recommend this game to EVERYONE because it\'s for all ages (unless u are a very serious person) JK LOL! :D',
       'OK, I love Idle clickers and this is a great game in this genre. Easy to get into, ads not forced on you, nice graphics.  There is one thing that is really bugging me though. You start out with your standard 9 crops and you can then unlock more for each plot. My issue is it does not tell you when you unlock a new one if it earns more than the standard one. Do they just look different but earn the same? Apart from this... Love it. Keep up good work devs',
       'Like so far But, 2 issues. 1- I don\'t Facebook or do any social media so needs to be a way other than ads for those bonuses. 2- daily rewards Don\'t happen. Shows that they were collected but will not activate unless I have enough diamonds. Please fix. Play offline on tablet and hotspot to get daily reward.' ,

      'Since no one reads 5 star reviews I figured I would rate as 1. Great time killer during those boring meetings or occasional bouts of constipation. Want to take a break from your mind numbing job? This is equally mind numbing....but hey, play on your bosses time. When you see a picture you can\'t figure out, lower your mental ability to where it makes an amoeba seem like Einstein......from there you will get every puzzle. Enjoy',
       'Really fun game! Just a couple of itsy bitsy things that get on my nerves. The coins you win are miniscule compared with how many you need when you use the Help function (even bumping it up to 5 coins for each correct answer would be better) & the other thing...I get that you need ads to keep these games free but does there need to be an ad after EVERY SINGLE PUZZLE??',
       'It\'s ok, I wish the words were harder. The pop ups are far less than many other apps and I like games like this, even more so when they are challenging. I give it 3 stars.',
       'Ads, ads, and more annoying Ada that can only be removed by using "coin". While I have no issue paying for apps or occasional chunks of content, this was annoying AF. I also didn\'t find it particularly challenging.',
       'Truly a amazing classic game. Really fun you end up kicking yourself over some of the answers but in a funny way . Really recommend downloading runs really well great game all around :).',

      'Finally got the game to load, was delighted to see that the multi hour rewards were 880,000, so much more than other slot games! All of a sudden however you guys have decided to restrict those hourly gifts to 200,000!

And yes, I do buy coin packs on rare occasions, but I shouldn\'t have to just to play this game! üòí',
       'Fafafa gold slots are very easy slots for Jackpots. They hourly to 3 hours  bonus. They also once a day a daily spin. Levels up really fast. Now I have tried to purposely get rid of this game. However Every time I tried I would win more.  I really put it to the test. Thank you.',

      'The game is designed to force you to spend money unnecessary money they\'ve already made millions of it you don\'t think of me to do stuff for free. The game is rigged so you cannot win 90 percent of the time. Ots a fun great game but the developers are selfish and very greed y at this point. Game 5 stars. Cheating 1 star.  Developers OVER priced items and greedyness earn another 1 star.',
       'I was so upset that i deleted this game!I had no idea how much i missed it! I was a big candy crush fan and still am today! Im glad i cleared up space to instal it! I recomend this game to everyone, i realy love that you can play it offline and with other players! Even if the gamers at school say this ias a stupid game, i think it is fantastic!.I live that you get candy powerups everyday instead of using your gold too!',
       'You\'d think an app so heavily used wouldn\'t crash so much. Time to uninstall. Finally was getting close to completing a super hard level, after struggling for days/weeks. Game crashes and I lose my progress. Will never reinstall.',
       'I liked this game, but I\'m trying to get passed level 460 just about to win, and game goes out. So I have to keep playing. I\'m thinking its just a fluke no it happens again. Same night. I lose 2 games. No, thanks, don\'t think I\'ll play this again. Until you can get it fixed!',
       'I came on yesterday to play CCS and noticed it\'d changed the background the colour and the game itself... I really don\'t like it... I prefer it the old way!!! It reminds me of a similiar game called cookie jam! But I\'ll get used to it. Keep them Candy\'s coming and crushing!! <3 <3 :-) :-)',

       'It was good but then this happened. I was playing just like any other day. My phone had died while I was playing, so I charged it and left it untouched for about an hour or two. When I signed in, all off my progress was erased! Please respond and tell me what happened.',

       'Irritating. At first it gives you an option of playing a video to receive additional help. Which works only for the first time. Next time onwards no way to cancel the video in case you don\'t want to install it. It is so frustrating. Either allows to cancel or tell the users what to do next. Worst way of promoting other apps.',

      'It\'s OK I love to play the game when I\'m bored and it helps me to be settled back and have a good time. But these all happens when I\'m offline. But when I\'m connected to Wi-Fi there\'s too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you\'ll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I\'m playing the game??!! It\'s too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.',
       'Well before I say my review, I would like to clear out a few of the negative reviews. There are not very many ads at all, in fact I barely ever even get any. Second, the controls don\'t suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.',
       'It\'s stupid. It\'s really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn\'t turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked.',
       'I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don\'t you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?',
       'I dont know why people are rating Ketchapp games below 4 stars... I agree games are difficult but one of the unique one\'s in every launch. Their creativity is awesome... Love to play each of their games. Kind of more chanlenging and unique ones',
       'This is an amazing game! But there\'s a tiny problem with the controls: they are hard to be used. In addition, there are so many advertisments and that\'s the only reason I gave 4/5 Stars' ,

      'The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won\'t annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   C√∏okie',
       'Its a legit fun game to play but...  For me I get streshed because when I need to do it over again then u  streshed by not doing it...    Its still kind of a good game though..  Also on YT thanks for...   !!!! 2 SUBSCRIBERS!!!!  I know its not alot but I am rlly happy and I\'m thankfully to who subscribed to me on YT :)  My name was galaxy DJ but now..  Its AngelPlayz I haven\'t even uploaded any videos yet üòÇüòÇ but thanks for the support!  I might be making new videos about roleplays bloxburg builds and games to enturtain u guys to not be bored!!   I LIKE TACCCCOOOOSSSSSSSSS.....  üççüççüçç .. This is so long lol...   Sorry how this is so long üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Well yeah that\'s all I got to say..!!?  Cya peace GUYSüççüçç',
       'Well, I admit, I\'m addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn\'t be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can\'t Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! üôåüòéüòç',
       'It\'s a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ‚ö† the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it\'s super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.',
       'So rage inducing! But i am a comete noob at your amazing creations. When o first downloaded it 3 yrs ago i hated it a deleyed after failing the first level before getting halfway. Some how though my abillity for rage cam control itself and yea. So in a way you made a rage game that helped my rage. Huh. Anyways great game might buy full version. Only if i can become a good player though',
       'Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it\'s fun because it\'s challenging and there\'s super fun things in GD except hacking because that\'s no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I\'m super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! üòéüòÇ' ,

Till now my highest score is 74 & I\'m in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...üòÇüòÇ Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game.

       'I\'ve noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don\'t think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying.',
       'I really like this game. But here is why I gave it 2 stars.  I completed all of the challenges but still don\'t have have enough score to finish ranking up.  The 5 day to secret ball never works for me. It resets after 2 days even though I play everyday.  There should be a counter for how many times you switch lanes. Some of the challenges were impossible because you had to switch lanes exactly x amount.  Also I don\'t think you should have challenges that make you avoid getting the coins, because the whole point of the game is to win spheres and lanes...',
       'Fun little time killer. My only problem is that daily rewards fail to show up most days. It could be a problem on my end, but I don\'t know, and it\'s a pretty small issue so I don\'t really care.',
       'Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn\'t respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I\'m willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.',
       'This is the most addictive game i have ever played. I always play it when am bored and you can play it when your offline. Totally recommend it but pls answer this question..what is the world highest score?' ,

You can\'t collect the food even if you grow it. Since I did have enough gems wood or food to build the warehouse I\'m screwed with no options  but to quit the game. Sucks it could have been good. I\'m done. It\'s sad that with all the bad reviews you don\'t choose to change any of those features to improve the quality and keep more users to continue play.',
       'I never pay for supplies in these types of games but with this one there\'s no point in playing anymore if I don\'t. You simply can\'t earn enough coins to keep playing. Additionally their ratios for resources are all over the place. I often found it didn\'t make sense to use the "higher" option when a lower faster option was more cost effective.

      'Awesome Game!! Really I like this game. I dont even have words to describe it. Totally Fantastic... Whatever you say, this is totally cool. But I have a request...please add a column of legendary bikes. Like there is Common, Rares, Epics, and Specials , there should be a column of legendary. Waiting eagerly for the next update. Thanks a lot of making this fabulous game. And I would also like to appreciate the colours and graphics of this game. Thanks to the team for making this game. I advice this game to those who are looking for cool new games. Please install it and have FUN!!!! Dont just look at the pics, install and you\'ll be amazed.',
       'Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death',
       'Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won\'t register your flips. These aren\'t huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.',
       'Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I\'ll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.',
       'This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can\'t seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn\'t be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it\'s not something you have to add, it\'s just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven\'t seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it\'s an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! üöòüòäüöò',
       'This game would be great if it wasn\'t so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn\'t slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.' ,

      'Good but ¬£4 is a lot to not quite remove all the add. Some pictures are still locked behind and walls. Easy enough to unlock but for the price id expected all add to be removed. Also really would like the pictures to be sortable by category with more fantasy and space stuff in the complex pictures. Also there appears to be no way to sync pictures across devices. If I\'ve paid ¬£4 I should be able to switch between the phone and tablet at will. Both are android.',
       'In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it\'s just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.',
       'I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It\'s kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.‚ò∫',
       'Awesome app, its oddly satisfying and can either be really challenging ir really easy. Its constantly update with new pictures to do, and already contains probably hundreds lol, if dont 75+ and in saving the really detailed ones for last. If there even is such a thing. But, i think a counter for how many blocks of each color are left would be a really awesome alteration. There are many strategies to use when you do a color by number. So a counter for how many blocks of the selected number are left, it would be such a life save.this game has taken enough of my life already as is lmao',
       'This game is an entertaining and super relaxing way to spend time. New pictures are added every day, and there is a large selection of different things to color. I really like this app, and think at deserves five stars. To whoever is making the art on this app, it is really beautiful. If you are reading my review, (Wich you probably aren\'t) I think it would be really cool if you did some pictures from popular books and movies.',
       'This is the best free colouring by numbers app out there however some changes need to be made to make it perfect.  Mainly being able to register and log in and out would be amazing in order to save your progress within the app.  One word of warning - do not move the app from your device onto an SD card or any other external memory because it will treat it as a fresh install and you will lose all your completed works! I learned this the hard way and I\'m rather gutted about it.' ,

And thank you so so so so much.But I saw one mistake you were making that was if a player just tap a white tile you would make it out . So don\'t make the player out. Give it at least 5 chances. So that he can make his or her best high score. Please try to make it more interesting . And also when we reach higher you make it faster and faster. Otherwise this game is the best of all games.',

      'Playing four windows is great, having to pick a window and only winning 1 in every 25 bonus games really sucks.  Make it more like the casino game before it was changed, single window main with four bonus screens, player claims all wins, OR, keep four main windows with higher minimum bet and have four window bonus screens but player MUST claim all wins.  I am level 48 and bought my way to platinum status. Higher level players ( larger bets) wouldn\'t mind buying coins regularly if it were more fun.',
       'Seems when your balance becomes too high you are BLOCKED for being a cheat?? Unsure how you can cheat on their slots. Their terms and conditions do not give any rights to players at all. Disgraceful people to deal with. Difficult to get any response to emails. Would not recommend.',
       'Was good until today. Had purchased over 200,000 coins then the coin amount started jumping all over the place without playing. Closed app and reopened it and only had 553 coins left. I wasn\'t even playing! Waste of money when the game steals coins!!!',
       'As many of the reviews are saying, why has my account been blocked. You have a bit of fun playing on these machines and win a high number of credits and then your account is blocked. How ewill my account become unblocked?',
       'This site is FUCKED. DONT BOTHER DOWNLOADING. The features are practically non existant. These money hungry pack of cunts can\'t understand that there is no way people will buy coins when there are no features. The money they want for coins please go to real venues and put the money in real pokies. You will have more luck there. I will never buy coins on this site and because I speak up and tell people how it is, I am going to be targeted. It is the 26th of February 2018 and i will get back on here to notify you all then next time I get a decent paying feature using the free coins.  Bad reviews normally means bad pays on this site. I will get back to you all............ but dont expect that to be for a few months...... it will take that long to get a decent paying feature.',
       'After 6 years of playing, I get blocked for no reason. 6 years of saving coins and winning qnd loosing until I have enough coins to play high spend room. 6 years where any day I can gain 300 billion, or loose 100billion and call it a day.

      'Great timewaster! There are a lot of characters to earn and you don\'t need to spend real money to get them, so that\'s a plus. However, rated it a 3 cuz there are sooooo many ads. I get that ads generate the revenue to keep a good game free but an ad populates for literally every action. Win a game=ad, lose a game=ad, go to the settings=ad, change the volume=ad... ok the last one is fictitious but it really seems like that\'s how it works',
       'Love the game, its fun, addictive, and challenging. It makes you actually think before you do anything. The ads really are a bit much, being that after every single round in a tournament there is one. Also, one major thing, keep up with the updates. IOS users seems to have gotten an update with new characters and pvp mode even but not android',
       'The game is simple to immediately start playing and fun. I shouldn\'t rate a game based off of this but, these pop up adds are tremendously common. Adds are essential so that the app can support itself but to have an add after every single play and then have an add to open a chest? Really? That\'s a bit much, especially, when the adds are not easily skippable and even force you to the download screen of the add. The game is simple, fun, and has witty, silly, and quirky characters. But the adds are a bit much.',
       'Me and my son have had fun with this game and made an attempt to collect all characters. The game is set up so you can not earn all of the characters but have to buy the last couple in a cash grab. It would be fine if they we\'re only available for real money but the game gives the illusion that you can win them in a chest. One that we have spun over 50 times without success',
       'The game itself is enjoyable and the controls are quite simple. Very intuitive. But Jesus Christ on a frosty log, the ads are way to much. After every round, ad, want your prize? Ad. Wanna do anything in the game? Enjoy the ad. Jesus guys, I don\'t mind ads and I understand that\'s how you make money, but you shouldn\'t have to watch an ad to get your prize for winning... Come on.',
       'Everything else is great, EXCEPT the amount of ads... I love the game, but I don\'t want to keep turning on and off airplane mode so I can actually enjoy it.  Edit: there are ads after I go into settings and more information, which doesn\'t leave the app!? Seriously? And the "messages" are all more ads for other apps too, lol. Bro calm down with the ads. This is why I\'m now uninstalling.' ,

      'I\'ve played for 3 years and this game has just gone way downhill, this is the biggest pay to win game that exists. It\'s enjoyable to see people have the ability to buy what I worked so hard during the last 3 years for a mere $10. I haven\'t enjoyed this game in months, it\'s a chore to still play. Download only if you\'re willing to drop a fortune.',
       'nice game for the others saying that this is a copy of coc it has a lot of difference this game is more easy to play than coc. coc is a hard game more time o upgrade more time on things in this in only 5 m its fast becouse it is free and you already have a hero if you start the game in coc you ned to be th lvl 7 to get it or 8 idk but dont say that coc an cc is the same becouse your wrong of saying that they are the same (^_^)',
       'OMG This app is annoying in all ways... And on Certain hack things I play this for 30 seconds but still don\'t get a pass! Tell CoTops to give me my credits',
       'It\'s a great game but there are too many things u have to pay for. Too many OP heroes that unbalance the game. Stop making new heroes so often. I\'ve been playing this game for about 6 years, and I hate that new players get it so easy. I had to grind to get where I\'m at, and that\'s how it should be',
       'Lol I\'m changing my review once more. I love the game but every new hero you guys drop completely messes up the game and makes things unfair. I don\'t know if your way of trying to fix it is by making more OP heroes but it simply makes the game less enjoyable. The last few heroes that came out completely made my account useless and if I don\'t put in a good couple hundred dollars is just gonna stay useless. I think that\'s unfair so for now I\'m taking off a few stars. I know you guys don\'t care but its the only thing I can do to express my opinion. In my humble opinion you guys should balance the useless heroes you already have rather than coming up with new ones that make the old ones  useless.',
       'Very unfair. D\'ont download it unless you want to spend a fortune. After four years of playing, the new op heroes available for cash, will crash your in a second. Be aware !!!' ,

      'i would rate 5 stars... but.. something with the cloud save broke, i used to have the megalodon, without any cheats.. but now i have the mako. could you fix this somehow? And do i email the support team? Im not good with all the emailing stuff.',
       'It\'s a really fun game, but sometimes you\'ll play a video to revive your shark and the video will play but you don\'t get another life afterwards. It\'s hard to believe that it is a WiFi problem because if it was an ad wouldn\'t be able to load at all. Also, I have paused the game before and come back minutes later and the game had kicked me out and not saved any coins/gems gained from that round. They clearly have a few bugs to work out.',
       'IT IS SO GOOD, YOU HAVE TO BUY IT!Every level you get a new shark,though,you have to pay for them.But the good thing is you still have your old shark! You will be challenged throughout the levels! AND WHATEVER YOU DO,DO NOT SPEND YOUR JEMS!!!! You barely can get any jems,besides the five you get for downloading it.Anyway all I want to say is have fun be cool and be one with the shark! Bye,rsvp!',
       'OMG! I love the gameplay in this arcade game I love everything about it. It is very cool that you can evolve sharks that can eat more stuff. Keep the updates coming it would be better if you added more sharks in this game . I recommend downloading this game if you want something to do in a long amount of time. This is so addictive I can\'t stop playing it!',
       'My apologies for the negative review lately. But to be honest, I have to use VPN just to log-in in Google Play and enable cloud sync or else, I wouldn\'t be able to sync my progress. Just a little request, can you make the gameplay smoother for lower end devices, such as devices with 1GB RAM? It lags frequently during gameplay. Thanks a lot!',
       'Really fun , good graphics, funny screaming when we eat the humans. The big sharks health will drain too fast after 10 - 20 mins. Overall really good game when ur offline' ,

      'I love this game. Every game I\'ve had, I played for a week or so, and uninstalled. But this one? Ive had for almost 6 months. Been playing every single day. Finally reached legendary 32, I\'ve unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so. Or at least a new adventure spot. Making a modded version of the rally car would be fantastic. Also, an upgrade on the formula car where it doesn\'t almost dead stop after it lands from a big air.',
       'If you don\'t want to give away free stuff from the chests, don\'t. But stop wasting my damn giving me these "free" coins for watching a video only to have the ad freeze %95 of the time. The are plenty of other free games out there, might be time for a change.',
       'Superb game! Too bad, the elements of hate like to hack good things and cause frustrations. For this reason, constantly run constant updates. I wouldn\'t mind paying through my rather expensive data to diffuse the damage by these bored, small prick nincompoops! Africaüòùüòùüòù',
       'How can an offline mode still glitch?!?! I can\'t believe it. It\'s like I\'m playing with 512mg ram on dial up internet. This is ridiculous. How does this happen? Do your job, and when you release a game or an update, make it work!',
       'Alot of fun but needs new maps and vehicles. Wayyy overdue for some new stuff.  Update: since the latest update I was very disappointed to see that they nerfed the magnet. Still waiting to see new maps and vehicles',
       'Good game, some of the challenges are impossible to play well because players vehicles are doing impossible things. The jump buttons/boost don\'t work very well on my phone so it\'s impossible to do anything in the challenges.' ,

      'This is a great game but it has it\'s draw backs. Due to a glitch in the game I had some coins and trophies taken from me in a game that never loaded. The biggest issue with this game is there is no offline solo play. A solo or practice mode would be great to allow people to get a feel for the game and be able to make tweaks in certain scenarios when playing with others. Easily worth 5+ stars if some adjustments can be made. Very addictive, very fun and suspenseful, and a great time killer.',
       'I think that you should win the balls all so instead of just trophies!! You pay so much money to qualify for a tournament and you got to pay a 10,000 dollar entry fee and then 1000 ever hole!! The game is coming to how much you can spend instead of how good you are you shouldn\'t be able to enter a rookie tournament if you have over a thousand trophies!! Maybe it shouldn\'t cost so much to be able to get into the tournament!!! Besides if you spend a lot of money the people who can\'t spend as much!! I enjoy this game a lot I play it all the time I believe that it should be cheaper to qualify for the tournament!! And when you lose your game that you should loose the ball your playing with!! I really appreciate your time in listening to my opinion!! Hopefully this might make it a little more fair to the people who can\'t spend the money they would like!! Sincerely a Huge fan of the game!!! Thanks Joseph',
       'Awesome game. The only thing I don\'t care for is, why am I playing people that have 80 trophies but have played 2,000 games? I mean I\'m working with starter clubs and they are playing me with so much better clubs.. I just don\'t think that\'s very fare. And is there any other way possible to receive extra gems and coins or get extra clubs higher-ranking clubs? Thank you for your time and thank you for coming out with this game it is awesome',
       'I haven\'t been able to use the app since I updated the app a few days ago. So apparently they haven\'t worked out all the bugs.... it will load all the way to 100%, then it goes to a 2nd download screen and it only makes it to 50 %  before it stops downloading. So it was great up until that point',
       'Fun and entertaining game for sure. I wish there was more variety of courses, but I enjoy the competition in this a lot. They update frequently, and have very helpful customer service. One small change I\'d make, on shootouts, if it could show your distance from the pin next to your name or vice versa. I\'d like to see different clubs available for purchase as well.',
       'Really a great experience! The game play is awesome and very addicting. Only issue I have is when I finish in the weekly division standings I am not receiving my rewards. I just placed 3rd and was supposed to get a golden chest but I did not receive anything. That was a little disappointing after investing all that time, but still one of the best apps I have ever downloaded.' ,

      'This is by far the best chess "trainer" for me.  It\'s got a nice flow and the game isn\'t "stupid" like most other chess apps/games I\'ve played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I\'m making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.',
       'I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!',
       'I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn\'t show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.',
       'For the non experts, let me tell you that 5his game cheats. I sat with a real chessboard to analyse why wasn\'t I  able to crack master level.   And what i observed was it didn\'t allow you to make actual moves when you show high levels of intell8gence. Sometimes it makes moves which are faulty. I think there is some mistakes in coding, perhaps deliberately made.  So not a fair play but a foul play.',
       'So far it\'s o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It\'s not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game',
       'The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.' ,

      'Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn\'t hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv',
       'First of all It\'s joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add "Edit and changing names"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all üé±',
       'I realize y\'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don\'t pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I\'m pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It\'s a pretty good app and I\'ve sent many people to download your app.',
       'Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don\'t decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don\'t mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don\'t actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.',
       '8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don\'t win any games until those coins are over and I\'m only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don\'t know why this is happening but it sucks because it\'s putting me off the game.. it\'s like 8 ball is making sure I\'m losing hence the rate 3',
       'This is the most addictive game i have playing since a bought this phone. All the new updates are cool. Need to get rid of those hackers playin along. Also when we get a phonecall the game reopens, its better if you  reconnect it during the tier its self .. very plesent game give lots of happiness.. make sure you work with above mentioned glitches, then 5* is sure.' ,

      'Do NOT go for high level military research without searching monster hunting, and Do NOT go for T4 if you not going to spent thousands of dollars. Even if you don\'t mind to wait 200 days, you will not able to afford it (lvl 10 military Def, Atk, Health cost 100m gold each). DO NOT GO FOR HIGH MILITARY AND T4 WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE GAME.',
       'Ive been playing for the better part of a year, and this game started out great for a long while. But IGG not only panders and gives better deals to Chinese people, cheaper packs etc. But literally 99% of all mega guilds and players are Chinese or Vietnamese. If your not asain don\'t play this game  you\'ll end up like me playing forever just to quit because of the obvious discrimination IGG holds with its playerbase',
       'This game is fun but be prepared for the mother of all Pay2win games.  These folks at IGG are experts at crafting new and exciting ways at fleecing their customers of every cent they can.  You CANNOT compete if u dont pay and pay often.  Players here ...just regular people... dump hundreds of rl $$$ regularly.  You have been warned.',
       'Gameplay is good, not a lot to complain about. As far as purchasing via in-app, BE CAUTIOUS AS THEY HAVE LITTLE TO NO CARE ABOUT THE QUALITY OR THE QUANTITY OF THE SUPPLIES YOU PURCHASE FROM WHAT WAS ADVERTISED TO YOU. YOU WILL NOT SEE REIMBURSEMENT.',
       'The game is awesome and there is always something to do  so you\'re never stuck waiting around for powerups or new lives. Unlike other games it doesn\'t require microtransactions to get stronger, but they do help you quicker if you\'re interested in paying. I\'m addicted and play every day.',
       'Misleading sale information! ! Current Fortune Ticket sale is misleading and horribly overpriced.  "Give your guildmates 10 Fortune Tickets!" for $19.99 should give ALL guildmates 10 tickets EACH. Instead it gives 10 tickets TOTAL for the guild to fight over!! Since MOST of the guild is left out, how can I give them a Fortune ticket as stated?? There is a comparable  $4.99 offer that gives 50 Fortune chest, 2000 gems, and resources. Each Fortune ticket is equivalent to a Fortune chest.... DO THE MATH! ! I submitted the error to online help and was DENIED!' ,

      'My ONLY issue is we have a Pirate, Wizard, & knight "hat", but NO clothes to go with it. Can we PLEASE get those outfits made available?? I\'ve been playing for over 10 YEARS now (I believe) & it\'s been like this since DAY ONE. Also, I\'d LOVE more furniture options. It would be cool if we had a new set for each room for every 100 levels reached. 100, 200, 300, etc bc it\'d keep players having a goal to attain & it\'d make us thrive to achieve it!!! Besides keeping us interested, we LOVE a strong variety & set of options. It rewards us, if we have the ability to purchase it, & we play for reward. Just a thought that I hope you STRONGLY consider & follow through with.  I\'d give 5 stars across the board if these changes were made. THANK YOU!!!',
       'Okay heres the thing,every f game is with money and this game was so much better without those money,i was 1000 lvl and my tom is gone why? Cuz u didnt made that feature back in the days,also u made this stupid diamonds alll for money,and not coins like it was...its not all about money get it? This game was so popularbback in the days and now is trash with all those videos to watch all those money you need to spend on clothes for tom...its ridiculus...sry for my english im just disapointed cuz u turned this game in real money not coins where you can be able to buy everything by playing like i did....',
       'Used to play on another phone couldnt download to new one so had to start again. Game keeps freezing and sick of pop ups that wont go and i have to close game to get rid of them. Annoying',
       'Not good for little ones. Too many buttons leading ads or in app purchases. Might be good for kids 6+ who would know a little better but my 3 year old just clicks everything shiny which of course is ads or in app purchases',
       'The newest update is terrible with "to open chests". I must stop every game right after I got a key of four. Then, I can\'t play with my favorite, because Tom is sleeping. Also, it is very bad, the new chests opportunities starts not at midnight like before, but late afternoon (my friend\'s starts 11am) - ridiculous. I reached 99 - can I get back the old version? I don\'t care any firefighter cloth.',
       'What is wrong with this app,, I\'ve had it for over two years now and never had a problem, for the last few weeks it\'s freezing, closes and not to mention the fake virus that constantly pops up and won\'t go away no matter what I do, even though I have anti virus, I even uninstalled talking Tom (virus was gone too) I then reinstall a week later and even the virus came back with it. It\'s very upsetting since I loved this game????!' ,

      'The game itself is very well thought of, highly addictive and is a great time killer. Plus, there are almost no ads in this game. However, there are just too many animations.

      'Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!',
       'In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it\'s newer it\'s boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star',
       'No matter how hard I tried, I would end up crashing on my head.  Round would end, and it would ask if you wish too see an ad.  Expect that after every round. Even if you say no, it will do an ad break every 3 rounds.  I wanted to enjoy this game, but it was not challenging, and so many ads that I uninstalled it.',
       'Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can\'t just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can\'t advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it\'s basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.',
       'This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said "add break". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them.',
       'The game desparately needs to offer more coins as skill level increases.  The frequency of coins remains the same while the skill level demands more and more coins (in the thousands).  Watching ads helps, but the player finds themselves doing that exclusively, which defeats the purpose of the game.  Physics, graphics and gameplay are good.' ,

      'The car will control itself... If you hold left it will turn left for a period but will start to try and straighten up... To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed',
       'I have a one plus 5T with 8 GB ram still the game hangs at the finish line and all my progress is lost. I have to restart the game to get it going. Please fix this I can sent you the screenshot is you want. I love your game and it would be great if these small thing is fixed swiftly !',
       'Fix the detection when you touch/hit in perfect drift mode. There\'s been hundreds of times where ive definately not hit and yet it ends. So Infuriating, love the game but that one detail could definitely be optimized better. The drift should not end unless you actually hit and it screws up your direction. 4/5',
       'Game is really good. Best drift game I\'ve ever played on the phone. But there are small bugs in the game such as season 7 second perfect drift track (should be Turin) the race is not 3 laps. Even though I finish 3 laps it didn\'t finish the race and it gives the "wrong way" warning Everytime I pass from start/finish line. I hope you can fix this.',
       'I love this game and so do all my mates. It dose have a few light glitches as most games do. I would love a night track of some kind in the future but other wise great game all together. Also out of all the drifting games this is the best one at of all of them.',
       'I love this game! The cars are some of my favorites. There\'s only a couple things I would like to hopefully see in this game. First, if you could upgrade the cars more and you didn\'t have to use the cards. Like us money to upgrade engine parts, buy body kits, etc. And there\'s some kind of a sound glitch. The sound stays on for just a few races and then all of a sudden it stops working but I can still play the game.' ,

      'Very fun and time killing. I play with my bf and 2 friends and we all try to beat eachothers high scores. It can be pretty competitive. Im prob gonna try to get more ppl to play with me too lol. There could be more variety in the blocks, and there should be like different modes, just an idea',
       'Its cool and all but needs some extra features.  Maybe a way to store 1 brick for later or some level advancement.  Maybe challenges or a power up system. The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.',
       'What they show on the preview and what it gives you in game don\'t even match. They make it look like it so easy. You cannot rotate the pieces. The pieces they give are so random, and most games you can barely get past a couple of turns before you can\'t place anymore and you lose.',
       'This is very deceiving. It looks like it\'s Tetris, but it\'s not. The pieces don\'t come down like the pictures show. I hate apps like this who deceive people to believe its a certain game when it\'s not just to get people to download. Will never download a game from this developer again.',
       'I hated it. Just freezes my phone n have to buy a new one  for 4954  dollars. Its just stupid n u really need more tutorial. Make this game have more tutorials n stop this freezing part for a better game n have  a 5 star rating from me n not a 2 star rating. Do u want a 2 star rating or 5 star rating? Just to be clear, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME IF U ARE DUMB. Tksüòíüòíüòí',

      'Only given a 1 star so the devs hurry up and get the game working again or else it would be a 5 star. This is the best game on play store currently and square Enix have done a brilliant job. No complaints... No p2w... and the graphics if you set them to full are just phenomenal!!! Keep it up guys!! But fix the loading issue so we can get back to akademia!!',
       'Great game so far. Not sure if there is a community forum or something somewhere which would be nice. I had a character on some other server and it seemed to be erased when the new server opened? Its fine though, previous character did not have too much progression. Music is not the greatest though, would be good if you could include more classic FF music in the game.   Dailys seem a bit overwhelming. There are so many quests to complete each day to get all the chests.   Other than that im quite enjoying it. If you can\'t load the game after update clear data and dl again',
       'Support is incredibly slow, they will happily take your money and not let you have access to the items you payed for. Will update this review if they ever actually resolve my issue. It has been 5 days since I submitted a support issue with no useful responses made by them. Update: over 48 hours since last response still not any closer to having my issue resolved',
       'I was hooked up playing this game as you can still get stronger without spending. Unfortunately looks like something broke during the update and was stucked in the FF splash screen. Hoping that the devs are on top of this and release an official announcement to players.',
       'As usual don\'t waste your time on downloading this game if your network is slow. What a shame every single game on play store works like a charm except this. Developer of this game learn from the games like Transformers Earth Wars, Starfall, Phantom Chasers & many more and fix all your Square Enix games. Once i was a fan of final fantasy on play station but android version is disgusting when it comes to download resources to even start a game. This is so slow. ü§¢',
       'Characters repeat the same thing over and over and it gets really irritating. And now the game doesn\'t even start, i love the final fantasy franchise and you have a really great game, and i like that you have to interact with the game to stay alive and it\'s not just automatic bullcrap, please keep updating the game.' ,

      'I think this game is brilliant. An absolute pleasure to play and I never get bored. This game should be voted one of the best games ever. Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can\'t join my sister and were only five levels apart.',
       'It\'s fun because I  git to play with school friends, and the gaming is amazing so keep up the good work! But I hate the new update with levels to upgrade you wepons! On upgrade costs more than the gun! Not   every one in the game is rich you know!',
       'I really like it. It\'s fun and entertaining, a highly suggested game in my opinion. Although i would like it if the sandbox mini game had more maps, and more freedom to choose those maps as well. It would also be very appreciated if we could play games with lower leveled players because i really wanna play co-op games with my friend, but she just started the game and it says insufficient levels. It would also be nice if the options of private servers were back in sandbox and you could choose what teams you wanna join in team fight. But otherwise, it\'s really great and easy to play üòÑ',
       'I like this game, But there are TONS  of things wrong with it. It\'s impossible to win or kill people after you reach level 10. Everyone one hits you and you can\'t even Dent them. FIX THIS PLZ. FIX the matchmaking and make it easier to get things.  This game is honest garbage right now.',
       'This game is fun, fast paced. I love the option to customize characters. And all the little references in the weapons are astounding. I just have one MAJOR problem. There is no reset button. The importance of these is to explore different options of how you play the game. If I had a reset button, I\'d give it a full 5 stars. I want to re experience this game so I can feel the magic of when I first started. I was just a lvl 1 back then. Now I\'m lvl 27 and it\'s absolute hell having to deal with all the people with stronger guns. Oh and one last thing. You put me up against lvl 38 but when I try to join my lvl 35 friend, you say "improper lvl." That is just extremely dumb. Please fix that.',
       'This game is great! Even though you have to constantly farm for wins, but it does pay off. I\'m a level 12 in Ruby rank with üëå guns. I used to have a candy cane baton that killed instantly upon impact, but it\'s not as effective against gold armor. R. I. P. Strategy' ,

      'The bonus spin is wriged. It never stop on any prizes higher 500k. Also, The options to unlock the cards chests are limited.  The food and pet potions claims are not enough.. It takes too many spins and lost and raids to advance.. Need more rewards and more interactive games',
       'I am not getting shields...  Whats the problem..  Either it gave me just 1 shield in 50spins or no shield in 50spins...  I am stucked on 1farm i have completed many times the same constructions but as i dont have shields neithr i get them people come and attack on my field again and again. Please fix!!',
       'how awful. need to buy building upgrades. building upgrades do nothing. buildings do nothing. literally do nothing. how do you get money? spin a slot machine. Thats the only way. There is no actual game here. And what happens when you run out of spins and realize you still need millions more money to upgrade worthless buildings? give them real money. this game is so lazy it might as well be classified as a scam.',
       'Game requires you purchase junk to proceed. There comes a point where the casual gameplay is passed by the amount required to progress further; either watching hundreds of adds to collect enough coins to move on, or simply emptying your wallet. Good for a few levels, that is it.',
       'I love this game. But please increase the numbers of spins every hour. And I also have come across one more problem- I get notifications saying that I have won spins and coins but when I open the app there is nothing or no way to collect my reward. I don\'t know what to do?',
       'Worst game ever. Developers blocked my spin. I play almost 78 spins and didn\'t get a single shield. Worst game worst game. I am invited all my friends . Thy join and all i got is notification. I entered my email id almost 6 times for coins and spins and got nothing from them. Coin master developers u cheated me. Worst game ever.' ,

      'Enjoyable game. Don\'t have to spend money on diamonds unless you\'re after a top look. Best played when linked to FB which means you can borrow from friends\' closets. Would rate 5 stars but recently I am having issues opening results in my in box. Every time I receive a result the page opens halfway then I have to exit the game and reload. Playing on an Asus ZenPad, anyone having the same issue or have a solution pls?',
       'I have been playing Covet for 4 yrs every single day! Being in the fashion industry I find it so interesting that the products you dress your models in are real items you can buy in real life. They have a great collection of brands but Im excited to see more.   And contrary to popular belief you dont have to spend a dime to play. My strategy for this is I play the daily challenge with either past seasonal clothes or i borrow from my fashion house. If your vision and outfit is great you will win the free item regardless of whether it is in season or not. By doing this you save $500 a day and i wait till a covet series comes along and play it till my heart and imagination is content.   Take it from a Covet junkie, you will be hooked for years!',
       'In the beginning, I absolutely loved this game, but now, I do admit that it get\'s a bit boring and frustrating after a while because getting cash and diamonds without paying real money is incredibly difficult and time consuming. I do like that they fixed the reaction time for voting because it used to be sooo slow. But overall, I highly recommend this game for any kind of fashion lover who is willing to have the patience to play it.',
       'Im simply addicted to the game and i usually play like 5 times a day and i would\'ve happily gave it a 5 stars if i could vote. I ALWAYS get the error message "there was a problem communicating with the network". I contacted the support team several times but its useless so until i can vote normally i wont be satisfied',
       'Fun, some technical glitches, and loading issues but that\'s what is expected of such a large game. It\'s fun and entertaining, recommend to everyone:) oh but I wish you could add friends individually I don\'t like that they have to be Facebook friends',
       'I really like this game, but it does end up costing a lot of real money if you want to make progress. And it can make you feel bad if you are voted poorly and lose points all the time.' ,

      'Yes this is addictive, yes it\'s fun, and it\'s great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don\'t have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it\'s not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it\'s clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.',
       'Way way WAYYY too laggy. It\'s an easy casual game though. I wouldn\'t say it\'s "fun" but it does pass the time and make you want to achieve the little goals. Only goal, make more money in game. That\'s it and you achieve that by not even playing the game so there\'s no challenge whatsoever. Uninstalled after first day reaching about 500 Trillion and force closing 100 times.',
       'This game is enjoyable, but like many have said, it drains battery life. Moreover, it hangs too long when switching planets. I suspect, like many areas of technology, performance testing new updates with older devices is not even a consideration. If it runs smooth on the latest and greatest then it is ready to ship.  Like many mobile games this is a casino. It\'s main existence is to make money. I do not have a problem with this so much, but the events give rewards based on leaderboards. Unfortunately, they are pay to win. You are bombarded with options to pay cash. Making the top charts without spending money is not likely to happen.  This game is a time and battery killer, so keep you charger close by.',
       'This game is awesome, my tablet lags a lot, but besides that, this is one of the best games in the world! The creaters should add a new planet on Jupiter for 100 decillion and the first thing you start with is a gravity proection! That would be a neat idea, but this is an awesome game! :D',
       'this is a scam! don\'t buy or do the free gold. they have denied my last 3 completed requirements for free gold.  Google Play will be hearing about this by filing a complaint against this game, it\'s advertisers, and anyone else involved! DO NOT DO FREE GOLD',
       'You should be connected to facebook. So when people change from iPhone to android, we can keep our levels. I just had to restart again and I had 6800 lemons and not much longer to complete the game. What an accomplishment I\'m going to try to receive this time' ,

      'This is an awesome game that gives you daily and weekly quest\'s and offers treasure chests. Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven\'t tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.',
       'Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a "slide," I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don\'t compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.',
       'Nice, good, adventure game.but some times your team irritating who one completed thirteen level they will easily get diamond  your giving master challenge ( now the challenge Chinese New year )who one complete your giving thirty diamond only.this offer will useful only for entry level gamers. Most of players finished fourteen level so they no need diamonds.so think about genius players.',
       'I love all the graphics it\'s a bit like the        piano tiles it test\'s your fast skills but except it is temple run 2 love it. Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.',
       'I love this game, very addicting. And I love that it has the daily, weekly and global challenges. As well as objectives and the daily chest challenges. Lots of things to work for and win. Makes the game more fun. Plus, so far, I haven\'t come across anything that I\'ve had to spend money on in order to advance in the game',
       'The game while I understand is a time killer, and is not meant to be the same as a mmopg, has a repedetive vibe after a while. All the challenges are the same, and the cups they have never seem to present anything new. The game does the same repetitive challenge especially when they are for holiday hats or valentine hat, the game is dying for lack of innovation and needs new life for lack of innovation and creativity to switch it up, there have been numerous running games out there since its creation, Subway surfer, and many other games.  This had that same old, same old, vibe.' ,

      'I never had to pay a single cent for this game, and it\'s working out perfectly fine for me. Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don\'t like my non-responsive faction members and I\'m worried once I leave my faction I couldn\'t join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.',
       'Game is really good! Currently level 10 & I am doing pretty good. (For what I think) It\'s a fun game to play you can get free coins which makes it more fun and fair for players that can\'t pay for anything, except patience. I do wish it\'ll be easier to level up characters. But it\'s pretty easy. Just so difficult to get more characters to pay for level ups.',
       'This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn\'t make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!',
       'Company is a joke. Never play their games. Dont not install this game unless you expect to spend alot of money to even try to be competitive. There is massive amount  of hacking and cheating and support as no ability to help at all. I would never recommend this game to anyone. The cons far out weigh the pros. Scopley does not care about gameplay or its players at all.',
       'No one from the support team will respond. My game was unistalled and reinstall and I lost 2 years worth of data. Can\'t remember sync it and I know scopely can do it for me. I\'ve provided everything they need and still nothing via email or in-game support. Will change my rating if this is sorted',
       'I can\'t get passed the opening narration page. Therefore, I can\'t even play! The "skip" button doesn\'t work! The "next" button doesn\'t work either! I\'d have given 0 stars if possible. I won\'t change my review until after the issue is solved. I\'m using the most recent update for Android and Google play.' ,

      'I played Game of War for appx 3 years.  The game started out great, everyone was on a somewhat even playing field. The game advanced to quick and left thousands of players behind. Other Players and I felt we could never keep up.  I hope this game advances at much more slower rate.  We all spend money to enjoy the game!    Don\'t be gready like GOW.  Thank you in advance.  Kirk',
       'Overall great game, however to play and be competitive ait is important to spend. In fact just to unlock some features you must spend at least .99 which is fine by me since I love to spend on this game anyways. I have been playing koa from the start and when this game came out I jumped on the bandwagon in the first 50 kingdom servers. So with that said yes it is LOTS of fun, I love my GoG family and definitely addicting LOL see you on the burning war field ;)',
       'It is a fun game and is the most indepth game I\'ve ever played. That all being said, unless you have a ton of money and a lot of time there is no way this game is worth it. I\'ve spend over $100 and play multiple times per day and I still find it hard to level up my estate. Even in an alliance unless they\'re all very high level it isn\'t much help. I\'m sure they\'re are much better games in this genre then Guns of Glory. To me it seems like a game for wealthy people and made by a company to just make money.',
       'What a great game!  Need to have introductory levels for newcomers, though.  You build your kingdom up and larger kingdom\'s just rush in and destroy you.  When you recover, they come right back.  Level into the attack mode, so people will enjoy the game more.  I am uninstalling after 6 weeks of running an Alliance, because it\'s just not worth the trouble.  Great concept, fantastic graphics!',
       'Love this game! Very entertaining, never boring. My only complaint is with some of the collecting events. You have to do certain things to obtain the necessary items to put together, but for some reason with the current one you don\'t get enough of one item, and too much of another. It would be great if you could trade within your alliance for things like this.',
       'Hey good game. Having played this type of game for almost 2 years, I\'m very happy with the rollout of this game. I only wish that the in game translator was better. So many wars start because you can\'t translate Russian, Chinese and most middle eastern dialects. Those wars often result in people quitting the game. All around, a very fun game. Even if you don\'t spend money!!' ,

      'This is the best game in the world. srsly if this was the only game on my ipad then i will be happy. As soon as you get onto the game you just cant put it down. The only down side is that the spins cost alot of coins and those coins can be hard to earn. So 4.5 stars i would rate it is that was a option but its not so i rate it a a big fat 5',
       'this game is the bomb. it is stupid that they asked you is this game beautiful, of course not, people die, and crack their necks, backs, and shoulder blades. This game all in all soooooooo fun and you should totally get it. just say no if you want to write a reaport on this game because it will ask you is this game is beautiful which it is not. GOOD LUCK, good  night, new york city. at late night talk show with stephen colebert......jk',
       'Would rate give starts, but the amount of ads is absolutely ridiculous. I\'m actually thinking about uninstalling please fix that. I know you want players to pay but in all actuality, it\'s quite stupid. Anyway, I do believe the game is quite fun',
       'Whatever they did last update broke the game for me, this is why I never buy anything in these games. No way to contact anyone to resolve any problems.  Game gets boring anyway',
       'Its a good game however there isnt a very clear plot to the game therefore it doesnt hook the player. Others may argue thaat the game is just meant to be  a bit of fun and there isnt supposed to be a clear storyline however to me i feel like its a bit boring. Anyway its a good game i would recomend it to my friends',
       'I love this game a lot. The only problem is that when you do the Dailey spin, you only get like coins. And then with the coins you can buy another spin which is what I do. And I get even more coins. It\'s really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and' ,

      'I like the games but.. I would rather go to a real casino if i wanna spend and win REAL money, so buying coins with REAL money just for innocent playtime is a Big turn off for me. You lose coins fast like the real slots, unfortunately. I just start playing the game for the first time and I\'m already out of coins. I believe they start you off with a low amount because I\'m already out of coins in 30mins of play. The games and the graphics are fun though, which makes it attractive to play. My only complaint is paying for those coins..',
       'Fantastic game! Best one in Google play store! Where else would semi- intelligent dogs pay real $$ with t he chance of winning 0 in real cash back, only for the fun of it! Brilliant! That being said, Ill keep on playing!Only slot game I never get tired of playing! Games are very realistic, and the graphics are great! Be careful though, able to go through a lot of money quickly because the games are so addicting!',
       'Have had this app for several months and almost always have fun and the support team do their job fabulously. "UPDATE:"  May 2017, It has now been over a year I\'m still spinning, having fun. It is now mid July 2017 and I\'m still having fun and give it 6 stars but it will only let me do 5! "Update:" We\'re now into mid November and I\'m still happy and still spinning! I am now into February 18, still knocking them dead. Fabulous Fun! Come join in.',
       'I would give it a 4.5 but can\'t. It is very addictive I just wish the login bonuses were better. And when you spin the wheel don\'t get too excited. Very rarely do you get more than $2500. But I gotta say it\'s my favorite slot game. You should bring back that Tiki Slot. That was fun. I\'m really in to the Tigers slot machine now.',
       'I love this Game App! My hubby was giving me the hardest time when I first started playing it...and now he is hooked just like me! I had the best time playing the different games that Are usually locked during the Thanksgiving holiday when all games open. Only complaint would be it takes too long to open unlock games ... People would buy more coins if more games to play we\'re available instead of spending coins trying to unlock games.  I personally spent more cash on coins during the all games open.',
       'This continues to improve.The original variety was fun, but each new game just seems to get better.  The graphics were always good, but the new ones are truly impressive, and fun.  The way they are combining multiple features of earlier games offers more play options and payoffs.  Almost impossible to put down. Bad luck suddenly reverses and is FUN!' ,

      'Best Drag racing game in Google play store. If you have a addictive personality don\'t play it. I do suffer from that first race was on Dec 312017 as of Feb 22, 2018 I have 208 hrs on the track 23 in the garage own 22 cars and spent over a Benjamin on it in less than a month. Ya gotta have some smarts to play and win. Money helps with extras. Only time I\'ve had a issue with it was this morning a season ended I was upgrading a Tier 5 car and paid with game money and didn\'t receive part. Still a 10 star game... Great job Developers!!',
       'Game is really great! Amazing graphics, amazing cars, lots of continuous fun! A few bugs and connection issues which can be frustrating at times especially when your team depends on you for points. Though I believe they\'ll eventually fix these issues as this is the BEST racing game out there and it\'s only getting BETTER!',
       'Love the new updates where you can carry on the trials without having to go back to the garage. It would be nice to able to trade up your keys i.e 500 bronze for 10 silver or 100 silver for 1 gold. And the stage 6 upgrades be not double up or get stage 6 upgrades relevant to the cars you have.',
       'Customer support has won me over. They have literally provided the best resolution can think of for the game removing all my fusion parts. Hopefully I don\'t have many issues in the future but this one time moment has definitely filled me with confidence that in future, zynga will fairly sort things out.',
       'IT\'S BROKEN It won\'t load up rare imports screen and when I tap on the rare imports button it doesn\'t do anything even when it tells me to go onto rare imports screen please fix this as I can\'t play otherwise. EDIT: as soon as I downloaded it on my phone though it has worked perfectly fine so now I am tons happier.',
       'Prepare to have your pockets emptied with very little support if anything goes wrong and trust me it will. From losing fusion parts to losing your account and connection issues that have been present for the last few months. Don\'t worry though you will get bombarded with cars that cost a small fortune from events and a new special offer every now and then tempting you to pay more money. If anything ateast the devs are consistent and are very good at taking your money off you but putting in as little effort to fix things as possible' ,

       'After I posted my recent comment, there were some angry comments pointed out at me. I apologise for that. I mean, this game in great! There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars. For someone who says "too many notifications", go to the settings and turn off that notifications button. Thank you for those hate critics you guys made. It really teached me a lesson.',

      'Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don\'t like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option',
       'It\'s fun. It\'s actually more informative that I thought it would be. It kind of opens up you mind and is an amazing pass time stimulate. However I feel it would be more beneficial in and educational sense if you had more of an opportunity to review the answer list through the app. It\'s actually something I look forward to when the round is over.  So you\'re not just learning something from what you and your challenger have contributed as far as answers, but the game itself has also done it\'s part. Other than that, totally awesome.',
       'Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it\'s good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can\'t take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren\'t recognised either. I\'d enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.',

       'This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!',
       'Great game. Really fun buy id love to be able to play without having to wait for someone to challenge me or vice versa. A single player option would be fun. Also i payed 3.69$ to have no ads but i sometimes still grt the very long ad videos which i find a little annoying since i payed for no ads... But other then that great game üòä' ,

      'Dear Pretty Simple,      I am a Criminal Case player, and I love this game! This was really enjoyable, great and fun! I hope their will be a 5th criminal case, and it will be named CRIMINAL CASE: ANIMAL PET INVESTIGATION .... Please... And the killer will be predator, and the victim would be pray, and all the officers, deputies, the doctors, and the other investigators will be all Animal pets.... Please... This is only my request and suggestion.. I hope you will read this... And i hope that my suggestion will be realize or to become true.. Because criminal case was very good and fun... I hope you understand me cuz i am only a 13 year old kid and I love animals so much... Thank you... I hope you can read my letter...üòäüòäüòäüòçüòç  Sincerely yours, A player of Criminal Case',
       'This is all I needed: another Criminal Case game to take up my free time! I love the whole four of them. The the hidden objects tease my brain to no end. Each game  is intriguing with an original story line. I do have my favorite crime scenes,  and plenty of friends(all over the world) whom play as often as they can too!',
       'It would be nice if you level up and get full energy but your energy had some if not all left before you got it restored that you just increased by the full amount, the way it is now I lose energy when levelling up because it doesnt add any more to the 110 that is standard. I dont think it is fair to those of us who play daily. I never know when my pet will find that last batch of XP and cause the level up to happen. If I am over the 110 already, I don\'t even see the new energy. Some concessions need to be made for this. I love the game though, it is fun and challenging.',
       'DONT BOTHER WITH THIS GAME Played for 10 minutes before I ran out of energy, which you need to earn stars to progress! Then have to wait ages for it to recharge.  OR......pay to top it up. Don\'t think so. UNINSTALL IMMINENT',
       'I love this game. I have all of the criminal case games & love them all. The only things that I don\'t like is that when when ur energy gets refilled, it only adds to what u have, instead of adding an extra 110 to what u have. The other thing is that u can\'t buy none of the hamburgers, orange juice, chips or anything with ur tokens',
       '4th instalment of the Criminal Case games. I love playing them all excellent time wasters intriguing story lines. I\'m well & truly hooked on the whole series. Gainsborough, Pacific Bay, Save The World & now this Mysteries Of The Past........ all brilliant' ,

At random times the game just cuts off, sometimes when you are loading up the game it say ooops something went wrong write an email, Evan some of the videos freeze up or just shuts everything down. I would be happy if I could play the game without any problems at all. Thank you for your time and patients. Have a good day.',
       'Really great game but gets boring over time. I\'ve been playing for awhile and I just keep doing the same s*** everyday. Please add more content, I really can\'t tell what the game is lacking exactly but its just plain boring after a period of time. Maybe add clans or we should call it "club" for this game so we can socialize with others.',
       'Deleted, because on daily special thing it says so many hours left until I can do next daily thing, however I got a notification saying I got 2 hours to complete daily thing or I go back to day one. And what happened? It went back to day one. Truly and utterly miffed!!!',
       'This game is addicting actually, but your server is su*ks, I\'ve lost so many money when open it, said no internet connection too often, even when I on wifi. Please fix connection problem, I think there is a problem between your application and your server. And this game is using high resources on my phone, heating problem.',
       'The graphics are kwl but the game can get slightly boring. I leave my game for about an hour and then I come back with loads of money to spend. Then I leave my phone in my room for 3 hours and so on. I just wish there was more to the game than buying sports shoes.',

      'Good graphics but the character movements are clunky.  I\'m a hardcore FPS gamer and I like to test the limitations of a game.  So tried shooting a shoulder and the bullet went for a headshot instead whereas I clearly know my aim would miss. Glitchy.  Clunky and not so realistic unfortunately.  So not sure why the high ratings.',
       'Still full of annoying bugs. The worst game I ever played. Earnings are exactly layed out so that you can\'t level up as you should and in a way that you should spend a lot of money... üëé Graphic & other bugs, really not fluid etc. üëé Full of annoying ads üëé Some can shoot through walls; but you can\'t. Some can see you behind walls, but you can\'t. Starting pvp, you get placed on the map with the back to the others. Your oponents have 10x stronger weapons... Fairplay üëé Nothing is balanced fairly in pvp üëé',
       'The latest version is so annoying. On the sniper arena, my men get killed immidiatly at the end of the countdown to begin. If i even shoot any sniper he wont die rather it will finish it shoutout and then turn to my soldier and kill it. I hate now i hate d game. Please do something about it.',
       'This was a fun game at first until I got to a mission that is impossible to complete. I have the Target directly in my crosshairs and my shots go right through him. The hint only tells me he\'s too far away but he never gets closer. Also the price for premium is ridiculous. Uninstalling.',
       'Yeah man cool game, however we must ask ourselves if weed is a gateway drug maybe shooting games are a gateway to more sinister things but no one give a hoot about it hahahaha I like playing games. Hi, 5 stars. Food next 2',
       'Is game could be so much more than it is! After a few weeks, PVP becomes a joke when you are up against paying users who have one shot kill guns and a barrage of armour.  Then single player is just rinse and repeat over and over again.' ,

I hope my tears will help u guys. :)',
       'Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it\'s just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............',
       'For this game to be so simple compared to todays games and grafics, I love it. I spend hours sometimes playing this.  Not to mention they keep upgrading and making it beter and better, keep it up fellas....i havent experienced any of the problems mentioned withthe updates others have but until then great game',
       'Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!',
       'At first I wasn\'t sure how good the game was but after playing it several times on Android and Windows 8.1 phone, I like it.  It doesn\'t weigh down on the phone\'s processing power. A very addictive game!! Give it go.',
       'I love it and I\'m addicted to playing it.   I like the fact that you can earn points if you don\'t want to buy them.  It would be great if tilting the phone had an impact.  don\'t change much though, its a great game:)' ,

      'Fun, graphics are nice. Free money goes quickly and some of the games bonuses and free spins some have decent ones but infrequent.. They want you to spend real money like most online slots but if you don\'t play for a couple days and just collect the daily free coins you can play for a little while every few days. Unfortunately there isn\'t a lot of opportunity to get free coins. The wins don\'t out weigh the losses but that is usually like it is in real casinos so  at least you don\'t lose real money :) If your patient and don\'t continue to buy the "sale" packages but rather build up the free daily spins.  I just play other slot games  until the free coins build up a little on this one so I can play for awhile. I do like the game though, lots of game choices .',
       'What a waste of time, had free spins twice but i  all the time never once did I get 6 HEARTS. HOW MEAN CAN YOU BE.If you buy coi s good luck all they want you to do is BUY BUY BUY. Once again why did I bother.  THIS IS THE WORST SITE EVER',
       'I was playing a tournament u have going for Valentine\'s day. I get to a game where I have 65 million and I won over the 20 million that was a quest. I lost over 100 million trying to get a free game quest. If I want this kind of feeling I can go to a real casino and drop real money there and get the same result.',
       'Agree with other reviews...all they want is you to BUY BUY BUY!! I won $14 BILLION on a jackpot...that\'s HUGE! And yet, no matter what I played, tried small and large bets, I LOST EVERYTHING in a matter of hours!!! That\'s how ridiculous it is! Also contacted support about a glitch and they NEVER fixed it...it just rips you off on free games. Great games...just a total waste of time.',
       'The Most "Indecent"Slot apps  on Google Play. Non stop popup ads..Spin once..lose 60%  Close 3 popups. Spin, win 10% Close 3-4 popups. Contact them? Sure..If you want to give them your Paypal login info..Stay away',
       'I\'m uninstalling due to excessive notifications.  While listening to one song on YouTube, I got 6 notifications each one chiming over my music. No thank you!  Ridiculous' ,

      'Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn\'t really feel like you\'re getting anywhere.',
       'I really enjoy playing this game but it takes far too long to progress. Gems are way too far and few between to enable you to \'buy\' better vehicles to defeat the boss. Then you have to also use more gems to get weapons! If you don\'t spend money it takes a long time to get anywhere. If there were more gems available this game would be a 5 star game.',
       'Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it\'s only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that\'s bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it\'s a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I\'ll rate 5 star$',
       'For as repetitive as it is I can\'t seem to put it down, it\'s seriously addictive. Maybe it\'s the great graphics or the fact it reminds me of one of my old favs arcade game  Spyhunter. A few small things I would fix are; needs a running diamond total during race to see how many you\'ve picked up. A better garage showing a side angle of your car so you can see the paint jobs and rims better and the most needed item is when you click on your profile pick there NEEDS to be a experience total! Just having the circle showing your experience isn\'t enough, I\'d like an actual number total. Also another mode to think about is maybe a side scrolling mode or overhead track mode like Grand Prix 2. All in all great graphics, music and replayability!',
       'Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me',
       'Starts out fun but then you need to spend serious cash to upgrade . Takes for to refuel and a ton of gems to upgrade vehicle. Game is getting slow and old. Also stuck on Zoom mode on Galaxy 8 plus. It\'s impossible to play!' ,

      'I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn\'t have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn\'t get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren\'t vigilant of their customers and don\'t take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.',
       'Great game with a lot of potential.... There can be so many more additions to make this fps better. More grenade varieties? A spectator mode? Clan levels that allow more players to join when we reacher higher levels? Gun balancing changes? I feel like the Cerberus should be buffed. It is expensive, and the 3 shots at once doesn\'t allow for many attempts for kills. Adventure mode for more gunbucks? Death match option? Allowing us to pick the map? I understand the game is fairly new, so keep on adding changes and new improvements. Thanks for listening!',
       'I REALY LOVE this game but the only thing is that I\'m on level 10 and when ever I play in a battle and win I only get 200 gun bucks. PLZ can I have money transported to my account.My name is PRO_ADMIN.I would REALY HAPPY if you doüòï.By the way this is also for my FAMILY and they would love it if you do ):  . I am only 10 and I know I\'m asking for you to do a big thing but my family would really be happyüòä.My brother\'s acount is PROGAMER and he is only 6. PLZ if you don\'t reply or do something then it\'s ok ):  .',
       'Game is really tooo gud, graphics also nice n smooth controls but u guys released only one game mode(Team death match), but in lot of fps games they provided free for all, bomb mode, Flag capture n many more modes.. If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games üòÄ n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area.',
       'Very well made game! One of the very few game\'s that will remain on my phone. It\'s brilliant fun. It\'s got a great feel to it. The maps are so colourful and well designed. My only gripe is the weapon system... Some players obviously spend a fortune on this game and so their guns just wipe the floor with you. Good game though.',
       'The best shooting game ever. Lobed each and every single thing about this game but there a little suggestion that we can see the player if they are online or not but how is this if we can see there live going on matches? That concept will be great and games lag sometimes so if you can fix this and add my suggestion in guns of boom that will be hell great!! #the best game' ,

      'I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I\'ve decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I\'ve upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!',
       'Really fun and addicting! The first time i saw this app was when my dad told me about this game, he said that it was very good. Literally the first 10 minutes i played this game my mind was blown and i beacame addicted. Around 2 years later(now) i found this game again and instantly installed it. I love this game and I have played it for a long time. The graphics and music are amazing. This a really good game and you should install it! Who could think that glass could be so fun. However I think this game would be better if some of the thing you have to pay for would be for free.',
       'So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn\'t save where I\'m at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won\'t be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!',
       'It\'s very addictive, one thing I am pod about is that right from the get-go they\'re trying to get you to pay for it . It would have been nice if they didn\'t try to sell the premium version so quick. If anybody could have tried any other levels without being intimidated to pay for premium maybe I would have been sold to buy a premium. As of right now I\'m okay with playing classic. Maybe I\'ll think about premium ..',
       'Challenging but fun The first time I played this I was like "This is easy" But now I\'m at level 8 and I can\'t beat it! I bought the full version so I can start at any checkpoint I want. I always start at the highest checkpoint I can choose, but for level 8 I died with 2 balls left...at least there are 2 perimids right at the beginning but there SO hard to get! This game is very challenging and yes sometimes it makes me want to throw my phone across the room, but it is still very fun, and highly recommend',
       'Outstanding and highly recommended Beautiful graphics, great concept. Very fun game to play it\'s a casual game. Super addicting but not like with other games where you want to play but are still bored. It will entertain you time and time again. One of the best mobile games I\'ve ever played, no doubt. It\'s not required but if you enjoy it a lot you might want to spend the 2 bucks on the "premium" which allows you to continue from check points among other things. There are no annoying ads even in the free edition which is a huge plus.' ,

      'The heroes should be for all players from the lower level. They can make their own choice to choose the hero or switch them. If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy? It\'s the strategy game, not for only the big or strong players. Thanks!!...',
       'It is a good family game and it is a way to play with lots of friends and even make some new friends in your clan. It does not take lots of money to complete they game it only takes skill and dedication. I have played this game for years and have had many different accounts on it, but you just have to dedicate your self to one on those accounts to get a good high level account',
       'Coc is on the first place in my games list. It is very addictive and enjoyable. I am looking forward till the day town hall 12 comes. I am not much happy with SUPERCELL ID thing. Because it is not much easy to use. I recommend using the normal GOOGLE PLAY sign in method because it is much more appropriate for me. Overall COC have become my life. I also recoomend to have a time limit for coc, like coc automatically switch off if the user plays coc more than 1 hour. Long Live COC!',
       'Its an awesome game. The new concept of supercell id is cool but switching is little time taking. I Would request you guys to make it easier or add some shortcut to switch accounts. Because it is really difficult to change if you are in poor network zone. Plz consider this. Otherwise the concept is really good it saves RAM of phone as u dnt need play games and services updated. üòÄ',
       'Awesome strategic game, love it. But I have one request to Clash of clans creators that pls update clan castle of coc village that there would be an option that how much treasury do you want to Transfer to your storage. I think all coc players would be love this option and it would be great idea because you can transfer required amount of treasury to your storage and the rest of it will remains safe in clan Castel. If you like this idea and will work on it then pls reply me. I would be thankful to all Coc creators if that happens.. üòä',
       'NICE GAME, NICE GRAPHICS,NICE GAMEPLAY.. Been Playing Since 2015 and I See A Lot Of Changes..  I Wish new content would Be Added More Frequently and I HOPE The Village must Have Village Houses! Cause A Village Is Not A Village Wihout Houses SUPERCELL. There should be houses that has different colors and traits, some which raises stats of barbs and valks, or reduces time to produce troops and spells like in Builder Base,there should be houses which raises defense or offense and houses which reduces building production. This May Give Clash Of Clans A New Spark and Would Be More Strategic than usual. Thanks For Reading Devs Godbless.' ,

      'This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don\'t worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you\'ll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!',
       'This game is honestly a great time-killer and even has it\'s challenging parts, but from what I\'ve noticed as you get to the higher tier songs they just get slower and slower and are just flat with barely any challenge. I expected more of a challenge with a higher level but now this game is getting horribly boring.',
       'Great game. Played to level 120 and have over 500 gems but then I switched devices. This requires a Facebook account which I did not have. It worked for a little bit until Facebook disabled my account for doing nothing. They need to fix the method they use to sync progress. Now I am level 3 with 17 gems.',
       'I\'m in love with this game. It\'s challenging, you don\'t have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks.',
       'I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who\'s better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn\'t seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don\'t think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.',
       'This game has no WORLD\'S favourite song  DESPACITO  SO i m hating it tooooo much  when i see this then i think that let\'s download it bcoz it contains despacito song also but when i see all album of this app then i started hated it. So i would request from CHEETAH GAMES that plezz add DESPACITO SONG also in it This is my humble request from CHEETAH GAMES.' ,

      'A lot of the male characters don\'t show up when I\'m playing. The dialogue and speech box will still be there but I can\'t see any of the male characters, and this only happens with the male characters. I have tried all that I can to make it work, but it won\'t and I have to go through the stories without them being there most of the time. Please fix this for me and I will change my rating, and please allow to create a story in Limelight for mobile, I really wanna make my story but all I have is my phone and I LOVE the Limelight versions.',
       'I never EVER been so absolutely in love with a app. I only read about 3 stories and spent $82 for gems and tickets because not only I couldn\'t resist it\'s the least I could do for the creaters for creating such a perfect game that seriously was meant for me in every way possible! (And I NEVER spent money on ANY apps so THAT is how much I LOVE this!) This brings me endless amounts of happiness! It\'s EVERYTHING a story lover could love! üòçüíì AND THERE IS NO ISSUE AT ALL ABSOLUTELY NONE! And I am so not lying when I say NO ISSUE! üòÅ 100/10 game! My only wish is I\'d love for another way to earn gems.',
       'Game is fun. Dont even mind spending money in gens every now and again. But seriously to get the outcome you want, this app is charging waaaaaaay too many gems. Like 50 for one simple choice. And its goes up higher depending on the amount of gems you have. If I pay $5.99 for like 60 gems.. that should get me through and entire story. Not just one chapter. Will delete app if they dont change it. Not gonna spend $40 to finish a story.. Sorry but I think thats outrageous.',
       'This game is really fun! I wish there was a way to restart a story that you are in the middle of or that you could change your appearance or other people\'s appearence at any time. Also when you decide what your character is wearing, sometimes you can\'t see it because dialog is in the way. Also when you choose what you look like. I would prefer it to be against a white background. It\'s hard to see what the darker colors look like.',
       'I love this app so much. I love all of the stories ive read  and am reading. The only problem is that although they\'ve added more chances of earning gems they Only give us 2 passes now every 4 hrs. That way to much time to wait for only two passes. Before the update they gave 4 passes every 4 hrs. I think that was better coz u got mire passes with that amount of time  11',
       'I dislike some parts of this game. one part I really dislike I\'d how you have to use dimonds to get the good answer. I never have enough dimonds to get it and my parents won\'t let me pay money to get dimonds. I would really appreciate it if you didn\'t have to pay money. Something that would be really fun is if you had to play mini games to earn dimonds,and then you would have a good story and live happily ever after.' ,

      'Got to the moon in 2 tries,  mars took longer, though it was mars one way, Venus was a challenge. Now I want more, haha, fun game. Encourages innovation. Idea: with persistent modules already in the game, why not allow orbital modules like a space station? Or missions where you need to put a satellite into orbit. How about reusable rocket stages? Updates just make the game better.',
       'I am so addicted to this game. I love everything about it. I just wish there was a place to donate to you (developer). Also, I would love it if there were more rocket parts. Also, I wish there was a thermosphere you had to get through to get on planets. All in all, I love it! Can\'t get enough!  Edit: Thank you so much for the reply. I\'m sorry I wasn\'t clear on the thermosphere part, but i think the reentry effect would be lovely. I just can\'t stop playing. And I\'m SOOOO excited about rovers and things! Thank you so much again! :)',
       'Bee looking for a game like for my entire years ! this is the best rocket game, I have ever seen in my life travelling to space , I like the sound system , formation of building materials is compatible ,graphics are excellent to the 2D platform . I like the physics of the game. Please keep it , ur the best Space programmer of all times (GOAT). Is it possible to add a space shuttle and moon rover ?    Regards. Please fix up batrrey issues . my phone heats up a lot .',
       'Trajectory in orbit I really love this game you made. It would be cool if you could make the rocket face the direction of it\'s trajectory during orbit. Edit: Can you add re-entry effects when going to other planets? It would be more realistic. Also add heat shields for re entry situations. And when is docking gonna come? Hopefully in the next update.',
       'I truly enjoy this game. There is a learning curve at the beginning if you\'re going to have a successful mission. However, soon enough you\'ll be traveling the Stars. This game is challenging enough to keep you interested. You are solely in control of all of your missions, which I like because I don\'t feel like I\'m forced to jump through hoops to get to the next level. Very well designed. Now for the real reason why I\'m sending this review... Designers, please move the engine ignition button away from the acceleration bar. Too many accidental engine ignitions while trying to adjust engine power.',
       'Awesome work with this new updates.  I have an idea. Maybe you\'ve already thought of it.  Multiple engines under the same fuel tank.  For instance, I\'m trying to reenact the Falcon Heavy, but because you can only put one engine under each fuel tank, I had to put several boosters to reach the required thrust/weight ratio.  If we could put multiple engines under a single fuel tank, I wouldn\'t need more boosters.  Maybe, something for the future.' ,

      'Big fan of Beyblade since I was a kid, from the first generation. So this is cool to play this game and see how far its came. Though there are many glitches in the game, this is the second time I\'m gonna have to download because it won\'t open. Overall, it\'s a fun game when it\'s not glitching',
       'Garbage game,is now infinitely looping on a challenge tournament. Once I defeat the first opponent the screen goes black and the game freezes. Reopening the game puts me back in the same match and ends in the same endless loop.   Dev team needs to fired and a patrol of lemurs hired instead because they\'d at least be entertaining.',
       'Everything is great but it can there be like a story mode cause just battling that is kind of boring. Still I think that the app is great, still could use a story mode where u can customize your own cherareter',
       'You really don\'t do anything but press orbs and press to buttons. Plus, just to get cool stuff, you need to go out and buy only beyblade bursts. The game is boring and confusing.',
       'Thanks sooo much Hasbro u added dragoon and everything awesome app love it, but could you add a ring out finish. I know u can don\'t keep it up',
       'This game is beautiful  but hear me out add human avatars so that you can see them launching that will be cool  and add nightmare shelter regulus  arc bahamut  andddd  of course strike god  valkyrie' ,

      'Great game. The games are more fun than Candy crush and much more fair. For example, they let you make moves you can\'t play in Candy crush and timed rounds don\'t start until you touch the screen. Also, while some of the games are really challenging, you don\'t get stuck on them for days and days.  There are no gems or gold bars, etc. You don\'t have to slowly earn some kind of premium currency or pay real money to get special prizes.',
       'Loving it.  Reached level 370, and am really enjoying the game. Fun, good graphics, good story. Nice balance of challenging levels and easier ones, but so far no levels that look impossible. On the negative side, 900 hard won coins for 5 extra moves is ridiculous. When replaying a level it would be nice if you could go straight to the game play without the screen telling you what you need, we already know.',
       'This is my favorite game. Absolutely love playing it whenever I can. However, why did the the flower growing from beating levels suddenly switch from starting on Friday, so we can enjoy it over the weekend to starting during the beginning of the week. Did not get to use my 6 hours of unlimited lives like I have been since this started. I would very much like if it could be switched back to the original timeline. Enjoy unlimited lives and contests over the weekend when it\'s more likely more users will have the time.',
       'I think that we should get more  coins for winning the levels. I find that the game can cost me money that I don\'t have, so I will spend less time playing your game. I love this game alot but why play if you are not getting enjoyment because it costs to much to play. (Otherwise I love the game) I also never got my horse, please give me my horse, I really need that horse btw. I already had a name for her to. I was going to call her daisy. The name goes great with the garden theme. (If you hadnt realized thst already) Please please send me daisy, I love her already. Peace.',
       'Playrix games are all generally the same.. They\'re good. But well designed to ensure and encourage the use of real money to play. Think of old arcade machine style of game mechanics and you\'ve got a general idea of what you can expect from any of their titles.  The only thing truely different is how quickly each game decides it wants to dig for your wallet.  Disappointing.',
       'It was a lot of fun the first few "days" but got very hard very fast. Don\'t bother with power-ups as it doesn\'t really make a difference. The only way to win is to get lucky with a big bomb. That\'s it. It\'s a shame because the game is nice, I just progress way too slowly now for it to be worth playing.' ,

      'This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!',
       'This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you\'re willing to go broke',
       'Lots of fun, creative and very easy!  Review update: I reinstalled in 2018 to find it has changed. You cant dig down very far like you could before, or down to water (it only floods a little bit in places) so I couldn\'t make a moat for the castle.',
       'Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.',
       'Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses.',
       'I have a significant concern with how easy it is to accidentally spend the gems. It has happened at least once, though I\'m assuming it happened a second time while I was quickly clicking building a building, since fifteen gems are now unaccounted for. I cannot feel comfortable with this game if at any given moment, all my gems might get spent because of one misclick.' ,

      'Honestly i really enjoy the game thus far thank you for all the recent updates niantic... but there is one thing that has been bothering me and that is 1v1 with friends and trading... both features were shown in the original trailer... yet again i love the care your giving the game niantic i truly praise it but i would like to know whats happening with my 2 listed thoughts',
       'Please have more legendary raid events with gen 1 and 2 Pokemon for new and returning players who want to collect everything. With regards to using GPS and joystick cheats you guys actually benefit by getting more players from rural areas or dangerous areas playing and spending money. Besides you still have to do all the hard work minus the walking so it technically isn\'t that unfair to others especially since everyone is level 40 these days with legendary Pokemon. The game is already balanced just needs more events. Please consider a premium service to pay for where we can use a joystick in game. We can pay monthly or something so everyone benefits.',
       'thx for niantic that always listened our sugesttion, but i wish we can trade or battling with other player around the world by staying at poke center or else... - and btw you should update the new gym and new pokestop... since when i was on holiday in Indonesia theres not so much pokestop and gym around :( even there are many landmark in there - another suggestion plz maked some item that can be used to summon legendary/raid battle in location that we want, so its much easier  for the communities to do raid battle in specific location',
       'I love pokemon go and always get pulled back into playing it. I\'m still getting use to the updates after not playing for a while and am disapointed in the gyms. While I love being able to use them like pokestops, I wish to recall my pokeon from the gym. I love I a rural area and my poor Vaporeon has been at a gym for 13 days. THIRTEEN. I want my pokemon to come back please.',
       'I love the game but There are fixes and patches that should have been implemented. That people have been asking for but Niantic won\'t deliver. Ex: There are small bugs everywhere especially in gyms and raids and medals.  They never added trading There is no direct PvP No ingenuity (they could have added Pokemon centers or more pokeball types) Thanks Niantic.',
       'Can you please make it so that some Pokemon spon even if you dont go out, I wanna play from home but no Pokemon ever spon . Also can you make it so we can earn coins. I can\'t buy coins but I want to have a chance to earn coins so I can buy things to use. Thanks I love the game though it\'s awesome!' ,

      'At first, the game was good. But after time passed, there is a little gameplay between advertisements.  The game has been sold to advertisements where ads even come in between while you are playing. Very annoying.  Disappointed.   Uninstalling.',
       'Hi everyone!  I\'m really not a fan of this game, I mean it\'s ok I\'m not going to lie but is very boring. The graphics are ok but it is repetitive. I suppose it is quite addictive but I lost interest after a few goes. It wasn\'t my cup of tea so to speak. I hope this review was helpful and remember to give it a big thumbs up!!!

       'Was super fun until you introduced balls achieved by watching ads and a luck based ball/challenge system. The devs got greedy and ruined this great time waster',
       'I like this game. I purchased it because it deserves, also I want to remove ads. 3,50 ‚Ç¨ and ads are not removed completely. I\'m disappointed, expecially for the "restore purchase" button that not works. Despite this I think that as a game is fun but monotonous in the long run, defect of 90% of apps of this kind. I hope developers will add something with updates that are not other challenges that ofter go to luck (and waiting time should e removed also). Sometimes there are some bugs but irrilevant for gameplay. The development house has made other interesting apps too. Sorry for errors, is not my first language.',

      'I would like to give you guys a 5 star but i guess we still need some improvements. Mainly for the auto battle, characters are not using their special abilty or command abilty. Please have them use it so we can still maximize their skill even in auto battles.As well as a fast forward multiplier would not hurt. Would love to have those featires on your next update.',
       'So close to perfect. The game is beautiful and plays like a good mix of old Final Fantasy and the Dissiadia games. The only problem is that the pricing in game is insanely high. You can\'t even buy one single weapon $1. If they dropped the prices then I would probably have already given them money. At least all the characters are free.',
       'At long last, the game is now working and the text is now intact. Now I love the game, with its graphics and frame rate are fluid, the combat is likely the same as the first one on the PSP while inheriting the turn-based battle system of the past, and all of my favorite characters from the SNES games up to the latest are here! Great game SQUARE! But it\'s a shame that there is no English voice over to the characters though. I\'ll love this one even more if you\'ve thought about it SQUARE.',
       'Haha first review I\'ve done without being asked too... (at least it hasn\'t asked yet...) main win for me is how little battery it uses for relatively good graphics. I like that main story doesn\'t use stamina etc so can play as much as you want... I liked ffbe but in my opinion this is better.',
       'It is a very good game. Having no limitations on how much we can play is one of the strong points. The high (1/3) chance  to get a 5* weapon of your choice is also another great selling point. Also, your generosity with gems is very much appreciated. Please keep things this way. If i may suggest, please put a "joint skill" function where two or three characters can perform a skill (with a unique animation) for greater damage. Perhaps you can make it another part of the "limited stamina quests".',
       'Absolutely amazing. I can safely call this an actual game that you can play. There is no energy that stupidly limits play time, you can unlock all available characters by playing the game, and it actually FEELS like a true Final Fantasy game! I love this game and I am definitely going to spend money in the future to show my support for this amazing game.   However, since this game is fairly new, there isn\'t much to do. You definitely need to add more quests, more characters, more events, and PvP. Real-time PvP would be amazing. This is truely an spectacular game, and I highly recommend it for any Final Fantasy fan. Also, Cloud is available near the start of the game! Big thumbs up. Please don\'t screw around with energy Square Enix, please as it is a plague in the mobile gaming business.  EDIT: Please increase the level cap to 99 please. Lv 50 cap doesn\'t feel right at all.' ,

      '1st win bonus from events cannot be opened instead it gives a clickable button saying "open",  it says "close"  instead and I haven\'t even finished it previously yet! I won for nothing seriously? Overall very good game but have squishy bugs to be dealt with.  Oh,  and add offline part too if possible just like Asphalt 8 on some casual activities.  Uhm optimize the graphics too for other gpu like mali and powervr devices =)',
       'This doesn\'t do the TEKKEN franchise any justice, controls are awful (mash one side of the screen), the layout of the title screen is painful and the fighter unlocks etc are daft. I would rather pay a larger amount for a proper TEKKEN game than this. To add insult on top it\'s just crashed and not given me the fighter it was unlocking.',
       'Progress loss. Try the suggestion I saw from the reply to others coment but only pop up for reopen the app. Please fix the problem or most player won\'t stay no to mention spend on the app.  Even update to the latest version, it still load to the lvl 1 version. But still have previous achievement done in my Google account. It become annoying r o player.  And I can not even register on Bandai for a account to issue a formal complaint.',
       'Updated review: The issue with account data loss is fixed with the help of the workaround given by Dev team... Loving this game all over again. Yet to test the latest update though. Previous review: Lost my progress since today noon IST. I\'m able to see the progress and acheivements in Google Play Games app but whenever I load the game it begins with the tutorial. Devs, kindly resolve the issue as I loved the game so much...',
       'Update 2: Tough luck. After creating a new game because of data loss (again), playing through the stages mote to catch up, what do you know, the update restored my old progress. You know, the one that has less fighters and items in it. Dammit.   Update: all my progress was deleted after playing the game daily since installation. Just opened it up one day and. I\'m back to the tutorial. All my effort (and rewards) back to zero without me doing anything. Wasted playtime.',
       'I lost my old progress and had to start over. The new progress i made already reach a further point. Now i get my old one back but lost the new one.  I want to choose the new one as the one stays forgood.  I tried to follow the steps i saw on other peoples review but lost at How to communicate the acc/user id? (2nd step)  When i open the link. Its just connect to the FAQ page.  Help!! T.T *Heartbroken' ,

It\'s one thing to optionally watch ads for coins and prizes. But its another thing when full screen videos pop-up, pausing your game and wasting your time. I was honestly thinking about giving this 3 stars just b/c of how annoying that is alone.',

      'This is a fun mix of simpler games with more challenging ones on each level. Extra points for the extra words makes it more interesting because they often include less common words and words of foreign origin. There are no clues as to what those words might be, so it\'s challenging. But there\'s also no penalty if a word isn\'t accepted.',
       'This game is great. It helps out with working in my focus and concentration issues I have do to TBI. I have to ask though, whats the point of collecting coins if I can only use them to pay fot hints. Also, maybe add a feature where you can use coins to change the background like on some card games. Or maybe just add a free feature to be avle to change backgrounds to a users own pictures in the gallery. Maybe add a few bonus rounds here and there where you have to find words in a time limit. That would be an exciting way to use your brain more. Just some thoughts. This game has some great potential!!! Keep up the good work!!!',
       'This game is a scam. It gets you going then it blocks on a game asking you to create a word and not accepting any possible combinations. You have to pay for a hint and then accepts a word you already tried before paying for the hint. This game is not really free. Scam stay away!',
       'This is a wonderful way to end my day. I am addicted. When I taught school, I would give my students a word. They were to find all the words they could out of the letters in the word. They loved to compete with others (kept them from exchanging words). Now I know why I had them do that. I love it, too!',
       'I would have given the app A five star review had it not been for the greed of the developer it\'s fun and challenging BUT to have an ad after every lvl and not being able to turn off ads permanently even with a purchase? Sorry it\'s an uninstall for me there are tons of word games with less greed',
       'I like the game because it help keep your mind sharp. Also it good for memory. The words are repeated and I like that.  It helps with concentration and focus. It can be used as a teachable tool also. So many little words I didn\'t know was word\'s.  So it also educate you' ,

      'This games accuracy is worse than my atari 2600 and is 1000 times worse than my 5200. It seems like in 38 years with all the technology we have today , someone would finally figure out that when you go up, You go up and not right and when you go right it goes right and not down. Not the case here. Man we have games that live life for you basically. But still cant figure out how to fix pac man. REALLY? And the ads an ad after every board. Ads ads ads and then guess what? Another ad. Very shameless',
       'Came for Sonic, stayed for a good game. I suggest adding new ways to use coins, like for different variations of pacman or the ghosts. The only complaint i have is the loading time is quite slow',

       'I am really surprised. The amount of new mazes I\'ve never seen before just blows me away. Of course you can just play the classic version thats why I downloaded it but wow love this game. And you don\'t have to spend money unless you want to its very kick back. Adds of course but whats a dollar to you?',
       'Fun game, except in some games it gets too sensitive and I seem to lose control of the pacman. Other times it gets stuck in one place. It can be frustrating at times.',

The only issue I have is in survival mode there doesn\'t seem to be enough cows, and I have only managed to make some shoe armor. But then again, there\'s a lot I haven\'t figured out yet, but it\'s been fun learning.',
       'YAY! FINALLY A GAME LIKE MINECRAFT!!!!!!! Except it doesn\'t have stuff like the animals, buckets, iron doors eg. But what is the Nether react core? It is just a made up block. But please add stuff like levers, iron doors, animals, Redstone, Buttons, iron trapdoors, texture packs, adventure mode,  Redstone torch\'s, Hoppers, Ripeters, dimensions like the Nether and The End, And other stuff from the game, "Minecraft". Also, add skin packs and make it like people can see there hand, and add mobs like dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, and foxes. Dogs, Man\'s best friend. Cats, Always cute. Birds, Watch them well you build. Rabbits, See them jump. Foxes. See one on an adventure. Please Also pay for Minecraft if you want it for stuff like Creepers. Also, add farm animals like chickens, sheep, cows, And other stuff like that. But plz do it. Also, add all paintings, pictures from Minecraft, and caves. I will Enjoy the game more if you do. Bye!',
       'Love the game! My only problem is that for some reason, when I grow wheat and try to get a cow to follow me, well they just ignore me. I haven\'t been able to find carrots for the pigs either. Frankly, I would like to be able breed animals pure and simple. Otherwise good job',
       'It is a nice game but it is just shot of (some) things.. e.g animals, red stone ,pail (can contain milk ,water and lava or it can be empty) , red stone torch, paintings (diffirent sizes),mobs. Also, it would be nice if you can label the items that we picked so that it would be easier for us to pick the item that we want. I hope you can add some more items into the game.it will be more thrilling to play. Thanks' ,

      'They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It\'s definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you\'ll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.',
       'Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don\'t be fooled. This is a pay to win game.',
       'I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that\'s cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!',
       'This game is more geared to people who are capable of spending hundreds of dollars but it is still fun.  More non pay for content would be nice as far as more weapons.  But it\'s still a descent game for a pay to play even if you can\'t afford pay.  I think you should be able to upgrade more than one item at a time though.  It only allows it if you pay to.',
       'Typical pay for play. Fun in the low levels then it becomes painfully obvious who are paying the big bucks and I am starting to believe They put the people who pay on the same teams. So after about level 7 unless you pay you will lose a lot. They will say everything can be obtained for free. While this is true. The amount of time and effort makes it not worth the hassle. To get the better robots you will pay a lot of money. $100 for a robot as a sale price in this game. It shuts off in the middle of the game tech support took their time responding and didn\'t address the problem. They say record and take pictures but they will not upload. In my opinion not worth the time.',
       'I totally like the game and all but there must be balance between different robots especially..... some robots have a big advantage like the haechi with 3 medium slots and its dash ability.. its like u cant even aim at it......  Also please remove the components so that everyone is able to buy newer robots... u can make them available in gold or silver or even workshop points' ,

      'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn\'t one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you\'re better at making farm and army games. Please make more of thoseüòñ',
       'This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own üí∞. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.',
       'What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I\'m in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can\'t push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something',
       'Really a awsome  addictive  game.. but its not a fair play..  It  offered me only one  legendary card as I am playing from the beginning.  In the other hand one of my friend started playing just 4 months ago but he owned 5 legendary cards. one from the crown chest, another from the legendary chest and recently he got another one in the super magical chest. Now you decide. Is it a fair play?.  Really Disappointed üëé. And on the other hand it is pay to win game.. In some cases skill doesn\'t work .' ,

      'First up the images used as what the game looks like are fakes. I saw too many polygons.... (Shudder) Secondly there is no start menu. NOPE! Just some fancy loading screen and boom you\'re in the game without a chance to look at the controls. Plus your first mission is ruined by the tutorial at the worst places on the track.   Bad game knockoff. If you download this just delete it. This game is EXPLICATIVE',
       'Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that\'s excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.',
       'Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?',
       'Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can\'t without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.',
       'Update: so I\'ve been playing for several weeks now. You cannot win with maxed out mods, racing the same level cars. They\'re twice as fast and you can only knock off 3 cars at the beginning of the race and you\'re unable to catch with others. Even if you spend money, you will not get 1st place in a lot of the races. Very unbalanced game. Whoever programmed the ai should be fired  Fun game, but the intrusive ads are ridiculous. It pops up in the middle of a race, before and after the race, finished off by asking you to pay to remove ads.',
       'I don\'t know what the game is even like. I couldn\'t even get past the loading part because it won\'t let me tap on the screen.  I find this very irritating because I like trying out new car games. But please promise me you won\'t play this game any further as its a waste of your time.' ,

      'This game was great until the most recent update now I dont play as much. Only being able to save 25 cupcakes when before tgere was no limit IS terrible! I\'ve purchased boost to pass a level & several times when I\'ve used them the game freezes so I lose the boost. I contacted customer service got a generic response & no refund but they want me to rate their service ü§î no thanks! I loved the game before but not so much now!!',
       'Would of gave full marks but on a few cooking appliances when I tap on it doesn\'t work. Second I think it would help if you could carry money over from one country to another and convert currency. Some of the levels are hard to achieve and you don\'t earn enough power ups and spoons to help you through the levels plus restore lives take ages. Customer waiting is to quick.',
       'Ar first I was going to rate this well, it lets you get several levels in without pressure to buy the cheats, aka power ups.  That quickly changes though when you reach levels that must be executed flawlessly and without any delay what so ever. We\'re talking playing 100% perfectly in every way.  Enter the power ups. They go from optional cheats to required if you\'re a mear human. That\'s how they make their money.',
       'The game very addictive ... should be able to keep money you earned on next level... on some levels when cooking makes it almost impossible to earn enough points to beat the level... I\'ve been so close at times by a point or two and still lose tht level not enough customer to earn points..... I really enjoy it but this needs some adjustments...',
       'It is a great game and very fun to play but just needs a little more to it. The one thing I can\'t figure out is why do we keep getting coins if we can\'t use them to purchase anything after you get all the upgrades on your ingredients. There should be a use for them or stop giving us coins in the rewards of each day. I wish there more things to buy or if the coins could be transferred to the next level or something. Okay thanks. P.S. I was just enjoying this game until you guys decided to cut my cup cakes down to 25 only so that means I have been saving mine only to know that after I use them up I can only get 25 at a time well that sucks and I hope you change that back if not my time with this game has come to an end.',
       'Was a great,  fun game,  but now with the new Update things will not download.  I\'ve sent emails to them and nothing has change.  I did receive an email back asking to rate their and of course I told them you don\'t want me to rate something I never received!!  Can\'t open game,  this issue has gotten worse!!üò°' ,

      'Most of the controls are excellent, I love the snap-to by selecting a ball, and the fine tune dial, however the "spin" mechanic is terrible to the point of being broken. No matter where you put the contact spot on the cue it is always maximum front spin or back spin, there is no diagonal spin or English, and no gentle spin of any kind. Fix this and you have a perfect pool game.',
       'I played without sound for a long time. After Upgrading my tablet, the sound won\'t turn OFF!   I have it off in the settings but am still getting sound after sinking a shot and at the end of a game.  I am very dissappointed that i wont be able to play this app anymore.',
       'It\'s not horrible by any means but it\'s basically the children\'s version of what the game should be. Way to basic way too easy and no points and buying system or any sort of upgrades every level just diffs with amount of balls and placement not difficulty Thanks',
       'Was disappointed when I reached level 816 and found no more game. Also, game could use some kind of "side game" to avoid boredom.  But still good time killer.',
       'I enjoy playing this game. I already reach level 400 but i don\'t know how many levels this game have. Do you increase the levels every time you update this game until it reach to never ending levels so that no one will stop playing this game because of the never ending levels. This game is fun and challenging.',
       '1st there are ads in between each play which is ridiculous.. I dont know how high the game goes up but there are NO hints or instructions on what exactly the goal is besides potting balls.. it\'s ADDICTIVE and fun BUT if this is all there is to it I won\'t keep game long' ,

      'It\'s a very good time passing game that enhances your vocabulary and makes your mind more sharper and responsive.However, there are some photos that are not even close to what is the answer.So it would be great if you show more accurate pics.  Most importantly collective nouns are bit complicated and some are wrongly mentioned that doesn\'t even exist.',

       'The game can become a lot of fun if you play multiplayer. Sometimes does not load the images, and then it\'s very difficult to impossible to get the answer. Probably a bug, it does seem to happen a lot though.',
       'Really fun game to pass time, really gets you thinking. 1 problem i find is words from different countries that are not used at all where we live so it makes it nearly impossible to know what the word is. 1 other thing us not being able to sync your game onto another device. Kinda sucks when youre on level 1300 and you have ti start over again',

      'I love that you don\'t lose troops while defending. The only problem is the cost to heal them is rediculous. There are many aggressive players that assault you early on in the game and unless you pay money it becomes difficult to maintain a stable civilization. I believe it would be better if there were cheaper or easier ways to gain resources for those whom don\'t pay to win. Thank you for the amazing game though! Love you guys and I will never quit playing!',
       'I watched commercials about this on YouTube and after downloading the game I was very disappointed about the graphics. It\'s more like a crudely drawn cartoon. It seems OK, but there\'s not a whole lot of variations from other games in this category. Wish the developers of these games would add a new feature or two just to make it stand out. I\'m going to keep playing but if it doesn\'t get better after a while I\'ll probably unistall.',
       'I like the game. Has a few things that are a pain though. Like you cant share resources if they were bought, what does that even matter. I also dont like that your avatar can only be your facebook pic or an in game one..give me the option to upload my own pic without changing my facebook one.',
       'I like the game but there is some bullying that happens. No limit on how many times a player can attack you. I was attacked 60 times in an hour by the same player killing every troop I had, cleaning out all my resources and destroyed one of my bases. It is just plain malicious. I have brought it up before and no one cares to do anything to fix it.  Update: I sent the above message months ago and received no response. This is classic "pay-to-play" tactics that promote bullying to get you to pay for upgrades. I won\'t be playing anymore.',
       'The support for this game is a joke.  I have been playing for 3 months and they have yet to correct a single thing.  I still can\'t bind to my Facebook and their resolution was to start over even though I have spent well over 100 bucks on this app.  Very disappointing.',
       'Love the game, spent a lot but sadly to many people make it so hard to grow in the game. They come and pick out the weak and destroy everything you spent weeks building. The same players will go ahead and hit you untill they kill all your troop and burn down all your huts so I think I\'m going to quit the game and delete.  It\'s to that level of ridiculous, you spend your hard earned money and someone comes to put a fire to it making it a waste.' ,

      'So I played it on my iPhone e and loved it. Recently o got a new phone and it\'s am android. I connected to my Nintendo account and loaded it up. My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I\'m not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr',
       'Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I\'m paying ¬£9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn\'t make it worth the price being asked.',
       'I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',
       'This would have got 5 stars had I been able to share it with my 2 kids via family share. I refuse to pay ¬£30 for all 3 of us to have access to all the levels.  Great game though. Fun, quick and easy to play. Many hours spent between us. So many levels too.',
       'Super Mario run is a great smartphone game it has the very addicting toad rally and remix ten and the simple, but very rewarding controls. The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars',
       'I beat world 1, and I have to pay for the rest of the game? Really? This is stupid.. If you\'re going to have a game you need to pay for, market it as such, not the ol bait and switch. Very deceitful.. At least make a trial game or demo game not lure someone in and then tell them they need to pay to finish the game' ,

      'I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there\'s only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can\'t beat them! Keep making more awesome games!',
       'This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn\'t always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing',
       'I can\'t help but love a mobile game that doesn\'t constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it\'s tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.',
       'I really like the game. But there\'s one thing that annoys me: when I don\'t play this game for a few hours and then I do another battle in dungeon, the game crashes after killing last monster in that battle.  I found out that if I switch on mobile data it works. So I wanted to asked why is that. EDIT: now all works just fine. 5 stars',
       'Gameplay isn\'t disrupted by ads unless you want some free coins once and awhile. They aren\'t throwing the loot boxes in your face either.  The coins per hour/minute seems to be while playing only. Not sure if that\'s a glitch or how it is meant to be.',
       'Overall the game is really fun. A few minor issues like the controls being a little awkward and no way to remove ads, but other that that, a solid time-waster.' ,

      'This game is amazing! Everyone needs to play this. I would\'ve given a fifth star however you need to not only buy all XXL sharks to unlock the "!!" Sharks but max them out. Definitely download this, just one tip. Don\'t delete when you have progress. I\'ve downloaded, played, got bored, and deleted 3 times. Now I\'m never deleting it. I have so much progress, if I never deleted it the first time I would have everything in the game',
       'Finally! For the the longest time I\'ve been waited, the gaming performance has been improved! No more annoying lag and the gameplay feel a lot smoother now and I am so happy about it. But the graphics still needs to be improved because it doesn\'t look too good and some minor bug needs to be fixed.',
       'Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it\'s so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I\'ve had to start all over again... but the fun continues!',
       'This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don\'t play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don\'t make us wait foreverrrr!',
       'It\'s a fun game and I\'m enjoying it. However, I\'ve come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.',
       'Fun time waster, can get quite a lot sunk into it, and get e erything without paying up. Glad its always been grindable. Just has had trouble connecting for saves. I lost everything a couple years ago before they had cloud saves... They\'re here now and aside from a logout/in they are wonderous afaik. Good stuff!' ,

      'I like this game but there\'s so much cheating going on. It doesn\'t resister some of the moves you make or it\'s lagging and when you smash the minions they should fly away and not stick to the screen for ten seconds so you can\'t see what\'s coming next. Just stop cheating! Don\'t take 20hours to give the necessary tools when doing a double task in the jelly lab.',

All my progress in game was lost. All the money invested in this game was lost. I have sent them emails, tickets about it but no answer what so ever. The result is ---&gt; uninstall',

      'I\'m 11 and i love it so much.I have some Ideas for a toca kitchen 3. You can be able to make sandwiches and soups or stews. And more ingredients, more people. And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.',
       'Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I\'m sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP',

Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!üòÜüòÜ I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!',
       'This is the best game ever it is also funny because I was giving the girl food and I gave her some strawberries and I put a lot of lemon, hot sauce, Barbiecu sauce,Manas,keckup,salt, and pepper... SO funny, it also sounds just like a kid is playing with the food, that I\'m eating grapes right now,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÅüòÄüòä‚ò∫üôÇüòê',
       'I want YOU to read this Toca Boca I love it! But I have to ask, Why is there bread if you can\'t make a sandwich? Also can you make there a way to make soup? I really like your games but I am only 10,how do you expect me to pay for the games. At make 5 free like this!' ,

      'This is a great game and is challenging it definitely requires some focus and concentration. There is a bug that needs to be fixed it is on the gold game mode and it\'s the game that asks you to select which colours are more prominent out of all the squares but the coloured squares don\'t appear. Please fix this as soon as possible because I really enjoy this game.',
       'I really lived thus game because it isn\'t just tapping something but it\'s actually training your brand and improving your attention, memory, logic and your mind in general. If you need help in any of those subjects (or you just like a bit of fun ) I would dwfinately say this is the game for you.',
       'Very great game, I can pic some logic questions here and ask it on my friends ang classmates. It really gives me a brain exercise. Wheneve I feel bored, this game takes my bored away',
       'I just started playing but so far i am truly loving it! I\'ve always preferred games that teach and/or exercise your brain rather than the largest number of games available! Within a few rounds it is obvious this game will promote brain activity and help in every aspect of life! I highly recommend this üíó',
       'Simple but fun. These games are challenging and do make you use your brain without taking much time. You can play a few levels in just a few minutes easily. Ads are not too bad either, not too obtrusive and are sporadic enough.',

      'I kind of miss the old version because isn\'t that why they came out with a 2nd game so if we eant more we got it.  Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.',
       'I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I\'m playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can\'t complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that gameüëç',

       'This game is both funny as serious it\'s a great way to make kids understand the danger of some things around them. Like trains and wires and different things. As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.',
       'I think that there could be less ads. When I\'m trying to replay he game an ad pops up which is really annoying. What I would say is that this is an excellent game but just less of the ads',
       'A truly wonderful and entertaining game. Very well supported with great updates over the years. Latest version (Valentine\'s) appears to be buggy (animations jerk ahead) ruining the gameplay. I\'m unsure it this is the game or my phone.' ,

      'If you\'ve liked the first game you\'re probably gonna enjoy this one. It\'s more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it\'s built around microtransactions so if you\'re feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don\'t understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it\'s likely you\'re going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren\'t aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don\'t expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!',
       'Free to play games are always the same formula: Starts off addictive, gets more challenging, starts encouraging you to buy gem equivalent, forces you to buy gem equivalent. At least most other games are fair with it though, giving you a chance. PVZ 2 does not. Levels go quickly from fun to I\'m done, and become impossible. I\'d love to see developers or game testers try to complete later levels without gems, especially Big Wave Beach. It\'s a shame, as the first game remains a classic. Buy the first game and Garden Warfare if you like it. Leaf this game alone, it\'s a sprout at best. Oh and remember, if zombies try to break into your house, throw your money at them.',
       'I was unable to launch the game for some stupid reason.....i sent several messages to the developers email seeking help,but everytime i get a same reply,asking me to visit the ea gaamjng website. It doesnt work,and seems like the message the developer replied is auto generated. Does popcap/ea rlly take time to fix it? Pls help me,i dont wanna miss out on speacial events. Thanks',
       'The game lost all my progress when it crashes. It occurred to me thrice already and I had almost had more than half the plants in my collection. Not going to invest my time in this game anymore as I have to start from scratch everytime. HAPPENS EVEN WHEN I USE GOOGLE PLAY TO UPLOAD MY GAME STATS',
       'EA doesn\'t care about the problems of the gamers. Im not interested anymore in this game after my profile has gone. 3-4 years of playing and buying stuff and most of my plants are in level 10 plus 4k+ gems, but with one stupid glitch, all of my achievements are lost. the game does not deserve even 1 star. I DONT LIKE TO PLAY FROM SCRATCH AGAIN & AGAIN. STUPID!!! u dont care about our feelings, all u want is money..' ,

      'I can\'t say I love it,maybe I can. But any way, this would have to be in one of top hundred gamesüòÄ. There are a few things I would like added though. Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed thisüòÄüòÅüòÄüòÅüòÄüòÅ.',
       'I think you guys have messed up your game in the past few updates. Seems like there is some memory leak or something. After a while the steering wheel lags so much. Only the input. Graphics don\'t lag at all. Please fix. Also would be great if you could add some button to start and stop a timer in free mode so we can set time challenges for ourselves. I like the game but it is unplayable after a few minutes after the recent updates',
       'What you should improve is that YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ADD\'s I MEAN SERIOUSLY I WATCH MORE ADDS THAN THE GAMEPLAY. I ONLY PLAY FOR A LITTLE THEN MOST OF ADDS SHOW UP. I WQ5CH ADDS THAN PLAY8NG THE GAME FOR CRYING OT LOUD!!',
       'This has to be like, my 5th or 6th reinstallment of this game since there\'s no ingame reset, but darn well worth the data(little bytes). I usually like more realistic car games, but even the "extreme" warp in physics in the gameplay doesn\'t distract from the fun. These are the cars you\'d want if you\'re trying to beat the traffic, run from the cops, or solve a parking dillemma. Great fun time killer! One thing though, the other reviewers are correct in their complaints about how often and when ads pop up. That shouldn\'t happen smack dab in the middle of a maneuver.',
       'This is crazy like I understand that you need ads but the fact that they are popping up on the middle of the screen is crazy! Like I woodnt mind if you had a small one at the bottom is the screen but the fact it pops up at random in the screen is really annoying and finds the game. I do love this game but the ads ruin it. Please fix this!',
       'This game was just really really good! But please please make the exact same game but instead, if you do something illegal like crash into another car, the cops start chasing you. If you do do this I will comment on every single game that comes up on the adds. But, there is a tiny bit to much adds. Anyways, AMAZING fame!!!üòä' ,

      'Pretty cool game. Like the simple concept of taking something we have all done at one time or another and turning it into a video game.  Genius. I really like the sense of accomplishment I get when I make a trick shot like a bank shot off the boss\'s head and no rim just straight in! It\'s like he shoots he scores! The crowd goes wild! ..fake crowd roar...',
       'The game makes me feel things down in my nether region super fun to play. When I throw the paper ball I\'m like sweeeeeeeeet. I daydream about playing when I\'m at work. The second I get home I get undressed and play me some paper toss.  Thanks you guys over at paper Toss you really know how to have a great time. If you guys would like to hang out some time and toss some paper I\'d be down. hit me up some time',
       'Wow, this game is fantastic! How have I not downloaded this before?? The controls are easy to use and very responsive. So far I haven\'t run into any bugs so that\'s good. I really enjoy using different objects to throw in place of the paper ball, which is actually my favorite. The fact that each object is affected differently by the fan makes this game flavorful. Really great job with this!!',
       'Disappointing. Paper Toss Boss used to be known as Paper Toss 2, though the name isn\'t all that has changed. For one thing, there are now WAY too many ads. Every time I change a level, an ad comes up. Inexcusable. And to make it worse, the game lags more. If my old Android 2.2 phone can run Paper Toss 2 with no problem, then the same should be said with this version and my new Android phone. Considering it a classic game ruined.',
       'After the last update the game sucks so bad. Tons of add, lag, the interface moves poorly, after 5 minutes i just gave up and uninstalled it. Used to be so much fun before. Please go back to the previous versiob!',
       'Great except two things... ... the fact that I can\'t turn off that tab on the left that flashes at me when I suck. No I don\'t want a hint or buy some gimmick. Just let me throw the ball in peace. It\'s nagware and it is so annoying it makes me not want to play the game. Make it appear *once* then give the option to banish it.ALSO there is a game breaking glitch that happens frequently where I throw a ball and it goes in but then nothing happens, I don\'t get another ball, I can\'t access any menus, the game is frozen. This happens every' ,

      'This game is fun and entertaining and time will pass by you playing this. The only downfall is you only get so many chests locations on main screen and take hrs to open them up. So you have to decide if you want to play or wait the hrs. You can free up those chests by using your gold that you have but if you run out then you have to buy more with real money.',
       'It always seems that luck favors your opponent and gold is extremely hard to come by. Wind totally inconsistent, almost like it screws you purposely.  It would be nice if they gave you gold rewards for achievements but that\'s where their money grab is. Some courses have bugs and it\'s extremely frustrating, Win or lose money always seems to be pretty tight.',
       'It\'s a great game but I was up against one person and it usually gives the other person a chance to hit but this time I would have won but it didn\'t give me a chance to go another round. Don\'t know if this is a glitch or part of the game but it irritated me',
       'Game is rigged! Don\'t get your hopes up on being the next Tigger Woods when playing this game. All they want is your money, give them nothing. This game is only fun when you win. That is all I have to say. Even my girlfriend agrees with me on this, and she doesn\'t EVER EVER agree with me.',
       'The one star is due to their challenge a friend. If the friend is not online when you challenge then you cannot play against them.  When you challenge a friend you should be able to play the level if they do not respond to challenge after the timeout.   In this event the hit opponent ball will do nothing, and mystery boxes will only benefit the collector instead of opposition actions on opponent you challenged.',
       'I got hit with the rocket and both times they hit my ball and their ball went straight into the hole. I\'ve gotten it 3 times and each time, it bounced me backwards and always put their ball in the best position. I\'ve lost over 6,000 coins for just those instances. Why is it when they get it, it always works out? And when I get it, it messes me up?' ,

      'Great, addictive game! However, real fast, I was wondering how the free box worked. I always hope for something real good but ALWAYS end up with either raw materials or ONE coin. Now don\'t get me wrong, I LOVE getting free stuff, it just seems like the "spinner" purposefully chooses raw materials. Like, it\'s not random like it seems; it never chooses anything close to a weapon! In any case, I cannot play this game enough, very very fun!',
       'Honestly ive been waiting for close to 2 months. This game was like crack for me until the update left me no nice place, no hard earned stuff. I dont mind starting from the bottom again but at least give me some perks. This game is worth every cent and time. But until i get my account back or my stuff back im leaving 2 stars when really this game should be 5 stars all the time. I wont be playing this game til then. Thanks for the good times.',
       'The game doesn\'t load!!! 1.) There\'s nothing wrong with my internet connection! I don\'t have any problems playing RIFT, LOTRO, Neverwinter, Aura Kingdom, Allods Online, etc. or any of my other Google Play apps on my internet connection! 2.) Using Task Manager doesn\'t work! 3.) My device has way more than 200 MB of free space on it! 4.) I haven\'t been able to play for 14 days now!!! 5.) Jurassic Survival looks more promising since there are no loading problems!!!! >:(',
       '**UPDATE** Was an awesome game. Could use a few more perks (ie. Weapons and hard to get items) in drop boxes and yellow zones.Now the down side is if you die in a level your last position is no longer there to try and recoup some of your items. Players killing you as you open trunks in inventory screen. With that I think I am done with this game. Oh ya and the free spin box...give random prizes instead of coins and rope. People will get really into it if perks are awesome.',
       'Love the game addictive great grafx but after 2 months of playing getting up to level 77 and not being able to craft Chopper, Refined Furnace among many other items unless you pay real money and then you have only a chance at 1 part of those. There is a free item every hour or so but have yet to get anything of use from it.  sadness me deeply.',
       'I love the game. It\'s awesome. But I do have a few questions. Why are the bunker cards so extremely difficult to find? I\'ve been looking for days killing every zombie possible and looking through every crate without finding the cards. Also. Why isn\'t there a disclaimer that says if you die in the game, everything you purchased will be lost? I think that would be extremely necessary so no one over spends their money. Other than that, absolutely smooth running, fantastic graphics, and realistic deaths. I love every aspect except I can\'t find these darn bunker key cards.' ,

The dude takes literally the longest route possible to get to the evac! Nearly finished it just to do so but the amount of ads/repeats you have to go through just gets worse',
       'I really like this game and its one that I can play continuously, my only problem is that I can only play once a day.. the game will work for as long as I play but as soon as I exit I can\'t back on until the following day. It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can\'t just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...',
       'Good but buggy Good but buggy, one can earn infinite money in no time then u can upgrade ur vehicle to the max in the very first level. That destroys the fun of the game. Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.',

Contact me as soon as possible.',
       'Yesss. I complete this game in 7 days. I can\'t understand the ending why that cantenar shake. It\'s mean the zombie are in the cantenar? It\'s mean part 3 will exist? Awesome game. I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don\'t read it before. I can\'t find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....',

      'It\'s nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it\'s not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It\'s just not fair.',
       'I loved flow free from a young age. I\'ve played until 9√ó9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I\'ve tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs',
       'Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.',
       'The best, the OG, the original puzzle time-passer! (second only to Tetris) I love this game, I\'ve been playing it for years! The original starts to get boring after awhile, but with all the different variations they come out with, it never gets old. A very fresh experience with one of the recent updates, feels much more refined when compared to the one I used to play.',
       'Was a great game until about 48 hours ago. I didn\'t mind the ads but now after every level I complete there\'s a video ad. Even then I would deal with it but it closes my music player. So after the ad I have to go to the music player and start it again but then when I switch back to the game I have to relaunch and reselect the level. Gets annoying to have to do after every level',
       'Fantastic game. Real addiction game I\'d say. It\'s an awesome time killer. Different types of levels never make the game boring. Graphics is okay. Number of ads for a free to play game is less compared to other games out in the market which is a relief.Overall I would give 4.5/5' ,

      'Why I liked it? Because it\'s a simple game that doesn\'t make you addicted to phone but rather enjoy going forward focusing your attention entirely on your finger. What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven\'t listened to this game\'s. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I\'m entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.',
       'I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it\'s meant to be "skillfull" but thats harder than skillfull, you can\'t even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don\'t care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.',
       'This is game is ok if you are bored and don\'t know what to do.... however it becomes irritating after playing for a while.... overall its a nice game',
       'I would like to report a bug. When you pause the game, moving obstacles keep moving. Someone would use this as a cheat',
       'This is the best game to relax. But i have a problem i do i change the music there are some music that i like and i want only that to play so i request ro put a music option  Thank you',
       'This is so bad. And it\'s very boring and I thought that it has some special things. Do not download this.' ,

      'Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?',
       'This game is pretty good, for the most part. The only problem is the bots you go upagainst are  way to hard. I can never win. I would have gave them 5 stars but I gave them 4 stars because of the bots. And the game is kinda hard to control. When I move backwords on a veichel it goes up.',
       'New update stucks a lot and 1st time my mobile hangs a lot due to this game and btry drains faster than ever. plz crt these mistakes to continue njoying this game',
       'Ok. I admit this game is pretty fun. But the missions, especially the hardcore ones, are ridiculously hard. So if you want a challenge, I recommend this game. But if you rage over really dumb things like me, then I definitely do not recommend it.',
       'The physics is very hard to grasp leading to many fails and the bots often drive backwards and forwards until they can drive up onto my head. There\'s also no start timer, leading to the bot ramming into me before I can figure out what\'s happening. Great with human opponents, however single player makes me want to throw my phone out of my window. Great concept, horrible execution.',
       'I hate this game it makes me so stressed and the AI is rigged also the David and Goliath mission i try to win they win 5 out of 5 of the first 5 matches and I\'m afk they win 4 out of the first 5 matches this is f@#$ing stupid P.S impossible to get new cars the machines just gobble up your coins like the game where you try to grab a plush toy but it always fails because it\'s rigged' ,

      'lnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'I love the game play and graphics. But I payed for adidas female clothing and an aquarium previously on the game, and then when I restarted, they have gone. I spend ¬£3 on it in total and I actually spent more money on other things that didn\'t come back in the next game, but it\'s understandable because they were lifestyle points and you know it\'s currency not clothing or furniture. I uninstall sims sometimes a bit of always go back and before my items were there, but now they\'re not and that really frustrated me. I actually ended up in 2017 spending  ¬£10 on sims freeplay and that\'s the only money I think I will ever spend on ot now because if you restart,  you don\'t get anything you wanted. Please fix this because I spent that money and I could\'ve bought something else with it but I didn\'t because I like sims.',
       'Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools "playable",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it\'d be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.',
       'First, I don\'t like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don\'t like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you\'re just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!',
       'im not sure what\'s the cause of the problem but what i know is the sims\' act a lil bit freaky. i just redownloaded this game bcs i cant log in this game before bcs i just updated it. before this, the sims is ok, but now they act really awkward. when they\'re walking, they legs dont even move! it\'s like they\'re flying, plus when they\'re doing any action like "clean the dishes", they dont move, they just stand still in front of the sink. this is freaky. please reply to my review bcs i really want to know more about this. i really like this game except what i said above. this game is really addicting:).',
       'I think the game it self is FANTASTIC,  I LOVE IT!! Allthough, I think this is a prob , I wanted to age my baby sim . But the problem is , that if i go , it says i have to pass level 12 and do a quest . Im fine with that , but im level 13 (nearly 14) And the quest hasnt come up yet . I think its bc i have to finish all the quest i need to , to do the toldder quest . Hope all is allright . Anyways , as i sais before , This game is my life! And keep up the good work!!' ,

      'So I\'m changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it\'s a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I\'d rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!',
       'GAME CODE reveals ROLLS ARE NOT RANDOM - they\'re pulled from a table of predertirmined outcomes, designed to MILK YOU FOR MONEY at a set rate, based on PvP, reg. Game, Event, Boss, etc.  Just like slot machines & video poker (which i programme).  You must \'assemble\' high scoring games, like a puzzle, with majority of yahtzees sitting after 4 or 8 rolls (1 or 7 bonus \'dice\'(money) spent)... Like a choose your own adventure book that can cost Hundreds of Dollars.',
       'First off, I can\'t stand the constant ads that kill what I\'m listening to.  But the PRIMARY reason I must delete it-- it takes up TOO MUCH SPACE!  From the get-go, I moved it to my SD card.  Every time I play, I have to move files from internal storage back to the card.  My phone had minimal space left, and I couldn\'t figure out why.  After deleting other apps and trying everything I could, I deleted this game.  YAHTZEE was the culprit!  Obviously, files were still being stored on my internal storage, despite moving it to my card!  NOT GOOD!  Now I can download the apps I had to delete!',
       'Fun and addicting! There are a lot of fun options within the app for game play (e.g. tournaments, themed "dice masters," play online, wagers, etc.). It is, however, difficult to earn extra rolls without buying them. It is impossible to partipate in many events fairly & have a chance at winning without purchasing extra rolls.',
       'Horrible game, stupid graphics looks like a preschooler did it, games are definitely rigged you hardly ever beat the house. To much stuff going on on this board you have no clue where to go to get to anything. The old game was easier to navigate. You should give people the option to keep the old game.',
       'Too many ads, basically requires you to buy dice. Literally the only way to ensure a win is to have dice for re-rolls. This wouldn\'t be a problem except you\'ll hardly ever win dice with the scratchers, and when you do it\'ll be one.  It\'s all a cash grab, and the ads every 3 or 4 rolls are intrusive, frequently locked in, and always very annoying. Gameplay itself is simple but just way too many ads.' ,

      'I had this game a long time ago and it is one of the best games out there. It hasent changed since when I usted to have it it would be nice to get some new maps or bikes and maybe change the layout of the menu. And maybe even a multipler more where u play with other people/friends and just free ride or challenge to see who can get more points. Other then that it is a crazy fun and addictive game.',
       'Awesome!!!! It\'s an awesome  game.......But(there\'s always a \'but\' coming from me ;-) )......You should work on the reality glitches. Like when you start, in the first levels(the docks)...You move and the bike rolls down but when you move up the next slope it doesnt....You should work on that. One more thing......You should not keep all levels payed. You should keep it like, if you beat a certain record or you finish the course faster than the time given already. Otherwise, HATS OFF TO YOU ILLUSION LABS...GREAT WORK!!!',
       'LMAO, how pathetic. Not even possible to control this garbage.  It is nice to see that your level of dedication matches the skateboard version of the game though, along with the PC version, and that you continue to abandon your paid software, you thieves.',
       'I liked the game a lot. The graphics are great and the tricks are to I loved every thing about. But the one thing I do not like is that ther is no free ride. I think it would be better if ther were skate parks and stuff like that to ride on.     üòÄüíöGREAT GAMEüíöüòÄ',
       'I really enjoyed this game till now... I completed all the challenges on docks and have 200 adrenaline but haven\'t unlocked next map!?! I went online and researched it and you apparently need 210 adrenaline but there is no way to get it so you have to burly full game!!! This is a money scam',
       'Good game, but tell me why I have to pay 5 dollars just to get more than one map! Deleting solely for this, because ive already done all the challenges and medals.' ,

      'What a good little game. Nothing special in the graphics department but it delivers on everything it says and shows. After playing for a little while I couldn\'t help but feel like I was waiting for a little bald guy to want to eat me if I got an answer wrong, "cans we eats it precious". Jokes and riddles. Very good game. Well done.',
       'Game is really good specially for kids . Makes them think. Only bad part of this game is the list in answers.. they are already displayed. This makes the game very easy. It would make an awesome game if user had to enter the answers.. hope the developers fix this!',
       'I found "500 Riddles" to be somewhat misleading.  After the first few levels the riddles started to repeat. (Either the exact same riddle or the same riddle worded differently) Also grammar and punctuation errors in the riddles started to get annoying. But overall I did enjoy the program.',
       'The game could use a few fixes. Sometimes when you touch a level it is unresponsive. The stage count is weird. When you completed all stages of a level it says 9/10. Please fix this the overall game isn\'t bad but these are very easy no brainer fixes.',
       'It\'s fun.... But way too many adds. Still love playing it....but it\'s just annoying... Ok so to add to this: im on level 19 now and a LOT of the riddles are repetitive...again, still a good game and good time waster but I\'d prefer new and harder riddles as the levels go up ... Just some advice to the maker of this game!',
       '1 star for a puzzle game that has incorrect answers. There is a question in Level 3 that is wrong. It basically reads Dog is a ruler while God is a servant instead of the reverse. Job good did you.' ,

      'Hey RobTop, the game is ok, but there is one issue. im used to playing geometry dash with my samsung chromebook 3 (it doesn\'t have touchscreen) and when i press the spacebar on my computer (this is the same issue on geometry dash lite and subzero) it doesn\'t let me jump. And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.',
       'Got all the way to the end,  and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow,  and ended up having to restart all of the levels,  fix this,  it doesn\'t happen with the other geometry dash games,  just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted...  Fix then 5 stars',
       'When I heard that this was out, I rushed to the Play Store, freed up my storage and installed this app. This is fantastic, as I had been craving for 2.1. I finally have a little sneak peek, although‚Ä¶                                           A) No Spider in main levels (Challenge excused) B) Ads‚Ä¶ugh                                                        C) No Account Loading (2.1 fixed)                                      D) Levels too easy and short                               It‚Äôs still great!',
       'This is really hard. I can\'t buy the full game as I am only 9, but I think I am missing out on a lot. Please add check points to normal mode as some levels are basically impossible',
       'This game stress me out but the next day when I play it I beat the lv in one go and fills my heart up with joy! So what if the control\'s are sensitive? I know they are.. but if you take a day and give it another go you know what happens and you do great!',
       'I love this game just...can you fix one glitch? On the final level final area the wave is bugged ...when I tap it goes down by itself! Can you please fix it? I was trying over 3 hours to make it but I can\' t because of the glitch :( Please fix it.' ,

      'I have only had this game for a few days, so I can\'t write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it\'s up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.',
       'Man i love this game!!! So much better than wolfquest!!! I do hope tht this game soon be added new things like more animal to play as, better in performance. The ad free guys...keep it up!!! Just wondering if there\'s a add as mate system in multiplayer in the future? Anyways....this is the best wolf game tht i played!!! Do hope tht you guys one day add more animals to play as (like a snow leopard for example)',
       'Love it but pleeeeeaaaase make it possible to play as a boar or a rabbit or deer. Also I think it would be really nice to have a hunger and thirst bar because there is no real point in drinking. That way if you dont have enough food or water you start to lose health.  Also I don\'t think we really need stamina from the food we eat.  These are just suggestions but I really really love this game.  Best simulator out there.',
       'It just lags now. The new update made it to where my chat, my character, and my animations won\'t work. I run about as fast as a turtle, and I am not pregnant. Please fix!!!! I love this game. I have a few questions if you don\'t mind... Can you guys add in multi-player mode, like single player mode, that we can pick up our pups, it would be cool to add that option in the top left menu. Thank you guys so much!! Love the games!!',
       'On one of the quest, I think 11. There ia a syrange new animal and I went to the game menu for information and there wasn\'t any. It looks like a brown rabbit, I tried killing Rabbits squirrels and deer, but It wasn\'t the right animal! Is it in the snow biome?  Anyways hope you can help me and otger quest 11 users. It\'ll be great that when you get the same animal twice it counts as duplicate. For example "Wolf Common Duplicate +(however acorns). Thanks and the update is great!',
       'Could you add more animals to play as? And a world idea could be a dessert. I love this game, and the others you\'ve made, so I know you will make awesome updates soon! Keep up the good work. If you fixed the glitch were you eat and jump at the same time you fly, if you fixed that can you please put it back. It was fun... XD' ,

      'The game is good and i like it..  But after every fight you must connect to internet,, honestly this sucks.. Fighting game needs much comfort ability but every being online its really boring and it eventually slows which makes the game awful Please fix this up  Shadow Fight 2 is more portable and nice thought this will be better than two but for this update Shadow Fight 2 Is the best...',
       'Ok now this is getting really ridiculous. I don\'t like being a jerk but I just gotta complain about the latest update. Ever since I updated the game, all that the opponents have are always katanas and glaives. And those are two really annoying weapons in the Heralds chapter, especially with the AI problem and them always wall spamming the player. And there\'s also the crashing which after 5 updates, still isn\'t fixed. Look, I like this game I really do, and I just hope this game gets it\'s bugs fixed soon so I can enjoy it again...',
       'This game made me rage. Insane difficulty is literally impossible.The loot is trash, upgrading armor and weapons is better. In the fighting system, when you get cornered, your basically screwed. I miss the mechanics in Shadow Fight 2 where you cant hit him when he fell on the ground. It a really good mechanic to give your opponent a chance. But thus game, there is no mercy at all. You still get hit when on the ground which sucks. C\'mon developers, you gotta fix this!',
       'Classical pay per win game. Once you advance (e.g. lv 4-5), winning against the computer in the main quest is only possible after several days of waiting for free cards and random levelling of the weapons via chests (gained via duels). Glitches in skills usage are also observed.',
       'Great game in terms of graphic and gameplay. The only thing that sucks are the paywall in this game. Almost impossible to pass the story mode with weak weapon that we are given. The box drop rate also terrible. The only way to level up is by completing the main story. I will uninstall this game till they fixed this system. Really bad system.',
       'You guys made a really good game honestly. Just one thing that gets me tho, when you win fights you get to fight stronger and stronger opponents that\'s a great idea btw. It\'s just that most of the time I ended up fighting someone that has 800 + power and I\'m at 550. Like bro. Come on.  One more thing. The chess take to long really you guys need to fix that. Other than that it\'s an awesome game. No lie' ,

      'This game is the definition of a really bad freemium game. You get to play one game an hour. If you want more you have to pay a ridiculous amount. Full of bugs and the game freezes constantly and if it crashes mid game you wont be reimbursed your wager or energy. The old family feud was great. This is just garbage. Uninstalled and moving on.',
       'Fun game,  but the answers are American so it doesn\'t make sense if you don\'t come from there.  For instance,  they reference american food snacks and sports which I\'ve never been familiar with.',

       'This game would be alright if you removed the chat. I came here to play the game, not talk to randoms who want to know where I live and if I\'m single. I don\'t enjoy being harassed. If I wanted to meet people I\'d download a dating app FFS.',
       'Geared only for Americans, takes an hour to get another ticket, answers like "go for a run "are incorrect only to find the actual answer is "running" are a few reasons why I have not enjoyed the game. Room for lots of improvement. If they fixed these plus the glitches I\'ve just read in the comments section, then it would be a great game indeed!',

      'I never write reviews, but this game really deserves a high one. I got this game because my friend Emily adores it, and I have been playing NON STOP. It\'s so beautiful and high quality for just a dress up game. It\'s absolutely wonderful. My favorite thing is that you can really enjoy the game without having to use real money on in app purchases. Yeah, you can if you want to, but your experience isn\'t less if you don\'t. A high quality and fun game. I adore it',
       'I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I\'m a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events.',
       'In depth in both gameplay and attention to details of awarded items. Continuous hours not required but with once a day of incentive activities. Controls are  sometimes unstable. If a glitch does happen, its fixed fast and your also awarded for time spent. Very happy customer. Enjoyed the best dress up game I\'ve played so far. Thank you makers!',
       'Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted',
       'I love the game. From its cute and addictive style to its unique and original dress up gameplay, it turned me from a dress up hater to lover. But I feel like there\'s a Paywall especially during events, and diamonds are forced to be bought, but they can be earned, which is good. But so far, you seem to have listened to feedback, from the skin tones to the bug fixes. But I love it still.',
       'I had seen many ads for it and was kind of interested, but I didn\'t think a dress-up game could be that fun. One day I couldn\'t find any games I wanted to play, so I decided to give it a shot. To my surprise, I am really enjoying it! So if you\'ve had any inkling of interest in this game, give it a shot. You might enjoying as much as I have.' ,

       'Im very very upset that I got to level 1488 and it took me down to level 705. How does that happened. I paid money to play this game. Now wont let me pass or get back to my level 1488. I love this game now not so sure. Got ripped off again. Please fix. So upset and mad.',

       'As levels get higher the game gets difficult and sometimes gives wrong set of blocks on purpose to elicit money. To the creator of the game that is probably good business practice. To consumers like me it is frustrating experience and thus I am uninstalling it for good.' ,

      'üëáEarn.Free.Moneyüëá √ÆnstaII \'VEARN\' App Entet (RERA) to Start Earnings So far so good. Fun way to get Money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. uno points equals cs instead of like some of the others where it takes uno points to reach cs etc....Also, TOYOCASH App very reliable in paying you when you redeem to Giftz. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to waIIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for adding some fun to my day.',
       'Fun, addictive, progressively challenging....this game has it all. I especially appreciate the flawless performance with no lag time. I also paid for the ads to be removed... totally worth it!  There are some inconsistencies with words being accepted in some levels but not others....not an issue for me though. It adds to the challenge.  I love the beautiful background pictures!  Best word game ever! I just need more levels now :)',
       'Great game, fair balance of ads. Only thing it needs to mix all the songs thru all levels, as the single song while does hold up to repeat play, eventually gets repetitive. Also need better dictionary because I often play real words and it doesn\'t count them which stinks.',
       'Okay, enjoying playing the game but seems that there are no rules! Sometimes proper nouns are okay sometimes not, words used in previous rounds suddenly aren\'t allowed, etc., plurals are a lottery and perfectly good words are just not accepted and few non-words are allowed. Seems a bit arbitrary at times.',
       'I love it. There\'s only two problems. When you\'re on a streak and you accidentally hold a letter and don\'t make a word you lose your streak, even if you don\'t try to make a word. As well as that, the WORST part of the game is the notifications that constantly pop up even if you turn them off. Seriously might be the reason I uninstall the app.',
       'Far too many ads, overly simple, and you take off points for words that ARE WORDS but aren\'t included in said round\'s dictionary.  Like a glorified boggle. Nothing like what that ad I clicked for this app advertised at all. I\'d give 0 stars if that was an option.' ,

      'I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It\'s fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn\'t want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.',
       'Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It\'s reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series\' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis\'s and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I\'m offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,',
       'I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I\'d end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!',
       'Game it self is great and a ton of fun.   But, the system for showing ads is so annoying.  It\'s not just your normal video ad no, they make you watch 3 different ads and a min of 16 or 11 sec each.  After you have watched the minimum time, you have to hit next and repeat again',
       'Quite addicting. But does have partial microtransaction walls where it\'s extremely difficult to get past certain parts without forking over real money. Other than that it\'s nice. I only have two things that I think could make this game better: 1) boss battles and 2) ability to sort through parts by specific type, rather than just their standard class.',
       'The game was nice at first, the rewards system is nice and everything is noob friendly, but the most annoying thing that happened is that after I uninstalled and then reinstalled the game, all my progress and my initial account were GONE. A whole day worth of grinding down the drain. Please implement a fix for this. I want to like this, but if you\'re going to wreck my progress every time I need to uninstall, then no thanks!' ,

      'If you are going to write a word-based game, you should be fairly literate, but, in this case, it is clear you are not. I find many words that are not allowed but are words in the dictionary. The reality is that this is a scam to get suckers to buy up big on coins.',

Not a big deal considering it\'s FREE.',

This game is really helpful.üòÉüòÄ‚ò∫üòÑ',
       'I really love this game because it helps me learn how to spell and also is very helpful by telling us that we are spelling it wrong and lets us try again. This game is addictive and easy to play and also it is VERY fun. HOWEVER, it kinda frustrates me when I need coins to do things, like when I wanna skip. The coins to me they are not very useful. BUT other than that this is a great games for kids and spelling test. Some of these words are hard to spell. A thing I want them to add to the game is an topic about anything and we can spell words that are in that topic. That is all I have to say.',
       'I think this game is great! Awesome time passer and just fun to play. They only drawback is that it drains the battery of your phone so fast it\'s ridiculous. If it weren\'t for that it would get a perfect score',
       'Pointless. Stupid. Kids come home from school and run to their rooms to see their best friends in the world. Phones. Aflter a long hard day at school. And pages upon pages of homework, they want nothing to do with math, history,ECT. Personally, my least favorite subject is spelling. Why come home to thousands of notifications about SPELLING. Ligit. Go find a child who likes to spell. I think not.',
       'I really like this game! Fun game to help pass time. I love discovering words from the random letters in the pan. Only bad thing about this game is the pictures of the cookies and all the delicious words make me hungry and crave chocolate chip cookies' ,

      'Just way too many ads. Eventually you start having to watch an ad after every second other level. Its a free game, so I get it but the levels are so quick sometimes I\'m watching more than I am playing. Fun game, though. Easy controls and great graphics and sound.',
       'Good fun and very addictive. I see people moaning about the adds üòß but what can you expect from a free game? You get an add pop up after about 5 puzzles and to be honest it is only for a few seconds....just close it if you don\'t want to see them.',
       'This game is outstanding. Love the graphics, simple to understand. Some appear quite easy and then you suddenly get a level that looks like it should be but has you scratching your head for AGES!!! Love it. I can live with the adverts, just wish i could put the phone down.',
       'This game is sooooo frustrating that the game made me through my phone on the ground. If you are good with controlling your stress then you should try it. But if your not good at controlling your stress then do not get it.',
       'I usually can find something "wrong" with almost any app or game, but this is about as close to perfect as I\'ve played or used. I did not find the ads to be *nearly* as bothersome as most games. Good stuff!!',
       'I saw this game on a advert on tap tap dash and started playing the advert I became obsessed with it and felt that when it finished I would have to get it. Ever since I downloaded it I became more and more addicted to it. I highly recommend this app' ,

My only problem with it is job selection is boring and there is no way to save the current life you\'re in in case you want to come back to it at a later time.',
       'It\'s perfect! Me and my friends play it all of the time. It\'s somewhat of a thing between us to hang out and play this game, competing for the most money, kids, lovers, illnesses and many more. There are so many different directions one life can go- no two games are the same, and it\'s all up to you to determine the future of this person\'s life with endless possibilities. It\'s amazing, but can I suggest a couple new features? Pets would be great, and more family options. Like cousins, aunts, grandparents. Maybe funerals and funeral costs. Insurance. Tax. They\'d make the game a bit better, but there\'s not much you can do to improve this game. It\'s already amazing.',
       'I honest to(a high power) love this game! I\'ve had it since the beta days. They always improve! The possibilities keep coming and it\'s all because of the game dev(s)! The community for this game is amazing too! Sure sometimes the game can get "boring"because it\'s just a "clicking" game, but that\'s what\'s great about it! I see a bunch of \'life simulator\' games but I gotta say, hands down, best one yet is this one! This proves that you don\'t really need pictures to have an amazing game! Just use your imagination!',
       'This game is so simple and basic, but I still find myself coming back to it over and over again. The only thing I wish for is a temporary save state since sometimes when I think I have 20 minutes I suddenly only have 5... And I was having my best life! ;) It\'s not perfect but the devs are so responsive I don\'t even care. They work hard for this game and they deserve 5 stars. Thanks devs!',
       'I love this game, tho I hope you add more depth there. Like, friends, enemies, character traits, new works, new countries (Please add Philippines), your kids getting married, and many more. I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME AND I\'VE BEEN HERE FOR AS A TESTER FOR QUITE A LONG TIME. I HOPE YOU UPDATE SOON.',
       'Its a good game but I was reading one of the reviews for this game with good constructive criticism. And the developer replies with a hatefull "grow up" comment. The developer seems to be more focused on sjw political correctness instead of listening to the community who obviously love this game and just want to see it grow and not crash.' ,

      'Really liked this when I first started playing. Honestly,there is no point me keeping it now. Can\'t perform my operations,as don\'t have bought staff and ward not on the appropriate level. I can\'t get any new staff,as I don\'t have enough hearts,and once you are at a standstill like this it take FOREVER to earn hearts back. Have loads of cash but nothing to do with it!! Game seems to be designed around getting people hooked initially (as performing operations etc is really fun), but then can\'t continue or progress without purchasing hearts!! Not wasting my time with it any longer.',
       'Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I\'ll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx',
       'It is definitely one of the best games I have ever played. The only problem is that it is soooooooooooooooooo addictive. Apart from that every thing is absolutely epic. I think there should be more operations available more often. I don\'t like it that there are a few bad words in it but that is just me. Some people might not think that hell and Dammit are bad words but I do. That\'s it really. Basically, this game is down right amazing!üëå',
       'Your new update will not let me, or several people it looks like,  get into the game. I am currently doing the 12 day event and am on level 17 please fix it ASAP! I refuse to lose all my progress. This is the best game I\'ve had on my phone in a very long time.',
       'The game was working fine last night. Today it keeps crashing. I start the game and a minute later it crashes. When I start a surgery it crashes, so that wastes the energy. I feel like I spent my money on hearts for no reason. Please fix this issue!  **Update. I updated the app and it\'s still having problems. I\'m unable to do surgery on anything. As soon as it starts I get booted',
       'I\'ve played this game a few days now, all of a sudden it freezes and crashes. This file has corrupted my new SD card, has uninstalled it\'s self along with any memory on my sd card.... I even downloaded it again as I expected everything is gone... Gone! Great game just not worth the bugs!' ,

      'I play real poker and do pretty well. This game is clearly made to force you to lose your chips and buy chips. They are obvious bots, and the amount of time I have a great hand on a turned and get called by absolutely  nothing but lose on the river is just unreal. I understand it happens, but it happens way too often in this. I have spent alot of real money on thia game in the past, and now I just remembered why I actually stopped playing it',
       'I would like the game very much never had to spend it on time kind of addictive. I can figure the game out sometimes very easily other times not. You can usually tell whether you\'re going to be lucky (those are the times to hit the slot machine while you\'re playing). Sometimes the hardest part e dealing with it dummies who think it\'s bingo. And sometimes I got to admit how you had enough time and I\'ll play that way too but that\'s usually when the game teaches you a lesson at other times it\'s very predictable and I know that I\'m going to get that hand but it\'s fun',
       'Fun game. Most of what I know about this game, I\'ve actually learned by playing it on this app. And yes, it\'s very addictive!! And yes, anyone with negative comments???...they haven\'t taken the time to REALLY know & learn the game & it\'s rules. Just because ya lose...doesn\'t make it a bad game!! LEARN THE GAME & ITS RULES, SPEND A LITTLE TIME ACTUALLY PLAYING, (WITH GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP)...AND YOU\'LL LOVE IT. The more ya play, the better it gets!!',
       'More ad pushes and Facebook posting than anything I\'ve over downloaded. Posts without asking and you can\'t play a single game without 20 notifications asking you to spend money or share it with friends. Popular game but can\'t do anything for 10 minutes after opening app until you sift through all the nonsense they throw at you.',
       'I just left a table after winning big with four 3s. Next hand got beat by four 9s. If you can handle ridiculous hands, bad opponents and repeatedly getting bad beaten by 1% chances on the river then you will love this game. And for some stupid reason I do üòÇ',
       'There\'s a small bug - once you lost all your money in a tournament, you can\'t see the cards of the other opponents after the show down... Besides that, the app is perfect. I wish I could have this interface in real life games.' ,

      'I hate this game cause one, you can\'t even change the decorations or visitors. Two, you can\'t even get coins for completing a level and the daily wheel is rigged cause you can\'t get anything good. Three, if you watch a video for a reward or life, it never gives you anything. And four, they don\'t give you enough moves for each level, there are too many ads and everything\'s so overpriced. Hate this bullcrap gameüò°',
       'A great game, but WAAAAY  too many ads. Its the same thing after each level: AN AD. The game is fun, but its hard to enjoy when you\'re watching ads every second. And Im getting the same ads over and over! I want to rate five stars, I really do, but I cant if there\'s going to be this many ads in a game I think everyone would enjoy. üíõüíõüíõüíõ‚ô° (( pretend the hearts are stars )) I\'ll download the game again once I see less ads in your games, like My Talking Angela, which also has way too many ads. Please take this into consideration! Thank you!',
       'The game was great until they put the ads on there, there are too many and 90% of the time I try to "x" out of one, it takes me to the play store anyway, and the game freezes a lot more now. It\'s also frustrating you can\'t alter the decorations. Game needs some improvements, and I hope they address them because it\'s quite fun to play.',
       'I am so disappointed in this game due to the fact my 3 year old somehow bypassed my password and spent 79.99 on coins!!! I sent a message immediately to Google play and the developer and I was told it doesn\'t meet the refund requirements. WTH?!! So frustrating! üò°',
       'This game would be a whole lot of fun IF there weren\'t so many ads! My niece is not patient enough to wait for stupid ads to finish, and u can\'t play the game until the ad is finished! Very disappointed!',
       'Love this game. Super fun but how do you get rid of ads? I paid for coins yet i still have ads. This is highly annoying especially if i can\'t skip them. Still love the game just not the ads :(' ,

      'Good, with a major flaw I\'ve ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I\'ll tap, and the game won\'t register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I\'m on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I\'ve closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It\'s an issue I\'d like to see fixed.',
       'I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME This is good game design. It rewards you no matter how high you go with a beautiful little tower. The colors are really satisfying. It keeps me engaged since you can "regrow" your blocks. That creates tension too--something to strive for. It\'s so simple but soothing and really addictive!!',
       'A Great Game For When You\'re Dumpin\'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin\' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I\'m in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren\'t too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I\'m happy to say that. I don\'t like to stay too long. Great game!',
       'So,  basically it\'s a pretty fun app to play when you\'re bored. It\'s a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It\'s a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don\'t really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!',
       'Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn\'t have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic.' ,

      'Lost all of my bikes when I re-download the app. It shows the 500+ wins I have, but I don\'t even see a way to get the basic ones unlocked again without paying for their stupid VIP package. It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven\'t bothered to update this in years.',
       'Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can\'t stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn\'t happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can\'t buy any of the bikes.',
       'After only playing a few short but addicting levels, I am already having a blast! The game may not look spectacular on a technical level. But the gameplay is so freaking fun! And the controls aren\'t too complicated either. Recommended for everyone!',
       'It\'s a fun little game at first, but has many, many flaws. You have to link it to your Facebook account if you wanna play all maps. There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can\'t play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That\'s just ridiculous. Not to mention it\'s very buggy. Sometimes you\'re racing someone who\'s in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it\'s just stupid.',
       'Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you\'re racing friends.',
       'Bugs and Glitches... Multiplayer links are not being sent back and forth properly. Some games keep giving me desert level 1 and not showing any replays or ghost bikes are doing a different levels then the one I am suppose to be racing against. Please Fix!!!' ,

      'Should be called adzy. During the level theres an ad banner at the bottom. At the end of every level there\'s an ad, some you can\'t skip and have to wait an entire 30 secs to sit through. To make matters worse, the chests can be boosted by 50% by watching, you guessed it, an ad.  They don\'t even give you a shop option to remove ads for a small amount of money or some sort of package. Pure plain greed',
       'It stopped working on my One plus! Help! I was excited about the side games! *********************************** Excellent, addictive fun. I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn\'t level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can\'t progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.',
       'Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It\'s nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don\'t want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn\'t get a key.',
       'All in all it is a really great game there are very few ads, its fun, the graphics are crisp. Its amazing except for one thing. On one of the levels all of the monsters have exactly 666 health and im not religious or anything but I\'m pretty sure that if some one who is religious see\'s that, well lets just say that it might not be good for the company, so I suggest you fix this.  Thanks.',
       'Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion.',
       'Fun game but takes forever to get gold to upgrade. The cost to pay for the gems to buy so you can buy gold is really expensive. Not much dynamic to the game. Same stuff on each level just takes longer to bet enemies cause of higher HP.' ,

      'Nice game. I like the concept of rebuilding but this game was meant to kill time, I hope so. Keep adding characters and what we require is a hell lot of mini games so that they may keep coming and coming and coming. I do not intend to harass you but try to add more and more mini games after each update. I\'m sure that in the course of  time you may be able to compete with the best games ever created but do not make the game larger than DWTD 2. Add more new locations too otherwise we will not be able to consume the tokens. The game is nice because you do not have to consume money for characters and get them through gifts instead. It is also nice because tokens can be collected easily. Please think about my opinions. I‚ù§ this game.',
       'The character models are cute and all, but the games are getting a bit repetitive. WAY too many ads. Like, ridiculously too many. The app forces a couple right after you finish some of the minigames. You have enough to offer us - forcing even more ads on top of that is tiresome. Get rid of them.',
       'Dumb ways to die 3 gets 3 stars. No, seriously, I loved the first 2, but this one is not good. Only 4 minigames, not really different each from another. Remember FASTER FASTER FASTER ? It disappeared (I miss it), and is now ADS ADS ADS. The goal here is just to use money and play as often as you can for ADS ADS ADS. The main thing here ? Minigames ? Nooooo, just getting (or buying) tokens and use them to repair houses (no impact on gameplay). Why would this game be nice ? The graphics are still good. Yes, that\'s all. Have a nice day. ADS ADS ADS',
       'Best game of all time I mean you have to try this or else your life could be boring and lonely the 1st and 2nd are also really good check em out and you can\'t live with out this game. My point is best game ever',
       'Best Game Ever And After just adding Dippy and Pillock I finished all the characters even though before I got the update I finished collecting all characters by getting Dunce then I went to play it through app stores and update it And now I have All the characters again I love your really wonderful  games and they started off as an advert about being safe around trains my favourite song the games are my favourite games ever as well Thanks so much for brightening my day Metro.',
       'To be honest, I don\'t think this game updated at ALL. Dumb ways to die 1 and 2 were GREAT but this one... not so GREAT.  First of all,  there are only for games that you could play.  Second,  it\'s not as creative as the other ones. And third,  the only good thing about it is that for ME there are no ads.  The list goes on but that\'s for you to find out and for me to uninstall. üòêüòêüòêüòêüòüüòüüòüüòüüò¢üò≠   Im VERY disappointed' ,

      'Ok.....we need an aquarium just for the holiday\'s.  I cleaned out one aquarium and that\'s all I have in there is the holidays.  After this session I\'ll probably save one just for Christmas itself.  Love the unlimited times! Keep the surprises coming!! I don\'t like so many clocks in one game and the "timed" games are insane! It is definitely challenging.  I play several times a day if possible.',
       'Great game but would love it more if it kept track of when you bought something . Like a little quantity number in the corner after you purchase a fish or decorations. Hard to save up to buy things for guests, sucks when you buy something you already have when trying to complete a task. Other then that it\'s a great game lol I enjoy playing it.',
       'Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I\'m 32 and play this often so it\'s not just for kids . Give it a try it\'s very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen üòâ',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.',
       'Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can\'t do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!',
       'I dont think we should have to buy diamonds that are ours already. The decorations are too exspensive and it looks like I, along with a few other players will be uninstalling Fishdom bc you guys are just con artist. We are hard working, good ppl that shouldnt have to buy the "bank" that is ours to begin with. Yall really nd to fix this before everyone stops playing' ,

      'I kind of enjoy the game but would like it more if there were cheaper options to buying. After you buy some the prices jump to 99.99 and have yet to see cheaper prices. I\'m not unloading that in one go. The people of this game would probably make more money if they bring cheaper prices. I would buy several different little packs that eventually add up to 100 bit you ain\'t getting nothing otherwise. Also wish you could buy more things with the gold you purchased. Like have a choice to spend loyalty or gold',
       'When it\'s not crashing, it\'s fun to play.  Sucks when it doesn\'t load of locks up during game play.  Also it gets expensive as you have to buy packs at $99 a pop after the 1st 2.  The game play is addicting, but no fun if you cannot afford the special offers they continue to throw in your face every time you log in.  I love final fantasy games but this particular one is a money pit!.  Not to mention the constant crashing',
       'I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.',
       'This game has potential to be fun but it\'s completely ruined because IT\'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don\'t get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it\'s full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it\'s a complete money bucket!',
       'This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.',
       'The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it\'s free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15' ,

      'I have loved Hot Wheels for years and this is a good game. Fun and challenging. However I have been a bit frustrated because sometimes I just explode for touching a wall like on level 6. Awesomeüòí Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don\'t reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie\'s handling. I cannot get up a hill with it. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.',
       'Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I\'ve never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.',
       'The game is good. There are problems though. D-muscle is absolutely useless. It\'s the worst car in the muscle set and has no business being the fourth car in that set. The final upgrades for the fourth car on all sets are far too expensive. It requires an insane amount of grinding to unlock the last cars. The prices of supercharged upgrades are all over the place. Why do all of Haulinator\'s cost 100 coins while Dune It Up\'s cost 1000-2000?',
       'Lost all in app purchases which amounts to stealing. Beware of doing in app purchases. Way to many ads. App also crashes a lot. Support said they would help then didn\'t respond after that. If my son was able to lose his progress and the money we sunk in the game because he was using multiple devices and didn\'t know what Cloud and Local meant which cause him to lose his progress then mabe this game shouldn\'t be labeled E for Everyone. Change the rating to Teen if they have to know what cloud means or risk losing there in app purchases.  Google change the rating on this game.',
       'The game is my little boys favourite but the recent batch of adverts in game (Yahoo specifically) don\'t close - meaning you have to force quit the game. Lazy programming and terrible QA process from the developers. Avoid.',
       'Whoever decided to put the HW Poppa wheelie in the game is an idiot. Loved this game until i came across that car. Im seconds away from fully upgrading and moving on but i couldnt let it go. That car is a load of frustration.' ,

      'I really like it, turn based strategy, probably one of the best games I had on this phone yet. There are a few fun tribes you can buy (or rather should buy) and I think spending a few bucks for a game like this is absolutely fine. Just keep an eye on the time, half an hour flies away if you don\'t pay attention ^^',
       'Love game, but why the auto start, in my opinion, no app should auto start, app should only be turned on when in use, fix this or I uninstall. GEEZ, all you developers think your app is only one used, get a clue! Then why do I keep getting a "Poytopia has stopped" message every time I start a session on my tablet, even though I did not play Polytopia during last session.',
       'I love this game hence the 5 star. But the multiplayer needs some work, if I wanna play a game with a friend in 1 sitting I have to reload the map each turn. If the turns could progress without reloading the game that would be awesome. Also, I had a bug that made me replay a turn a few times in multiplayer for some reason after I returned to the game.',
       'Fantastic mobile game. It\'s a great pocket sized Civilization-style game. Quick games with the depth and variation to keep you immersed.  Unfortunately, the multiplayer update doesn\'t seem to be functioning very stably at the moment. My friend (Verizon iPhone) and myself (Sprint Android) have been trying to play some matches, but we keep getting turns where we can\'t move our units, or gain resource points to spend. As it\'s an indie-developed game, I understand it\'s tough to test every permutation of devices and connections. I\'m hopeful and looking forward to subsequent updates and bugfixes. Keep up the great work!',
       'balanced and very deep. You have fulfilled everything I ask for in the last review whether you read it or not. The \'modes\' list is a little sparse, however, and it would be great if you would plan some modes as a side project or something. Not that it is easy making a new mode. Well nonetheless, god job',
       'There have been 2 games in the play store that I have enjoyed enough to buy everything they have to offer The battle of polytopiya is one of them. This is a great game for Appers that like turn based, strategy based gameplay from very easy to impossibly hard. I was just thinking to myself how awesome it would be if this game had online multiplayer... woke up today to online multiplayer, very satisfied. I am sure that it will be expanded and improved so I\'m not going to suggest anything yet. Enjoyed everything about this game, would like to see some merch being sold soon, I would very much like to support the developer.  You have brought joy to my life. Thank you.' ,

      'Pretty good design, but there is a cheater mode which tells you when one is wrong even if it\'s not apparent. So the fastest times are always really fast even for the hard ones. Also the ad bar is right below the numbers so you accidentally hit it when you play. Pretty sure that\'s intentional to get extra clicks, but super annoying.',
       'My wife and I play this game like an old couple as we wait for our son to sleep, sure enough - we all doze off!  This game makes the brain go, sometimes my brain goes so hard that smoke comes out my ears.  Beautiful. Thank you for the gift of this game, we\'ve shared about the light it brings into our lives.   That\'s a good ending.',
       'Great game for keeping your mind active and gives me something to do on my phone.  If there was a way to get rid of the adds then it would be even better.  I wouldn\'t expect a free game to be advert free; but I would like a feature to remove them even if I have to pay.',
       'having lots of fun with the game, especially the daily challenges. But  ads that cannot be skipped pops up way too often, and its quite irritating. Also it would b good if u can ad d something like automatically mark (diff cotour, shade out) the numbers thats already been fully filled so we dont have to check it manually.',
       'I like this very much. I don\'t mind the ads in the game but the reason I gave it only 2 stars are all the loud ads in between the games. Unbelievably annoying. Specially when you get one in the middle of the night on the long distance bus.',
       'The game in itself isn\'t bad but I\'ve completed a puzzle in 10 minutes and for the past half an hour I don\'t know what to do next, does it pop up on the screen \'You have finished\' or do we just move on? I\'ve been looking for any place that I\'ve gone wrong but I haven\'t found any' ,

      'Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I\'ll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily "less than 20 coins" reward. Sooooooo cheap!',
       'It\'s just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that\'s a good question.',
       'Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don\'t ever plan to, but here you also don\'t really need to. I\'ve won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you\'re not forced to watch them. It\'s not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.',
       'Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don\'t even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.',
       'Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn\'t be putting people in the "club" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this "club" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they\'re INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game',
       'Would be good if someone actually thought about what they were making. This is an over computerized auto random winning when that person didnt actually win game. Many flaws need to be fixed. Start from scrat ch and make a more user friendly uno to play with my actual friends, not random people until I make it to level 5. Not cool.' ,

      'Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh',
       'I love the game but its frustrating when you have all 8 Spartans and the sword guys get in the way so maybe an extras set of controls to control where your men start or something. Also for me the screen keeps jumping I try to look at enemy and I catch a glimpse but then it jumps to my side then back again and again and again please fix this.',
       'I think that this game brings back memories of the times that we all played on the first one and seeing this new one with more actions and abilitys and many more things to do is just what I would expect from something from the old stick war 1 game and I just would love to see more stick war games like these overall I love this game and I think it was the best',
       'This game is amazing I love war games like this please make more levels and more characters and online battles it will be fun and make a castle not a camp like...  A tower defence mode where you defend your home castle',
       'This is one of the most awesome game of all time and thanks to the creators you can play it on mobile too. But it still lack some awesome components, 1. Add Chaos Empire, 2. Add multiplayer!!! Overall still AWESOME!!!',
       'You know,  its a shame because this is a fantastic game. There is ZERO balancing. The entire game is designed to force you into using gems and micro transactions to get past abnormally difficult gameplay walls.' ,

      'Graphics were generic until now for x86 devices. Thanks for that update. And that moving data to sd card, it is really appreciable since now a days even 32 gb  not sufficient. Hope other game developers get inspiration from this. And downloading just updated part is also an improvement instead of downloading whole data again. 4 stars because this game just wont allow to play older version once it finds out new version is present.',
       'Asphalt 8 airborne is a very exciting game to play. The addition of bikes is mind blowing. Wish all time limited events could be on mobile data rather than wifi. Thumbs up gameloft for an exciting game. After the recent update of this app it keeps crashing with a pop-up message "unfortunately asphalt 8 has stopped working". Please fix this issue.',
       'I\'m addicted to this game, I love it. And with this new story mode update  I\'ve got more excited, I won all the starting races and now waiting for the refill. Only one thing that is negative, it is the upgrades are too much expensive and takes a huge time to gather coins versus the escalating events and this is depressing. I hope that game developers will fix this problem and make it fair enough.',
       'Munich update completely ruined what was previously the best driving experience on mobile. EDIT: Fall Out Boy update basically makes me unable to play the game altogether, with the game constantly freezing at the Gameloft splash screen. Talk about letting the junior devs do all the work unsupervised...',
       'This fallout boy update really sucks. Two stars for past glory but this needs fixed. Wont load multiplayer and takes several tries to launch the app at all. Either a white screen or gameloft logo hanging endlessly. And tbh I dont like the blurry nitro thing. I get it, but hope it goes away in the next update.',
       'As racing games go, this is probably the best. The graphics, sound, gameplay are excellent. Race solo, against friends or the world. The variety of ways to race is big. The selection of cars and now bikes, keeps getting bigger. The only down side is buying something from the shop or on offer. I purchased a special offer and never got it. They got my money, I never got the goods. Trying to get in contact with them is a joke. All replies to my emails were automated responses telling me to do the same thing over and over again.' ,

      'Between ads completely over running gameplay and the new requirement of having to earn stars to proceed, Rovio continues to run this once great game into the ground. **Update** game now freezes randomly requiring a force close. This is beyond ridiculous. I HATE what this franchise has become. Rovio should be ashamed.',
       'This game used to be awesome, sadly I have just removed it due to the star issue. I used to be able to play for fun, however, due to the its current standing, one MUST achieve three stars in each level in order to play other levels. Madness! Great job for taking the fun out of a game!',
       'Love this game but keeps freezing, a lot! It\'s more frustrating since the update where it costs 30 coins for the telescope but only get 5 minutes instead of 10 now and half the time my games frozen and the time runs out FIXXX',

And this is first time i\'m very exited when i managed to finish a level, even after that, i repeat again till i can surpass it perfectly.

       'Pretty cool..It was actually a little more than i expected.  The bikes are cool. They seem to be modeled after actual bikes, but perhaps didnt want to pay 4 the licensing to use actual manufacturer names.',
       'One of the best motorcycle game to date, weather conditions are great, bikes are great and handling is great, but the bad ai on higher difficulty level a few times are ridiculous and messes up everything.  Sometimes a truck speeds up to 150km/h just to close off that small gap, where you could slip through, but next time all cars in all lane slow down at once, so you can\'t pass anywhere, even though there\'s nothing in front of them. This is really annoying, when every second counts and there\'s no way to pass them for 4-7 seconds. Apart from this the game is great. The keep changing weather conditions is great too.',
       'There are some idiot missions such as combo overheading. I would give this game 5 stars if not those missions.',
       'Gave one star less because the missons lack mathematical accuracy There was this level to travel 8 kms in 130s and it was showing it an easy mission with a bike of top speed 172 kph üòÇ The graphics and gameplay are superb I like the game' ,

      'When I first started playing this game I thought it was great. Big wins but the further you go the more impossible the challenges to beat and no where enough credits to beat them unless you buy and way to expensive to buy for the amount of credits you get. The daily bonus only comes 1 or 2 times a week, funny I thought there was only 24 hours in a day. It\'s fun until you get to the higher levels.',

      'The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I\'d like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.',
       'Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It\'s very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again',
       'Game is basic in its features. The worst part of the game is the trade hq. Rather than letting you buy directly off the hq menue you have to load the other players city. If your phone doesnt load it as fast as someone else they can snipe the goods you need to buy.',
       'I love this game but I want to tell you. You Simcity global HQ building have a problem . And I think all through the world of simcity player face this problem . Your global HQ trade only  View u wanted things like if I want Cement than I searched one HQ building than HQ bulid view me More  And more same thing like burger and sugar and franch FRi and etc things  And few other things like glass and etc I want that the HQ building show one type. Of things like if cement 1 and 2 glass 3 matel 4 cap etc etc than like I want so sir please üòÖ try',
       'This is a great game,very addicting, but can you please fix the glitch that makes everything either too big or too small. The contest of mayors screen doesnt even show up  only shows up one third. Will rate higher once this is fixed, its very annoying',
       'Simply the BEST city building & city management game on the PlayStore.  It\'s great fun and many things to build and do.. Weekly events to keep you occupied. City management so you need to actually think before you do. (Example, don\'t build sewers near suburbs or inner-city) Beautiful graphics, plenty of various types of buildings, leveling and so much more.  Love it.' ,

      'I wish I could post pictures, but the game is too easy. I beat the first 2 levels both on one attempt. Though I am an experienced geometry dash player. But if I can beat a level first try, not knowing the course at all, that\'s some easy stuff. I highly recommend geometry dash sub zero though.',
       'I love every Geometry Dash version! And this one might be the best. But my only downfall is that the music, which is freaking awesome,gets ahead of the actual gameplay and I miss my jumps. Plz fix and I\'ll rate 5 stars! But keep up the good work!',
       'Great fun but needs more levels. I laughed when I saw a review made by an idiot because he said this was a copy of the Impossible Game LOL it\'s the other way around, dumbass.',
       'Hardly worth downloading. I love the full version of the game and figured this world be similar, or at least have some interesting levels, but much to my dismay it does not. The levels are easy and somewhat boring, which is unfortunate because Geometry Dash is usually neither of those things.',
       'THIS GAME IS AWESOME PLZ MAKE THE COMING SOON Levels Music kind of more like the seven seas music THANKS and also I rated 5 stars on every thing on this game and P.S. could you please make the coming soon levels more faster dear fellows, thanks',
       'Love the songs, especially The Seven Seas (I enjoy the Irish feel) and Viking Arena (dark and cool beats to it) not so much Airborne Robots, probably because it sounds so happy and joyful that it seems to mock your struggle (like Jumper in the original GD).   Only reason I ever uninstall is because I have beaten the levels and need space for apps, but it seems I always eventually reinstall and play the levels again just for the fun of it (even if it gets frustrating at points)' ,

       'Would be a good game if you didn\'t have to wait 9 hours to fill your energy. Also says I have no internet connection so cant watch ads to unlock things after being forced to watch a 30 second ad... A little confusing',
       'Well the game is okay but its so laggy and there is no commentary, its like playing football with no commentary. Pliz add that and then the life regeneration time is too long. Make it 30mins at least. Conteols need improvement and finally the guy run like fellaini. Speed is low it neexs a fix.',
       'The adds killed the game, every time you do anything it\'s a 30s video and it kills the game. I loved the old games and it hasn\'t moved on much over the years apart from the new game modes that you have to pay for',
       'I love this game, however you people should have improved on RN16. Not make a game that is lesser. The dynamics of this one doesn\'t work. Amazing game, just listen to people like us that paid to play it and improve on the small details....please',
       'Is fun for a bit but no chance of winning on pro mode. Impossible to get a turnover or regain ball in the ruck for long. Need to keep scoring off of kick off. Also more ad watching than actual playing the fame' ,

      'This is the best game I have ever played! This game changed my life. The controls are great, and so is the gameplay! I get a deep feeling of satisfaction every time that pigeon eats that delicious fruit. Also you have a great art style man! I\'ve never seen such good, original art in a game like this! Truly amazing! Just kidding, I know you stole that art. This game is horrible.  I hope it gets banned soon.',
       'Listen, I only have this five stars because I want everyone to see this. This game is blatant plagiarism! There is an artist who animated these birds, and the creators of this game stole their art from them! DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. Lawyers have been called, and I expect it to be taken down soon. Please leave a negative review so this game fails! Thank you for reading.',
       'Had to see for myself if it is really plagiarism and I have to say it is so.  I had some doubt at first, but I know for sure now that the animation work is completely stolen.  Now if only you made your own animations you wouldn\'t have your game in jeopardy!  It appears the whole appeal of this inherently bland gameplay is the visuals of dancing birds.  Shame!',
       'This is not a legitimate game. All the artwork and animation featured in the game design is plagiarised from Kevin Gemin, a freelance artist on several platforms. To take and profit from the hard work of an artist and not credit them let alone ask permission is below the scum of the earth. Don\'t download this trash and instead allow me to redirect to the proper source of "inspiration." YouTube - kekeflipnote Tumblr - k-eke Tumblr Twitter - @Kekeflipnote Facebook - @Kekeflipnote Deviantart - kokorokeke Patreon - Keke',
       'All artwork in this game was a ripped animation from k√©k√©flipnote. Do not rate this game high. It\'s committed a crime. It\'s not even subtle about it. The game literally uses the exact same animation but retextured. If you want to help go to the bottom of this page and report it for copycat/impersonation, or go into other and write plaigarism.',
       'The animations in this game are blatantly plagiarized from Kevin Gremin. You would think that a small indie studio would be respectful of freelance artists and their work, but that\'s not the case with Fortafy Games. This is shameful and needs to be removed from this platform, along with apologies and compensation to the artists you stole from.' ,

      'Graphics are awesome, but the game itself is very monotonous. You can fall asleep waiting for something to change and make it more exciting. When a change such as an added bonus does come (bomb or a rainbow bubble) you realize that it wasn\'t worth the 20 or 30 levels you just wasted your time on. Progressive enticing events need to happen more quickly.',
       'On level 19 I scored three stars bit it shows only two. Aside from that, no other complaints... YET. I will say thank you, though, for not aggressively pushing ads, pushing to pay to extend the aim line. So far, its amusingüòÅ',
       'Game is good without any aproblem it do works. It\'s not a game a advertising app, isn\'t this too much hance i know you developers make money on the game but just because of this much ennoying adds when people uninstall this app you won\'t be able to make anything out of your effort can you???',
       'I thought the levels would be more difficult by now I\'m on 143 at the moment. I enjoy the game but I\'m getting a bit bored with the easiest of challenges and without having to use the help button . I hope the game will  get more challenging soon.   Grandson aged 5 will like playing this game.',
       'This is a really fun game but my  my concerns are that when I have no balls left, for me it doesn\'t have the option to play a video to earn more but for my brother it does therefore it makes me start all over again. The other concern is that when I use a bomb for the chest it takes away a ball for example I have 12 balls when I use the bomb from the chest, I get 11 balls left which it doesn\'t do that for my brother. I hope you can fix this.',
       'Plays good at first then only gives u balls u dont need like 15 yello balls in a row or how i keep loosing cuz ill ame somewere and it firest were ever it wants or when u click on the chest it fires the ball or how if someone txts u the game has to restart no matter were u are. During the restart u must close 5 adds to play the game agian' ,

That\'d be great! Shorter back end allows spins to come around way faster. But be more unstable for grinds and manuals. Please add these features!!! Thanks for the great game!',

      'Do not spend any money on this game. This used to be one of the best slot games until the developers got greedy. Payouts are small and events are nearly impossible. They try to make it all sound good but it\'s not. They also changed the customer service on here where it\'s hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!',
       'I have played this game for many months I have purchased and yet with all the updates you all do it keeps getting worse the payouts on the slots are horrible. The group event games are picked I think to take all our chips so we will be forced to buy I believe that until you make the payouts on the slots better you are going to lose a lot of customers.',
       'Disappointing, Unless you purchase chips.. you can not keep up with the Club event games.  There is no real incentive to continue. IN order to even play you will need to Start with chips over 5 Billion chips.( which you don\'t get) Otherwise you will never even have a fighting chance, as you will be betting low and never gaining.... Or get high.. lose all quick. And then quit.. Or You can Pay out of your pocket.. over and over....',
       'I urge people to stay as far away as possible from this 1! They are robbing lying cheating scumbags, using illegal and and fraudulent tactics to get money from your bank account in to theirs! Such as offering deals and then not giving you what you have paid for! Investigation underway!',
       'Considering the game is called BILLIONAIRE CASINO, the payouts are too little to support the name.  In the first couple of weeks on starting with the game payouts are great then like all other games you are on a continuous loss to PURCHASE COINS. Happy gaming.',

      'I know a lot of people seem to not like this game but I actually really enjoy it the only thing I don\'t like is the lack of sound.   It would be nice if there was background music of some kind and a glass breaking sound effect when you went through each barrier something pleasing to the ears  Oh and shorter ads would also probably be good.  It could also use more roads and balls and barriers to work towards. I feel like this game has a lot of potential though hope it keeps being updated.',
       'This is a very addictive game. I don\'t understand why people don\'t like it. Fast paced. As for the adds, you people should turn your internet off and play. It will help.. ##VOODOO## Would you accept a video from me? You can use it for advertising purposes. I thought it might be of great help for you.  Please get back to me by replying. I would be happy to email the video to you..',
       'The game is fine. But OMG the ads....they make you watch an ad every few seconds until you pay for the premium version. This is just sick. I mean games do have ads but the number of ads in this game are unbearable. Very frustrating . So if you are looking for a free game THIS IS NOT IT.',
       'The game is very enjoyable, and it\'s pleasing to the eyes. I like that you can fall off course and redeem yourself if you make it back within 5 seconds. The ads are pretty excessive though. I\'m all for supporting a free to play game with advertisements, and at first I didn\'t have a problem with the ads. You get an advertisement after every game but they\'re often just picture ads or skippable after 5 seconds. I draw the line when you go e me an ad after every game and there are 30 second ads that you\'re forced to watch. If you\'re going to make me watch an ad give me an ad every 3 to 5 games at least.',
       'Hey Developer! This is Great Job!. But, if there are other players who have the disease "Afraid of Heights", this game will not be suitable for him. You make players Cringe (Afraid), because there is no music. This game like a Dark Theme Games.',
       'Maybe you could add coins, for example each gate you go through could +1 Coin and you need like 290 Coins to upgrade your airtime by a few seconds or milliseconds, although the sound is not very good due to no sound at all. Very good game although!' ,

Please fix this in my account. Otherwise, I love the game. Remember to buy something to fix the ads.  Edit: I sent customer support an email with a screen shot a month ago. There has been no response.',
       'Stay away unless you plan on paying money.  The devs force ads in almost everything you do, and I\'m pretty sure they aren\'t vetted as one of them seemed to take control of my screen. Great potential way to serve up malware to your customers.',
       'I like merging games, but this one has a huge ad issue that makes the game somewhat frustraiting to play. I\'ll click the store to buy a house and it will auto start an ad video. It\'s lacking a bit in the story line department too. For a base merging game it\'s simple and fun, but definitely needs some work.',
       'Nice mindless game, fun for when you want to just chill out. Would have given more stars,  but it seems upgrades are temporary. I won\'t be wasting my money getting better boxes,  the one I bought didn\'t even last 5 minutes! Such a waste of $4.',
       'Ever wanted to be Mayor? Ever wanted to run a town, develop the land, and see a metropolis grow? Well, look no further than Animal Crossing cuz this game does none of those things. You just merge buildings into better buildings. It is fun, if you spend money so that you\'re not bombarded with ads. But then you run the risk of being unable to watch ads when you want to to do things like double your earnings or unlock a better building from the mystery box.',

       'Can\'t disable or lower sound in game. Seems like such a basic mechanism to be missing. Overall feels incomplete, with an unbalanced economy based on advertisements with no real progression coming from play time. Decent concept, poorly executed.',
       'All you do is watch ads. Start the game, you get an ad. Play one round (rounds last about 30 seconds), watch an ad. Play two rounds, watch an ad. Want to double your earnings from last round? Watch an ad. Play a round. Game crashes. Open the game. Watch an ad. The game itself would be ok but the constant bombardment of ads is just too much. Literally half of the time spent in the game is just watching ads.',
       'There seem to be way more ads than in earlier versions. it\'s getting a little ridiculous, especially early on where a round might only last a minute or two with a 30 second ad between each round.',

       'A nice game but there\'s to many adds. They\'re on the screen as you play, they\'re pushed every second game and the rewards are nerfed so you gotta watch more adds if you don\'t want to grind more, something that will pop more adds sooooo...

      'They keep killing you to make more money. You can grow as much as you wish, whether you pay or not, these devs will just create more fake accounts to create revenue. Very unethical practices and immaturity is at the peak too. They have absolutely no professionalism. They openly admit that you can\'t beat them at their own game and will tell you in a very shameless way that the money is all they care about. Kids with ego keep buying stuff and they keep fuelling racial hate through their Chinese profanity all the time. Literally the worst game devs I\'ve ever seen. Would be 5 stars if this was not a fraud scheme of a game.',
       'After a week of play , I am getting to attack smaller cities , KILL KILL,  grate time filler,  some sexier clothing options for the (ladies) would be nice,  lots to do and manage, clans mates are important, so chose wisely. I am enjoying this immensely.  Edit after (time seems like forever,)  I am really enjoying this,  Negotiated a couple of Peace Treaties, built my crew and strength, I am getting to be a force to reckon with... But there are still bigger fish, frustrating  Would love a feature to hunt the attacker, but then that would backfire too,   Great game...lots of challenges and opportunities for growth,  Highly recommended   *****',
       'It\'s your standard "GOW" clone with a Godfather ripoff motif.  You know the formula: spend money, build fast, get stomped by the kiddies with access to daddy\'s credit card who spend thousands of $$$.    Guaranteed to trigger the easily offended due to scantily clad women.  Hilariously bad "Engrish" text throughout the game.    Just get your currency for whatever other game it is you play as fast as possible and move on.',
       'I have been playing for a little over a month. However I feel there is some cheating going on and I have a feeling it\'s by some of the larger clans. I\'m starting to question the security of the game. My clans game clock is causing issues. Some good some very bad. All of my resources were collected and 2 hours later it\'s full. Another clan mate bought a 24 hour drive and was attacked by the leading clan in my city. All of these were experienced just before and while the attack was going on. Shame on the game for allowing this to happen in the game developers clans favor.',
       'Newbie dont play this game. It\'s was fun at first then you follow the instructions as normal. But at the end of the day you will get stuck and you will run out of supplies.. Their idea is to make you buy.',
       'I think this could possibly be the worst game for GM support ever. If you need help after paying, Don\'t worry someone with broken English will appear, answer a different question then leave. Mind blowingly stupid.' ,

      'If there is anything that would make me quit playing this game, it would be ads. I don\'t mind ads but ads are just way too much and take away the fun of this game.  Apart from that game also freezes sometimes and there are some glitches too.',
       'Really fun game. Lots of levels. Really like tournament and duels. I feel like there\'s some cheating in the tournaments. When I watch the videos some people seem to not be touching the ground. That\'s pretty lame. Other than that great game',
       'That\'s crazy you allow hackers to have the highest score and also show the video. Say that person isn\'t cheating and I\'ll show you a video where he shows how he does it. A-hole.',
       'Fun...until you had to beat an opponent to proceed to next level. These opponents are too much of a jump up on the difficulty of that level. So can\'t pass...no longer fun...uninstalling',
       'Have a problem touching the multi-tasking button Wichita spawn commercials while I\'m racing. And it\'s my favorite game. Thanks',

       'It\'s gr8 and all, but there are some things that I want. First is crouching, it\'s impossible to build bridges if I\'m always falling, Second is sound FX, for me it\'s too quiet and the fact of footsteps and moos and oinks and clucks is very good. Last IS everyone\'s game enemy, ADS, ads pop up in a few seconds and when building my first house you can forget what part you were on. PLEASE ADD OR FIX THESE THINGS!!!',

      'Whenever you die in the game you start completely over again. And after each game an advertisement plays. Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It\'s a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It\'s very competitive!!! I swear my husband can\'t beat my score no one has lol',
       'It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone\'s or tablets I find it hard to control I don\'t know if anyone else thinks so but that\'s my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company',
       'It\'s good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it\'s my opinion so don\'t get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don\'t have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn\'t play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! üòÄüòÄüòÄ',
       'Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface',
       'start to crash often when playing online. i think it need some sounds or music. playing silent for long time feels like going stupid after long time played. since it so addictive . keep repeating boring play but keeps ppl playing. is fun though, but I think everyone need to keep control how much time played. can\'t believe I can play for like hours haha. don\'t know why my Nick name don\'t show anymore. usually is \'eat uuu\'. but shows as nothing ____ now.',
       'Game lags way to much. I can\'t enjoy it at all. It\'s a waste of an app. You guys really need to fix it. To many people like playing but the lagging has got to stop so the game can be enjoyed. If this game coast two pennies, I wouldn\'t by it. I am uninstalling this game for the 2nd time. Never again. Sucks, cuz I really like playing without the technical difficulties' ,

      'I love the game so far. I\'m not too far in it yet, but I\'m gonna be playing for a while. The one big issue I have with it, is that it is such a battery hog. It pulls so much power that my phone starts to get ridiculously hot and I can burn through a chunk of my battery within 10 minutes of play time',
       'It\'s OK... But the reviews that say you don\'t need to spend money are lying. I have fixed every bench in town for a week and found no cement - but you can buy it for 96 gems. Yea right. Pay to play as always... Also its a bit of a grind game, doing the same things over and over which just get a bit more expensive the more times you do it. Its OK to waste 20mins on but I won\'t be keeping it that long.',
       'Very addicting game! looking forward to new updates and other things to do! I understand why now that i don\'t get diamonds like I use to. thank you for reaching out to me and I understand they are trying to keep fair game play! I would recommend this to anyone, it does not get boring like other simulation games',
       'Loved the game until level about level 10 when I needed to open the bakery to make more sales, need cement to complete opening, I\'ve fixed every park bench in town 5x looking for this material, I\'ve found everything but cement. Unless I purchase Jems I can\'t move on, getting annoyed.',
       'I love this game and the updates. But now that you have to have certain blueprints to upgrade the factories and bakery it\'s taking up way too much room in my shed especially since I need alot of items for the upgrade. Including the shed. I think it\'s a great addition makes it more challenging just irritated at the lack of space.',
       'Love the game. Upgrades takes a bit long and I\'m struggling yo get some items....if only the was a trade with friends option...me and my friend is playing the game and we regularly have the items the other person needs... trading would be cool....even maybe sponsoring some cash to the other person....' ,

      'Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.',
       'Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I\'ve progressed it\'s just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I\'m not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!',
       'Fun at first, but you have to pay a lot of real money for it to stay fun. Otherwise you have to wait weeks and months to progress. Some events can only be fully completed by spending hundreds of dollars (yeah, that much). Not worth it. If you have that much money, use it on something better than this. Improve your life, use your time better, don\'t waste it here. Good luck!',
       'I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I\'ve already dumped into this game and the devs didn\'t give me my in game rewards. I\'ve submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.',
       'Wasn\'t sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to "farm gold,xp,mats". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it\'s an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don\'t be jealous, just play your game and have fun.',
       'Honestly gameplay and all is good but the game is so p2w it\'s not funny, it would cost u over a hundred dollars just to complete every reward for new Valentine\'s event. If you like this game play private server instead this version is a giant cash grab. Not competitive for f2p at all' ,

      'The original sonic dash is better imo. had a better atmosphere, maps looks better gameplay also better. the original was a masterpiece. also, I don\'t like that they introduce scenes that requires you to tilt your phone. since i played sonic dash i didn\'t expect it to be there. it\'s annoying when you\'re laying down and play the game and you got that scene just ruins the gameplay.',
       'The responsiveness of the controls I  this game make it unplayable... it\'s slightly more responsive than the original sonic dash but it\'s still no where near good enough for such a fast paced game.  I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it\'s the same on all of them',
       'Way too many advertisements. I actually downloaded this game because subway surfer makes start over everytime you download it but after my next tech upgrade I\'m going back to that, atleast the game not flooded with ads.',
       'Ads are back. I paid for a red ring bundle, which did remove them for a while, but they\'re back. The only reason I made a real purchase was so that I wouldn\'t have ads, so can someone please remove the ads from my account. On another note, I really like this, and nice to see Shadow playable again.',

      'To many ads, even if they make the game free.. Pathetic. Conflicts with game when trying to back out of them and even crashes. Inconsistent game play, twitchy controls at times. Unplayable shots where one number on power scale is to hard the next one down is to soft.  Multi player has a feel of being rigged at times.  Potential for a good game but not yet in my books.',
       'Super fun game, but WAY TOO MANY crashes. I\'ve been struggling with a level several times only for the game to crash mid-level and I lose all my progress getting booted back to the beginning. Infuriating!',
       'Some observations: ball does not rebound off rails as they should, especially the back and side rails near the hole, where the ball hits the rail and stops dead. Part of miniature golf mastery is using the rails but not in this game. And when the ball is against a rail a shot is allowed as if the rail was not present. After a shot the screen should automatically rotate close to what the next shot would be expected so as to minimize manual rotation. I was making a long swipe to rotate almost 180¬∞ and my finger hit the power slide and an errant shot was made. Most hills are not smoothly sloped but instead very angular. Hitting the bottom of the slope causes the ball to jump in ways unanticipated rather than roll. This is golf, not basketball. I uninstalled the game because it just wasn\'t as fun and realistic as I had hoped.',

      'You have to pay just to see a picture or video. If you want to make money do adds cause if someone is gonna waste there time and money on a story than thats just dumb. Either way change it from paying to adds. Like when you click have a add or in a corner  or even when you start the app. I bet my life that the app will be so much more popular if a change happens. Other than that I like it. Sorry for criticizing',

       'Annoying vibrations !! The vibrations wen \'being phoned\' is annoying especially if u are as addicted as me and play it at night. They are so loud and I have to stop playing at night and in the day because of the vibrations can u add in a feature in the settings that enables u to turn them off!! Except from that this is the best game ever and I ADORE it!!',
       'I love this app but there are a couple downsides to it:  1. Why do you need to pay??? Can\'t it be a one time payment?  2. The vibration is very loud considering I love playing it at night and it wakes everyone up when it\'s video call!!! 3. The amount of time to wait could be reduced to 5 or 10 minutes.  Anyway I hope you can also make an on and off button for vibration! :) Great app though! üòÑ',
       'Why do u have to pay just to see the picture and the videos? What\'s the point to that? U want us to be addicted to it but some of us can\'t buy it for a reason. Please update this and think about it. I know it\'s a low payment. It u want more people to install it. Please consider this thank u!!',
       'It\'s an awesome app but it has it\'s name for a reason. If u don\'t buy the better version, your stuck on cliffhangers for 15 minutes or so. It gets annoying when your in the middle of a good story then it says you have to wait 15(or something) minuted to continue reading' ,

      'This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn\'t as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn\'t there but now it\'s forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.',
       'I really wish you guys didn\'t update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can\'t listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!',
       'Amazing game... Loved it...üòç The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it\'ll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it\'s okay üòä',
       'It\'s an amazing game. Sure I run around my bedroom screening every time I fail next to the end.... but there is something about this game that makes you happy. Is it the music? Maybe. Is it the back ground and the way it moves?possibly. It\'s all of those things plus more   In a nut shell I really really really really really really really really really love this game :p',
       'Seems like controls tend to be problematic, and synchronisation has to be adjusted for every song. However the game is wonderful, precise, compelling and worth spending time on! Everything is well thought, new levels and lines are frequently added. So far my favourite app ever, looking forward to playing some new levels and the match option.',
       'Wow, awesome game. Great controls and idea. However the following levels all fall on the same points. Christmas, valentine, all about us. These levels have bad music, theme, and overall are not fun. I value the old levels more and find them much more fun to play even f2f or the millionth time than the new levels.

      'So far so good, much type of game we can played. Very kind developer give a good item free. I liked it. More costum appereances will be good (dont made weird costums). The minus is city is to small for lot of player like that. Very crowd, i cant even see other player appereances. So camera angle maybe you can make lil bit wider or higher so city can looked much bigger',
       'I cant log in to my acc. Even my friend couldnt too! Once i could and i exit the game to check on something, When i return, it doesnt do the normal reload thing. It brought me back to the main menu n tht i hav to log in again BUT i cant log in. I even uninstalled and installed it back a couple of times. It feels like im just taking chances here to be able to play. This all started in the afternoon for me. Not sure bout the rest. But please take some action about this matter and/or respond to us regarding this matter, Thru facebook or here. I really like the game. Soo please. Help. Explain whats happening. Get it fixed quickly.',
       'The support work really slow. I have top up twice and they aren\'t sent yet to my account. Have report 2 days ago but no reply yet. I only can report the first transaction because the app is not allowed me to report again before the first one is solved. I topped up for event but the event will  end today. If this is solved after goddess kiss event, I just want my money back. I wont delete this until the problem is solved fairly.',
       'I love the game its truLy one of the best but after an update I can hardly play 1 minute at most and suddenly its shows unable to connect, I already checked my connection it was good! What happen? The first time I play it was very smooth..please fix this one..please..please...',
       'Hi. I hope someone can help me. I cannot access my account in Server 141 my Character name: Penguin. Im sure about my email as this is my only email i am using on all of my accounts here at GPC. I just got logged out accidentally and when i logged back in i cannot find all my characters in both servers 131 (scru.iProOo and 141 (Penguin). Please assist. Asap. Godbless.',
       'Had so much fun and thrill in playing the game. Graphics and overall performance is great!! Though i would just like to be helped with my old account.PLEASE HELP ME RETRIEVE MY OLD ACCOUNT :( I want to continue my old progress but since ive changed phone, Id have to redownload and log in in the game. Tho unfortunately you guys updated it from the last time I played it and now, When i log in using my supposed account it kept me getting right from the start in choosing character. How can i get my old character back? Thats so unfair :( I made all effort :( My username is PetLucifer. Also, does server has to do anything in relation to that? Cause i cant remember which server i used to log in' ,

      'So far, I dig this game. Although, the individuality of it is scarce. I still play it and enjoy it. It\'s not identical to other games of this type, as the challenges are similar yet different. The scenario of the game is basic with the others. I have a variety when it comes to games, this one has similar sound affects to other games that I, personally, downloaded. (But they\'re also from the same makers.) This game is over all.... Good so far.. I would recommend, linked my account to this game and invited friends and family. (I only do so, if the game/app is worthy. I\'m a picky bull!!!!) Overall, you\'ll have fun! Cute toys and  unique power ups, with a slightly (10%) twist.',
       'Definitely addicting. The levels are challenging, the tools are fun to figure out and the reward set up is not unattainable. The only other thing is they grew more wise  for the latest update, you can\'t change the time on your phone to add lives anymore! Probably better that way, one (read: I) should pace themselves when playing....',
       'This is by far the most fun I\'ve  had with a game app! Its so cute and  colorful!  And each increase in difficulty  makes you want to keep coming back for the next challenge.  What also makes it awesome  is a no brainer,  its great for children and adults alike.  BIG THUMBS UP!',
       'Really enjoyed the game until I was entered in a two week tournament.  Now, the boards are incredibly difficult and I can no longer earn prizes on a regular basis. Of course, I suppose that\'s by design so I spend money. Which I won\'t do. I just want some "bubblegum" to past the time.  Now, it\'s making my blood pressure rise...  Also amazing how many 5 ‚≠ê ratings they get in one day without the user giving explanations on why. Seems suspicious...',
       'Really an exciting game. But there is a small problem. Sometime when I run the game it\'s not response (all animation are moving, but it isn\'t resopnse when I press the screen) , so I have to close it and run it again many times till it response. Hopefully you will fix this problem ASAP. Thanks!',
       'No really, if there were 100 stars this game and developer would get it! A word of warning....IT\'S ADDICTIVE!! if you ever reach the end of the game ( which is very doubtful) you might have to suffer "withdrawals" or you could play one of the other games...' ,

      'this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates',
       'I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.',
       'LOVE this game!! Literally, I don\'t think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it\'s just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move üòú',
       'A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it\'s really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it.',
       'The game is addictive. Mediocre ratings are because there is a bug. On all games on all levels I\'m getting a network error and I\'m not connected to a network viewing a hint. I have been connected to numerous networks and reset the phone. This needs to be sorted.',
       'Quite addictive and challenging isnt just about solving the puzzle though because requires a certain amount of precision in drawing various shapes that work within the games physics. One mistake and time to restart. Addictive nonetheless and provides some good challenges and perhaps outside the box thinking. Perhaps the drawing tools could be more precise e.g different brush thicknesses? would help but bloody bloody bloody good anyway..' ,

      'All was good until today..i have entered the game and when i go to battle none if my screens or skills or even my level selection will show up. I can still use my swords but i cant see anything else. When its fixed i will gladly change it back to 5 stars.',
       'As bare bones and as simple as any other bog standard clicker game. By The time it ever gets interesting you\'re already bored. The music is cheerful but gets old fast. There is a special item to pick up randomly like in other clicker games, however in this one you can collect the same one over and over to no benefit to you. You have to spell out a word in order to get a bonus. A bonus that you can easily get every 10 minutes or so by simply watching an ad. Speaking of ads, they are too long for how much gold or gems you get.  Overall it\'s not a bad game but it\'s just not great. See the weapon thrower series for a similar yet better game.',
       'It\'s ok. Time during battle should offer something to do instead of just watching it happen and waiting. Something to get a bonus to crit chance, or even just a clicker mechanic to slightly speed up MP regen.',
       'If you like consantly grinding without having to try...it\'s great! It\'s a little crashy here and there and some of the text is a hard to read. Very generous with rewards though. Definitley not a freemiun , though purchases are available. The tech side of combat it is very refined..think Diablo 2 with attack rating bonuses, critical hit %\'s etc.Though skill use is limited so far. Fun time killer though. Isn\'t a lot of d.i.y. in the combat but it still satisfies. Lvl 220...do you ever get out of the forest? Think it might be a little unbalanced in it\'s resource use as well. I\'ve run through many different games on my LG K8 and this one drains my battery faster than any other. After all...it\'s still good fun. Maybe needs a little polishing?',

      'Whenever I try to open the app the screen starts flashing black and it\'ll stay like that or keeping turning back to the screen I was on and off, which ends up somewhat strobe-like. The actual game itself is amazing despite having a hard time trying to beat the bacteria level but, what\'s the point of a good game concept, if the game won\'t work properly',
       'I thought the new scenario was a free-trial only like the simian flu. (At least you can unlock it after being a brutal pro at the game) I\'m gonna enjoy playing this a good few times and unlock even MORE scenarios. Keep up the good work! I wanted to make a suggestion, but I just can\'t remember now. Oh well...',
       'Fun game. I wish the rate of death was more consistent. 37,000,000 a day at one point, but waiting 6 months for 100,000 to die towards the end. The disease didn\'t change, the rate of death shouldn\'t decrease just because there are fewer people. Good game otherwise',
       'I didn\'t buy the new plague, i might need to. The first 2 difficulty settings are easy, the 3rd not so much. Good game to me! Just have to read what it is that you spend your DNA points on and you should do just fine',
       'Really annoying ads keep repeating and covering controls.  So annoying. Pity as game is unplayable like this. It never used to happen before. Why can\'t developer just charge for extra content rather than make game unplayable. Will have to remove.',

Just because you suck doesn\'t mean it isn\'t beatable... You shouldn\'t give low stars because it\'s a difficult game! It\'s very beatable without purchase!!!  5 stars!!!!  Just keep trying!

      'Good game, please add more customizations, make a custom skin is hard, please make it easier to fill in and please buff sniper rifle, please have a invisible armor button, have hats and that you can create multiple maps. Also, I hate that everybody has auto sight and auto fire on, so that people cant enjoy that much fun because you basically just would get killed instantly just because of people who let the game play for them.',
       'This game is a good game. I gave this game a 5 star rating cuz its sup awesome and also me and my brother play it at school if this had a 10 star rating you know i would give it a 10 star rating and also can you add a minigun and also i hope this game never dies and i hope to remember it when i grow up',
       'An amazing game i love it can\'t wait to get that skunk gun like the one in the trailer and i hope you guys will update it for new skins and guns and also add a friends list so players can have friends and chat together I hope you\'ll add this in the game which would make it even better : )',

      'Awesome game!  Earning money is easy especially with online play and watching ads.  ONLY downfall is earning gold can be a pain,  seem like the only way to get gold is by beating a boss, buying gold with real cash and levelling up which can take some time.  Other then that it\'s a very addictive game if you love BMX that is.  Folloq me on instagram @evans_customz',
       'Very good game but I wish there was a better way of getting gold without having to pay out of your hard working money. Since when did games start asking for cash? I would pay to buy the game but buying gold is stupid as hell.. either way very good game',
       'Stats are meaningless. I was getting beat consistently by a bike with lesser stats. My bike speed was rated at 16 and the other bike was 10 and I got no separation whatsoever. The stats are misleading and only serve to get you to spend real money.',
       'Great game that I would really enjoy putting some time in but it constantly starts to shutter and the frame rate slow way down and makes it impossible to hit your marks. I had a subscription but decided to cancel it because the game is unplayable. Please fix and Its a 5 star game and worth the subscription. (Galaxy Note8)',
       'Cool little game with very few ads. The only downside is you have to buy gold to upgrade your bicycles so if you don\'t pay to win that\'s just a great time killer.',
       'Game has great potential but you can\'t get past the 3rd level without spending money to buy gold. I understand the free game thing but come on. The 3rd level? Really? Stats are meaningless. I keep getting beat by a bike 2 levels under mine. Save your time.' ,

      'I really like (love) this game, but 7 energy per level (out of 20 total) means I play 2 levels and then close the game. Sorry Tapps, wish I could like MORE and play MORE but you literally aren\'t letting me. Make level energy 3*-5* and I will give a 5 star rating. Till then, I\'ll stare at this app and click around to others that actually give me play time.',
       'Makes you think & easy task to complete. Make money fast & especially love being able to obtain free gold! The variety of items spectacular! The pawn shop is a joke due to their request for the same item you can obtain in the locker is not worth purchasing. But I do appreciate that the pawn shop is only an option. Love this game! Easy download and simple strategy!',
       'It is very addicting! I am not getting paid, or getting a prize for this review. But I love it! It is sooo much fun, the gameplay is good, and its like your a character in the tv show, you go to storage units and actuion! This is also a great game for kids, I loved it and saw kids having fun, I thought it was also cool because, you can own a pawn shop! I recemend this game as a person, and you should try playing it to! By a 11 year old',
       'not a bad game energy being quicker would be good. it word be nice if you could post links for life on your Facebook page more levels with a lot more higher end stuff to sell. needs to be done sooner rather than later before everyone gets bored and finds another game.',
       'Well, firstly I really like the game. But this is the second time I have had to play it. Got to level 20 and in Miami doing great when all of a sudden it reset my entire account and I have had to start again. Very annoying after I had made some in-store purchases. Working my way back up again. Let\'s see if the game resets me this time.',
       'It is a great game but gold should be able to earned as well not just 1 bar for an add watch and its predictable, they always bid you up never a easy locker or a mildly easy. Plus things take to long to sell in pawn shop.' ,

      'Quite Addictive. Played nonstop 6/7 hours and unlocked 40%. what u just need is time behind it. There\'s a rule of Fibonaceae in mathematics and if u follow the rule in the game you will make it in the minimum time. But the amount making system is quite sick. U don\'t  need that critical numeric use of currency just keep it low in the gameplay. Otherwise the game is good.',
       'Gave 2 stars more than last time...  Now i have all the mines but i think that i will delete this game..... Too much frustrating because of the instability of the game.... The game always shut down either i\'m watching an ad or just upgrading my miners.... When it happens on an ad it\'s thw worst!!!! sometimesi have to redo the same boosting to 3-4 times until it works once... So instead of losing 30-45 sec of my life for a game a lose 3 minutes in all!!!!',
       'I like this game a lot. There was a problem with one particular ad causing the game to have to be restarted, but they seem to have gotten rid of it.  Developer responded to my unhappiness.  Isn\'t that a good Developer? I think so.  Their game, Idle Factory Tycoon is really good also.',
       'The game doesn\'t keep cloud saved data.  Had this game linked to Google and Facebook. My phone broke and it took me awhile to get a new one and now that I\'m on my new phone went to download this game and I\'m having to start all over.  Thanks for all those months deleted. Won\'t be playing this again.',
       'Well although I like the game, I have to give such a low rating, due to the prices. I think the devs used the wrong currency. Otherwise it\'s hard to explain prices over 20‚Ç¨ for 1 chest or a boost for only a few hours. But that\'s the games we have to deal nowadays. Do nothing and pay a fortune for it.',
       'Game is fun but after opening 3 mines and prestiged 1, I mean it\'s always the same. They don\'t give tool for kickstarting mines when you start over. Its kind of boring to start over thousand times. So game is fun but gets boring quickly to me.' ,

Find some cool guns kill some noobs a really good time. Then i get home after all that and play some knives out. Pretty cool game 10 out if 10 would recommend',
       'First win today without killing others, i\'ll try to survive and make it. Thrilling... You\'ll never know where the attack come or opponents are. Every one\'s hidding and waiting and running. Like inside the hunger games movie... Many ways to stay alive, and to win. Overall this a great game to play single or with friend. Graphic amazing smooth, control its ok, movement is cool. Nice work def team... Keep up the good work.',

      'Great game, probably best talking animal game out for adults n kids... but sometimes u watch a video so u can spin the wheel n win gems or coins but the wheel not always comes up... ive had approx. 20x it has not happened in last 4 hrs... would like it redeemed n fixed plz...',
       'Really fun game. My 2 year old adores Hank. The only thing that I feel is missing is a way to save your progress to the cloud. My phone needed to be reset a couple times and we had to start over. Didn\'t mind so much because hank as a puppy is much cuter.',
       'I like this new update. Hanks now have His own happy meter like Tom and Angela. Nice. Also this is just my suggestion. Can you guys also make My Talking Ben and My Talking Ginger. Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that\'s it. You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It\'s not fair. Lastly good job guys.',
       'My three year old grand daughter got around my password and charged $40 of in app purchases and did a monthly subscription, too. I have gone through everything to try to remedy this, with no help from the customer service from the this apps developer.',
       'I hate this game when I download it as I came to level 15 hank turns in a kid and looks like a road pup his face üò´üò´üò´üò´ is very. Bad I can,t see his face any more road pups also look good  but hank is üò´üò´üò´ when he is in level 1 to 14 at that time he looks normal but at 15 üò´üò´üò´ all other games. Talking games are good but hank is not üò´üò´ please let hank good not like a road dog please .üò´üò´üò´üò´',
       'I absolutely love the game,  but I have one question. ...why is it called "talking hank"? Hank doesn\'t say a freaking word!!! I realize that it\'s a spin off of "talking tom", it\'s just an observation and is a little annoying. .. otherwise GREAT, GREAT GAME.' ,

      'I\'m really fond of this game and love the gameplay and quick paced matches. The new update is AMAZING!   There are a few things that would make this game extra perfect for me!   Must have character customisation. This would be of big amazing to me. Char customisation makes me bind more to certain characters. The rings we get don\'t have much value to them except for upgrading the characters.  Could have non-ranked matches. I would love the option to play/practice against rivals or my own friends.   Should have quick chat responses. Would like to communicate before and after the match with simple reactions. Like Good luck and I win, tee-hee!',
       'This game is if Sonic Dash mixed with Racing. And I LOVE IT!!! One suggestion I have that I don\'t think many online multiplayer games have, add some sort of singleplayer mode. Otherwise, great game! I like that it\'s free with ads being removable via in game purchases (which I did), controls, graphics, and soundtrack are outstanding, overall, I love the game, and I look forward to more updates in the future.',
       'Please add a custom character, there is one in the main game so there should be one here to. Also please add infinite, cubot, orbot, and eggman. Also some more variety of music and areas would be good. Thank you for reading and for the great game! :)  (Edit): we need a friending system and to be able to customize our characters so that we have SOMETHING to spend rings on. And Espio needs some serious buffing because right now, he is pathetic.',
       'To many ads unless you make some kind of purchase. Loading screens seem to take longer than I\'d like. You can\'t at this time play with friends as Opponents are automatically chosen. There is still some characters ability noise in the game even if you have music and sound off. I\'d like to see characters abilities not to be so similar, but it isn\'t taking away from the game at the moment for me. With all that said though the graphics are great, the game is fun, and it\'s worth the $1.99 purchase I made.',
       'This is one of the best mobile games I have played I a while. I probobly have a bias sense I love Sonic so much. However, if one thing could be added I would say it should be a converter for the Red Star rings to normal rings. Unless you want them to be payed for. I don\'t really care either way I\'ll just buy the Red Star rings but I brought up that idea because I currently have 23,000 rings just kinda waiting to be spent. Maybe incorporate phone backgrounds or some customizations for the game that cost extra rings? Thankyou so much for the new update and if anyone I\'d debating on installing it just get it. You\'ll have fun, trust me.',
       'Love the game, but there\'s something wrong.. Well... I think Cream is kinda rigged. Her items are a bit OP for the other players which makes it an easy stage into a extremely hard stage. And also, the deduction of trophies in 4th place is too much! Please make it lower (like maybe at around 5 or 8) and change the deduction of trophies in 3rd place 0 (These are all just suggestions I have). If you read this SEGA, your games are great and keep up the good work!' ,

      'This is a very entertaining game that is simple to play. It has provided me with hours of fun! The only thing is that I wish there were more combinations, there are things I\'ve tried that you\'d think would make something but don\'t. For example, Crayon (or Pencil, or Charcoal, or Paint) + Paper does not make Art.',
       'The interface is not so good. Big icons are not convenient, we have to scroll down long everytime, I could only imagine how much effort would it take if I had 500 items discovered. Please make icons small or a different tab just for icons or just make it like little alchemy one.',
       'This game is pretty addicting. I get stuck sometimes but I always find something new.  Small issue though, I it won\'t let me pull rust out onto the screen for some reason. I\'ve used it before, but now it won\'t let me use it anymore. Perhaps it is an issue with my phone rather than a glitch in the app.',
       'This is leagues better than the original alchemy game. There were a lot of bugs but they\'ve all more or less been patched out. It took me 2 months of playing everyday to get all of the items and combinations cleared.',
       'I love this game so much. I\'m stuck on trying to make life but it\'s not frustrating it\'s challenging and I like it. Also, for all the people getting pissed off because the items disappear and you cant \'use\' them anymore it\'s because you can\'t combine them with anything anymore so it is put in your encyclopedia so that doesn\'t waste space for the things you can use, it\'s actually a very smart game mechanic. I\'m pretty sure it even says that in the tutorial. I also like how they didn\'t take the same combination formulas from the first game and instead added new ways to achieve the same product in a more realistic way, also there is so many items to create! So I think that this is an all around great game. Good job developers. Good job indeed.',
       'Its a cool game. If you press the hint button it gives you a choice to watch a ad for help. I am not seeing in-app purchases so far and I have had this game for a while! I recommend this but not the other version. It gets a tiny bit boring after a while though. overall, GREAT GAME! Whoever made this game is great! :) :) :)' ,

      'I love this game. Amazing sound effects, graphics. You guys did a great job that\'s for sure! But still couldn\'t give it a five star because of the lastest update. The entire screen goes black after playing the game for 5-6 minutes. That\'s pretty irritating not to mention how much slower the phone gets as well. Didn\'t have these issues with the last update. Fix it please!',
       'The VERY best game EVER..so fast to level up... Never boring.. Always SO much to do!!! ... it NEVER asks 4 money !!!!!!   NO pop ups or commercials. !!!. . the inventors are genius... i Love this game..  thank you for making this game.. Graphics are Amazing!!!   Best farming game ...Bonus Zoo !!!...and breed ur animals ADORABLE BABIES.. with a splash of Cityville  ..Gold digging..making ingots to use...  So many optional tournaments if u want to win more money n prizes in the Regattas... Township friends make it SO much easier n fast 4 everyone  .. and so much more You just HAVE TO Try TOWNSHIP ‚ù£üíû',
       'The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen',
       'RSYFJH Great game very addictive, and I don\'t know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, üòí you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats\'s kind of ridiculous. That\'s the only bad thing I have to say about this game.',
       'BEST GAME EVER! It\'s my biggest game but even though I have an old phone the game still runs really smoothly. There\'s always something to do, it never gets boring. I\'ve been playing for 8 months. Super easy to use and learn. It\'s addictive. You also don\'t feel pressured to make purchases like other games.',
       'This game needs the ability to gain more township cash. I have spent way too much real money to buy township cash and im not doing so again at this rate. Farmville isnt this bad and hard to expand.  You cant expand the barn without waiting on products by train or paying in township cash to expand. And that costs over a couple hundred township cash for each expansion. Getting a dollar or two here and there takes forever to collect. Plus the expansion makes small expansions so it doesnt help much.   If something dont change i may quit the game. I enjoy it and would like to continue but at this rate i dont see much point. I cant afford to pay more money to play.' ,

      'Controls are terrible. Doesn\'t feel natural at all. Have to pay for every park/spot other than the starter park which sucks. Just pay the $1.99 for True Skate. Way better game with more natural feel for the controls and bigger parks/bettter spots. It\'s like going from Tony Hawk Pro Skater to EA\'s Skate series. Give us at least better controls to make this feel better. Fluck it. Not pick up finger to ollie which doesnt even work %80 of the time.',
       'Would be better if you could Manuel between tricks  and if the tricks were in combo with other instead of individually named. Also can\'t seem to feeble, or smith grind:/ Fakie seems to not be working for me, it just registers at regular even though I\'m clearly riding fakie! Also I\'ve paid for this game and haven\'t seen a new park in the past year and the map The Docks sucks!!',
       'Spent literally hundreds of hours playing this when I had an iPhone, it was the best mobile game of all time.. Then I switched to android, and waited forever for it to be ported to android. I was so happy when I found out it had eventually made it\'s way to the play store, downloaded it immediately and bought all of the parks. Then I realised it didn\'t have the option to replay clips or edit them like the iPhone version does. This has ruined the game.. One of the best features was the ability to watch back a line you have spent hours perfecting, edit the clip and share it. PLEASE judt add the ability to replay and edit clips on android like you can do on iPhone and make it the greatest game of all time again.',
       'Needs some fixes. It\'s EXTREMELY annoying when I go to do a nose or tail slide, the game does a boardalide. Even if I\'m blatantly placing my fingers in the right spots on the screen. How do I unlock "Skate". Needs more designs. Better customization.  Also needs to recognize more tricks.  Along with already existing ones to be better portrayed. Should add a mode where the board is essentially floating. So that one may be able to flip the board without wipe out to see how to do a specific trick. Game is fun though.',
       'Awesome game it\'s so fun and like real life skating I use to play this game along time ago when It had the horrible camera angle and it has improved a lot. It\'s not hard to control either. The one thing I didn\'t like was that there is no replay! If you could replay truck it would be perfect',
       'It\'s an amazing game! I also have a suggestion. For tricks, like the ollie and kickflip, it should matter where your feet (Fingers) are, so if your going for a kickflip, you should have your foot higher up on the board and for doubles and triples, your foot should be farther down. I know it\'s quite large and some people may not like it, but it would add more realistic gameplay.  Edit: Also some different trucks would be nice, and also if it had grind marks.  Also you should add user challenges and maps, I know this would be a huge update to make but I know it would make the game so much better.' ,

      'I used to be so excited about this game. Best slots out there with fun games, great graphics, and variety, but the game is too greedy now. I do not mind throwing some money at a well developed game that deserves it, but you never win anything in return. Just want you to keep spending. Such a shame, love several of the slot games.',
       'Best casino slot games, choices and addictive! I have tried others but I always come back to Club Vegas. I can\'t wait to see what "coming soon" is all about. Thank you!',
       'Small payout compared to size spent, not enough action. Not fun when all you do is get rolled. Nice slots though if your willing to pay up.',
       'Game is great but  since last week after your maintenance   I have just been loosing and the free games have become harder to get but otherwise  it\'s a great game the best one that  have played in a long time',
       'Edit 3 update: I have reported the developer to Google, it\'s been over a week without a reply after being ripped off during the " minimum x3 wheel event" good luck getting support after you have purchased and something goes wrong, these leeches won\'t be getting another cent from me.  Edit 2 Bought $19.99 coin pack during "guaranteed 3x wheel event" only received 2x on wheel, currently have a ticket open with support, if not rectified will be reporting to google.  Edit 1 And the raking over the coals continues, since last update most of my lucky spin levels have been downgraded to silver, such great value for sapphire vip tier. Buy coins watch them get sucked away, rinse and repeat. You\'ll be lucky to get 2 spins from your bonus at sapphire level.',

      'I really want to love this game but the time mechanics in it are just too much. An hour for one game token and most of the maps after the tutorials cost more than one token to play. I have to wait 3 hours to play one round? I really like this game, the merging mechanics are addicting and fun! I find my self between kicking myself for popping something early and getting excited for getting close to going just one more level up, but I almost have to literally forget about the game in order to get any sort of meaningful play time out of this game.',
       'Reason I changed from 5 star rating to 4 stars is before a recent update, you only needed 1 dragon chalice to play any level. Got changed to needing more than 1 on most levels, which wouldn\'t be so bad if they didn\'t make you wait 1 hour to get 1 dragon chalice back. Used to only be a 15 minute wait between chalice\'s. If it goes back to old way......5 stars again! Still a great game',
       'I thought it was really cute until I found out that you have to use orbs to open some of the treasure chests. How do you get orbs? By buying them of course. You have to spend money of you want to play. And that really sucks because other than that it\'s a really cute game',
       'After reaching level 39 my camp game completely erased and I\'m back to level 2. wasted so much time making hearts. .update. I tried to play again. I even have cloud saving my game again. I reached level 30. Suddenly all my dragons are gone. Again. What the hell game! Update: once again  the updated and all my progress is gone. This time om at level 53. I\'m done. The creators don\'t even reply or show that they are listening to the players to come to a solution. I\'m not playing this game again. WASTE OF TIME!',
       'Purchased the 30 day gem subscription. Got the first few days then it stopped. No way to contact support from inside the game, help menu continually crashed. Emailed support from outside the game and received no reply. Hoping Paypal can get my money back. Cute  time wasting game but don\'t spend real money on it.',
       'Love the idea. Would love to have getting gems be a little bit easier without spending money, watch ads or something for gems, since they are required to complete some quests. Also, mine all of the sudden stopped working. Said the hardware in my phone couldn\'t support it anymore. Same phone. So, now I can also no longer play. Bit bummed about that.' ,

      'I really liked the action scene where the ICE police arrested the mommy and took her children into social services. I do believe giving an emergency C-section for an illegal is a bit much for a story line, but whatever. Totally makes sense. I love how we\'re able to take care of the premies and foster them until they\'re adopted! 6/10 - Would play again if bored.',

      'I downloaded this game and the very next morning my phone got hacked. I\'m not saying it was definitely related to the game softwares but I have no way of knowing, so I will not be installing this again. Also its clearly a straight theft of  Minecraft with only some textues and sounds changes. Blatant copy write theft.',
       'I love this game but you can\'t open chest or crafting table or stove. About the houses: it\'s really fun and easy to build the houses. And also it\'s one of the best and exiting Minecraft game ever!!! But like I said you can\'t open anythingüòë But other than that in love it can you please fix the changes that I want if you can please!! Thank you!!üòä',
       'I went all unsure but three stars.It was the best game I played but 21 days after I downloaded the game was broken! I went to my map and my dogs head became a leg!?.my brother had this game to and I played on is server.but then his body was broken!. Next thing he was invisible!.please fix the bugs on this game and I\'ll give you five stars.',
       'DO NOT WASTE YOUR DATA ON THIS PIECE OF TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!impossible to see at night due  to ads. ever walk around outside after midnight with a flashlight in your hand pointed at your face? well the ads make it hard as hell to see at night. i have started this game six times and cannot see anything happenning at night. and that is too big of a flaw for me tocontinue to use a game. paid 7 bucks and downloading the real minecraft right now. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!!',
       'At first the game was great but then there were a few things that need to be added. First of all, you can\'t crouch, second of all,it doesn\'t have texture packs, and make the graphics like the real version of momentary. If you add these, I will give you 5 stars.',
       'OMG THIS GAME IS EPIC!!!!!!!!! I have 1 question, there are these holes in the ground  (in creater mode) and the holes have iron and sapphires but I\'m scared 2 go in. What are they and is it 100% safe 2 go in the tunnels? At the moment, I just block them up. Plz tell me! Oh and I LOVE the fact that the game saves on its own!!!!!' ,

      'Awsome game. Completed all levels without any hack jzt waited  for hope   ( the lives ) evrbdy shld try this. Sry i gonna uninstall this app only bcoz i finished all levels. Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.',
       'The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don\'t get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new "enemies". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you\'ve lost some lives. But that\'s not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.',
       'I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It\'s more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.',
       'Completed all but just couldn\'t get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I\'ve ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.',
       'Amazing game reminds me of the old school games . But the only problem is the lives you give us to play. They are so few and they take a lot of time to refill. PLEASE remove the life or ball things from this game it will be the best if you do that cause I was playing and level by level I was getting exited and I wanted to rate this game 5 stars but suddenly this GAME OVER thing comes and I had to give you this ratings.please let us play without stopping and waiting for the life to come.',
       'I love this game üòçüòç it is my favourite but.... I don\'t like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it\'s a great ideaüòãüòã btw i loved it üòçüòçüòç ill give it 5 stars thenüòäüòä' ,

Additional to that i saw therr locked 200 diamonds i clicked one of that and all my 420 diamonds gone and onlu 220 diamonds left and its showing me 2 big circle white and pink.. that\'s not fair....',
       'Found a game called "Infinite Balls" on my friend\'s iPhone, we loved it. This is the best Android alternative we could find, but it\'s not quite as satisfying. Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls. Would be nice to turn off the help lines, too.',
       'Super fun and addicting, the beginning levels are pretty easy but they get to be rather challenging after a while!  The only thing I don\'t like is the frequency of the ads.  Game itself is great though.',
       'Would be good but the most annoying part is if you fail and you get the prompt to watch an ad to continue and you just want to restart it makes you watch a full bloody ad anyway. So whats the point of not continuing. Rubbish concept.',
       'Good game.  Wish I could purchase ad- free version.  Deleted! I turn volume off for a reason, but then volume is forced in ads, which makes turning volume off option pointless.',
       'Awful! Why is your app crashing when I deny the permissions for making calls? What does an app like this needs permission to make calls? And what kind of a developer designs their app to crash if one of the irrelevant permissions is not confirmed?' ,

      'Don\'t want to play hours of boring levels to get to (hopefully) more difficult stuff. I would have no issue if the levels were at least different from each other. It takes merely 10 seconds to get through the starting levels but there are just too many. It\'s wasteful.',

      'Such a bad game. Nekki never gets enough of money so they show ads nearly after every fight. You can\'t earn gems from watching videos as it\'s never available.

       'Challenges ruin the experience. Mandatory in order to progress and level up. Some challenges are just ridiculous, and frustrating when you\'re given five tries and having to watch a thirty second ad to get one back every time, even if you make a simple mistake. Other than that it\'s good.',
       'Let me just say I don\'t mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high',
       'The game crashes unexpectedly even in the middle of a fight and when I return the energy I used for the fight when it crashed is already consumed when I didn\'t even finish it.

I restart my phone and it works smoothly after that but I can\'t have my phone restartung every time I want to play. Please fix this',
       'Worst controls ever!!!! Seen in present times. Your thumbs literally pains like hell while playing. It\'s a button smashing game & makers haven\'t give a thought while design, the left directional control loses it effectiveness frequently!! It\'s designed so that player can spend more for upgrades or its development issue, whatever it is, it\'s really painful. There are no such graphics in the game anyways just 2D fight, atleast they should have got that right!! Don\'t know which Google\'s editor has made this game his / her choice!!' ,

      'The thing that makes this game great is the visuals and the audio. It is absulutley beautiful and the art style works so well with the type of game. Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I\'d very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there\'s a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style',
       'Good graphics, but can get boring after only like 3 minutes. Also the makers of the game should add a another different mode where your running away from a villager/camper and see how far you can get. You could improve or modify this mode that i have made if you want',
       'First off, I\'d like to give a big thank you to the developers for this game. It\'s amazing.  However, I\'ve been encountering quite a few bugs lately. One day, picking up a hover feather crashed the game. Today, I can\'t pick up llama horns, and the background blur that happens when you go into the workshop stayed into an actual run. I took this as a challenge and continued playing. I\'m on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 9.7 running Android Marshmallow.  This is just to tip you guys off on some bugs.',
       'The game is addictive, but i cannot play it more than 10 minutes at a time, because it gets boring. The awful part is that since 1 week, i dunno why, it crashes while i\'m playing.. Anyway, it\'s addictive because after you start playing, you start thinking about it while you\'re not playing',
       'Was really enjoying it until the most recent update. You guys broke the ad version. Now no ads play to get a revive. Disappointing as it was working fine. Why oh why did I say yes to the update? It\'s as if you wanted to force free players to buy the paid version.',
       'I have \'noisy\' brain and anxiety and sometimes the world is too much to bear. This game keeps me calm and collected all the time. The music and gameplay soothe me up. I do get frustrated over the goals but I have nothing but praise and love for this game. Thank you to everyone involved. You all helped a lot. Cannot wait for Alto\'s Odyssey for Android!' ,

      'Amazing game, great time-killer. I discovered a game breaker: if you go into the settings after you die, the number of coins you got in that level, the number in the brackets becomes equal to the total number of coins. Keep going back and forth into the settings, and the game will eventually ask if you want to triple the coins by watching a video. Instead of tripling the number of coins you got in that level, the number of total coins you have gets tripled.  Instantly triple your wallet every run.  I want the devs to see this and see if they can patch it because I really like this game and I want the coins I earn to be legit.  Thanks for your time, Mike C.',
       'It has a progression system, but it\'s completely worthless. The only reason to try to win belts is to get weapons that serve no purpose. You can win most of them by paying 200 coins and getting a random one, but you can, for some odd reason, get duplicates. Not to mention the fact that coin combos actually do nothing, not even useless cosmetic items, nothing. I think adding function to the weapons (e.g. Making long swords slightly longer range or making small weapons quicker) could add more depth and more of a reason to play the game. Overall: It\'s a good timekiller.',
       'Great game. Best for killing time. Great concept. Need to add a  counter for counting the number of people killed, otherwise awesome. Also there is not much incentive to play to win belts. Make playing with boss again free. Add new opponents (not bosses but the minions) . Make the game a little less challenging. Also remove the brief stun completely',
       'Really fun game. Nice graphics and simple controls. More depth to combat system would be nice. There is no point in achieving coin combos. It does not affect the amount of coins won. Add a multiplier for coin combos, as well as a score multiplier for chaining combos together without missing enemies or coins. Don\'t allow duplicate items to be won. Very annoying to grind and grind for coins, only to get a duplicate you can\'t do anything with. Lastly, an option to pay to disable ads would be nice.',
       'The game gives you an unskippable mission to get kills with a certain type of weapon and then will never give you that weapon. I\'ve opened over 100 chests and never got a two handed sword, so my options are pay real money for the the weapon (what they want) or delete this cancer app. I get you have to make money but there are better ways than stopping all progression and ruining the fun. Overall good game 6.7/10',
       'The gameplay is super fun till i got imposible mission "19 coin in one game" seriously? I\'ve try to complete this mission for  hours and always fail So in the next day I play to see if the mission has reset, and its not -_- i mean at least give us mission reset..' ,

      'A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it\'s a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you\'ve done them and reached level 10 on both, there\'s really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.',
       'Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I\'ve basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I\'ve got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.',
       'Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot\'s more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn\'t bother me that much. 5 stars for the team',
       'It\'s a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the \'colony\' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you',
       'Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON\'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!',
       'Well I was only shown this game last Friday and by today (Wednesday) I have reached level 10 on earth and Mars, both my rockets are fully upgraded. Nothing to do now, I thought you would be able to set up buildings and colonies and keep jumping to different planets. But no. If it\'s enjoyable but over quick, nothing more to it after you you level 10. Can keep taking astronauts up but to what end? You don\'t go no further, they make you money but you\'re maxed out on spending anyway. Shame, concave been really good' ,

      'It\'s a very great game,Nothing but love.   But I got a notification  that there is an update,I updated the game but I still can\'t find the new added missions in the game. Secondly I am on day 87 and my day 90 supposed  Reward changed after I downloaded the update.',
       'I don\'t understand why  diamonds are required to craft materials. As a F2P player it is difficult for me to craft new materials. The old updates never had this rubbish. Please fix ASAP.Will install again if it is fixed.',
       'It is a really good game but I have 1 suggestion. Can you not make people waste lots of money. When people are rich in the game, when you die the game makes you waste alot of money and when you\'re poor, they make you waste little',
       'This game is fricking lowkey lit. But could you add stunt trick such as backflip or frontflips that gives you money any time one of these are perform on motorcycles. And cars could get cash as well by drifting or something. Also can we buy one or two houses that have a garage so that we are able to store vehicles there. Thanks and keep up the good work. Oh one more thing can we deliver the car we own for free and rent the others for a certain amount of time that would be awesome.',

      'I love playing slot machine games, and Pop Slots feels like the only game that does not immediately shoot me down when I get a little crazy/ ambitious with my betting. It is the ONLY game I have ever played where I\'ve hit the jackpots on multiple occasions. Now maybe it\'s all completely luck on my part, but it feels like a game that doesn\'t immediately take all of your money faster than you can collect it. It\'s very easy to level up with a good win streak, and those hourly and daily bonus grow pretty quickly. Love this game!',
       'I like this game..but once i got to a certain level my daily bonus stopped going up.  It has reamined the same and it would be a little more exciting if it would increase the higher you go.  Win or lose is ok with me, it\'s something to pass free time.',
       'Game is really fun to play probably my favorite, and is the best slot machine app. I\'ve been playing at least 5 years But have recently stopped because it\'s not fun if you hardly win. And I totally get that it\'s supposed to be like Vegas, Win some could lose a lot. But it\'s just a game, it\'s for entertainment and I get that you can redeem the gold chips for real rewards in Vegas, but that\'s not why I play. I play because the games and different casinos are fun along with the bonuses. I spend 11 million just to play the pirate gem bonus and only win back 5 million. I could really care less how frequent the gold chips are, you only get 1 in 4ish balloons anyway. I just want to PLAYYY. Especially the bonuses, but it takes forever sometimes for them to be triggered in some casinos. Any chance it can change?',
       'Great game at first but when you progress you pretty much play for 10 minutes wait for bonus. Started purchasing chips and then they seem to go quicker! I like that is not all win win but damn, throw a dog a bone every once in a while. Basically you throw money away paying for chips and NEVER, and I repeat, NEVER win!',
       'I\'m sick of only being able to play for ten minutes at a time. Would love this game more if I can actually play it but you hardly can win coins, and if you do it\'s a quarter of what you spent on spinning it, and can hardly get coins. If you had more ways to get extra coins rather than paying like watching an ad, or something then that would be cool. Or if they made it so one could not lose 500k in ten minutes while only winning a total of like 5k that would be great cuz I would actually then enjoy it.',
       'I don\'t understand all these people whining about the game. No one us obligated to buy chips. Just stop playing for a couple days and collect your bonuses until you have enough to play again.   I live that I can have fun playing and turn my loyalty points into real rewards. I\'ve been playing allvthe various games since pretty much the beginning and have a blast with them. Thanks to PlayStudios for all the awesome rewards I\'ve been able to use.' ,

      'Great game if you wanna run low graphics for a smoother gameplay on your phone. 40 instead of 100 is great for mobile games as well. Maybe make the controls a tad bit larger for default size. Otherwise really fun. Maybe add a first person mode? Unless I haven\'t found out how to haha. Great game. I seemed to like this one out of all the others tbh.',
       'Good game, but after the last update the game game is riddled with bugs and glitches, making the game next to unplayable. Will often come up with queue error and kick me from the game and the screen constantly freezes. I can move, but I can\'t pick anything up and my teammate position is also frozen. Pls fix or I will uninstall. Also, you got rid of the aim button which sucks. Was way better before the update. You\'ve ruined the game for meüò≠üò≠üò≠',
       'Well I love the potential. Has a lot of bugs. Dual or quad mode doesn\'t work and overall it takes too long to wait. I waited 10 minutes for quad and then it just stopped and put me back to choosing game modes. I think thi s game can be the best if it had more work put into it.',
       'I honestly liked the game better before the update. You got rid of the aim button, the game is full of glitches like taking damage inside the safe zone, and I get lagged out all the time even though I have a pretty good Wi-Fi connection. To be honest,  you kinda ruined the game.',
       'I love this game but a few problems 1 don\'t drive cars in this game i was driving a car and just died out of no were and the cause of death was getting run over by a car. 2 sometimes the lag gets real bad and some players have a massive advantage over others and that makes it a bit unfair if these problems are fixed i would rate 5 ‚õ§',
       'Good game. Takes a bit to get used to controlling but after a while it\'s OK. I think it has a great potential if devs will keep working on it. There are some minor glitches in graphics and gameplay which hopefully will get fixed over time but apart from that it\'s good game. And you could add voicechat. That would improve it  a lot. Keep up the good job.' ,

      'Game is fun but almost every time I play the app freezes at some point and I get eliminated in the time it takes to catch back up or restart the app. I have a pixel 2 so phone speed shouldn\'t be an issue. At this current state there isn\'t much point going for the prize when the app will physically present me from progressing',
       'Great trivia game. I do wish there was an easier way to get an extra life. Also wish the app kept track of how many questions I have answered correctly versus wrong. Enjoyable game either way. Just wish I could finally win!',
       'Game has lag time bad. Tonight I couldn\'t see the question until after the answer was read, eliminating me. I have a great phone,  Samsung s7, problem is on their end... too much traffic for their servers I believe. Need ways to get more lives too. I referred someone but never got a life. System should be smooth as silk when there are over a million players.',
       'It\'s fun when it works but lately I cannot get the questions to pop up. Super annoying. Don\'t know if I will keep trying after it not working at least 3 times in a row.',
       'Great game, questions are fair, slight lag every once in awhile but doesn\'t effect play. Host is funny. I don\'t play everyday but when I do its fun. I haven\'t won yet but maybe someday',
       'Cool trivia game show concept. Hopefully they find permanent funding. Wish the app tracked how many questions you answer correctly and average them out for those of us not lucky enough to win some moolah.' ,

      'The game is great! Love the handling and graophics... But I would suggest making the drift angle wider. So instead of hitting 90¬∞ and then the counter says "combo broken" it could be something like 100¬∞! Cause I mean... Reverse entries are awesome! And you should make the hoonicorn Mustang 4wd instead of rwd in the drift setup!!',
       'One thing: (two things actually)  Please make the drift school car available to buy with at least in-game cash maybe for a limited time? And please add a feature that gives you the ability to save replays, that would be really cool.',
       'New update sucked. The game is really good but its really laggy now, like i get lag spikes every second when i play in a track. Please fix this cuz i really want to play this game. I wont blame my phone on this one because in the last update, it ran smoothly, no lag. Plus my phone is an ASUS, a gaming phone, there shouldnt be lag in games like these. Please, please, please fix it and I\'ll put the ratings back to 5 stars‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è',
       'Game is great... but so buggy at the moment it\'s frustrating...also wasted a VIP purchase cus unplayable I\'ve messaged carX on Facebook to no reply... get fixed ill put back to 5*',
       'I love this game alot, its the best game ever. I just love drifting and all sort of car things this game as to offer, but didn\'t the producers of the game think to make a version of this game for Xbox 360 because you don\'t get a drifting game so amazing like this one or any kind of drifting or spinning game for Xbox 360.. It would really be amazing if a game like that could be made.',
       'LOVE THIS GAME BUT IT NEEDS 2 MORE THINGS TO BE MY FAVORITE GAME.  Make a motorcyle update where us players can drift motorcycles. And also make more customization options where we can add body kits exhausts spoilers coilover axle extensions and more. Thank you and please look into doing what i asked so us players can enjoy this game that has a bunch of potential. Thanks' ,

But once you have been playing it for bit you get board or at least I do.and to the creators of this game to make it less boring you could put levels or different modes in it or add more  shapes. Please reply or just update. Thank you.',
       'Great game to pass time. Adverts are frustrating but necessary unless you want to pay to stop, BUT very annoying when they pop up as you just lifted a puzzle piece and because of advert it just drops randomly. Also being able to rotate pieces would be handy, granted not as challenging however.',
       'Your English is so bad it is insulting.    You need to hire someone to proof read before you post requests for ratings.  A definite turn off to the game which is actually quite fun and challenging.    Requires strategic planning.',
       'The app is fun but it needs a no ads option for purchase. Also if the game is muted the ads should be auto muted as well. Currently the play at full volume whether the game is muted or not. It\'s very frustrating.',
       'My four year old likes it and I feel like it helps him on making decisions. I can actually see him thinking what going to be him next move. I like this game and I love playing with my son. Only thing I hate is that it does have to many ads üòí',
       'I like the game itself, but way too many adds and they pop up in the middle of the game and then your piece you are placing goes wonky.  Do away with the adds in the middle. Whoever thought that was a good idea in a puzzle game was completely misplaced.' ,

This is very frustrating and usually I have to wait a while before I can come back and the character can be controlled by tilting again.  Thank you for your help in solving this problem.',

      'The PvP system is super broken. One game might be played with someone at close to your rank and next you might be playing a player with 20,000+ more trophies than you. And along with that the 2 players aren\'t even getting the same waves of enemies to start with so someone with 8 less rank ups than you can beat you by 35,000+ points. This has only happened to me like 15 times a day so please fix it cause game ain\'t worth playing if PvP is broken.',
       'I\'ve always enjoyed this type of game, but the upgrade costs are absolutely insane for anyone who doesn\'t feel like shelling out gross amounts of cash in microtransactions. The levels steadily become longer and more tedious, without ever becoming an actual challenge. Too many ads for too little payout.',
       'Just wondering where my season rewards are I ranked pretty high and it started over but haven\'t recieved anything.  Why is this?  UPDATE: STILL WAITING FOR MY PVP REWARDS FROM A WEEK AND A HALF AGO.  WHAT GIVES?  THIS GAME IS A RIP OFF.',
       'Great graphics and controls. Really unbalanced on PvP. So won\'t be bothering with that aspect of the game. Prices on gems is a bit of a rip off. Don\'t get much gems for the $. Will be avoiding that aspect of the game as well. Overall a solid 3 stars. Is fun, but could be so much better!',
       'I Really Loves This Game....Overall This Games Is A Good Game But A PVP Mode Disconnecting Easily And Frequently Although With A Strong Wifi Connection.... I Lost A Lot Of Diamonds Because Of That... A Bit Dissapointed With PVP... I Hope There Will Be An Improvement And This Problem Can Be Fixed So Soon....üò¢',
       'PVP Only mode.  Taking too long bringing the aliens out to destroy.  Can\'t even get pass the rookie stage.  Very disappointing.  But you not going to do nothing about it.  It is what it is.' ,

      'Should be an option to lock targeting  and then fire, many shots were messed up from lifting my fingure at a very slight angle.  Also check points should last longer than once. Making one mistake at lvl 190+ and then having to go back to zero was so frustrating it was the main reason i uninstalled.  Terrible shame honestly, the game could have been really fun and is an original idea',
       'Good simple nd great stress buster but at higher levels there is glitch. I got to lvl 570+ and game hangs  and way too slow . Even number on cell exceeds its size.  I scored in advanced part. Hope developers do something about it',
       'Its a really great game and I really recommend it! The only problems I had was the controls are a little weird and there a little bit of too much ads but I dont mind it but I\'d rather you fix it! Thanks for making me happy! ‚ô°',
       'Downloaded this game just to kill some time. It was fun at first but then once I started to play the challenge mode it would not let me see the whole screen during some challenges. So there is no way to win at the challenges that require you finish in a limited number of moves.',
       'Its a great game i love it. The only problem would be that the speed X2 sign covers how many balls i have left and i hate that maybe try placing that top right hand corner instead of bottom right. I also hate that it only speed up X2 and not anymore but i can live without it',
       'Game is fun and addictive. Ads are horrendous. Can\'t skip/exit and happen all the time. Edit: if you have data and WiFi access disabled, when you back out of ads the screen goes black and won\'t let you play' ,

      'Still cannot get the game to load, has been since 2/16. I sent an email, but have had no response. Otherwise, I enjoy the game, although it definitely is not as good as it was when I began playing a few years ago. The payouts are not proportional to the bet played. Graphics are nice, overall game play is very easy. However, I have chips to lose, so would like the issues fixed so that I can play the game.   ***game still will not load past the title page. I have sent 3 emails, a mobile ticket as directed in the reply from the developers, but still nothing.',
       'New  Superdog game is fun, but the gameplay is soooo slow it\'s like watching paint dry.  Only game I have ever played where you can make friends but you cannot delete them. This problem should be addressed. Good selection of games and good graphics.',
       'Non-Stop FUN.  So Many Dailey Facet\'s of Bonus Chip earning potential.     Thank you for continued comment meant of constantly improving the quality of our gaming experience, thanks again.                    Would like to let you know, our Team is really learning to play together nicely.  They have finished in the Top 10, every season thus far, in League Tourney\'s.            I am very proud of our Team, TheTwilightZone.                                                             Our Team ended the year with a First Place Finish in League Tournament!!

       'I\'ve been playing for a couple of years now using only the free coins. The games are fun, however I believe that you must purchase coins in order to win a jackpot. I\'ve never won one. I play just about every day. Too bad Double U Casino doesn\'t let non paying players win. I cannot be that unlucky.',
       'After looking at friends profiles, I\'ve seen NO JACKPOT WINNERS. Since I\'ve had this game downloaded(few years), gift giving has diminished due to game allowance, receiving has definitely slowed way down. Still better than most casino games... Greed is setting in on the company.',
       'Sorry it is not polite what I have to say about this site. Nothing changes. Daily spins I managed to get 7,000 credits not enough to play one game. Would not recommend to my friends they would be wasting time and money.!!!!!!' ,

      'It\'s a best game on playstore!!! I play it lot of.. and it\'s my favourite game.. but one problem is that when i start multiplayer match it says sercer not found or server overloaded. But it doesent matter for much. I give all 5 star for best graphics, bedt controls, and also bestest weapons. I love this game. Thank you gameloft. We expect that you will keep developing games like modern combat. I am waiting anxiously for next series. Thank you.',
       'I had previously given this game a 1 star but for this update I\'m blown away by the network rectification aspect. The game runs butter smooth even after post FUP data speeds. The game is currently saturated with lvl 140 players with all the prestige weapons, so I\'d request you to bring about a balanced match making in the PvP based on their matching levels and introduce some welcome benefits for the returning players',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s by Gameloft so it\'s bound to be a good phone game. It\'s not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn\'t hold your hand but it\'s not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you\'re also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it\'s definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I\'m stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)',
       'This probably the best FPS game in the Play Store. Graphics, animations, music, voice actings everything in this game are awesome. üòä  The game runs in my phone in full 60 fps on Ultra-high settings. But sometimes it crashes without any reason and when I run the game again, it starts to verify game data. My phone is not rooted and I do believe the problem is not in my phone, it\'s a bug in the game. üòï  Overall, it\'s a great game. ‚ò∫Ô∏è  Peace out. ü§ò',
       'This game is awesome.  But plzzzz ban clone paragon  first plzz plzz plzz.  Every match i see 2 or three paragon...  And mc5 is best game so far... One more thing this game turn into pay to win i think so plzzz reduce  the pay to win system and in match give 40 to 50 credit 10 credit is very lowest credit  to unlock items.... So plzzzz ban paragon first and give extra free credit  resources to earn in multilayer match....',
       'Played one time, loved it. But now when I open it again, its stuck on "loading player profile" screen. I\'m pretty sure its not a mobile phone problem, either its a server issue or a bug.  Edited: I got past the loading screen, it takes simple procedures like \'clear cache\' and cellphone reboot. But you\'ll have to do these everytime you want to play so I\'m uninstalling for now. Hope its fixed soon.' ,

      'prices in the game are not well distributed. you can unlock new players only with gold but gold is obtained so hard. on the other hand, money is useless after some point. you can only use upgrading players but it also requires gold. you can obtain golds with watching ads and playing every tournament over and over again to level up and gain gold but after some point you cannot unlock new players (therefore cannot unlock new tournaments) because it requires so much gold. the game forces you to buy golds. fun game but only a short period of time',
       'I got to level 7 on big fish casino to get 60 gold. yet when I went back to reap my rewards I was startled! then my feeling of "startled-ness" changed to one of despair. For when I went back I realized I wasted all that time going to level 7 on big fish games and instead of having 60 gems I have 60 minutes of wasted time. Great game. Horrible reward system.

      'This game was good  but could be better. I wish there was something other than just basketball. Like tennis, football, or something like that. Graphics were good. This game is addicting but it\'s hard to get past level 20 if you don\'t have Facebook. So I\'m stuck on trying to get enough stars to get through. Good but could be better',
       'This is a very well thought out game and I love the positive comments when I finally figure out the  way I need to go first so that the next shot is easier to get. Some of these shots are really difficult, if you don\'t get the right basket first. Anyway, I love the challenge. Y\'all got my vote. BEST GAME EVER. Thanks man. I love your guys\' creativity.',
       'This game is fun, but it seems like there are tons of attempts to get you to buy stuff. Plus you can\'t get Panda as a character. But other than that this game is awesome. I don\'t know why on the Dude Perfect channel they advertise it as just for iPhone, but at the very end say it is also available for Android. I recommend this game. It is very fun',
       'Firstly to John J - I have never paid a cent to play this game and that is why I love this game!! I have been able to complete the whole game 210 levels without paying a dime! That\'s truly awesome! It has been challenging because in order to advance I needed to get 3 stars on all levels to open up the next level for free. Then of course you have the energy bar that runs out, but that\'s ok because it replenishes in reasonable time. I would run out and instead of paying money I would go check an email, or post on Facebook and before too long I\'m back playing a few more shots on dude perfect 2!! So easy, so cheap, so challenging and so much fun and so friggin awesome when you completed level in 3 stars!! I can\'t wait till the next section opens to see what they have in store for us. Thanks.',
       'This game is clearly set up for suckers to pay ridiculous amounts of money to play.   1. Energy bar--- really? 2. Constant ads some of which you have to watch. 3. Want coins? Watch their YouTube videos, get them more views, more money, more endorsements. 4. Don\'t worry, after about $100 you can have everything and probably still have ads. 5. If you can get past all the BS posted above, after about level 35, this game gets so freaking hard that you cannot derive any fun nor entertainment at all.  These guys are entertaining but this game by the devs is clearly set up for money and sucking the entertainment value right out of what could be a fun game.',
       'Sometimes this game can frustrating but you just have to get good at it. I personally love this game and I recommend this game to every one who likes a fun game.A special thanks to dude perfect for the great game and I love your show to,I hope you guys continue it and I\'ll keep watching it.            THANK DUDES.                FROM REILLY.' ,

       'This game got to a level where it predictes your every move and block you before you play. I mean the whole point of chekers is you capitalise on your opponents error which they are bound to make. Playing a computer however is very different because it already knows your possible move and then blocks you. So for that it\'s completely no fun once you get to a stage cos you basically can\'t win so only one thing left is to uninstall and look for another with a more fairer playground.' ,

      'Fastest uninstall ever. 15 seconds of gameplay, then 15 seconds of timed add. Can anyone spot the fake reviews? Really developer?, ya cant wait a tad longer to stop the game and make us stare at a cat puzzle? The worst. I didnt even play it long enough to appteciate the poor controlls. Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.',
       'Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)',
       'I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn\'t have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it\'s Definitely Not a game you\'d wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!',
       'Too many ads. I just downloaded n was very happy to check this out but first thing that came on my screen was advertisement. It\'s sad that even after so many feedbacks given for excessive advertisements still developers are running with it. I\'m uninstalling this game n not recommending anyone to try it unless you want to watch commercials',
       'Overall....Great Game, but with Controls of Shooting & Moving around....It\'s Not Exactly Easy to Around. And when it comes to Movement just in General....my Main Problem, But NOT the Only Problem was the Movement in Exactness of where I\'m Trying to Move my Guy (My/the Shooter) just Stinks!! - The Game itself....I Love It!!!',
       'Good game and all but the pictures shown for the view isn\'t what it seems, and this game has some flaws, such as inaccurate hitmarkers. When an enemy shoots from behind me, for some reason, it points to the front, I almost died one time, pressed medkits, I got back up, and I couldn\'t turn the camera for the rest of the game. Also, add the guns that are actually in the pictures... :/' ,

      'It\'s one of the best basketball games ever in my opinion, but today I had 14 then hit 4 threes while my opponent had 9 then it said my connection lost even though it really shouldn\'t have and it made my team have 11 POINTS. You need to fix these kind of things.',
       'I can\'t see myself EVER giving EA mobile games anything but a 1 star rating, the game is geared to cheat unless you\'re spending actual $ on paccs & players. How many times can an event rob you of stamina to only rob you again by redundantly giving you the same fucc\'n collectables over & over & over again!!! By the time you actually complete the set either the seasons over, or there\'s better players @ the position that you\'ll probably never end up getting either... Unless you spend some cash. EA succs man, SINCERELY!!!',
       'I think i\'m dissatisfied with this game of rule. You should change this rule... when the all people can feel comfortable, and can be feel happy, free and enjoy it. This is so very very bad news with you EA. If you still use this rule, i think... this game can be game over forever. You should back this rule like before. if you can\'t, everymonts, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, this rating of Nbalivemobile always down, decrease, and fall, hopefully you can understand if you feel this game very important for you! Trust me!. Thank you. Tru',
       'EA, the game is official and is above average as far as graphics, gameplay go etc. etc. but food for thought and I think it\'ll be a gamechanger really...it\'ll take the game to new heights on a consumer level. It\'s the only thing missing aka Commentators/commentary as part of the in-game gameplay and the rest will speak for itself. üî¶',
       'Low framerate. How come i enjoy a game that has low framerate? I\'ve contacted the customer support by email but i\'m not sure they listen to my complain. Lots of players who have the same framerate issue as me. This game doesn\'t even look different based on its performance.',
       'Game has been crashing for almost 2 weeks. More than half of users are currently experiencing this issue. Despite all the reports, EA has yet made a announcement or acknowledged  about this crashing issue. The main reason for this is because they do not care about this game. How is this kind of issue staying for 2weeks??? Are tech people that incompetent??? If so please look for real tech people with all the money you guys are grabbing from users.' ,

      'This game is very fun and addictive but should have offline mode so we don\'t have to deal with a hacker every game.  Also after new update I\'m having issues getting into the game. It says "check comnection" and my connection is fine even tried uninstalling it and all. Other games work on my phone and so does my Wi-Fi. The game just worked last night for me now it doesn\'t! PLEASE FIX!!',
       'Could you please add an offline mode...would be nice to practice on the go. Also please please please add more guns. I have been playing this game for a year and still no new guns but glad you are keeping up with the maps. I have this HUGE problem, it says check connection when I have good connection. I tried to restart my phone and reconnect but still doesn\'t work. PLEASE FIX.',
       'Just good. This game is great. The controls are completely customizable so you can make it work the way you want it to. Graphics are on point, better than 2nd Gen consoles, lesser than 3rd gen. If this game came out in the age of the PS2 I would have bought it. Also, buy a box because this game couldn\'t have been cheap to make. This game should cost like $25.',
       'its a great game. i loved it , but old brewery map was better than the new one ,that was my favourite but after the latest update it had  been altered and this "new brewery" is not liked by gamers, all of them want the old one brewery ,old one was awesome ,so much fun , i wanna request you to please. change the new brewery with old one we all commented to u and complained about this. many of my friends uninstalled critical ops  we all are waiting for the old brewery i wish you will make a read at all the comments and take the required action against it with in time ..........',
       'I love this game....  But I would like if there we can play offline....  And there is so many hackers!!!!!!  Try to band them..... And please Change that there is two missions in a day so we can open chest.....  So we can get skins...... Please..... Thank u of u guys change....  Love this game....  It\'s like counter strike...... And one more old take off the lag I can\'t take it......',
       'It was a great game. Until you guys updated it. It\'s now extremely laggy. It causes there\'s if my phone to lag. I personally don\'t like the newly revamped maps. Im really good at this game, but I\'m on a six game losing streak due to lag. Please fix . Thanks' ,

      'Overall... I\'d have to say it\'s a very basic game and I wish there was more to it. I have always loved the Simpson\'s and playing a game based on their life is surely interesting. However, I was hoping that it would be more realistic, fun and free. It turns out that it\'s a P2P game and that took my surprise because it really is unfortunate. I hope they improve the gameplay and graphics. More updates will definitely bring more players.',
       'Since about 2 days ago the game keeps disconnecting from the server and I constantly need to \'retry\' to connect. Sometimes I am able to enter the game, but only for a short while before it crashes. Unable to stay connected.  No problem with wifi as this happens on multiple connections and it appears to be from the game\'s side.',
       'I have been plying this game for years i love it and quite often play more than once a day. The graphics are great as are all the challenges i hopr you bring the gifts for visiting you friends towns back i hopr this game goes on for a long time most of my family play to x',

       'Great game for Simpsons fans. But what kills the fun are constantly new side missions. Just as you finished one, two new shows up. You can never concentrate on what\'s most important and that\'s building the Springfield but rather playing with some ruffians at the time now.',
       'Guys please just take the game back to what it was. Ironheights jobs are all gone, the collection radius i had increased is also gone and this is on top of everything else mentioned here. Testing the software before release seems a good thing to consider next time.' ,

       'Really you have no idea what\'s coming next, so you can\'t plan on your next strategic move. Its all luck if you make it to the next round or not. So theres no challenge. I do appreciate the fact it has no ads.',
       'It would be better if the adverts didn\'t stop you playing the game. Also asking for the rating every five mins pisses me off',
       'This game is good for a good time waster, but eventually it gets boring. The only thing really fun is trying to beat your high score. I think a way to help improve the game is have a high score chart around the  world. So we are going against everyone and trying to beat their high score as well as our own.  You can have many charts. A weekly, monthly, daily, and overall.  And with that being said I think you should incorporate prizes. Which can just be skins for the blocks. Trying to collect all of the skins.    Just a thought and idea. Because there comes a time where it\'s gets boring competing against yourself.',
       'Foolishly made game, many a times the three blocks they send don\'t even fit in the remaining blocks. I mean, u shud send the blocks such that people shud love thinking where they all will fit, if allowed in comments I would have sent screen shot of game where I lost in it, to ask u guys where the hell these three blocks fit. I wud suggest to take it as an error in ur game n resolve it.' ,

      'Good game however, once you\'ve taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world\'s and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.',
       'Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.',
       'This game is great overall and you have a great sense of progression as your ship gets bigger and faster. The problem is the controls themselves. I found it very hard( I noticed this when I reached HP or ship level 6 ) and sometimes close to impossible to fire at other ship even at point blank range. The game has a very hard time trying to focus on one ship and would often shoot at where the enemy was 3 seconds ago especially when there is more than 3 ships at once which often happens. I would recommend a fire button option to compliment the controls and the gameplay experience. As I said before, it is indeed a very amusing game and would be even more enjoyable with this added feature.',
       'please, please, please. update more maps or make it more challenging, ive already conquered all the islands and there\'s not much i can do anymore. so please, either more maps, or let others conquer my islands and let me reclaim it. i know you guys can still add up to this already amazing game. also, improve the controls, really cant see much when im steering. but over all, its a really fun, relaxing game. ;) thank you.',
       'One of me and my sister\'s favourite game. But we wish we could play together same team or against each other with bots. We don\'t  want to be against online players. If you guys do that I will tell alllllll my friends to play. Anyway great job keep up the work , you guys are greatüòÅ',
       'Very simple. Gives me a lot of nostalgia. Two things though, it seriously needs music maybe some Celtic tunes or shanties. And secondly it needs more stuff to do. When I first saw a whale I was excited about doing some whaling but nope. The whales do absolutely nothing. Maybe even some treasure hunting puzzles or something. Good game just needs a little more content.' ,

      'I love this game. I truly do. That\'s why this hurts. With the Adam Warlock update, I knew I had to be ready to save up crystals, though I did intend to spend a few for new uniforms, but hiding the one for the update\'s protagonist behind 5.5k crystals is a new low, and you haven\'t even soothed the slap on our faces from the Ultimates\' update. I was prepared to buy a new subscription for crystals or bios, but not anymore.  Netmarble, I thought you better than this. You had a good, committed following, yet you abuse us like this.',
       'An amazingly, beautiful made Game, which is a true gem for Marvel fans. Hats off to you guys. I didn\'t thought that android platform will be that big in gaming areas. I am a Hardcore gamer and i know what gaming should look like...and that\'s what it looks like - Future Fight. I hope you guys will improve the game from time-to-time so that we can\'t get bored of it.',
       'Updates? Updating means improving something, you\'re just digging a bigger hole NM.. I used to spend ¬£10 a month on this, now it\'s not even enough to unlock the new characters... Many of my free to play friends stopped playing, and I\'m 1 update of following them.. Just can\'t be bothered with the grind, and the other option is pumping money into it. That\'s not gonna happen anymore.',
       'Do not even download this game. It is an absolute scam. At one point it was a good game but you will quickly find all the good characters are locked behind thousands of dollars of paywall. Much of the game is based on RNG and so a lot of the resources you can actually grind for go up in smoke. If you don\'t already have this, stay away.',
       'Look I downloaded this game not too long after installation I expect to play the game then I was notified that I can\'t play offline no problem with that but my problem was downloading the update info which also cost 522.36 mb. All this should not b necessary I think it should be like this when downloading the game there should be an additional file which should be the update info.I feel it will be easy for those who are downloading this game (like me) to start the game instead of downloading "update info" before starting the game. And I hope make u of this advice because it will be beneficial for those who are downloading the game and for you.',
       'This game is fun and a great phone game. If you are looking for a game with leveling that will occupy time and love comic books this is the best. It has been plagued the last few updates with customer relation problems due to what has been viewed as cash grab maneuvers. The developers need to go back to what was making the game successful. The increasing of prices every few updates will destroy consumer confidence. I do feel that they listen to their customers and make adjustments accordingly.' ,

      'Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning',
       'Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.',
       'Absolutely amazing game!!! I\'m a huge petrol head and this ticks all boxes considering it\'s a phone game. Love the controls. Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress. Literally one downfall... upgrade costs when you get higher spec cars. Apart from that... GOOD JOB!!!',
       'Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I\'m just going to name some things that I\'m sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I\'m just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!',
       'This game is brilliant. Have been playing it for ages. However the updates are messing with previous games, especially NASCAR I\'ve been playing previous events but with update they\'ve gone and replaced by new ones, I\'ve been working towards cars etc....all gone. Slightly annoying guys. Keep up with the good work etc but leave the previous ones alone please.',
       'I love this game but, I download it several times! And the download process is always stop at 98.8% and not finishing. And its say Download Error please check your connection setting! But my wifi connection is fine.Please help me ASAP i want this game so much' ,

      'I\'ve been playing this game for a while and I absolutely LOVE it. but the new update could definitely use some improvements. I have everything in the power category and the suspension maxed out. But everywhere I drive I just flip over and barrel roll everywhere. When I drive foward my truck wants to do a backflip and when I brake it wants to do a front flip. Also, I wish you could change the color of the roof and frontlights (aka the lightbars) but the front light bar doesn\'t even turn on nor does the top light bar that looks like the front one. Please take my review into consideration. Thanks.',
       'I absolutely love this game. But sence this update has came out all my trucks seem like there missing a 2nd gear they almost stop at 30mph and makes tbe truck not go pst 30 utill i switchs in the 3rd. Please fix this. I love this game is one of the best offroad games ever. So much more better then gigabite offroad. By the way the motors on this game sound really cheap. But the gane runs vary smoothly on my Samsung galaxy but not on my android tablet.  Please fixe these bug then i will rate a full 5 stars woth no, if, ands or buts. Thank you for your time.',
       'I love this game so much it\'s so fun and the gameplay is great. it got even with the update but the update also made the gameplay kinda crappy like when i drive on the side of a hill or just drive and turn my truck flips over all the time and it\'s not as fun to drive cars cause the mechanics for the vehicles feel way  different and not as realistic as before the update. Please fix this i love your game',
       'The game is awesome I think you should make it to where you can actually get stuck and dig ruts... I also think that it would be awesome if you created a map with like a small town with paved roads and trails that you can take... Kind of like a few of the maps on baja for ps3 other than that it is an awesome game keep the updates comingüá∫üá∏üí™ü§òüî•',
       'Great game just hate the sound the trucks make. Would like to have the option to buy crewcab, regularcab or clubcab on every truck. It would also be nice to have a side dump or axle dump exhaust. Would love to see the old 1993 dodge w250 make it into the game. Would like to see more trucks. Great work',
       'Only reason I wont give 5 stars is BC anytime you go back to the menu or try to go out riding it will crash. If not on one way it will be the next. Get the crash fixed and ill give it 5' ,

Funnily enough the option to purchase it again looks like it\'s working. Cannot give any higher than 1 until this glitch which can render your previous purchases void, is fixed.',
       'Hello, I download turbo dismount  purchased the premium version as I am familiar with the game and used to have it on steam. It hasn\'t seemed to have unlocked anything at all. I tried restoring purchases and it hasn\'t done anything. I checked my bank and the transaction has been processed and is pending to come out my account meanwhile I have been left with the standard version of the game and am quite disappointed please help?',
       'After playing this game, I\'ve really enjoyed what it has to offer. The cars are cool, the graphics are fun, and the ragdoll feature is awesome. But it needs so much more. And I have a few badly needed suggestions. First of all, and most of all, a SAVE REPLAY feature and a SCREENSHOT feature. Adding both of these things would improve the game TREMENDOUSLY. Second of all, GRAPHICS OPTIMIZATION. It can get pretty lagged up on some of my favorite levels. And it\'s the same for other people. And last of all, a VR feature. Like for first person camera, there could be VR compatibility. This is not badly needed, but it would be pretty awesome. So, Secret Exit crew, please please PLEASE read this review, and please consider it. These ideas will make the game better.',

       'Not as fun as I thought, but still great game overall. Addictive‚ò∫ Funny as well because you can customize your own character and vehicle!(use funny images! I did and i laugh all the time!) 4 stars all the way!üòÅ' ,

       'This is a nice idea for a game but needs a lot of work. First of i couldn\'t even understand how the game works. Always saying "connection is slow" every damn time. Controls? Terrible.

       'fix the laaags please. I have high speed internet but still facing lags. I spent a lot in this game and don\'t want to loose it. Still lagging :(. It works with only high speed internet. Can\'t play with the data packages only strong wifi.  You didn\'t fix this in the new edition of the game and the rush mode is not working. The new party is sucks big time. Fix fix fix',
       'Ok. are you kidding me? i payed my money to get rid of advertisement and all the sudden it reappears again. i purchased some coins to get rid of advertisement and its still there. BEWARE PLAYERS: this is a bait. it wont made the ads go away. ads will also appear out of nowhere during my gameplay. delete it now',
       'If one of you game Creators survives more than 5 mins in that game where everyone is teaming up I will rate the game 5 stars again... Half of times i respawn  i get eaten before even the game starts. And one time i payed the X3 for 1 hour i was ever respawning on viruses . The game is nice but the performance is not nice.',
       'The game is way too glitched and it is frustrating. Any time I try to use the joystick it would go to another place on the screen, and other times would make my blob automatically go somewhere without me even using the joystick. If it is just my device making the game buggy then is it still possible to fix somehow? Please let me know.' ,

      'I had loved this game until it stopped saving my car purchases. Like my last  one the pick up that looks exactly like a 80s chevy with the cap off and roll cage. I put 7.0 motor in it with NOS tires and paint. Went in this morning it was gone. Please fix.Norton also says you\'re monitoring my location how obtrusive you dushbags.',
       'This game is really fun and additive I play it EVERYDAY. This game is by far the best demolition derby game I,ve  played. For my free car I would like a lykan hypersport please!!! ;-) If you do not know what it is please look it up and please try to make it they are really cool, fast, and exotic cars. If not I would like tank. Thank you for reading.',
       'I\'m loving these updates really bring more life to the game. The new car is really fun because it can flip over really easy. Please don\'t change that. A few suggestions: When you go to winter wonderland you can\'t go back. Would be cool if car panels would become detached like the hood or the trunk. Adding a police cruiser would be cool too. Other than that very good game',
       'Kept telling me that I was going the wrong way even though I was going the right way while racing. Which then it puts you in last place. So, I\'m uninstalling this game because it\'s frustrating to be winning a race and a design flaw ruins the game for me. Also, giving more camera angles would be nice for the other players not uninstalling this game like I am right now‚ò†‚ò†‚ò†‚ò†',
       'I think this game is awesome I\'ve been looking a lot on the Play Store for Crasher demolition car games and so far this is the best one I have found I love all the vehicle choices lots to choose from, like if you\'re going for a a strong car you have your semis and tanks and all that but if you want a fast car for racing there\'s quite a few to choose from. One of my favorite cars I\'d like to see in the game is a 1975 celica GT',
       'Is game is awesome but its hard to make money unless you upgrade your car until u can\'t upgrade it anymore and you only get around 4500 bucks if you have 9 other people playing demolition and 7000 bucks if you have 10 laps and 9 other people racing the controls are easy and its a very fun game PS I think they should put in a military tank!or a golden impala, chevy chevelle, and a 1966 Chevy ll nova ss' ,

      'So nearly perfect. I tried several and they all had too many ads... some (others) with startling loud sounds that you couldn\'t turn off! Very upsetting! THIS game, however, has only ONE ad at the start of each game, and allows you to mute the sound "once" for all future ads. It\'s simple to click the ad off before the game commences. *wink* The background is lovely and the graphics are wonderful! So relaxing. The happy little "card dance" animation after each win is nice, as well. Thank You!',
       'It\'s a fine enough game, I mean it\'s solitaire.  However the app refuses to allow Pandora to run in the background unfettered.  I listen to a lot of music, all the time and if this app can\'t work my life, I can\'t work with this app.  Also too many adds.  I understand that some one needs to pay for the development and what not... Just make me buy the damn app.',
       'I agree with other comments the ads are awful I\'ve tried several of these type games and all are to much ads .. But this one i seem to have higher scores than with the other ones.. It\'s a great pass time and over all a better choice',
       'I grew up with all I had to do so day long was teach myself how to play Solitaire.  It\'s not like I didn\'t have friends but was bored with the ones I had to play with.  I think the game is very realistic.  And completely challenging.',
       'Downloaded this app this week.  Can\'t stop playing it... and it helps me decompress when I get stuck on a level of CandyCrush!  Good job guys!',
       'I\'d really give it a 4.5 - plays smoothly and easily, ads are expected in a free game and these are easily disposed of.  The only downside for me is the "wins" are too frequent - not realistic.' ,

      'The game is fun. I\'ve seen a couple of others say, that in the time challenges, you have to hit the opponent again, even once they\'ve hit 0 HP. That doesn\'t make any sense.  Also, I can\'t play PVP, it won\'t let me create a user name, it just loads until I have to force close the app.  Why is there a login with Facebook option, if that doesn\'t sync your progress across all devices?',
       'Its a great game my favorite on my phone but needs clans so u can choose to go up against friends. And also the 5/5 thing takes way too long bc im trying to buy parts that i need to do challenges with and i cant hardly fight bc its always at 0/5. Its already hard enough to get 1,000,000 just to buy a good robot. Please make an update and im sure ratings will go up',
       'I actually used to enjoy this game but im so tired of getting time up on the time trials when my opponent is at 0 hp. Why i have to land a blow after they are at 0hp is absolutely beyond me and is beyond infuriating.',
       'I would like to share the only problem I found with this game. When I made a purchase from the store it gave me a receipt but I\'m not happy as when I went back onto the game my purchase was not there I contacted Google Play and they had to give me a refund I would like to make this problem known and hopefully the game developers can fix this. My transaction wasn\'t complete due to the game lagging on me apart from this one problem I would like to congratulate this game as I found this game just absolutely amazing it is a great game and I also find it amazing that the robots are like the robots from the actual film thank you.',
       'Would be 5 Star all around if you actually fought real people. Fighting someone\'s robot with Ai isn\'t PvP. It\'s pve still. So technically it\'s fake advertisement.',
       'It\'s okay but here are 3 top failing contents,#1,is that everytime in time attack is that when time is over the enemy wins but if someone has low health they should lose,and the one with more health should win.#2,glitches when I didn\'t press anything.#3,is that the game always checks for updates if I didn\'t check for upgrades.Thank you and please give your game a little extensions,these are the top 3 failing contents I got Thank you.' ,

      'Great game, Love it! Very creative, fantastic graphics. Not so difficult or loss of life\'s to where you can\'t even play.  Yet still challenging.  Only negative is lots of ads. Would gladly pay nominal fee to get rid of them.',
       'A truly fun, interesting & free game. A good game for any age. If you need to do something relaxing, this is a good way. You\'ll get hooked!!! I\'m in the 500\'s & it\'s still fun! The ads only require 1 more touch on the screen than you have been doing. Well worth it.',
       'I really like this game but newer version I have updated to after 3 months and I see the Hooray Sound in the end and some more sounds in between has been changed to Ticking kind of sound.   I seriously and kindly request to the developer to restore those sounds which were there in old versions because I seriously loved it. I wish those sounds can come back which makes the game more amazing.   And ofcourse I still continue to play this and have hope for those sounds to be back.',
       'Love it !!! Caught my eye when I saw "pick 2" vs. pick 3. I\'m a stay at home mom kids in school 6 days week that gives me time to burn   (lol) They did a couple small tweeks which  made the "typical pick 3 concept"a thing of the past (FINALLY) BUT WAS ENOUGH change to make it a keeper',
       'I love playing games like this to relax, but on other similar games I can\'t stop myself from buying the stupid in app purchases all the time which makes me more stressed! This game is perfect because it\'s not so difficult that it\'s not fun and I don\'t have to worry about wasting my money on imaginary things!',

      'Enjoyable game, lots of freebies.  I now need to change up my review.i had made a purchase in the game during a "Spin and Win" promotion, that purchase stated that I would receive 10m chips for every 2k league points, at end of promotion, I did not receive any of my chips as promised per promotion advertising. I followed the process of getting in touch with Huuuge Casino and was told once that someone would be in touch with me, as of this listing I still have not heard back from anyone.',
       'I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won\'t give up.. And I\'m not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won\'t put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I\'ll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.',
       'So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em\' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.',
       'Do not download this game they are an overseas company with an office in California that money launders people\'s hard-earned money through in-app purchases.  they will take your money and you will lose it and have no recourse to get it back. everyone should notify google and report them as they should be made illegal and sued to get them closed down for good.',
       'Like the slots, hate the lousy pathetic payouts. Really tight and horrifically greedy gaming. I will NOT buy any chips and urge any players to also NOT buy any chips. Same old BS response sighting "BadLuck". That\'s totally unacceptable. Losing over 26 Billion twice and over 11 billion twice is not Bad Luck. To me I saw a calculated takedown. I couldn\'t win at all. Your canned response doesn\'t make any sense. I bought chips in the past but I won\'t EVER buy any more ever again. Very frustrating!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!',
       'DO NOT BOTHER  playing this game. IT IS PAY TO PLAY. It used to be a really great game. Have met some really great people. Huge makes constant updates and each time they do, they pay less. People are leaving in droves to go to other games. YOU BLEW IT HUUGE!!' ,

       'It downloads all the decks but only get to use a select few. The people  complaining about the controls need to fix their phone,  Google how to calibrate G sensor. Maybe the developers can help set that up at the beginning of the game.',
       'Don\'t get me wrong or anything, I love the game but the controls are not so good. Like how you have to tilt the phone up to pass and down to correct it.  Sometimes I accidentally get mixed up and do the wrong one, all I\'m saying is the controls are complicating to me. And thank u for you time and help.',
       'Can u plz make it not stuck? Because it kept on saying "Place Your Forehead" after we pick a category. And it is literally not doing anything! Plz fix it!',
       'First clue of every match is skipped automatically.  Its embarrassing since this doesn\'t happen on iPhones.  I\'m using a Pixel 2 XL.',

      'Its an alright game and i advise people to play but would be better if people who walk by your clubhouse could be mugged to get more money and maybe sneak attacks would be good so you might be able to take some money without anybody knowing and when people are bringing cigarettes to california you could intercept the vans. Overall great game',
       'This game has so much potential to be an awesome game except for one factor, you require way yo much real money to move ahead. This truly is a pay to win, change that and the amount of people downloading this game will remain playing imo.',
       'Didn\'t like it at first but if you can afford to buy coins a lot more fun. Seals matchups for New York are complete b.s. though',
       'Great game. Cost alot.  Definitely more fun when you have alot of coins.   But bikers do cost way to much. There needs to be an adjustment there.',
       'Really like the game and could be a great game. I would rate higher but there are a few issues. First issue I see is it shouldn\'t cost so much to train more bikers. When you take over territory most of, if not all, the money you gain has to be spent on replacing the bikers you lost. The reward should be higher or the cost of training more bikers should be lower. The other issue I see is the goals section. A lot of them have too many requirements to reach the goals. Make the goals simpler. Also they are not set up in a way to help you progress in the game, they are pretty much random or the goal can not be reached until you are much further in the game. For instance, one goal is to get some properties to level 5. Once you complete that the goal jumps to make properties level 30. That\'s a huge jump and somewhat disheartening. It\'s kinda ridiculous to jump from lvl 5 to lvl 30. It takes way too long to go from 5 to 30 and will prolly make a lot of ppl stop/not want to play the game. Improve the goals section and make the rewards better and it will help make the game more successful.',
       'Too many pop up adds.  It\'s a money grab if ya want to go anywhere in the game.  Deleted app' ,

       'Used to be my favorite game.  The latest update completely changed the character of the game.  The ball is faster, bouncier, and everything is smaller, and it all adds to just randomness.  The AI got worse at the same time, so it\'s not really harder... just more random.  I now find that this game stresses me out instead of helping me relax, so I have to give it up.',
       'Stale gameplay with nothing interesting. AI sucks. Lv 27 has little difference from lv 1. Too boring. Time to rid this trash from my phone at least I bothered playing with AI till lv 27. I wonder if there is even a end game or maybe the level keeps increasing aimlessly without any interesting change. Bored to max.',

      'Several times now I\'ve tried to type in a logo name and the app has told me I got it wrong but I thought it was right and couldn\'t see why I was being told I was wrong. So I hit "solve" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I\'ve recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you\'ve ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?',
       'First Level at Barbie and Twitter, even if type the words correct, the app tells me that there\'s a mistake. Solve shows me exactly the same word I\'ve typed in before',
       'Not a bad game, but would be great if you could simply type the name down, instead of slowly searching for each individual letter. Makes it all sluggish and takes away the fluidity of the game.',
       'Several times I have tried to use a hint and it  wouldn\'t take it off and it was difficult and easy. When I type in the logo it would tell me I\'m wrong then I hit solve and it was the same thing I wrote also and if people don\'t know some of the logos what is the point of the game.',
       'It\'s too easy to amass a huge number of hints and use them. I\'d like not to be able to complete every level without doing some online searches.',
       'This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further.' ,

      'This game is just a cash grab.  Just a little thought and the dev got obviously greedy. Have to buy literally everything with real life money,  there\'s no incentive to play more than 5 minutes.',
       'This game is brilliant!!!!!! The gameplay is magnificent and the power ups are amazing. This really really gets everyone laughing when the players fling out the cars, especially the kids. What you guys could do over there is make a button that randomises the cars that you have. Great game. I would definitely recommend it to a friend',
       'A fun downhill racer with cool weapons, cars, and avatars. One of those avatars looks suspiciously like JackSepticEye, which renewed my interest.  One suggestion... instead of immediately over with the littlest hit, apply a damage or time limit for a better end wreck.',
       'Was pretty fun! Untill the rediculous amount of Ads after the first try! I don\'t not want to watch 3 videos between plays, absolutely rediculous',
       'I love the game it is soo funny when I fall the little avatars they make me feel so much better. I love it how you get new and diffrent cars. Make sure you get this game it looks boring but it is soo fun :)',
       'I think this game is for telling  that how can we manage a break failed car and in this game there are very nice car and we get a new car when we have 100 coins and when we get out sometimes there is written win a price and if we have 100 coins so we can click on that and after clicking that we get 2 option one of car and another of costume so you click any option your 100 coins get cut and there are 3 boxes click one so then you got a new car' ,

I still like game though I just hope u add that',
       'UNINSTALED   Need alot of gold (money to get it) to finish special even its true...!!! you can\'t finished that even if don\'t have it. yes it\'s a MONEY MAKING GAME..!!! actually, it\'s pretty good game but you need to improve your server, it\'s fu**ng so long... need 5 minutes to enter the game. please even if  I got a good internet, still to long long time to enter the game. please‚Äã fix it up.',
       'Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won\'t reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.',
       'The game starts off good in the first couple levels. But once you start getting to the faster cars, it becomes way harder to keep up with the cars PR points, to get to better races. Unless you spend real money to get the parts. One question I do have. Is about the blackridge rivals. Why put some one with a car at a way higher level against a person who\'s car isn\'t even close to the car at a high level, and one more thing... make the races longer. 20 seconds a race isn\'t fun at all. Thinking with the name "Need For Speed". You guys would of done a lot better. The only thing that I seem to like are the  graphics... But that\'s about it...',
       'When I started playing this game I really enjoyed it. But now I realise that in order to progress, you MUST spend REAL money. I am a family man, with a wife and 6 children, I just wanted a game that I could play when kids are in bed and wife is in bath, I don\'t have cash to spend on games, the worst thing is the 7 Day events, you cannot beat them without spending money. Very disappointed. Good game but don\'t expect to progress very far if you don\'t want to spend money.',
       'I don\'t know why but whenever I watch an ad I don\'t get tHe reward or a nor the time is reduced would have rated 5 if it had worked well. And the special events are difficult and not at all reasonable. Reduce the refill time for the tickets to play in special event. Guys I have given one extra star for resolving the  ad rewards. But please distribute the events in special series equally and not give more no of events in last day of the special event. And the hunter match is very very difficult please fix the AI. Thank yoi' ,

      'Time killer. B&W colors are a bit hard on the eyes after awhile. I wish the controls weren\'t so touchy. Even if I\'m using my stylus it\'s easy to move into a wrong corner by accident when you know it\'s not the right direction.',
       'I\'m not far into it, but it\'s fun so far. My eyesight could be why it\'s not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It\'s still a very good game though.',
       'If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It\'s by far the best maze game app I\'ve come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I\'ve tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It\'s the only maze puzzle app I\'ve found worth playing! üòÄüíú',
       'I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven\'t played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I\'ll have to download a separate kid version for her.',
       '5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes',
       'Where is the challenge? This game is as lame as the rest of the maze games. If you would  try make the game more challenging then maybe I would not have deleted it.' ,

Every so often, you‚Äôll be gifted a new gem - and the faster you tap on box at the bottom of the screen, the faster the gems will appear.

      'Buggy. Can\'t remove injured soldiers from the army. Most of the time have to reload game to see that productions are done or gold and goods are to collect. Each update gets worse. I feel I wasted my time and money. This game should not be out of beta yet. Non existent quality control.',
       'Update Feb. 23, 2018: new app update increased the size of buttons and icons enormously and now the screen is so crowded as to be extremely difficult to play. I\'m on an 8" tablet. ----------------- start original review ----------------- Addictive city-builder reminiscent of Civilization, but better. Only problem is that friend invitations are limited, which means you can\'t add new guild members as you play longer... It is ridiculous to artificially limit invites without also providing a mechanism to add new. For example, lose a guild member, gain an invitation. Or, gain a guild member, gain an invite.',
       'Nice game and very addictive and i specially appriciate your excellent support ,but i think developer has to work on application programming because it slows the mobile phone and as so many users said, connection lost is a main problem that i hope to improve it.',

      'I think its a great way to connect. This game can truly show you what you know about music, and how forgetful really are.As long as you have a good internet connection youre fine. It is both good for Iphone and androisld users. The only thing bad about it was that your profile picture takes super long to load, so I gave up on that.',
       'Very fun.  I wish I could just do the Party games though.  They are much more fun as I prefer competing with a number of people, not just one.  Too hard to get enough tickets, though!  I get discouraged when no tickets/videos are available.',

       'I hate it, I thought it would be a perfect game for a music lover like me but it\'s not. The game just keep loading and loading ( both practice and Normal mod), i wastes 30 minutes for nothing, hope you guys could fix it as soon as possible. Tks.',

      'Time is far too short on some of the more difficult areas such as matching pairs and on others an abundance of it! But an enjoyable game so far though I only only been playing for a few days. Lots of options to buy but I intend to play this as a free game and see how far it takes me.',
       'I\'m addicted to this game.  You don\'t have to spend money to enjoy it either.  Illustrated beautifully and I love the fact items move around plus also have different modes to keep you intrigued. I only find it frustrating not having enough energy to keep seeking',
       'Very good game and beautifully designed. Nice combination of seeking games and other puzzles and great looking locations. Would give a 5 rating but for 2 things; 1. Happy to spend a bit of cash now and then, but being constantly spammed to buy stuff spoils the game ( and makes me reluctant to part with my cash) 2. Really annoying to have to explore locations multiple times (up to 20 times) to get it into the right "mode". There are tools to do this, but they can\'t be targeted so are almost completely useless.',
       'Good game and great entertainment so far, been playing for about 10 days. Some levels challenging but not enough to be discouraging. Good way to develop focus, observation and memory. Those rubies are hard to get though and expensive in real money...',
       'Really like this game, although some parts are not made very clear. I don\'t understand parts of it, but I\'m getting there. And it\'s a but clunky but maybe that\'s because I\'m on my tablet. As with all games, not enough, or big enough, rewards!',
       'Seekers Notes has many aspects.  I would like to have a  "strategy" or "how to" place to read about how the pieces fit together and how to approach the game.  It has varied hidden object panels with different methods of increasing difficulty such as fog rolling in, scrambling the word clues, and showing a shadow image of the object. It frequently asks the user to purchase more rubies or coins for real dollars.  This can get annoying.  Mostly fun and could be more fun if I understood more.' ,

      'Good I hope they fixed the bug where you double buy a car and it gives you the same car but still takes your money. But its still a great game. Ohh! And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.',
       'Good, but has some bugs I\'m sorry if I\'m being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall',
       'It\'s good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn\'t too much skill involved but it\'s a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I\'ve lost countless games because it doesn\'t stop or doesn\'t back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!',
       'Awesome It\'s a very good game, great graphics even for a bunch of cubes, but I also have an idea. You guys should make a game called smashy water, where we can choose from a wide variety of different boats that run away from boat police. Hopefully I helped you with my idea and I will download if made;-). You can work on the title if needed. Please reply:-)',
       'Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it\'s a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can\'t go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I\'m out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!',
       'Shalom there, The game is awesome. I liked it very much and hoping that in the future they will be more cars to be added. I really hope that "military helicopter" can shoot something, it is funny...so idle. Last thing, a HOVERCRAFT can go "river mode" ! Wrecked... because of...water. Hope you\'ll add the " police boats " in next update. Overall, abundant of thanks and good luck.' ,

Overall a great game but please change how you change password to make it easier! For the people who don\'t know their email I am there for you! Also could you have one year vip less expensive plz thanks!',
       'I like playing this game although i find that male characters do not have many long hair/ girl hair options available to buy unless you are vip or have diamonds. I think i speak for many people when i say that boys and girls should have more hair options from the opposite sex, for starcoins, as some people may take offense if they are strictly only allowed "boys hair"/ "girls hair" unlsss they are paying for it. I think you could inmprove further by making it easier to earn starcoins and another way to earn diamonds because many people do not want to/ cannot afford to BUY items in a fictional world.. Overall, i think this is a well rounded game, with a few improvement points, however i enjoy being able to have my own unique style in a virtual world :)',

But can map add a private photo send so only People  you know well can see your photos! Thank you if you can x and please add more things to app x',
       'Great game honestly, I\'ve been playing it for about 4 years now (since I was about 9), and the concept of meeting new people, being creative and having fun all at the same time is absolutely perfect! But just one thing, please could you make the artbooks more compatible with phones and tablets? I ask this, because whenever I\'m not on my laptop, I\'m usually using my phone. Sometimes, when I\'m on my phone, i decide to play MSP, and I like to make cute artbooks or edits from the artbook page on my phone - however, there\'s no choice to CHANGE the moviestar\'s clothes, MODIFY their facial expression or make them do an animation. If I zoom them in, they\'ll freeze and end up not performing any animation I have chosen. Thank you for your time, have a great day!',

That cant get in even we need them somtimes we play it and we need a ninja and its not in the box to pick a ninja you will jut restart the game. Anyways but i still love it Ninjago is my  favorite have you guys watch the ninjago movie even there episodes. Thank you for creating this game.üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç',
       'I\'m a big fan of lego ninjago‚ô•. Its just hands of time I fight serpentine and when master Wu spoke I saw a timeblade. When I was chilling looking at my mission\'s then Lloyd hacked into Zane\'s computer he said something I just have a bad memory.',
       'I think if you could add a few extra spaces for more ninja then everybody would be happy .the reason I\'m giving this app a 4 star rating is because you can only have up to five ninja on a mission including your own .if anybody would like that to happen then give this review a thumbs up.',
       'This game is a very sofisticated & awesome one. Controls are now customizable & we can now choose two powers for the avatars Coolest game ever!!!!! 100/100 stars',
       'This game could be amazing if it wasn\'t for the awful camera angles which make it impossible to see what you\'re doing. Fix this and the game would be amazing.',
       'It\'s amazing I love it I like how you can make your own ninja and have any weapons it\'s one of the best games I\'ve ever played I have it on all my devices it always puts my in a good mood a job well done plus I\'ve saw every episode and the movie I\'m a huge fan got lots of the sets (5) stars keep it up' ,

      'So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game',
       'A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job \'fun games for free\' üëèüëåüñí‚ò∫',
       'Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you\'re having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.',
       'I\'ve been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn\'t force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game\'s development! :)',
       'Pretty cool app. I\'d like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it\'s pretty cool so far.',
       'I am actually a private pilot, though I didn\'t have the chance to accumulate enough hours to earn my license. I also have several editions of the Microsoft Flight Simulator(tm) for PC series, along with a yolk & rudder peddles to make it more realistic. Their flight sim program is widely considered to be the top dog among all others. This app, though not in the same league as the afore mentioned, is still quite fun!' ,

      'Lots of fun and challenging trying to find the best placement for a word to maximize your score.   The one objection I have relates to the dictionary.  When checking a word\'s meaning in the dictionary that any opponent played, and I don\'t recognize,  the dictionary will sometimes say that it is an acceptable word for Words with Friends, but no definition is available at this time.  I believe that when playing a game having to do with vocabulary, no word that does not have a dictionary definition should be allowed!  What determines if it is a legitimate  word if not found in a dictionary?',
       'Have been playing for years and the enhancements keep improving it. This is not Scrabble. It\'s a different game wth its own features. Use those features and enjoy. It\'s hard enough to earn coins to make use of the features a rarity rather than the norm. And Word Strength (always available) is great - you can just accept your lower value word or challenge yourself to work even harder to find a better one. It\'s a great game - especially as once you\'ve had a go, you can leave it for hours (or days!) and only play when you have time. üòä',
       'Good game. Only problem there are games that left for 16 + days and you can\'t get rid of them. Even when you nudge the person ... nothing happens. This impacts on starting new games with those who want to play! Please sort this out. Ads too long in version 2. Would rate better if this was sorted.',
       'I really enjoy playing with my friends, just another way to keep in touch even though you\'re miles away! You can also meet and play new folks, as well as play all of the various challenges the game has to offer while you are playing. For example, you earn coins for different words played, difficulty of words played, or words with certain letters. If you enjoy just playing to play or playing for a challenge, this game has it all!',
       'It\'s a lot of fun but... 1. The ads seem to be longer in the latest version, 2. It\'s ridiculous to have words that don\'t mean anything,  3. The lightning race against a team is the best part but there needs to be some good prizes for winning, 4. I love the Solo challenges and I wish they would be scheduled to coincide with the big special events that give about 80 points for a win. I tend to be finished with the Solo event before the big special one begins.',
       'They should call this game Ads with friends.  You are forced to watch an ad after every turn, some as long as 15-30 seconds. Even if you close the app it will force reopen. No option to get rid of ads. No option to contact creators. Brings this game from a 5 star game, to one you will delete and never play again. Very sad they choose to make it this way.' ,

      'I love these games, really, and I was on a roll, but I can\'t get pass level 48 because my Wiko LENNY3 touch screen isn\'t responsive enough to register both fingertips at the same time. EDIT: I was too quick to judge the alternative way to be wrong. Thank you Bart, for your response. I retried what you said and had no trouble finishing the game. Can\'t wait to see the next game. You have a beautiful mind. These things you create, are a work of art.',
       'Brilliant follow-up to YELLOW! ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES! And, there ARE games trying to pretend that they\'re the same...only Bart Bonte does it right!  I try not to let myself do too many levels at once, just so I can extend the game. I can\'t wait for the next color!',
       'This game and yellow have single handedly improved my relationship with my niece. She loves playing these games over and over every time she comes to visit. Christmas day she didn\'t want to play with her gifts, she just wanted to sit with me and play yellow. It means so much to me. Thank you for making these games.',
       'By far one of the best puzzle creators for Android games! I was hoping for another "Yellow 2", and changing the color really surprised me, Looking forward to... Blue? (PS: after playing for a while, All I see is orange :P)',
       'Bart Bonte is a genius! If I see his name, I know I will love it. I just finished this one tonight and I loved every minute. I only needed the clues for the very last level because I\'m familiar with Bart\'s mind by now. &lt;3 I think it\'s great that clues are available though and that they don\'t give everything away right away. It\'s a big bummer when that happens on other games. Love, your die-hard fan! Please make another one soon!',
       'Thank you, thank you, thank you, Bart Bonte! I\'ve been waiting for a very, very long time for this game to come out since I first played "Yellow". Thanks a lot! But here are a few other questions I have for you: what will be the next game? How long will I have to wait until the next game comes out? Could you at least give me a hint? Thanks!' ,

      'Going to give up on this game I have been made to watch the same 30 second ad every other turn. More than half of the time I play this game is the black panther film ad, how many times do I have to watch the same ad...ridiculous overkill. There is no way I will go and see that film now because  your barrage of ads has made me annoyed at the mention of it.',
       'Game is great despite the over long adverts. However on every device I have played it on (smartphones and tablets) it flattens the battery in double time. It seems to hog the cpu which gets warm on each device I\'ve played it on. Anyone else have this problem?  When exiting the game I have to go to the device settings and clear the ram to stop the battery draining and the cpu getting hot. Seems to crash a lot too!',
       'Slightly better after latest updates but still not as enjoyable to play as it was before the major update last year. Glitchy, slow to start and to play. Constantly disconnects from network and having to log back in to facebook all the time is annoying. Can be a real chore to play. Might try and persuade my regular opponents to switch to another version. Jan 2018 update - EA, I\'m a balding 46 year old man - why are you constantly showing me ads for Pantene?',
       'Overall, I would not download this game for the following reasons.  Firstly, how come so many words are not recognized? Seriously, June is not a valid word, so are there only 11 months in the year then? However, words like upta do!   Secondly, this app drains battery life as though is using your phone to power a planet. You need to invest in your own power station, if you want to play this game for 10 -15 min sessions.  Thirdly, even for a free app there are too many adverts. I actually forgot I was playing a game and was about to open a bag of popcorn for the feature movie to begin.  Will be uninstalling now.',
       'Forget the ads, the app is very annoying. Its is plagued with connectivity issues. Ads loads first (at the bottom) before your pending Scrabble games is updated...and that is IF the game lists updates without resulting in network error. Often, it will need repeated restarts to update the list or starting a new random online game to force it.  I cannot recommend this app to first timers because it is frustrating. The Scrabble game cannot be enjoyed as EVERYTHING must be online...even Solo play. Look elsewhere until issues are addressed.',
       'Just like the board game. Love the addition of the dictionary and that you can either play the computer, online or with friends using the pass and play option. Keeping my brain active! My only criticisms are that you have to have an Internet connection to play and the ads in between each move get very tiresome... Otherwise good game that doesn\'t ask for money to play and is glitch free.' ,

      'I wish I could give this game 10 stars. It\'s amazing all around.  It\'s adorable and fun. The graphics are amazing too without any glitches so far. Haven\'t noticed any bugs either. The developer\'s done amazing. It does get repetitive after a while but so far by the time it happens something new unlocks so it\'s still fun. Can\'t wait to see what else you guys do to improve the game play since everything else has been flawless so far. Great job, keep up the great work!',
       'This game is super cute! I love my lil ninja friend! Lol. Nice story, and plenty to do to keep you busy. Will def take time to master, but it def has the potential to keep you interested in playing. Even got my wife playing it, and she usually only keeps games for a day or 2, cuz she gets bored with them. I think she\'ll play this one a little longer than most of the other games she\'s tried. I\'m really happy i found this game!!',
       'This one is probably my favourite, with minecraft and clash of clans. If you don\'t have this Virtual Friend game, then it is you who is missing out. Install and enjoy. There\'s nothing bad about this game, and if Naturalmotion do want me to suggest an add-on, then maybe enable me to link the game with a new device. I was LVL 52 once but I lost it. Now I\'m level 17. Hope you liked the suggestion. :)',
       'I love this game, it\'s simple and sweet. However, there was a middle row in the item-picking menu in which I had invested many coins into to help me level up faster. Today, when I logged in, the row simply disappeared without a trace. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the backgrounding of my app, but nothing seemed to fix it. Now I only have the Training row and the Fun stuff row. It took me quite a while to get those coins and I\'d really appreciate it if you brought the row back or gave me a solution to get it back. If it helps, you should also know that the \'I\' on every icon which used to let you see how an item was used has also vanished. Please fix this, thank you.',
       'You should add a dog and a cat wearing ninja suit they can be like the chicken and the squirrel the dog can run around you and bark and find bones and sell them for coins and the cat can find fish and sell it for coins. It just sounds like a good idea  the dog should be a husky or a smaller dog like a beagle so it is small like the other animals and it can sleep with the ninja the cat can just be a cat please look into this *^* looking forward to this',
       'This is a great game that I\'ve played off and on over the years. I just redownloaded it, and it\'d still fun to play. My only gripe is that there\'s no place to save your progress. Cloud, Facebook, etc. I hate having to start from level 1 every time I have to wipe/switch phones. Even an account that saves your data would be great. Fix this and it\'ll be 5 stars all the way for me.' ,

      'Awesome classic and how a port should be done.  The controls are wonderful, its great using all my gamepads to play. I love how all these great ports to android support that. Playing Sonic 1, Sonic 2, and Sonic CD all with gamepad. Tested on and working great on my Note 3, Note 8 Tablet, Pixel XL, and on Zidoo x10 . Edit: I formatted my phone , i reinstalled the game, clicked on restore purchase, but it takes me to an item not found. 1 star rating until I can restore my purchase, or at least access to a paid version again. Will rate back to 5 when I can play ad free again. Edit2: I found the way to fix restore purchase. Don\'t click restore purchase, just click on buy ad free, and it says it\'s restored and does not re-charge for payment.',
       '4 stars because i dont know how to play as tails/knuckles. EDIT: This game, I\'m starting to get nostalgia, and also, this game brings back the amazing cheat.... DEBUG MODE!!! #SegaIsTheBest EDIT 2: Changed to 5 stars cause I learned to do Sonic & Tails and play as Tails/Knuckles',
       'I agree the controls are really difficult. I played this game when it first came to the us via the Sega Genesis and those controls were way better. If you truly want to play this game right get one of those joystick accessories, otherwise good luck. It seems to go okay in the levels but beating Robotnic is much, much harder.',
       'Hi there my nephew downloaded this game and he purchased a few things on here without my consent. I\'m disappointed because it didn\'t ask him for permission as thus is a kids game it should have parental permission before buy items on her.  I would like a refund of all my money the ks',
       'Installed the game on my chomebook. I was told that it should work fine on it. After installing it, and watching one of the ads...I couldn\'t continue. Tried relaunching a few times to get it to work...Not worth my time, or money to unlock.',
       'A fantastic port of a platformer that still holds up to modern titles. It\'s pretty, the music is great, the gameplay is varied and fast, and the overall experience is just pleasant. The touch controls can take a little breaking in but overall they do the job. Unfortunately, there\'s a blemish in the level design that ruins the rest of what the game has going for it: labyrinth zone stage three. The rest of the game\'s difficulty is based around reflexes and timing. The difficulty in this level is shooting the controls in the knee and tricking the player into a boss fight with no health. This level plays nothing like the rest of the title and it makes one wonder if the developers actually knew what they were doing or just caught lightning in a bottle.' ,

      'So I\'ve won around 100 battles so far. Enjoying the game. Ready to see where this game is taken. I feel updates could make this unto the best mobile music game on the playstore. It\'s nice to always be able to recharge your stamina through ads. I hope updates come and also limited decals. One drawback and a fix needed is losing the stuff you paid for when you change the item.',
       'Would be better if you were placed in matched based not only on your discs but also on the levels of your band. I shouldn\'t get a perfect score and STILL lose because their passive is higher than mine but they made more mistakes. Also maybe up the sensitivity? it seems like the system doesn\'t quite pick up on my tapping  which causes me to miss notes. Graphics are nice and the spin offs are good.',
       'What happens when you miss a note??? NOTHING. the song keeps playing perfectly so what then is the point of playing the game correctly if there is no penalty on the song quality? No point besides screen shaking smh. Make it like the console version where you hear a bad note.',
       'Love the game. But inform understand how I can keep getting 100 percent and losing by 3 or 4000 points.   And. Why is it. Certain times of the day I win. A lot. And some times of the day I lose slot.  She. I win its always against the same person and they get the exact same score.  And don\'t use the pedal.  Just seems weird to me.',
       'I can never watch a video for more stamina and everytime I try to collect the 2x reward money by watching the video the game just glitches out on me. I would have so much more without the flaw. I want to make in-app purchases but this deters me for sure. UPDATE!',
       'Game is really fun. The ads for other game aren\'t cool if you let your kids play the game. Especially it having an E rating. That is unacceptable. I understand ads is why it\'s free  but don\'t have 14+ rated game ads for an E game. Glad I didn\'t let my kids play this yet' ,

      'Downloaded this through another app (free golden eagles) where if you downloaded and played this game, and got castle to level 10 would be rewarded. Sent off request to support a number of times with proof and no reply, and after a week still no reward.   So if you are downloading this to get reward from another app don\'t bother as you won\'t get it',
       'I like the game but it is hard for players who can\'t buy a lot of packs. Some slight tweaks to make it not so slanted towards big spenders.  Maybe make some exchange rate for silver to gold without changing the silver availability or price. Someway that gold can be acquired beside the little in the ground. I understand the game has to make a profit and so you should but more people would continue to play instead of giving up Anyway just a couple of thoughts. Got plenty more on just general gameplay  that I think would be useful. Again, not hating as I like and play the game.',
       'Pure pay tto win. You will either pay or quit out of frustration. Build times are hilarious. Seriously, our Earth\'s sun will die before you max out your hero\'s knowledge or most any other knowledge.  The Stronghold is worthless and a huge waste of resources. It\'s more of a trophy.  Sure you can join a clan, get some bonuses and buy some shields with points, but you will be destroyed by the winners. Me, I had a gift card and blew on this game, now I just start fights and make people quit.',
       'Great time killer, I love the interaction and concept of the game. It can get a bit laggy at times and at it\'s worst, it will crash on you. The wait times are unbearable though. No ads at all since the first time I played too!',
       'The game itself is great. Zero complaints there. But the fact that it I am unable to ever log in is infuriating. I\'ve literally been zeroed out because the app won\'t let me log in... multiple times. It\'s absolutely ridiculous. Needs to be fixed.',
       'Was never able to connect to even set up an account to try the game. Messages to support only returned with irrelevant form letters. Tried my Wi-Fi, data, and Wi-Fi at Att store. No luck and can\'t get an actual human to respond just a form letter telling me to uninstall, reinstall, use different Wi-Fi or get a different phone. All to try their game. LOL If that\'s the support you get when you are a perspective customer, imagine the "help" if they already have you hooked on their game. STAY AWAY!  (Galaxy S-7 Active Phone)' ,

      'My only issue with this game is that u almost have to end up purchasing tix to continue to play. The further u move on in the game, the more tix each card costs & ur only given a certain amount thru a daily reward. App should provide ways to earn more tix, either thru a daily spin or higher rewards. *(since app developer replied to this review, I changed my review to 4 stars)',
       'Really liked this game. Now i cant play it because its near impossible to get more tickets. I cant complete daily tasks as I have no tickets and ive got to wait ages to get daily tickets. Even then there gone within 5-10minutes and cant get no more until following day. Games dont pay out enough either when you win',
       'Just played my first 4-5 rounds and this ROCKS! Not too fast. I love it! Fair Payouts but 1st, 2nd, etc same as others. Graphics work!  All Around impression... Awesome-ness. Update: I\'ve been here atleast  5mos... long enough to know this still ROCKS!',
       'I really like this Bingo  game.  A few upgrades and it will  be better than all the other Bingo games.  I love the amount of tickets it gives you to play.  I love the extra stuff you can earn and not have to pay for.  A couple of things that would  make this game better would be all 4 cards on one screen in tablet mode, the power ups being applied automatically  and being able to daub that last number that\'s  called cause usually that\'s the one needed for Bingo.  Otherwise its great.  I hope  you find this useful.  I understand  if you can\'t  fix all three of these but the first 2 are more important  than the last and i understand  there can only be a certain amount of bingos i guess.  Thank you.  Real close to being a 5 but those 3 issues really hold me back as I\'m  sure it does others as well.',
       'I like this game VERY much. But my tickets keep disappearing! I just earned 200 tickets for feeding the dog. My tickets got added on. Then i clicked on Candy Crush. Then i clicked on 4 cards. And it said i didn\'t have enough tickets! It cost 240 in Candy Crush. I had almost 300 tick. When i looked at the top, i only had 131. What happened to all my tickets that quick?!?!? I\'m about to uninstall now. Its not the FIRST time this happened. But it will be the last! #GoodbyeBingo',
       'This used to be my favorite bingo game and then they updated it about a month ago (give or take a few days). Before the update, I was able to level up daily or every other but, now, it takes me a GOOD week or more to level up. That was my ONLY way to gain more tickets to continue playing without purchasing. I barely have enough to play 2 (4 cards each) rounds each day! REALLY stinks! Guess I will be uninstalling and going back to playing Bingo Blitz!' ,

Are you going to add more levels? I am enjoying the variety of games & never had to buy more points which has been awesome!',

       'Fun while the winning lasted then the losing started and the slaughter was on. I couldn\'t buy a decent win but I sure did lose my ass easily.',
       'I download to play games of my choice, I disliked having to play same game until you level up, all games should be open so we can choose.',

      'So far the best, mostly free, slot game yet. I think a dollar for only one scratch ticket is a bit pricey I mean come on. It\'s only a game. This day and age. More for less, brings more, than less. I\'m not paying a real $1.00 for just 1 game coins scratcher. Otherwise far as for fun. Huuuge is the casino\'s and Slot\'s you should be playing. Definitely a boredom killer.',
       'I\'ve seen some pretty bad paywalls in games, it\'s to be expected...but this game takes it to a whole new level. First 10 minutes playing you will win every other spin, enter bonus games every couple of spins, and win win win..then the paywall. The final 100 plus spins netted me about 5 wins that at least broke even and absolutely 0 bonus spins or bonus games. Definitely not going to pay real money for a game that\'s this tight. Don\'t waste your time. Lots of other slot games that are balanced',
       'Good game when it\'s not crashing. Had it crash 6 times in 15 minutes. Huge payouts during bonus spins. Sitting on 85 Billion that I can spend due to stability issues. Fix this and I will rate the game higher. Playing on Galaxy S 8+.',
       'Awesome game... just like being in a REAL casino.  Every now and then the game will cut out. I\'m hoping it\'s just my Wifi service? ? :\'-/',
       'I think this game is ausome! Very addictive,  fun and all around dope!!!! I suggest if you isnt playing it you better start cause you missing out!!!',
       'Game crashes and loses progress when it does. Was in a bonus and had 8+billion coins and it crashed with 4 spins left and when I reloaded the game seconds later, only had the coins I had after my spin that triggered the bonus. Garbage. Don\'t buy coins in this game.' ,

      'Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can\'t play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.',
       'It\'s a lot other games of this type. I haven\'t been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you\'re looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn\'t find any more connections, that would be great!',
       'My big complain is that I cannot enable notifications, I\'m on a pixel phone and it is no where to be found in the settings menu, I just uninstall and reinstall the game to see if it shows up. It\'s really inconvenient as a guild leader to not be able to get notifications. Thank you',
       'Brilliant game. I\'ve played this longer than any other free game. You can pay if you want to but it\'s not necessary at all if you join a good guild. The tutorial could be better though, some things aren\'t explained at all e.g. how to awaken characters. But apart from that it\'s really good!',
       'Its so sad that  they have ruined the game by being to greedy. When you power up it is almost always 5% unless you want to watch an add. Only graphics are good.',
       'Hey love the game and clearly has lots of effort pit into it. I can\'t say anything bad about it but I\'m having trouble with a high server load and I wasn\'t able to get on after multiple attempts. Would love for clarification for my problem and if I\'m the only one experiencing it' ,

       'Just because you make the game self-aware that it\'s suppose to be "hard" and to have bad controls doesn\'t make it okay when the controls are just awful. The grabbing hit box is horrible and overall, it\'s just a type of game that doesn\'t work well on mobile.',
       'This is horrible. Whoever is making these games should find a new job. Pure trash !',
       'Its challenging but they can make the control\'s better but i like the game it is really fun but hard and make the camera better because you only have to options',

      'While the game is fun, it definetly has its cons. My biggest problem, is not earning rewards. My first encounter with this was watching an ad to get 4k for free, after watching, i got NOTHING AT ALL. My second encounter was with the ranking system, after my second rank completed (reward 4 gold) i had earned nothing! I had my previous amount which was 2, instead of 6! Fix this for a better rating.',

       'It like everything else but I hate that we don\'t get gold from anything and that the sniper rifles and that the bags for the thives cost too much and i will love that the cases we get take less time and have even more slots for even more cases',

It\'s the TANKS and the SUVS   or make it a banable offence because all people do is camp in the last circle with a tank or a suv. Please fix this and I will rate 5 stars.

      'I loved playing many of the slots. One of my favorite games was Big Red. Today the app wouldn\'t open so I uninstalled and reinstalled it. After that, although it wins enough to play a bit of time, having used $700,000 at $8100 a spin and over 600 spins I still haven\'t got the free game. Before reinstalling the app I would get the free games every 50 to 100 spins. Although it didn\'t pay out much in the free games, it was fun to pick until you matched 3 of the same. I won\'t be playing this again. You have taken all the fun out of it.',
       'I play other casino games such as double down casino and slotomania, this is my favorite one but it gets played way less often. I just wish there was a little more to make this game fun. I do not like the fact that the Bonus Wheel payouts are extremely low and the odds are even worse. I believe this game would occupy a bit more of my time if the payouts on the Bonus Wheel were a little more, or the minimum bet at all machines should be lowered. Please consider. Thank you.',
       'I LOVE the Platinum quick hit bc it makes me feel like I\'m in a real Casino. I can\'t go to the Casino often anymore since I have given up on the SCAMMING INDIAN CASINOs so it now takes 3 hrs to drive to a Real GAMING COMMISION REGULATED Casino, so this pacifies me until then. LOVE THE AUTHENTIC SOUNDS!',
       'Do not spend your money on this game, I\'ve spent hundreds. Today I purchased a coin package and didn\'t receive my coins, emailed them and no response. This game is a scam, I\'ve read people comments on fb about buying coins and not receiving them, but I didn\'t take their advice. If you are reading this plz don\'t buy coins, they take your money and you don\'t get what you paid for. I\'m deleting the app, you\'ve lost a good customer.',
       'Game stuck at 30 percent on loading.  Constantly wants to connect to facebook which I rarely use.  Epic fail.  Scientific Games usually work well but not this one.  Uninstall and reinstalling seems to have fixed the issue.  However new issue... I have music playing but this application ALWAYS stops the music even though I tell this application not to play its own music. This is very annoying to me.',
       'Pretty realistic slots. I won and LOST a billion (yes, with a B) in a day. I continue to lose about 200,000 per day, but it always offers me up to buy more. Umm, no thanks. I\'ve fallen for that a few times and nothing to show for it after about 20 spins. Pretty much like real slot machines eat up all your $$.' ,

      'This is an updated comment. I already loved the game just thought it needed better controls. Have to say after the update I gave it a perfect score. It\'s sleek smooth and just all around fun. It\'s very clear they took consumer complaints into consideration and it\'s good to see. Highly recommend if you love GOT and these style of games. Only negative is the farther you advance into the game the more I get the feel of a page of wind kind of situation which is sad but it\'s still worth it.',
       'Would like to see some cut scenes in the game... Probably would have tried it earlier if Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen had been displayed instead of the ugly wrinkled blue guy...',
       'Game is interesting but lots of issues with save games.  If you use a friend code to join someone in a different kingdom, you HAVE to start over with a new game.  If you bound your old game to your Facebook account, you CAN NOT unbind the game!   While there is an option to bind to IOS gamecenter, there is NO OTHER OPTIONS for android players to backup.  Seems to be the trend for developers to release a game to start taking your money then limp along with updates',

      'I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.',
       'I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn\'t work.  So I pressed the \'X\' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I\'m pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE \'X\'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I\'m triggered.  Please fix that.',
       'I really, really love this game, but, I keep losing my ball count and I don\'t understand why this is happening. For instance, I have 90 balls and I\'m supposed to have 92, I don\'t get the 92. I will give 5 stars until the bug is fixed. The ads I don\'t care about because that only happens at the end of each game which is ok. Please fix this so I can give you 5 stars.  Update- I figured out why I keep losing my count with my balls. Everytime I get the balls by the number blocks, it wouldn\'t count themüòê I could get a lot further if this was fixed. If this keeps on happening, I\'m going to uninstall this game. I hope it doesn\'t come to that because I really love this game. Please fix asap!!',
       'If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.',
       'It\'s good at first but you\'ll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.',
       'Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I\'m not spoiling it, but I will tell you it\'s a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don\'t know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.' ,
    recentChanges: 
      '‚óâ New "Speed up the game" option for the balls to go faster. The option appears automatically during the game.',

      'READ THIS NOW!!!!! i love it it is very addictive a great time killer and once you start playing it you can\'t stop unless your battery is dead.how you play it  js t hat you make videos and then by tapping ijt you earn money an d when you have enough ü§ë$$$ you can buy a pug and then he has a store and you buy stuff for it. You also can put stuff in your backk yard. And you c an change the way you look. And the best part i s you can buy really cool stuff with the diamonds and you can earn more subscribers. Thank you for reading this it took me 2 min.to type it',
       'This game is so edicting. I only just got it and ime loving it. I allredy have a rell chanel but this game makes making a vidio simple and fun. All you have to do is tap pres publish and boom you get nice coments good vuis and nice suggestions. Man oh man am i adictid to this game. Good adictid it really really is such a good game. That my freind is why i gave it 5 stars and recomend it to evry one. It is just as good if not better than peudiepies tuber simulator. So pleas get this one',
       'I get that free games have ads. That\'s fine. But you can\'t get 20 taps in or switch to a new tab before you get another 30/50 second ad. I thought this was just a fluke, but it keeps happening every 30 seconds like it\'s on a timer. This game would be fantastic other wise. Uninstalled it after the first half hour.',
       'I found that this game is so addicting till you got like 100000 views ever second... then it becomes very boring... but I do recommend it to people who want a game to play for like 2 weeks but don\'t expect any big reward for play long... I just want tapps to make something rewarding to getting higher like designing your gaming setup or actual able to make a video and upload it to the game... overall good game',
       'Surprisingly fun. I\'m iffy on idle clicker games but the reviews convinced me; there\'s lots of unique aspects to this game that other clicker games don\'t have. It\'s competitive, which is cool, and you can actually customize the upgrades. The main thing that makes me stay away from idle clickers is that there\'s no customization. In this game you can customize your room and yard, character, and even choose the videos you post. Lots of fun stuff to do, definitely worth a try.',
       'This game has to be the most fun game I have ever played. It\'s so simple yet so amazing at the same time. I guess the only thing I can say about this game is that it needs more topics for videos to make. I find myself always making the same videos over and over it really needs different topics to add. You could add topics such as more animal topics. My idea is a pig topic since there is an option to get a pig outdoor of your house or a bird topic since you could also get a bird in the game. Sorry if this short review is pretty long just have a lot of ideas. I really hope you guys read this I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much I think this game still has a lot more things to add.' ,

      'It\'s a cool game, it just could be better and maybe there could be some other things in the update. Don\'t take it seriously! I\'m not trying to be mean but maybe there could be some other leotards and the update and some more hair dues because all of those buns and people may not like that\'s just buns people may want the braids that you always have in your other games. I mean the French braids and they keep going down into a braid, all those things would be nice!',
       'I downloaded this game for my little sister and the first thing she said was that there are way too many adverts and I agree because whenever she clicked on say the dress up or nail salon or gym and adverts would always come up. The game also lags too much even though she has a brand new IPad. However at this time I would not recommend this game. My sister said that she would play the game again if you reduce and have a limited amount of adverts. As well as the advert problems the game keeps telling me to buy everything and it pops up every time I think when you press the \'X\' button it shouldn\'t show again. Please fix this now. As much as my sister loves this game the adverts really annoy her. Would not recommend this game!!',
       'This is from my daughter, "I like the game but there\'s some things about it I kind of don\'t understand. Some of the controls are a little difficult like the one where you have to tap 1 or tap 2 when she\'s practicing. And its fun. Some of it I like a lot."   This is from me, "the app is annoying until you buy it. It downloaded a ton of icons (ads for other games) to my picture gallery without informing me. My daughter likes the game a lot and it\'s fun, but a bit intrusive with the free version. The gameplay is good overall."',
       'It was reqlly fun to play but it really repetitive doing the same thing! I wish the  vault and beam comes out and maybe a freeplay side of the game then a stroy and aslo bigger events!',
       'It is the best game i ever had!!!...the reviews says ut has so many ads..i had just a simple solution: just turn off your wifi or mobile data..and then u can play this without an ad...the problem i am interfering was just the purchasing item..u have to buy ut first...welp...this is the best!!!',
       'I\'ve always loved gymnastics, but have never found a game like this, fun to play, addicting, and not too childish. I really love this game!' ,

      'I liked the game more personally before the recent update. I have a newer phone & since game play mostly in shooting basket race is glitchy, along with buying things on the app, I hate that you can only have room for so many bags it makes it me want to stop playing after a bit. I can see waiting 15 min, 30, 45min, maybe an hour but not up to 12 hours. I used to like being able to buy the standard bag for old gold bar gave me something to look forward too if I won gold in a match.',
       'Fun game. But constantly asking me to buy something is annoying. Also, good graphics but control are not good enough. It malfunction, player with bad connection has advantage and wins game and money. That\'s problematic.',
       'I effing hate the new ways, they just made me pay 25,000 to upgrade my ball when it used to be 2 gs. But other than that this game is badasss',
       'Well... sometimes when I play some people I think mite be hacking the game or cheating. they don\'t miss one shot and I make none or sometimes one or two, that is the only down side but other than that it\'s a good game (suggesten have people by gold or game coins with the money in the game)',
       'So, be prepared for this, Miniclip will suspend you for gaining an advantage on their system. How you do that? I have no idea. But, today I was told that I am suspended from getting credit for my wins. Yeah, what a waste of money to spend on this app, do not do it',
       'The new bags won after a win are meant to get you to spend real money to open them up quicker by using gold. It\'s so obvious a money grab for mini games, it\'s sad. Also, the more real money you pay to get a better in game basketball, the more skills you\'ll have to beat anyone. That\'s why so many people scream about cheaters. There aren\'t any cheaters, just those who paid real money to pad the pockets of miniclip and make the game a true pay-to-win clustermuck.' ,

VEarn points equals vac instead of like some of the others where it takes Toyo points to reach mac etc...Also, InstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TVCD) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to Bankk. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to WaIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'After using it for more 2 weeks here is my review;  This is a great time killer and addictive too. Nice collections of tools, items, etc. But when we tried to play using wifi this lagged like anything. Dead slow and we had no fun of playing and competing. The developer may look into this or give us any guidance for smooth 1vs1 play via wifi.',
       'I just started playing this game and I don\'t think it\'s live matches. The opponents have ai style movements. I\'d like to play against other players in the matches. I\'ve been crushing the ai and want to try real people. But all in all it is very fun. Best badminton game I\'ve played yet. And most realistic too. I\'ve played badminton for about 15 years so it\'s nice to finally find a good badminton game.',
       'Hi,  It\'s been almost one month i am using this game. But there are many problems in this game: 1. game is slow in a multi player mode. 2. Most of the time if you play one on one using wifi or personal hotspot. The game will connect you with yourself only. 3. Most of the time you\'re unable to connect with with your friends only. In a month i connected with my friend thrice only.  I have a screenshot also where you can see that the game is sending a join request to myself only not my friend.',
       'The game is very addictive and congrats to the creater of the game  I loved it too much than any other games.................. This is the he only game I had played for a little long time........... But the prices for the equipments is too big.......... They have to reduce this....... Those who read review this about the game just download it immediately You will be addict to it..........',
       'Amazing badminton game! The game mechanics are perfectly balanced, easy to learn and harder to master. Skill becomes a huge factor when playing against unbalanced opponents. No single play works against everyone challenging you to constantly change up your play style. Just love this game!' ,

      'I like the game but there are a few mistakes in the game . For starters the footsteps don\'t always sound as it should , sometimes I find myself listen to footstep irrelevant to the characters walk. Secondly the combo moves for some characters are a bit broken. For example Berserk, it is very hard to distinguish his  (hit , hit , dash) combo , and when you do,it has a tendency of repeating the dash if you spam the dash button. You can also do this combo in the air if you jump before you dash . Besides those mistakes the game is pretty fun.  P.S. It would be nice if we can crouch in the game so it can make it easier to dodge bullets.',
       'Such a great concept! If you download it now, all features work and controls are nice. The recent update has changed my mind about it\'s improvements; I feel this makes it a better game in that it might not be perfect, but competitive play coming soon and a new leaderboard makes it worth it. Try it out!',

       'it has alot of glitches but over all i love it best hack and slash game i have played,but you should make the light bringer more powerfull though.' ,

Want a game to kill time, literally,  this it. Enjoy and good luck! Update..OK so I spent 5 diamonds to try and get extra spins which I did and won 30 free spins, I was betting 250k and won a whopping 1.5 mill out of 30 spins. Really? Come on! I understand greed but 30 spins and won what was equivalent to 7 free spins. Sheesh this is suppose to be fun right? Played the latest table for almost an hour on all bets and NOT 1 bonus game. GL all you will need it. Make sure bring your lucky rabbits foot.',

      'I really do enjoy playing this game. It\'s a great time waster. Good for breaks at work. Public transit. Bored at home. Good graphics. You can choose the controls method. Great car selection. I enjoy it so much, to help the creator I spend a few bucks now and then. It\'s one of the few games I actually play. Just wish there was actual racing. Or if you could have police chasing you, rather than being the police. Either way, good game. Those would be great to implement. üòÅ',
       'THIS GAME IS OVERPOWERD I\'ve been finding a game that is  A Leagend Car game. Then i found this cool game and  I PLAYED IT ALOT. But not forever.   üéµTHE STORYüéµ  When i\'ve played it i saw a !alarm At the gifts then i liked you at facebook Then i subscribed you on youtube  And i liked you at twitter too. Then theres a free luckybucy thing. The free watch and then you will have $500.THANK YOU FOR THE GAME',
       'This game is getting boring. Yah, Next Generation Endless Racing blahblah. But is this all about endless whatever? I think you must put some thrill to this game. This is nothing compared to Traffic Rider which is you also create that game (Yeah. Traffic Rider is one of my fav game.) I HOPE YOU PUT SOMETHING THRILLING LIKE MISSIONS *NOT DAILY MISSION* AND PUT SOME CAR NAMES IN IT. ONE MORE HOPE YOU MAKE THE CARS IN TRAFFIC MORE REALISTIC IT LOOKS LIKE A MOVING BOX... AND I WANT SOME FEEDBACK.',
       'Hello, üòä I really love this game, my favourite actually! I have play a lot of games, but this one is the best so far! PS.:I never spent real money on games! But in this game you don\'t really have to, so it\'s even better for me and for people who can\'t spend real money in virtual things. I know that there are 1 or 2 cars in the game that you can only buy with real money, but it still is a perfect game in my opinion! üòâ',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a long time on a couple devices and it\'s been a lot of fun. There seems to be some variations in scale of one compact car to another. The models themselves don\'t quite seem to be in scale to each other. You might have two hatch backs that should both be small, even very near in size but when you\'re looking at cars to buy you can tell that the model itself just isn\'t quite the right size compared to other similar cars, and then when you get out on the road with it, it looks bigger than it should compared to other vehicles on the road around it. But.. That\'s not too big of a deal. Great game!',
       'Fun, decent selection of vehicles, graphics and controls look and  work great. But theres a car with no way to get it but paying 15 actual dollars and I hate that. Everything should be earnable even if basically impossible to earn and $15 is alot of money for a single vehicle in a small limited android game. Even the dlc cars in major games like gran turismo and forza are cheaper and those games are way better. That aspect of the game is just confusing is all. Still fun to play.' ,

      'One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.',
       'I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That\'s why if I\'m going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.',
       'Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn\'t get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.',
       'Hi Hay Day Creators! I personally love this game, it\'s very relaxing and a nice way to kill time and does not use a lot of data. However I am having issues with watching the trailers to getting free stuff, I have an android operating system and I\'m not the only one having this issue, please fix this.',
       'I love the game but going to give 4 stars because the newspaper should be in color! Please change this. And please give it a tan for mining tools and maps act so it don\'t take up storage space IJS my opinion!',
       'I really enjoy playing this game however you can only play it for short amount of times as everything takes for ever to cook or grow. Another thing I dislike about this game is that you rarely receive diamonds and you need them for quite a lot of things. Other than that I really like this game a day all of the animals and characters are very cute!' ,

      'While I was playing, my phone battery died and my phone shut off. After turning my phone back on, I now can\'t open the app. When I click on the shortcut, it opens up a black screen for a few seconds and then exits it the app completely and I get a notification saying "Pizza has stopped" it\'s done this a dozen or so times now even after waiting a day. I would just uninstall and reinstall, but I\'m scared I\'ll lose my progress. If my progress is saved to my Google play account, will I be able to get it back?',
       'Very nice! I love the art, cute voices and the game play!  Non I have seen from the others yet that are just bunches of copycats lol. I\'m just into my first hour so  I might change my mind xD',
       'Doesn\'t like this new update. It ruin my gameplay. My hired buddies is not working at all. I manually put the toppings on the pizza. I did buy all the upgrades before the update. Now i earn less than before. Hope you bring back the one tap auto  toppings. Oh and I\'m glad that you didn\'t remove the auto slice buddy. It\'s the only upgrade that helps you slice better, not "MANUALLY".',
       'Really bad. Some people don\'t even say what they want. Then complain when they don\'t get what they want. Just like working at Little Caesars.',
       'Game was working fine until I got to day 40. Every time the day ends, the screen goes black, and then the app crashes and I have to do the same day over again. Please fix',
       'This is the absolute best game I\'ve ever played. No glitches and makes you use your brain. I\'ve maybe ever rated a game 5 once before this. This is one of the best games ever. I can even play drunk in chapter one.' ,

      'I love Beat the Boss 4! But there are some things that I would like to be fixed. For example, when naming your custom boss, the name duplicates. The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can\'t go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.',
       'I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i\'m asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting',
       'Too many ads. It\'s annoying especially when you are connected to the internet. The King Boss is not working and is always saying "Something went wrong, please try again later" and crashes the whole gane. On the other hand it\'s a super addictive and fun game to play.',
       'I\'d happily purchase this game but that doesn\'t seem like an option. Tge ads, especially the LOUD BLOW UP EXPLOSIONS game that go on for 30 seconds are especially annoying. I\'ll gladly buy it, if only to not deal with Fing ads all the Fing time!!',
       'It a geart game and fun to kill time but saying that, i\'m sick of the ad\'s popping up ever time i kill the boss. I know this a free game and that what you have to do get money from it but ever minute is kinda stupid and it stops people having fun. And to when kill the daily boss i never get my reward. It just comes up with try again later. I\'ll rate higher when this gets fixed.',
       'Game is now unplayable due to ads and KIIP rewards popups. The ads bring up my status bar so I can\'t X out of the ad, and the app hangs when trying to load the KIIP program. I have no interest in trying to play something that shovels ads in your face more often than you can actually play.' ,

      'Love this game!  Needs a little refining of the interface to help manage dwellers more easily. Gear inventory listing by attribute would be nice and should also show equipped items to facilitate swapping. Access to character window from each facility window would help with gear and dweller assignment. Load times are long and cause occasional crashes. All of these issues are palatable because the game it\'s so strong.  Still playing as is because it\'s nicely balanced, thank you!',
       'This is a pretty good app,  but when building it needs an option to replace a room with another type. You shouldn\'t have to spend all your caps to rework a floor plan, especially when you built everything not knowing you could combine rooms since the help pop ups didn\'t mention that until after you had been building a while.  Other than that it is thoroughly acceptable.',
       'I love this game, it\'s really fun. The only thing I wished was that when the characters level up, it actually does something more than raise their health. Like, increase stats in the place their working, or increase production. Maybe not every level, but there should be more benefits to leveling up. When bringing wastelanders back, let\'s say they are gone for an hour and you start to bring them back, when you get to ten minutes before they get home and put them back to exploration, they shouldn\'t jump back to where they started, from an hour. Idk. But I love the game.',
       'This game is so very exciting to play. As an avid fan of nearly all Bethesda games, this is a great mobile representation of their Fallout Universe. The gameplay is enticing and there is always something new around every quest; however it should be noted every quest storyline has variance, the quest gameplay is similiar between all. Comparing your dwellers from the beginning to a week into the game and there is a sense of accomplishment. The customisation of the dwellers and vault rooms is satisfying. The only thing I would add that isn\'t already presented, would be multiplayer. A way to send dwellers or explore eachothers vaults. If this option exists, and I just don\'t see it, I apologize.  Great game. Love to play.',
       'I really enjoyed this game but upgraded phone from s5 to note 8 and can\'t get my old game save back. Tried to follow steps and load from cloud but nothing loads. Wouldn\'t really care about starting over so much if I hadn\'t spent money on the game. Hopefully developer helps me out. I can screen shot order history to verify in game purchases if need be.',
       'Fallout shelter is a fun, beautiful quick game you can keep coming back to. For me fallout shelter is one of my most favorite games on mobile and keep coming back to even after over a year of playing it. They keep updating it to. There are plenty of things to collect as well as people u might know from the other fallout games. Really really fun and love the cartoony graphics as well as the easy controls. Great to kill time' ,

      'It\'s a fun game but the developers have made it difficult to advance high level characters unless you want to buy "chances" to get the necessary items to advance.  When I first started playing the game the items were easier to get, now the items are VERY rare to get and more difficult to get. Most of the reward items are basic items you get just from playing the basic levels.  There\'s no real incentive to getting the treasures chests because they don\'t give valuable items.',
       'It\'s a fun game. The challenges and levels are interesting and keep getting harder. But if you resource well and plan your strategies, you can play a lot smoother.   Only thing I don\'t like is the recent update... I now cannot play my regular levels. I can only do the Titan challenge and the raids... please fix ‚ô°',
       'Absolutely love this game but my screen has now gone black after loading. Cant play it any more. Why has this happened? If i uninstall and reinstall will i start all over again? Very unhappy. üòØ Update: restarted tablet and is now working perfectly yeah üòÅ',
       'You totally ruined the raids.  Now it always puts you against higher players and gives them massive turns.  You messed it up it your newest update. No way to win and totally unbalanced.  You waste massive food never to get anyone your level and lose massive trophies. Bad bad bad',
       'This was great to start with, now I\'m getting in to the game I\'m finding most of my shots miss. Played one game misses about 15 shots in a row...... Its just stupid and since the update its got worse and the game is crashing alot too.',

      'I love playing escape games. Have played many like Haiku, Rusty Lake etc. But you guys have set the bar. A mythological story based upon the mystery world of \'Bifrost\', \'Odin\' & \'Thor\'. Great graphics, storyplay, background music, easy controls & that song.. all that with free hints for each chapter. Everything was more than perfect. Now I can understand why everyone is saying that how it can be free?? Marvellous story & fantastic game!! Kudos to the whole team!!! Waiting for your next!',
       'I am stunned. I thought it was going to be a good game from the start because of the beautiful art but everything exceeded my expectations! The scenery is honestly so pretty I would just stop and imagine myself in the beautiful world and ponder. The music surprised me as well, it\'s so full of feeling and gets you very well into the mood. Lastly, the story was beyond interesting. It was very exciting to learn a bit about these myths and legends. Overall, the experience was amazing and I would recommend this game to everyone.',
       'The graphics are too good. Especially when you reach certain points and can suddenly communicate with spirits. It\'s amazing. If you\'re looking for casual adventures for android, this game does the job. Yes, the hints are given, but you are adviced to solve things yourself till you can\'t get any logic at all for the best experience. Good job, Snow Cannon Games. I want more like these. I\'m sure everyone else who\'s played this, wants so too. Please make a similar one on the Aztec Culture.üíñ',
       'This is so far, 2018, one of the most stunning games I\'ve had the privilege to play. Upon opening it I decided that I was going to record my play through and let others see how gorgeous this game is. I get excited to play it. The puzzles are challenging and really make you think while the graphics and voice acting immerse you this other world where spirits roam and the Old Gods still rule. Thank you to those who had a hand in making this game. 10/10',
       'OH ME LAWD. It\'s been such a long time since i found a game on play store that i could label "good". The art style is beautiful, story was captivating but my favorite part was the audio. Sound effects are amazing, the voices i could listen to all day although i don\'t know what language that was. Is there somewhere i could just listen to the warriors singing? They didn\'t sing words but it was still so relaxing to me. I feel like the game is a masterpiece and deserves hundred times the attention that it is getting. Kudos devs',
       'This is a classic point and click adventure game based on Norse mythology. Beautiful graphics, atmospheric sound, music and voice-overs. No stupid hidden object puzzles like in so many other point and click games nowadays, this game is reminiscent of Myst. I really missed a map with teleportation feature though, as you end up constantly running around from one end of the world to the other. A journal where the game automatically saves photos of the clues would have been really helpful as well, had to take screenshots myself. It\'s not overly long either. Otherwise a thoroughly enjoyable game, and it\'s completely free.' ,

       'Game is super cool only started playing about an hour ago and I\'m hooked already. Its a great game, love it. Hours of fun and time to kill which is usually after doing the house chores. My kids enjoy playing the game as well I think it\'s much better than boring football. This game is good for hands and eyes cor_dination as well.',
       'No saving feature. i.e. You cannot play in multiple devices of same account. Facebook connection also seems not to work.   A bug is spotted. In endless mode, plane just fly & fly without any enemies. Making it literally endless shooting at nothing.',
       'Just downloaded the game today, and I\'m already hoocked. I\'m usually not someone who plays mobile games on a regular basis, but this is definitely one that breaks that cycle. Awesome job, people. Awesome game.',
       'Need to fix......I\'ve beaten every level up to 35 on regular hard and crazy but it glitches while loading level 36 and won\'t play. Plus I\'m fully upgraded and when I have my best ship with my best side kicks all the bullets make the game go crazy glitch and screw up. Please fix for a 5 star.....if not I\'ll change to a 1 star and uninstal. Thanks  They never fixed it. Don\'t bother if you want a game you can complete! Last five levels will not load. So hurting! And best sidekick glitches game play too badly for play at all! üò†üò†üò†',

      'Overall super fun game and I\'m really enjoying it, however some of these levels are really easy, and then there are others that are super challenging and nearly impossible to find out. I just wish there was a difficulty setting so you start off with easier games and then it could get harder as it progresses, because at the moment I can\'t pass 70% of the levels without using hints.',
       'They made me misspell Rabbids, including "games" like Sword Art Online and Attack on Titan, and had obscure art that gave really bad visualization of very simple things. Just play a better trivia game. Moreover. Don\'t give us awful games like Unity, Watch Dogs, and League of Legends. Anime is anime. Video games are video games. Video game adaptations of anime are still, at there core, anime. Leave those out of these kinds of apps.',

      'Lost another These constant updates caused me to uninstall this. Fun game - very good game!But if it ain\'t broke don\'t fix it. I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.',
       'It\'s a fun game. If you\'re a COD player you\'ll love it. In general It does good on it\'s own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It\'s good that there\'s a grind to get them but I think it\'s a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.',
       'I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to "rent" which is an option in the game.',
       'Great game play, Great graphic, but after 1 month, I think this is another pay to win game ; the great Gun need to buy,  the Armor need to buy, almost every wining key things need to buy. But some people really like it because they have money to buy all those and "WIN" other pool guy. it is not about skill, it is about money.',
       'This game would get ten stars if devs can fix the spazzout camera episode that happens at least once per minute. Suddenly I\'m aiming at sky spinning for 1-3 secs and usually I die or miss a kill as a result.. please please fix this. Otherwise best mobile shooter game available',
       'So many people using modified apk to paly... Very few gamers playing ethically.. makers must do something about it.    New update is not stable.  After Every 5 min. It shows that my wifi got disconnected, though my wifi is already connected. Didnt face any problem like this in Previous version.' ,

      'It runs out of steam way too fast, then resorts to grinding. It wouldn\'t be too bad if everything didn\'t feel so clunky and the tricklist wasn\'t so bland and limited. Grabs are basically worthless to do, as there\'s a huge delay after doing an ollie that renders the grab low scoring. Hard to get air off of a quarter pipe to start with, and you can\'t really combo them anyway. The majority of the points you get will be from finding long rails to flip trick or ollie on and off and back into the grind repeatedly. All and all, it\'s ok.  Edit: The most recent update added a whopping ten extra objectives to each level. The drawback, however, is the "Russia" level now has to be unlocked with XP instead of completing objectives. It\'ll run you over 30k XP. The other two levels that are unlockable also used to cost 20k XP, but now both cost 75k each which is not worth it considering how little XP objectives give upon completion. The controls and gameplay still feel a bit clunky, and the tricklist is somewhat short still. I feel a good addition would be adding in-trick variations to lip tricks, such as tapping the flip button to switch from an eggplant to gymnastplant along with adding double-tap variations to flip and grab tricks which would flesh out the tricklist some more. Lastly, the game needs to be smoothed out somewhat. Perhaps a more realistic feeling THPS, with less rough animations for tricks. Regardless, I\'ve bumped up to four stars. Keep up the good work, SP3 team.',
       'its very terrible',
       'NOO!!!',

       'So what does the pro version offer that the one I already bought doesn\'t? Also I\'m calling some on the latest update 9/20/17, I\'ve out the no ads I guess version and still have locked levels that require more xp than you can have without buying or replaying the other levels 100 times each. Good game, but I\'m just saying.',
       'I bought the full game.  well worth paying to get rid of the adds. Take me back to the old thps days. Needs more levels but apart from that it\'s as good as a phone game gets. But what\'s with the pro version I never knew about this till I bought the normal version a bit disappointed if I don\'t  get the same stuff that pro version has. developer\'s please let me know .' ,

      'great and addicting. im not sure but is the automatic choose fiend limited? because I could only use it in a few levels then it doesnt work and disappears in the menu. so i thought i have to update the app. after updating i could use it again then again it wont work after a few levels. after the latest update it still wont work. so its either a limited feature oooor its a bug. it\'s just very annoying especially if you had a streak then losses it because you had the wrong fiends because you though it would automatically choose the right one. another is that it automatically spins the wheel even though i didnt tap it. buuut overall still a great game. been playing for years.',
       'I find the fact that the game is geared toward making you pay money to advance easier, appalling. My 4 year old grandson would love to play this game, but the fact that it is so difficult to  advance he would get very upset. By the way he is autistic. I will continue to play for a short time in hopes that this issue is addressed.',
       'I love this game, but in the last couple of updates the Fiend of Fortune keeps popping up with no close button. This mostly happens when I first start the app. I have to close the app and reopen. It\'s really annoying, please fix it!',
       'Told you an hour ago that your game jams up every time you put fiends of fortune on goes to 100percent and won\'t move again can\'t get it to go back o play game please fix fast or I won\'t wait again just delete the dumb thing.',
       'I love the game but my phone screen is broke so i had to get a new phone and i went from level 367 to 1. I am very disappointed',
       'Great game to pass the time.  It gets more difficult to pass levels unless you make purchases in the game to help advance in levels' ,

EDIT:  It\'s been almost 3 whole days since I paid this app for gems in-game and they have yet to give them to me, I have made a successful charge back for my money by calling Google play. Do not download this app and do not make any in-game purchases from this app. Just pay the $6.00 to play Minecraft.',
       'Very good game Please add the detector of Gold, Silver and Amethyst. But if you don\'t want to add three of them but please add the amethyst. I have gold and silver more than 30. But I have only 1 amethyst which is given you after killing 10 pumpkin heads. So please add that.',
       'CandaDroid yesterday I used 5.00 for a gem pack and never got any gems if possible could you give the gems owed cause currently I have yet to see any number change in gems or if you can\'t get the gems could I receive a refund and as proof I payed for it I\'ll email you a copy. The whole situation makes me upset again if possible could I get the gems or at the very most a refund, please and thanks Rhapsodic Archer',

      'Too many ads. I was okay with it at first, the breaking point was when they started playing the audio for an ad in the middle of a game with no warning or screen flash and no way to cancel it. They just started playing noise through my phone\'s speakers. There are other solitaire games out there, don\'t waste your time on this one.',
       'Used to love the game. But the adds kept getting worse and worse. Just did the update. And a sound add played in the background, and locked me from all functions, volume controls and home button. No better than viruses IMHO.',
       'The game is good, but it would be better without the ads. The biggest bummer is that phone gets rather hot. Walk outside bare feet on a mid-summer\'s day about 1/2 to 1 hour before peak-heat. That\'s about how hot.',
       'Ads have taken over! Forcing a user to watch a 15 second ad for every single game? Waste of time.  There are many other free solitaire games out there.',
       'Only until I  played other solitaire apps I could appreciate all this one does right. I like how it won\'t count movement unless it connects and the winning deals are great to hone your skills. Daily deal gives me something to look forward.  It is simple but nicely made. It has video adverts before each deal but it is bearable.',
       'Love to play, but the ads have taken over. They come on full screen, do it\'s hard to get the phone buttons to work. They also override the mute on the phone, and force sound on us. I can\'t write a glowing review for an app that allows ads to force themselves on us.' ,

      'Brilliant but why cant we change a custom setting so i dont shoot my weapons wen i look around. Oh and can we atleast move around when we jump out the plane ive died soo many times because of me and 4 guys jumped out nexted to each other too close but this game is fun to play just download it its awesome üòäüòâüëåüî•',
       'K I\'m not saying the game is trash, I just needs alot more programing. For exsample what is the point of money in the game if all it\'s used for right now is for buying skins that do nothing. Another issue is its over all game you should make it so we can go in the buildings and be able to things more easy and smoth not so slow and not have the controls all crampt together. If you did that it would be a five star game...',
       'I love the game, because i love pubg so much. But i just played like for 2hrs and notice a cheater in the game. So sadly its not good to play with a cheater',
       'It\'s very good nice graphics everything if fun but a suggestion please add multiple player so we can cost who we want or invite someone if they want to team up with you',
       'A nice break from Knives Out or whatever PUBG emulator you play. Fortnite is included in this because PUBG came out first. I don\'t play fortnite tho. That\'s the same as saying you play Roblox.',
       'One of the worst "battle royale" games, if you want to call it that, not only do the guns do absolutely zero damage but the camera positioning is awful so it\'s hard to hit people and movement in the game is horrendously wonky, don\'t download this game, go download knives out or any netease games, at least they made a good working game' ,

      'Guys this game is the best offline game I have ever played as it is toooooo much addictive. U would not believe me, firstly u would die very easily but as u play on then it would be easy to create high score. It also makes your reflexes more faster. The creators have done a great work. And people who are saying there are lots of adds are talking rubbish.  Play it!!!!!',
       'Want to play an ad? Download this game and you\'ll get to experience all the thrills of pop up ads between brief stints of playing the game you thought you downloaded instead of the ads. There is at least two ads per game. Some of the ads go landscape to further increase game play pleasure, X one out and Bam! Bonus round go straight to the app store to see the ad you X\'ed out available for download. Go back and BAM try the X again YOU GO BACK TO THE SAME PLACE. Good times were had played ten games and uninstalled. ADWARE ten millions downloaded how many kept it longer than twenty minutes.',
       'It\'s so fun with all the different types of patterns.im telling you its the best game you will play in your life.When I die it\'s actually quite good, because the last time I did had 100 to spend and when I had passed the next 4 rounds I had 10,000 to spend so you should realy get this game,and Change your life people.Plus the new thing is the star block makes you invincible for a short amount of time for example I was going when I had 93 and I went in 24 star and I Could go through 100 and 123,000 for 1 minute. Anyway great game if you liked my review go onto Episode to see that review. Hope you love the game. Oh and I forgot to tell you a list of all the patterns we have purple, green,rainbow,pink,üçî,üíµ,üöó and grey.',
       'It\'s a very fun game with so much to offer, the snake colors are very funny and colorful, but one thing I do not like is that there are SO many ads! When you simply try to restart a game it makes ANOTHER ad pop up for the 35 time. Please fix this issue.',
       'Nice concept, nice controls, the problem is that is too much randomnes and less skill. It forces me in corners where I\'m definitely dead or the good boxes are in corners where i can\'t go because of the walls and that also means im dead. Please make it less random or ar least make that if i comith to a path and because of the game i cant chage is, at least dont make the first mistake ista death.',
       'Love it, just love it if got addicted to the game in less than 1 second! But, try adding more ways of playing like championships or vs computer or against all over the planet! It might get you into the top of top 5 best games in the universe! Just sayin\'' ,

      'Starting to get frustrated at how dumb the fish are. I\'ve clearly got a block to clear to win the level yet it goes to another spot. Very annoying, especially on the last turn! How about you allow us to control where they go??',
       'I really love the game, currently on level 231. Only gripe would be that level starts with black rubber things on my side each time and never on computer side. Then if I match blue candies it gives the opponent credit towards monkeys. If that is fixed it would be perfect!!!',
       'This game and all the candy crush games are scams! Some lvls are just totally impossible to get though  without buying power ups all the time! Waste of money , cause NO matter how many power ups you buy you will still not get through the lvls simply because the game is designed to make you use your power ups when you dont want to use them with nothing in return. Seriously don\'t waste your money or your time! King dosent know the meaning of fair play they just want to empty your pocket and fill theirs......',
       'Addictive and challenging game with grate graphics. Completed level 1320. The best time pass game. I saw some reviews that people saying game cheats I to felt the game cheated me in level 1314. Any way completed 1320. Waiting for new updates. Amazing and My favourite game.',
       'This game makes me mad now. I really enjoyed this but today all the data disappear and now i\'m level 1 again  I was working on level 1098 now i\'m level 1. How it could happen:(',

      'Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!',
       'I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn\'t get me board everytime i have different desins to do.',
       'A really nice game which also got me hooked up! Nevertheles, it frequently and automatically shuts down, deleting what was there.....this really broke my litlle sister\'s heart, even mine. For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....',
       'I  am finally at the final last level! Before I thought it was boring but after I reached some levels farther I thought it was awesome! And it is the best game ever! YEAH!!!!!!!!üòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüíôüíôüíöüíöüíõüíõüíúüíúüíóüíó‚ù§‚ù§ AND when I was playing my 1st game all things were opened but when I played in my small sister\'s tab all, things were closed! I got everything for free!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA',
       'Buyer beware, I purchased the "unlock all manicures" option less than a year ago, not only to unlock options but also to remove Ads for my kids. It\'s less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed.',
       'This game is amazing! I simply adore it. But sometimes, it tends to hang up my phone for a bit. If you fix it maybe i would give it 5 stars' ,

      'Overall the game is very good but now a days even if I\'m not playing the game a notification appears on my screen which says that Champions (the full name of game) stopped, then there are two options displayed which are "close" (which closes the notification) and "submit feedback" (which I never select as I\'m usually busy) and it oftens stucks while opening my alliance window & it also got stuck today while opening the mastery window. Please fix these issues ASAP!',
       'Besides the long loading, it is an amazing game. It stay updated with the movies. I not sure if the new Black Panther skin is available to play as at this moment in time or not, but the pictures does show the "main bad guy\'s" suit from the latest movie, "Black Panther." So, it is up to date with the latest MCU movies. Also, it have good graphics and good game mechanics for a phone game too. All it needs is some voice acting for the intros like in Injustice 1 and 2.',
       'Kabam have pushed the line too far with this new update. We stand in solidarity with #BoycottMCOC  We are encouraging EVERYONE to leave the lowest possible rating for Marvel Contest of Champions on your App Store, bombard Kabam\'s social channels with #BoycottMCOC and not to spend a SINGLE DIME on this game.  Together we will show Kabam the power of the Marvel Contest of Champions community. Please share with your alliance and friends.',
       '100% will be the last time a play this game so dissapointed in it. Had it for over a year and eventually get enough shards for a 5 star character, open it and I get QUAKE F.S!!! Who the f**k is she? Shes got to be the only character in all of marvel that I relatively dont know and I ALREADY HAVE A 4 STAR VERSION ASWELL!!!. Get a grip and at least have an option to sell back for shards or even a re-spin for credits until then #Boycott MCOC',
       'Please add werewolfs, lycans vampires. Michael from underworld. Only one issue i found in this game. Crystal error every time when i open the crystal the same player opened which was exist already. Please fix this.. And my biggest request to you. Is that please add underworld champions lycans vampires.. You add blade super cool. Like blade vampire add werewolfs or lycans and vampire.. i give you 5 stars because i love this game.',
       'I used to play this on an older device and loved it, it had wonderful graphics and excellent game play. I\'ve downloaded it again today, and it hasn\'t even loaded, it just says something about my internet connectivity.... My connection is absolutely fine.  Oh dear guys, the most simple of things, and it can\'t even do that. Come on!  UPDATE: I submitted a ticket, and no one even acknowledged me üòÇ this is laughable Kabam üòÇ' ,

      'It is inexcusable to allow ads to make such noise when both my phone is in silent mode AND I have the sound off in the game settings! I went over other reviews and the developers wanted to know which ads. Seriously?! How about all of them?! They have to be aware yet refuse to fix the problem. Do not download this intrusive app. Also I get a migraine with the annoying "Ready? Let\'s go!" voice when the sound is on.',
       'Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you\'re given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.',
       'Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.',
       'Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.',
       'The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item.',

      'I would taste this game higher if the only way you could progress wasn\'t by having to purchase extras. Having to waste all my extras to get through a gate with 3 keys sucks and so does knowing that really the only way through is to buy your way through.',
       'I have enjoyed this game immensely up until level 240. In this level, rated HARD, there are most often no options to make strings and you\'re stuck with only strings of 3 of just plain air. When you see the game itself changing the color of treats several times during one game to give you a move, you know you\'re not imagining that this level is designed to screw you over into making fruitless purchases to overcome it.',
       'I would give this 5 stars, if you could select a level of difficulty, like easy, medium and hard.  It is not relaxing at all, once you pass the early levels. I hate the levels with bullies, you should be able to skip them.',
       'Was great at first, but is now so slow that it takes around five minutes to load the next level - or just to return to replay a failed level. Shame, as I\'ve stopped playing it because of this fault.',
       'Yes, I like the game. But I\'m very disappointment about the screen at the end of every single level when you can\'t able to pass it and invites you to buy "5 moves" and if you don\'t have careful it can click by mistake. This time I\'ve lost 140 coins in this and that isn\'t fun at all. And today I lost the daily mission but a minute before I had bought (25 coins) "skip the level" so if, I did it before end the time why appeared that I lost the daily mission? Total of coins I\'ve lost today 165... :(',
       'I love this game so much! It\'s so much fun to play when it\'s like there\'s nothing else to do so you can just play this! It\'s awesome and if you don\'t like it then well you are very weird and have bad taste in games' ,

      'Great concept but it takes an eternity to make profits, level up, replenish supplies, and be able to afford appliances required to accommodate the demands of tje  clients. In about an hour you can come back to the game and have made 60$, but you need 1800$ to buy a freezer to make iced tea. The objectives can be difficult  because one person will say "you need to put these French style chairs before I can give you diamonds" whereas another person says that you need to have the entire cafe Chinese style. This game is fun for five minutes at a time but too slow to play more than that.  It\'s a game you have to come back to every so often to buy stuff you need to progress',
       'Well, I\'m changing my review. This game quickly gets to the point where they push you to spend real money in order to proceed successfully. Special orders require many diamonds which soon run out so you need to buy more to keep your customers happy. They also push for you to buy up to VIP  status. So, if you dont mind spending your own money, then its a great game! Addictive and fun. It certainly keeps you busy!',
       'After months of playing this game I realised  no need to keep gems but to spend them snd rewards are amazing when you got gifts for fulfilling the tasks. So slow pacing. Could have been more exciting but I like this game and I belong to a township that\'s competitive and kind. Awesome game!',
       'This game is a scam. You have to spend a lot of money in diamonds just to move to the next level. Once your out of diamonds, if you don\'t win a pink or gold box, you can\'t buy the tea spices needed to boost your level. The competition rarely plays and the group\'s are inactive.',
       'So far its good. But I had to figure out on my own how to serve the blended specialties to my customers. An editorial would have been nice, but overall great game! One more thing, the character Bill keeps asking me to rate the game, even though I\'ve already done so. Please fix this.',
       'The game lags sometimes and you have to redo all the progress you did during the half- hour if the game closes by itself after the lag.  It\'s just disappointing when you\'ve done something with the spice orders and when you go back after  the lag and re-do it, the spice orders are different so you can\'t do the exact same thing you did before lag. It would be ok if you were re-doing everything starting off with the same inventory in your spice both as before, but there\'s always a part that has changed.Like if you used a spice before the lag, it might not be there anymore when you open the game. Other than that,  I really enjoy the game. It\'s fun and doesn\'t get boring no matter how long you\'ve played. It\'s just the lag-close-changes in inventory and progress that\'s always disappointing every time it happens.' ,

      'This is one of the best flip games I have played in a long time. Love the way they have implemented the physics in the game. It is like flipping the real thing. Every knife has it\'s own style of flipping. The collection is also amazing. Best part you don\'t need to buy gold for knifes. You can earn it. Some of the blades are paid but won\'t mind buying them as it is worth. Amazing job people üëç',
       'Hi! The game is amazing. Simple, yet very addictive. The color scheme is amazing, and the sounds are great. But I do have one little complaint ; Sometimes the "Card" knife doesn\'t stick into the log when it lands on the tip, although it should clearly stick and count as a point. Have a wonderful rest of your day :)',
       'This is a great time-passer (if you finally have some spare time) , good graphics, and mostly good physics.    However, I recently discovered that players are punished via a lock timer for marathoning advertisements to unlock knives... Why?',
       'REALLY FUN AND INTERESTING. i like how there is a very large variety of knives available to get. A few problems : i am not willing 2 pay money for a knife in a game, it glitches and lets me watch infinite vids 4 infinite money, some of the knives are really stupid',
       'A fun and addictive game but there are some issues with the game\'s economy. It\'s all about collecting the different knives but to do that you need a large amount of money which is earned the fastest with the expensive knives (Or just watching ads). The knife you may enjoy the most may only be 1 coin per flip so you feel forced to use another one worth 2 or 3 that you don\'t enjoy as much. I would like to see a system implemented that lets you upgrade a knife to be worth more so you have an incentive to try and use new knives that aren\'t initially worth 3 coins per flip but can be upgraded to be worth 3.',
       'So simple yet so fun!! You can watch ads to earn knives which I love since I\'m not a paying player. Alot of apps limit non payers but not this one. Definitely download it if you\'re thinking about it. Super addicting!' ,

      'Lemme just say ketchapp your games are soooo good!! And addictive including this one it\'s fun and ever since the first play I\'ve been hooked there are barely any adds and the graphics are phenomenal. I play it all the time plz don\'t change this, if u do your going to loose my five starsüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü.',
       'Most of my apps are from Ketchapp. Their creativity and style of games have just been wanting me to download more and more! Right now, Ketchapp is one of my most favourite game groups ever! Keep making more! I don\'t have any improvements, which means that their games are top notch!',
       'Patheitc. Being such a fast paced game you cannot have the blocks starting to move a split second before you\'re going to pass it. Makes the game pretty impossible from the first level. For something that was supposed to be fun, is more frustrating. You need severe luck on your side to get a win. Recommended do not download',
       'Its a good concept, but you need to update it, and make sure the blocks no longer move. Right now, it is by far the most luck based skill game. It is impossible to dodge the moving blocks, so if they are to move, they should move much slower',
       'Good, but difficulty is a bit tough. Unless I was a Jedi, it feels like I\'m starting on what should be a hard level. The AI is way too slow as well. I wish you could could change the color of your ball and race online with others in real time.',
       'I think it is a great way for amiee to get design for her Xbox 360 and help her get over with her anger with her sister and to help her to figure out what\'s the matter but what is the most important thing is to be a fantastic family together but why are we so lonely.... Well i think it is a great opportunity to make new friends to life' ,

      'My favorite FNAF game! The gameplay is just great and the first and second games cannot compare to this one! Five Nights 3 really forces you to use all the cameras to find Springtrap. I\'m almost certain that the series is ending, but God I wish it wouldn\'t! The story behind FNAF is outstanding, and I hope lots of the story is revealed in the movie! You\'re great Scott!',
       'Best game ever I\'ve seen many people play and get scared of the phantoms or springtrap but I completed the demo.I have a good strategy that I used to win I will share it 1. Keep springtrap in cam 09 2. Seal cam 11 in toggle map this will prevent springtrap from going into the vents 3. Be smart and figure out when to reboot stuff etcetera hope this helps. PLEASE make fnaf 4 I will love that keep up the good work Scott. And foxy \'s jumpscares is in the demo',
       'Tip for fnaf3 You know guys if you see bb close to the camera be careful because it means bb is right in your office so he\'ll be jumpscaring but phantoly as phantom freddy phantom chica phantom foxy phantom baloon boy and especially theres no phantom toy snimatronics and phantom withered animateonics also not phantom golden freddy ok now screeeeeeeeee! Oh! And also! There at the office at your table but well i was shocked',
       'Cool It\'s nice, and just like the one on the computer, but its got two bugs that need to be fixed. One is that springtrap very commonly disappears out of every camera view. I don\'t see them anywhere near the office, and then suddenly he jump scares me. Another bug, is that some of the Phantom animatronics appear right after I reboot vents. repeating event keeps them away. If you fix those bugs I will rate it 5 stars.',
       'Great job! The demo is excellent. The programming done to this app has been very well done. The key movement functions worked perfectly and it was not glitchy nor did it crash like the demo for F.A.N.A.F. 2 and 4. Just one thing, the jump scare preformed by Springtrap was slower than shown in Markiplier\'s gaming footage. Might want to speed it up a bit please? Great job :D  Keep up the good work :D',
       'I love this game! This game is fun, but it might turn off on you because its the Demo Five Nights at Freddy\'s, if you don\'t like this game then you have to buy the real version. Do not mess with Freddy, he is the one that gumpscares you the most. Bonie is not in the game ( that much ). Be careful because foxy is one of the death traps. There is a camera on the right that you can look at and on the left there is a camera and when there is a video error you go to the camera on the left then you see which one of the things. :-)' ,

       'This game is wonderful! It is pretty much time consuming! It often passes my time when I\'m damn bored. Only one thing is not there, once you complete a level, you can\'t play that level again. It\'s a humble request to the developers that there should be a feature of playing previously played levels.' ,

      'This is THE WORST game. There is no tutorial, and no way to know how to properly play. During the starting levels, you can hardy jump which renders lvl2 impossible, forcing you to watch an add to pass it.',
       'The game itself is fun and good but theres just so many adds and it gets so annoying. Another thing id like to point out, i beat both killer and parkour mode and didnt get an achievement or even a reward. Overall the game disgusts me',
       'Very good game, its the game I\'ve kept the longest as replaying using different techniques and moves is always fun. Ads arent a problem as they only last a couple seconds and can skip. Only wish is that it would update more, only had one update so far and the game came out a while ago.',
       'Don\'t know if its good bcuz u don\'t have the option to turn off the sound. Lame af. Even if I didn\'t want to listen to my music when I play....... Who wants to listen to the same "ow-crunch" over and over and over and....... Completely lame',
       'Too too toooooooooooo many ads. An ads pops up nearly everytime you restart a level. Really annoying. Takes a lot away from this great game.',
       'Stupid game, not much time was out into developing. No tutorial, very glitchy with bad graphics and heading rendering, takes a long time to get through small and simple levels' ,

      'Fut can not be developed with this building team. Football is one of the most attractive games but how this fut goes? In Vs attack mode, what the hell meaning do chances have? Players must creat chances by themselves not the game. You must let them play whole game and create the chances by themselves. EA is a big builder in football games and develop a lot but have you ever thought how your fut only stands at this place?',
       'The game is nice for every football fan.... Nice controls and good graphics...events are awesome... There r different game modes.. the only thing that I don\'t like after the recent update is that while playing campaign mode there are many stages which requires u to be in certain lvl in VS mode.... I think both the modes should be independent.. otherwise it\'s a fabulous game... The most awesome football game in play store right now.',
       'overall its an awesome game great experience. but Its hard for free to play players to complete and go through the events..... the icons are too difficult to get please make them a bit earlier to get, it will be awesome to have them in the team.... its difficult to get elite players in a pack of 500 fp totw pack n few others packs too... the vs attack mode is great.... EA please make sure that the free to play players to get a good experience of getting new and better players....',
       'Fifa mobile is a soccer game that lets you be a manager and manage the best team. This game have well made graphics and gameplay. The events are fun, campaigns are exciting and attack vs attack are addicting but, no games are perfect in this case it is hard for free to player to complete the team hero event and daily microtransaction are needed. I hope EA will adress this issue.',
       'Ya this is sure that this game is awesome but please make the gameplay same as real FIFA such as at a time 2players can play in a team and can control a team. One more request is that, that you should change the graphics because players in this game are not looking as the real one. I am waiting for the next version if this eagerly hope you make this changes in this game',
       'This season is much better than the earlier. The developers are doing a very good job by listening to the users through Twitter. The Free to Play users will find it a but tough to get the best of the players. In App Purchases will help a lot in this game. But even without paying this game has a lot to offer. Addictive if you are football fan.' ,

      'I love it! Out of all the 4 versions my favorite is this one. And it does say 12+ but it really isn\'t that bad once you get use to it. I just learned to play these games a month ago and trust me you see a pattern of where they go. I haven\'t played it one night. But then again I have never been jump scared. And parents if your kid is 9 or 10 and they want this game I say go ahead and say yes! One of the best games ever!',
       'Best Game Ever! I love this game because the animated animatronics like toy Bonnie he trys his best to hug you. Example: mum is that you? Mum I love you!  The chicken is so weird she has a beak on the stage but when she is at cam 7 in the hallway she has no beak, why is that? Toy Freddie is quite scary but he kind of looks like a stuffed teddy bear instead of an animatronic. Well I love this game thanks for the game Scott Cawthon!',
       'Cool but... It will only allow me to play on my phone and I want to also play on my laptop but when I try to download it on my laptop it says its already downloaded on my phone i dont know how to download FNaF on my laptop D: Can you please make a download for laptops/computers? I wanna try it on my laptop (I have a feeling its gunna be scarier than my phone cuz its bigger screen than my phone O.O) Please make a download for laptops and I will rate 5 stars  and it also shows on the screen there\'s night 5 but in game 1',
       'AWESOME I am in love with the 2nd game! It\'s scary and addicting because you want to come back for more! Fnaf is my fav game in the world and I make awesome fan art for it. (Instagram: Laughingsealey) I am saving up for the mobile versions of fnaf even tho I have all the PC versions. I love the graphics and the lore in this game! Actually, this is the only horror game I will play. I spend hours coming up with theory\'s and watching theorists make more theory\'s. Amazing game and it\'s worth the money!',
       'Awesome but... Great game 10 out 10 but where\'s toy Freddy when he gets off the stage? It seems like he rarly goes o the play room and I NEVER see him anywhere else not even in the hallway! Please fix this so we can enjoy the game a little bit more. And, what happened to the demo on five night at freddy\'s 1? Can you please put that back on the app store?',
       'Awesome! I\'m a fan of fnaf I wish there\'s more nights! I love you Scott cawthon! Tip:Toy Bonie comes from the show stage to party room 3 to your left air vent.‚è∞survive til 6pm without doors and a Freddy mask. Another tip:The Freddy mask doesn\'t work on Foxy just keep flashing your flash light on him he will go away' ,

You have to wait the full 30 seconds every time you play like 2 games which is really frustrating cause it is a great game!',
       'Good job marketing team. I downloaded it cause an Instagram ad said only 1% can pass level 9.. I beat it on my first try. Boring game and disappointing.',
       'Way too many ads. I don\'t mind having advertisements but after every level, I ended up watching more ads than actually playing the game',
       'Fantastic game but way too many ads. You prompt to watch an ad for extra turn, I watch it and then it crashes waste of time. Really annoying.',
       'Too many ads. Played 1 level then there was an ad and I couldn\'t press the "back" arrow on my device to skip the ad. Ad\'s are annoying...other than that, it seems like a good, challenging game. Will change review if number of ads are changed/removed (without paying for "no ad version" as I\'m a student who would rather buy school stuff).',

      'It was fun while it lasted. I was a big fan of the first game and this one was an awesome improvement. Unfortunately my game crashed after months of playing and forced me to play the tutorial again. UPDATE: After reaching out to Pikpok customer service they reset my story progress and gifted me several leveled up weapons that help balance out what I lost. I appreciate their rapid response and look forward to playing more!',
       'After i reach chapter 4, suddenly all my weapons progress are gone,  then i contact the support team,  and they dont restore my previous weapons,  but they give me MORE than what i have before. üòÑ  I really happy with this,  and i really appreciate this.  You guys should try this game. This is AWESOME. Now it\'s time for me to kill more zombies üòé',
       'I give you guys a 5-star rating. The graphics are amazing. And the weapons are cool. The only thing. I wish we didn\'t have to have the stamina constraints. And it would be awesome if I was able to keep the extra ammo I find so I have it for future levels. And also its a pain in the ass to level up the guns all the damn time',
       'Be better if i dont get all wepons down to a double barrel and pistol after months of gameplay.   Second time this happened so far.  Good game and story but gota work out the bugs.  Cant play level 8 with a level 1 guns.   Uninstalled the game.  Waste good money playin this online',
       'OMG. I definitely LOVE this. Better than the first. The storyline had me excited. Now it\'s more fun running with a goal. Love everything. I\'m on the lowest graphic settings but I still encounter minor lags. Oppo A83. But that\'s fine. I love how you can name your companion. Makes it more personal. Good job!',
       'Excellent game. I am totally addicted to it. Developers can you please include a reload button. Also sometimes playing I hit a wall or fence and it becones impossible to move left or right. In that case moving a couple of steps backward coukd save us in the game. Please include these options for making the most out of it. Overall its an excellent game and I highlh recommend it.' ,

      'Hello I\'ve been playing this game for months, so much so that I began to pay to play it. In October of 2017 I had a late payment that resulted in me loosing my VIP status. However; My bank account reflected withdrawals of 9.99 for game plays from October 2017 until January 2018. Google was able to give my money back for January but I have to now contact the Administration of this game in order to be reimbursed for previous months. I love playing this game but I will no longer pay to play anymore.  I will keep you all posted on my outcome.',
       'Decent amount of ads.  I sometimes have an issue where it suddenly stops accepting input. The game doesn\'t freeze, just can\'t do anything. I\'ve tried going to home screen and back and even turning my screen off and back on, nothing works.  Have to force close it. :(  this happens maybe 1 out of every 7 or 8 times I play.  Samsung note 8.   A "live" or else "play with a friend" type of feature would be cool.',
       'the game does too many resets, all on its own. i can be in the middle of a game, and the game will stop in mid-stream, then start a new game, and causing me to lose not only what i have "won", but will set me all the way back to the bronze box, or, in the case of special games, such as the winter sports 2018, back to the red box, when i actually finished and won the silver medal. the game can be veeerrrrryyyy slooooooooow, and often is. i enjoy the show when i get a chance to watch it, but am not so sure about the game. it would also be nice if there were instructions on how to play the features that are *not* in the tv show...',
       'Used to love this game!! Never purchased anything just did the free play. I received a Google play card for Christmas and decided to buy 400 diamonds. An ad popped up asking me if I wanted to buy a mystery Santa box for 1 diamond I did and it took my 400 diamonds!! I then was given 40 diamonds on the lifetime list for winning a certain amount of shows... when the game refreshed my 40 diamonds were gone?! Fix the bugs!!!!',
       'THEY OFFERED A FREE TRIAL FOR 7 DAYS IN WHICH THEY GIVE YOU DOUBLE COINS AND A FEW OTHER PERKS. I CANCELED WITHIN THE 7 DAY PERIOD SO I WOULD NOT BE CHARGED AND THEY STILL CHARGED MY CARD.  I HAVE BEEN REQUESTING A REFUND FOR ALMOST A WEEK ALREADY AND THEY ARE GIVING THE RUN AROUND.  I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE FREE MONEY TO GIVE AWAY.',
       'Extremely laggy, ads do not always close, and the game freezes or closes itself very often. It almost exclusively does that while in a game, so you automatically lose. The inbox always says there\'s 1 more message than there actually is. And sometimes hitting "play" closes the app instead of starting a game. Complete waste of time.' ,

      'Really impressed with this Escape room! I\'ve tried several others where I don\'t get anywhere, it makes it no fun to play! This one is just hard enough and some easy ones as well that it makes you use your brain & have fun at the same time!!! I\'m basically a beginner and got stumped quite a few times, but eventually figured it out. This is the best escape room app I\'ve played so far! Please make more!',
       'This really got me thinking, I loved the variety in the levels. The only issue is that some levels do have steps that are impossible to figure out as there\'s no connection in the clues. I had to use the videos more than I would\'ve liked. The other issue is that you can\'t save progress so have to start a level from the beginning if you move away from the app.  Overall a really fun game that\'s had a lot of thought put into it.',
       'I love the challenging concepts. But in 2 of the levels, there was no way I could work out the clue. You cannot see a hole in the wall in level 9. Not can you figure out the code on drawers in level 11 as the colour shapes are not relevant to anything. I had to go to clue which was disappointinting and still didn\'t follow. Otherwise I would score game higher. A few tweaks would be nice please.',
       'This game deserves my 5 stars!  and I\'m no doctor but this is a perfect brain teaser to help your mind grow. It\'s addictive and for me no matter how hard a level got I NEVER wanted to delete this wonderful app. I now mastered all the levels and now it\'s time for me to delete it.',
       'Me and my two kids loved this game! It took us about a week to beat it but we were so proud of ourselves when we did. The help button was very useful for us in a couple levels that we just couldn\'t figure out. Fun game that really makes your brain work. Can\'t wait for new rooms!!',
       'Beat it within a day. You have to have good logic and reasoning skills. This is one of the top escape games going. It\'s not like others where random items open up doors making no sense. It\'s more tomb raider/resident evil type escape puzzles. Great game. Need alot more of this. Good job devs. Goooooood jooooooobbbbb!!!!' ,

      'Can one also be able yo take turns??  I dont like it straight all the way to nowere. And brake should be fully efective one should STOP anytime he wants and also dont sale cars it should just be affordable by coins  Its really a gr8 game but only a little more work.',
       'Ok..but needs work No challenge n no real upgrade kinda wasting my time. And what\'s up with this buying the last car, there\'s no horn and way to keep the player interested that is why give it only three stars now if you fix it maybe I\'ll give give starsüò∂üò¥üò¥üò¥',
       'Spin my ride No more speed, I\'m almost there! Gotta keep cool, now gotta take care. Last car to pass, here I go! As the line of cars are going so slow! 5 star rad! Gotta get back to the game, all. See ya....Speed thrills!',
       'The game itself is very fun to play and very entertaining, however, the points system is a bit off. The reason for that is it not about the distant (which I like about) it about how many overtake you can take in a single game. That is what I dislike about this game. Also the cars... Not a lot of cars (need more). Few questions: Will there be such thing as upgrade speed or car customization? Will there be special event like special map that the highest rank get some kind of reward? And lastly will there be a competition of ranking ?  If all the that happening in the future this game definitely deserved 5 stars .',
       'Basic. You have to over take cars... That\'s it. When they talk about the physics being like simulation they are lieing. Left right go stop. Poor 16bit sound that you will want to turn off. It\'s like a game from the 80s. Uninstall.',
       'Incredibly boring gameplay with absolutely no objective. I got bored within minutes after realising that there\'s nothing to do. No improvements on the first version. Why not add a chase element or even timed checkpoints... anything even?!' ,

I under stands u need money but you should put purchases so u get some more money !! and also I want to have new characters and themes that will be cool course I nearly got all but I haven\'t! also change rating to pegi 3 I know there\'s the characters can be a vampire but srsly IT\'S NOT SCARY what is with wthat!  sorry it\'s long but thanks for taking time and reading bye!üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÅüòÅüòÅ',
       'I really liked it at first. But now all I get are ads. it\'s so irritating to be playing and then ad pops up at the bottom. You\'re clicking on your character to jump & you click on the stupid ad than every time you die you have to watch another ad so annoying. But I could get pass the ad      after you die but not at the bottom of the screen. Makes me not want to play it anymore. And I\'m only on day 3. It was a cute to relieve stress and now it just gives me stress.',
       'This adorable & addictive game is very fun to play at any time of the day! It is definitely a close competitor of the infamous"Candy Crush" trend. For such a simple concept, it never ceases to amaze me; especially since I can\'t seem to get a long enough winning streak to increase my stack count. I admit, I suck at this game... Yet I can\'t stop playing it! 4/5 stars for me. Loses a star for excessive ads and lagging during the game.',
       'Very very addictive pass time. Only a lil disappointed with the adds popping out every now and than. I know its a free app and adds are inevitable but try reducing the number of time it should appear not after each and every round.',
       'It\'s a very good game! I got my boyfriend hooked on it, but my problem with it is, sometimes when I start up the app it sits on the beginning stage of the app?? Like when am I going to be able to play again? Was just updated? So I\'m going to have to delete it and start it all over and re gain my high score??',
       'There are wayyyy too many ads seriously. You don\'t need that many ads for your game you have enough money you have a bursting game brand . Most of your games don\'t even have as many ads. Every failed turn "here\'s an ad buy my game!!!!" No!!!' ,

      'I love that I can play as often as I want.    It isn\'t like other games that make you wait a few hours to play again.  I\'m happy with the win/lose ratio.  This game is very addictive.  I also want to add that people complaining the game isn\'t completely free... it\'s just like any other game on play store.  If you want better odds on getting rare cards, then yes you can purchase them, but you don\'t have to spend any money if you just want to be patient and earn them by playing.  Come on people if you want to start off owning rare cards from the begining then support the developer and buy them.  Otherwise have fun and play your way to better cards.    Would love to have the option to play a selected friend :)',
       'The game is easy, simple, funny, strategic with a bit of dice luck. Although the map needs to be a little bit bigger because the battle is too short due to the Monopoly. Also are not available most of the time so I can\'t skip the bags opening time',
       'What happened? The game loads, plays 2 minutes and crashes. Used to work perfect before the update a few days ago. Can\'t even get to a match to play the actual game.',
       'Completely, undeniably luck based gameplay.   There is no skill required, build a deck with high DMG and high DEF with decent cards and you\'re good to go. If you win you\'re lucky, if you lose, luck wasn\'t on your side. Not much more to say than that.',

      'Simply wonderful app!! My daughter\'s speech is delayed and I introduced this to her at 17months. By 20months, we were hearing her sounding out the letters after it\'s repeated in the app and she has learnt to choose the correct letter when asked by the app. She couldn\'t get enough of it! Now we\'ve moved on to shapes and colours that she\'s working through now at 22months. It\'s truly amazing. Thank u for no ads. Beautiful graphics. No issues with touch or connecting. Would love British English version tho where \'Z\' sounds out as \'Zed.\'',
       'I absolutely love this app! My child has learnt so much from this along with all the other apps similar as well. There are no adds which is very much appreciated with a 3 year old that will click on anything. I would recommend to anyone!!',
       'The apps from this company are terrible 2 different phones and my touchscreen doesn\'t work when they load along with gave me adware on both phones to boot.',
       'Top listed apps for kids. It will be very useful if you make an apps for Bengali alphabet like this Apps. I got more apps in Bengali but not like your ABC kids apps. Plz....',
       'Amazing app for toddlers. My 2 girls LOVE it. I like how after they say each letter they sound out the letters. And for the other section where the "a is for apple" i think it should be the whole alphabet instead of just a few selection of letters. Because some times the letters repeat.. Like they\'re learning on just letters j or a.. Etc. Idk if you understand me or not. Oh well just my opinion but THANK YOU Also, for those of you saying it has bugs or its very glitched. CHECK YOUR CONNECTION. most of the time when that happens its because either your phone is sh** or you have bad service. Get on that WI-FI',

      'YOU GUYS ACTUALLY LISTENED!!! Im so happy right now because when I saw theres a new update, I immediately downloaded it to see if I can play it without crashing. I can actually play it now with my friends! A little bit of framrate drop but still... I can play this wonderful game. Im going to totally recommend this game to my friends. The devs of this game are the best devs in the Google Play Store. Again, Im truely greatful and I thank you guys. :D',
       'Hello! I\'ve seen this game many times from the ads and I tried installing it and later found that this game was really intertaining and fun. Anyways, I am having problems with the game\'s connectivity to the internet. I am using 4G in playing the game and it seems that it does not connect very well, other online games connect well to the internet. I think that is the only issue I have in mind. Just hoping for more smoothness though.. But I love the game, it is worth the time playing. Thank you!!',
       'I dont know why you chosen Retro style graphic and i hope for a change. There is a lot of IRANIAN players but PING is over 250ms and too much delay. Add iran flag. Google play sign-in is not working. Add more skins. Events are just bunch of objectives and prizes, add more artworks and stuff for events. Other things are good for now. Thanks for the revolutionary IO game. Congratulation on 10million downloads üíù',
       'simple, fun, addictive gameplay, good graphic with unique animations, great events that keep players active which is good, have great potential. dark adventure loading still takes too long, i already dead when the loading is finished. crashing and some bugs in event tab. talking about awaken system, man atleast dont downgrade the stars or reduce the percentage of downgrade, finding awaken item is already damn hard. this great game need new character and more feature but not p2w. keep the good work barbarq !!',
       'It is the best game I\'ve ever played! With simple graphics and gameplays, you won\'t notice how long you\'ve played! Generous with presents daily and very recommended to spend time. However with the new update, I can\'t connect and it stayed on connecting. Tried to change internet source, but to no avail it\'s still there.  I would like to ask the developers, to reply as soon  as possible, on what should I do to get rid of this problem.',
       'Feels like lots of players are AI bots. I\'ve won my first 10 matches with a 10+ holyshit mega kill every time. Looks a bit pay to win as a champ you must buy has a very OP skill. The amount of awakening to hit 5 and get the extra skill is astronomical and will require money to be spent. Also, not one person is speaking English. It\'s all Spanish/Portuguese.' ,

      'This is a great game with good ideas. Don\'t listen to those people who say it\'s bad as its not. There are some flaws, mainly in the fact that there are only a few maps so more maps would be nice. Also, it would be nice if you could change the name or if there is a way, tell me. There are other slightly bad things but overall a great game.',
       'Great concept the only thing wrong with it is the slow movement\'s that happens some Times during the game hope  that you all fix it. Another thing is the lack of stages there are only four to three stages and all of them are with ice add more and I guarantee your that your ratings is going to rise. Finally the option to change your name at the main screen and better control\'s than just jumping. Would love to play it once these issues are fixed and I don\'t mean to be harsh hope you all got my opinions',
       'This game is good awful DO NOT INSTALL. The graphics are the only decent thing in this game and they are ripped off of the real game. The controls rarely work. The ads are always in the way. The AI\'s are OP and there is no point in playing the game. Its a much better idea to just buy the real game on steam instead. 100x better',
       'The graphics are perfect for the style, but attacks should be more under your contract with weapons, and variation without. I also can\'t find the Bluetooth multiplayer hinted by the Bluetooth connection permissions. Is that a later feature? If so please add soon!',
       'I like this game but please the attack please make it more sence attacking only jumping why dont u make like in pc moves',
       'I think it\'s a bad game because it doesn\'t have multiplayer mode, it makes you fight on the same maps with the same people, and you can\'t make a name. üò¨üò¨üò¨' ,

      'It\'s a great game fun to play. But you should also have some mini games to like where you have to stack the food or swipe bad items off the table. And you need to have more mysteries out as soon as possible because I was really getting into the game n I didn\'t have anymore to play',
       'BEST app EVER made for mobile gaming! I personally can\'t thank you enough for making this game! It doesn\'t even need the stupid IMHO energy to play! You can just play forever :) The only "bad" thing i think its the "poor" voice over! It has all the quotes for all gang members but i just wanted to hear all the captions written in the script with their voices. Other than that it\'s the best game ever played on my cellphone. &lt;3',
       'Game was quite easy since I\'m a teenager and its geared towards kids, but I still found it enjoyable. More levels need to be added. Maybe even unlimited mini game mode where you try for high scores. Not the hidden objects one but the one where you stack food and also the eating food one. The game crashed a couple times on me and froze but it was fixable by closing it and going back in.',
       'Would of been great, has WB run out of money and can\'t afford sound-a-likes or the theme tune? Could be the greatest game ever but the voices are dumbed down. I can do a better Shaggy and Scoob voice.',
       'I love the game, just need more mysteries!! Soon please!! I\'m like a huge scooby-doo  fan I have been since a little girl it was mine and I\'m daddy\'s thing as a young girl, and I still love Scooby-Doo  just much now as I did then. So hurry with the new mysteries!üòò',
       'The one star is probably not a fair rating but it won\'t load, all I get is an orange screen. Once I got to the van where Daphne was talking but that\'s all a frozen van with random words. I\'m really bummed because I really want to play this.  I\'ve uninstalled and re- installed 4 times.' ,

      'Overall a great game, there\'s one feature though that I feel lets this game down. Just the small fact that a father can copulate with his daughter, then again with their inbred child if you so wish. I currently have 4 generations of inbred mutants running my castle, if anything the extra fingers actually help with certain tasks such as cleaning. Do you happen to have a designer working on this with the surname Fritzl?',
       'Why in the f**k does this require an internet connection. Fallout shelter is the same thing but doesn\'t need internet. Sure you can use internet for purchases and rewards but it definitely should not be required. Please consider making this offline compatible and I will change my review to 5 stars and a positive actual review of the game. Thank you.',
       'Definitely worth downloading and trying out.. It\'s just like fallout shelter but a little more. You can do a story line and attack other players rather then just sending people out and HOPING to get something good. It\'s a little slow at first but it\'s really quite alot of fun and the creators actually listen to its players.',
       'AWESOME GAME! Time killer, infact it takes all your time away from you. Relationships will suffer due to this game, marriages will fail, you will forget to shower. I\'ve been married 24 years, or should I say I was married 24 years, Theresa left me today, and she took the kids. I lost my job at the firm, but who cares! My castle is level 50, all my subjects rejoice at hearing the sound of my voice! I am a good king! Being a loving father and husband is for chumps, why take care of your family when you can be absorbed in a beautiful fantastic world of orcs and wizards and princesses. I could probably just watch Lord of the Rings but that is fake, this game is real my subjects! REAL!!!',
       'Good game but when your rank gets high all of a sudden most enemies are too powerful. Then it takes forever to gear up. Solution is to deliberately lose and lower your rank. Not good. Also you will find yourself with a lot of gear after you played a while. Would be nice to able to sort it, not only for your different warriors but also all the production gear. Would be good to be able to more easily compare gear in your stash and what your inhabitants are wearing. It\'s a bit messy now.',
       'Seriously, what gives with the battle system? If you can\'t beat someone 75k below your power rank because they have no real life and spend 20 hrs a day grinding for equipment - what\'s the point? Ofc I could buy that equipment with real money but would I support another pay2win crapp? Uninstalling.' ,

      'It is so fun also I made a vid about it on YouTube and more people downloaded it. My channels EXTRA cool bro Gamer. Another thing is that every time the bottle lands it plays I am the one and shows these funny videos. don\'t listen to the people who say this is rubbish cause this is EPIC I love it go download it it\'s so fun.',
       'It\'s easy to get ready to do a real bottle flip. Even when your not good at it in both. Just keep practicing every day doing the same thing.',
       'This is a game for me because I\'m savage I\'m a kid on my mom\'s account I love water bottle flipping I give it a 5 star for THE AM THE ONE plus the video I ignore the ads',
       'It\'s the worst, no levels and they copied the game from another. Whatever you do, don\'t get it. It\'s so amazing how people like this.It\'s a new version of a really fun game and now it\'s just stupid so don\'t get it.',
       'I think  this game like helps you practice water bottle  flipping  because what if you went on stage and flipped  a bottle.  And that  was my opinion  so yeah',

      'This game has a chip sale and it never pays out. It constantlyI takes it all back. I have been playing DoubleDown Casino for over a year now. I have enjoyed the game tremendously. However I noticed that I purchased chips all the time. The game takes all the chips each time and you have to repurchase. I have a Samsung Galaxy 6 Edge Plus. I have tried to install DoubleDown Casino many times and it always crashes. So for now I will not install it on my phone. I am still playing,its addicting..but i am still looking for other games to fill my time.',
       'Graphics are totally messed up at start up.  I cannot see games. The games that appear are games I do not play. I have deleted and readded casino but games are still not showing. Wheel spins give low points. Hard to get high points. When you manage to get a good score, it takes away until you get low. I like the games but often lose down to nothing. I will not buy credit for any games I play so if losing  credit is an attempt to get me to buy, forget it. I have kept this casino open longer than any others because I actually like the games.',
       'This use to  be one of the best games ever. Now you rarely seem to win anything. The more you play the less you get. Promo codes are marked invalid and it goes into maintenance  often but never improves.',
       'This game wouldn\'t let me play. It said login in to facebook or play now. I has 13000 and it took my money and started me back at 1 with 1000 at the begining.  It won\'t let me play unless I push facebook. I\'m mad I don\'t want to start over. Freezes won\'t open. Since updated. And stole my levels and money I won',
       'I knew there was a reason why I quit playing double down once before     they cheat   don\'t play fair. And they are cheap',
       'Like the new games that have come out. But you get little or no bonus when your points are down to the bare minimum. Some of us don\'t have alot of money.' ,

      'Its rlly a good game for brain training!! Idk why but i didnt find any bug, glitch, or smthing like they all saying. It works well in my device. This is the best app for training your brain. Ofc its not easy, its so challenging, in a good way. I rlly struggle in quick searching and some stages, but its just so addicting and so great!! I recommend you to download it!!!',
       'Additive and helpful. Its not an over night cure so people expecting that need help instead lol. It doesn\'t deserve a low rating. Yes theres add but it\'s to be expected with a free game. Having adult a.d.d and huge memory issues.. i can i liked this game. 100 doors is anther good one.',
       'It\'s fun. My problem is on the attention one we are suppose to click stop once the red dot is on the brain and I do. There is plenty of time to click it  but it tells me i missed it. No matter how many times I click it while the red dot is still on the brain. If I press it 10 times then the screen that tells me I\'ve failed comes up 10 times. Driving me insane.',
       'There\'s a glitch in "Quick Decision Skill" game. It is based on whether the previous and current object is same or not. When I click on the peach-moon-type object as same, it gives error, though I click on Same when two moons appear consecutively in the game. This way I\'ll not be able to clear the levels.',
       'I love it!!! The games are interesting. Now I am on "memory match" game which was initially locked and it keeps on freezing and promotes me to next level without me completing the level well. Besides that, I would highly recommended it to others, it\'s worth installing.',
       'This is completely addicting in a way I\'ve never felt before! I can still walk away from it but the concepts seem so simple yet provide enough challenge to make me think of it even when I\'m not playing! It\'s delightful to say the least!' ,

       'Honestly this game is terrible. As a fan of WWII games and history, I wanted to try this and have fun with it. Unfortunately there is no fun to be had here. The graphics are mediocre, the gameplay is flat and boring, and it is completely hisorically inaccurate. For instance, you start the game with a weapon called the BA 90, which is clearly modelled after the Kar98k, a German rifle which doesn\'t belong in the Pacific theatre. Instead, the Japanese should be using an arisaka type 38, and the Americans a Springfield or M1 garand. On top of this, while clearly showing that you load a 5 round stripper clip into the rifle, it only has 3 rounds to fire before reloading. In addition, headshots do not do bonus damage, the tanks are not from WWII but are modern, the M24 and M25 are also not from WWII, and enemies shot at long distances don\'t even notice they are being shot. You can tell that very little effort has been put into the game, and that the developer relies on fake 5 star reviews. Do not get it, it is a disgrace to all the other great WWII games that you should get instead.',

      'I hate it! There is only three looks to do, and the make up! Literally you have to click on it a thousand times until you get the one you like. The cloths aren\'t that bad, but they can be a little more pretty. They should make it for boys and girls, so you can dress up boys, and maybe the boys can take a girl on a date so, they could get married and then they can have children but, it would be a life cycle! They would start out as babies and grow on and get married!!! Hope you like my feedback!! P.S. Plz update the game!!!',
       'I gave you 4/5 star\'s, if you make a second version then i will install it again and play it then make it 5/5 star\'s, if not i will move on to more dress up game\'s and other types of games',
       'Really! you could only do their makeup and dress them up! BORING! Hmmph!',
       'this is a good game. even if you only have three looks it is still fun to make up different looks each time you play. invent and try out new styles x',
       'It\'s boring because you can only do three themes and all you can do is makeup hair and dress up sorry not the best game',

      'This game is at most decent. The biggest issue I face in the game are the symbols. The power up stars to help you level up, the scatter symbols and the bonus symbols only get in the way making it very difficult to get good line hits. Not to mention most of the slots pay very poorly. The bonus games are unique but very difficult to get and pay poorly. The free games are very boring with no real motives to get excited to get them, also poor payouts. You can\'t make an account and not save progress. The Artemis slot and Hestia slot NEED AN UPGRADE, two very promising slots are ruined do to the fact that the scatter and star symbols all get in the way. PLEASE get rid of the damn stars And make free games obtainable in a different way. I can not tell you enough how many times Iv almost had a good 5 of a kind when all of a sudden the star or scatter symbols get in the way. The hourly free coins are decent and the daily free spin for coins is ok. There are also it\'s good side to this game. Like I mentioned before the bonus games are unique and fun and the graphics are great. The slots offer a few ways helping you to gain a good win and achieveable quests to help you gain more coins and level up faster. This games has much promise to it and because it is sill an early game I think I will continue to play it in hopes that the creators can update this to be a fantastic game',
       'Not crazy about the way you finally get a bonus play.  It doesn\'t pay all that great.  I have played much better and more fun.  About to uninstall.',
       'Does not hardly ever match with the amount you are betting so if you are betting 500,000 you will hardly ever match it or win over the amount so the small bets suck and do not equil to the amount you are winning. Sure you will hit some big wins but watch your winning amounts and see it dwindle slowly.   Winnings are fast at first but slows way down. I use max bet when testing slot games and this one takes your winnings just as fast as you get them.  Also u have to follow there story line and you start off with just one game that you have to play for 10 levels and a new game opens and that is every 10 levels.  So at level 100 you only have 10 games to choose.',

      'Great game for its genre. However it desperately needs some events maybe a daily login bonus and some form of vip ladder. I like the nostalgic of the old game but I feel like the developers made the game and just walked away from it. Please for love of games add new stuff and throw some events to us who are almost maxed out. This happens and I\'m totally cool with a 5 star rating',
       'Pretty fun. But I don\'t think drivers or taxi drivers should drive like that, let alone be rewarded for hitting other cars like they do... Lol in the car it\'s cool but I wouldn\'t want to be physically in the game. It\'d hurt and be scary. Lol',
       'This is one of thee worse remakes of a classic I\'ve ever seen. To have a iconic game such as this and reduce it to a one tap game as oppose to actually driving and controlling the cab is ridiculous luckily it was free. So now I don\'t feel bad deleting it.',
       'Fun game, cool animations and graphics. Good music and sound effects. Can you help with diamonds and sell out features just a tad bit more. I enjoy the game. Awesome job developers and programmers. Nice twist on the classic crazy taxi game',
       'I think this game is great. The only problem that I think everyone will agree with is that you notice the taxis get stuck in debris often and you have to wait 2 minutes for it to reset itself',
       'Great game, it\'s fun to play. Would rate it higher, but it often crashes when I\'m trying refuel or double my earnings by watching ads. Then the game restarts, and I can\'t refuel for awhile, or I list the bonus earnings. FRUSTRATING!!' ,

If you have redmi phones installing this is just a waste of  your data',
       'Tried for a few minutes, then uninstalled. All I had to do is tap to kill the monsters, they don\'t even fight back. At lvl 2 or 3, I got a companion who auto attacked. Then I didn\'t even have to tap anymore. The monsters just died while I watched.  I don\'t understand why everyone is giving this 5 stars. Maybe some joke that the whole world gets except for me. Oh well.',
       'The only reason that this game is bad is because of book of shadows. This item is very powerful according to everyone who has it. Everyone makes it sound so good when saying,"Undisputed best artifact in the game." that I reset from stage 1100 to get it.  I have reset the game and run through the first 100 stages to prestige and find that book of shadows was not one of the few items I got. I have done this 5-6 times and I\'m bored of it.' ,

      'This game is the WORST!!! The controls don\'t work and there is not even demonstration on how to play. Also every time I retried to do it a stupid add came up. I AM FURIUS!!!! Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don\'t get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don\'t mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!',
       'tbh it\'s a really good app! The only problem is that it gets a little boaring after a while (obviously that\'s my opinion) And I don\'t know if it\'s just me but there or tons of over 30 second ads.',
       'I think there is to many ads like u have to watch a ad after u die. And then if u wanna continue u have to watch ANOTHER ad. Its just so annoying. But other wise I love this game. It keeps me entertained while I am bored or when I am on the bus on my way to school. But there are way to many ads and I hope u guys please fix that. üíú',
       'I like this game  very much cause you dont know what comes in front of you which makes this game more interesting. But 1 problem is there that the second i crash to any obstacle an add popups',
       'This game is AWFUL!! There is no tutorial and every time I fail an unimportant ad comes up. What is wrong with you making games like this? Close this game down it is terrible. Just learn. Who would want to play a game like this you stupid idiot',
       'It\'s honestly a fun game, and I\'d love to use it as a stimulating activity (ah, who am I kidding, it\'s just a great time killer), but it makes my head hurt-- and that\'s a problem. I\'m not even the type of person that is negatively affected by fast-paced graphics or rapidly changing colors. It\'d be five stars if it didn\'t give me headaches, but, for now, it gets three; good graphics, smooth gameplay, but no matter how great the app, it isn\'t worth physical discomfort. (Note: if you are looking for something similar, try "Run". It has the same sort of concept, but without the advertisements and headaches.)' ,

      'Don\'t like games that only let you progress when coins come up. Just took 53 spins x max to reach level 4. No thanx will delete when coins are gone. If any thing second chance and it\'s more pathetic. Bye for the last time.',
       'Fun game! Lots of wins! Not realistic because in real life you can\'t win this much! Hate the bonus and extra games though, constantly spinning faster than normal but rarely ever stopping on bonus or free games',
       'Slots WOW, is a suitable name. Awsome variety  of cool, unique  slot games, where you win incredible  amt. coins in spins,Hugh wins also bonus games,with out betting your entire bank roll,yet wins are huge,free games are more common than in most casinos.Choose your challenge game.',
       'Awesome wins and crazy awesome graphics. This is a game to entertain short or long down times. Once you start playing you almost cannot stop. Great job!',
       'Pros:  It\'s enjoyable when u get something out of it for betting at Max, but doesn\'t always go well and you have to waste 5million or so till u get a Ultra Win and bonuses don\'t come very often unless u either auto or tap it urself and hope it lands on a bonus?   Cons:   Game resets and freezes and you lose either ur gems or another spin at the wheel and or specials that they give u by watching short videos. Doesn\'t always give it to you as like I said freezes or makes you have to close the app and restart all over again.',
       'Loved this game up because it gives a lot of freespins to continue playing without worrying to wait for bonuses to come up again.... and it\'s addictive that I had it installed in my 3 Samsung tablets and in my husband tablet lolüòçüòòüòÇ' ,

Please fix these couple of things and I will rate thus game 5 stars. Thank you‚ò∫',
       'Its okay, but the lighting is very poor. The reason im writing this is because for some reason I get on here and all the wolfs are misshaped... the body in on the floor, the legs are in the middle and the head is on top... its funny but creepy. Please fix the wolf and the lighting.  THANKS!!',
       'Theirs one thing that keeps happening taht is annoing Plus I half to wait 1 day for it to stop.Its hat out of no where I start moving foward and I cant stop and when I try to fly I go state up its horrible it just happend.   :(',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!! =D it is well mayd ,lots of different blocks to build with but i am wondering can you add more animals?Because i love cats,and i was wanting to have a pet cat in the game but i could not find eneything to spon one. What about horses? It would be cool to have a horse. Other wise this game is AMAZING, ceep up the great work! !!!!!!!!!! ‚ò∫üëç‚ò∫üëç‚ò∫üëç‚ò∫üëç‚ò∫üëç Five Stars  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ',
       'Why waste $ on Minecraft when you got this? This ones free, better and perfect! Love building homes in caves, and all I want is a horse and maybe a mutant!',
       'Really Awesome Game. Suggestion: Can you add a boat (a rowboat is fine), remove the top height limit (which is just 1 block below the clouds) & include the night in creative mode cuz I rly want to see the glowstone, lava & torches that I put fulfill their one true purpose. Please grant me these wishes. But if you wont then...ok. No pressure tho.' ,

      'It\'s a great game if you like consistency. The level are set up the same way, with different icons. The down fall is that there is a limit on how much you can bet, you wouldn\'t be able to bet 3/4 of your pot or even 1/2 your pot. This game is still by far a really good game.',
       'Thank you for creating a game that is actually fun!!  The payouts are excellent!  This is the best slot game that I have played and I have been through quite a few!  The only thing that could make this game even better is to make clubs so we can talk to team mates!  Please do not change the win/loose ratio like all other slots have done.  I have recommended your game to everyone I know with positive comments from all!',
       'Played a lot of these games and this is the best by far. Love it Don\'t waste your time with any other game. The pay outs are frequent and sizeable. I\'ve been playing max bets for ever and I\'m sitting with 6.5 trillion in credits. That\'s right ......thats trillions. Best slots',
       'This is a very entertaining game. Great graphics,great returns. No complaints, plenty of plaudits. This is the second time I\'ve written a comment. Do you feel insecure? Do you need me to write a second review? I stand by my original comment. Please don\'t ask me to write a third review, it takes me away from the game!',
       'Love this game. Worth playing. However I have noticed a few flaws that can make this game some what boring once it begins to take 10 levels to open new games. And what makes it worse about this is that you have to earn diamond points to up your percentage on your level. Now this wouldn\'t be bad if they offered different times tables on your level board. Like right now I have only won Xp2 there is no faster way to win in your level faster. Yeah levels are extremely slow and it is beginning to bore me.',
       'Awesome payouts! Frequent wins. Great graphics only down fall is it takes awhile to level up which gets boring also would rather be able to bet higher make it more risk taking cheers' ,

      'TOO MANY ADS!. I don\'t mind the videos if you want to get a second box after a rave. However having to watch one for the first box gets annoying. Just open the box so you can get to the next race. Also it would be nice to know what special each car has. If it\'s a ram special or invisible special. Other than that the game it\'s self is great and fun. Oh a cool idea would be coin donations upon  liking the track you raced on.',
       'This game is dope I play it all the time! Alot of ads but I may just pay the 3 bucks to remove them. Only thing I would request is maybe an option to view the race stats at the end of each race. to see who we raced and their times rather than just a quick glance. So say I beat a high ranked player I\'d like something to show for it. Besides that I love this game!',
       'This game was worth 5 stars until the updates... More than half the time i try to connect to a race its doesn\'t work and doesn\'t give me back the 20 energy it requires to race. Also, I watched 50 videos to get the new car BLADE and i received absolutely NOTHING!!!! Until they fix this issue its getting a 1 star from me.',
       'Lately the game says searching for players but the game goes back to home screen does not give my fuel back... i would say it was a fluke but it happens all the time. Resets twice keeps my fuel then it works. NO IT IS NOT A DROPPED NETWORK PROBLEM.. ITS YOUR GAME NOT FINDING PLAYERS AND STEALING MY FUEL TO MAKE ME BUY MORE',
       'About 50% of the time I try to play the game loads takes my 20 gas then backs me out because it didn\'t find the opponents and it doesn\'t give me back my gas. Then I try again and it just freezes and takes my gas again. 40 gas to waste. Over the last few days of playing this game I have lost over 200 pointless gas now and I\'m very upset. Please fix. Only reason why it gets 3 stars.',
       'I really like this game when it actually lets you play it. It has so many connection issues that most the time it wont let you race it just takes your fuel and kicks you back to the main screen. Very frustrating' ,

      'I think this game is pretty cool! Also they added more houses to play in. I love multi-player because I like to see all the scores and I don\'t like the office because their\'s spiders and I hate spiders. I beat the Christmas level and I\'m trying to beat the other levels too. But when you start the game, it says choose cat and press it and there\'s a skinny cat with the ears    down. I choose the kitten. But I LOVE the garden level because you go on the slides and you can go in the house and go out of it and go on the carousel and more! But on the picture when you download the game, the cat is in the washer and in the fridge. But you can\'t do that in the game. I tried too. Its boring at first but it\'s fun! I also don\'t know where the cats house is. Is it in the first house? I TOTALLY love it.üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüò∫üò∫üò∫üò∫üò∫üò∫üò∏üò∏üò∏üò∏üò∏üò∏üòªüòª',

      'I played it a long time ago and i stopted like 5 months ago. Then now i reinstalled it and:  1. I could not enter my acc  2. I could not connect to facebook or google play.  3. I had to pay each time i danced wich sucks.  Till that update this game was the best game/app ever. It was so fun and so great that I just wanted to play nonstop.  I mean before this big update u payed for a song and u could dance on it as much as you liked. Now it just ain\'t fun anymore.   Please return to the classic game or your gonna lose much much more players like me.',
       'Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren\'t enough. And one of them didn\'t work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.',
       'I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.',
       'It\'s fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I\'m bored. I love the songs and dance moves it\'s awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it\'s awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don\'t know how to dance then you should download this game it\'s perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.',
       'Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn\'t have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!',
       'I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn\'t make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun.' ,

I am one of those pros in the game. it is a really good strategy game I love it so much. but there is one thing to fix beta Carrotina and huge gigantuas only have 4 decks and also beta Carrotina and huge gigantuas has superpower trick that no other heros has I wish they are normal the other heros also add me on pvz heros imanboss',
       'Please nerf captain cucumber, as a zombie main it\'s too problematic to fight against that card, for example unlike a similar card imp commander which in order to draw a card they have to deplete the enemy\'s health, whereas captain cucumber can just get a new card for just doing damage!

Please go and count what is the average cost of the cards in the deck you gave me. A whooping 4 mana cost!??? What the hell.... And the opponent that you set? An average of 2???

      'Many games say they are free to play but you are limited as how far you can go without putting money into the game as long as you grind and have patience as takes time. . GoH is not like that. You can actually gain the better gear, the better characters, etc without dropping buckets of money in the game. All you need to do is regularly play the game, level up your character,and participate. Doing so you will get stronger characters. This game has great gameplay, awesome characters,fun PvP and it\'s just addicting overall. This game is truly free to play.',
       'Great game. Nice mix of action and turn based play. The fact that you can search for specific shards, gear, crafting parts is a touch of genius - no grind. Separate energy for two areas means longer play. Only downside is the rating for this is not high enough! Also, background music changes according to location, very nice detail. Massive amount of characters and variations of them. Great game guys. Really looking forward to updates.',
       'All the main movie characters and space ships to use. Wish u would make more farmable but over one of the best games out there. I actually prefer it compared to Xbox due to no issues with extensive network down periods. If u want us to pay then we gotta be able to play when we want right? Someone else should send that to Xbox they stopped caring long ago. Well done again for the game',
       'This update gave the players most of the things they have been asking for over a year now. The only issue i have is that EA is still pushing its pricing model with this game. 300 dollars to full star up a character + another 200 for gear. Its a bit much. The F2P is still full and while you will be hardpressed to make it to number 1 on your shard it is possible and gives great satisfaction. I would recommend atleast giving it a try.',
       'Best game in this style yet.  There are many similar games, some has better graphyc and etc, but this one is the most balanced. Many nice updates. Game changes everytime.  Not very easy also not very hard.  And the most important thing is that u dont need whole day. Just 15 minute  to do every daily mission. Best game yet. I wish if you give me beta test acc  for youtube channel.',
       'Just d/l this like a week ago. Very good game, the turn based RPG style works well, the graphics are top notch, as well as the sound is accurate and superb. The only thing is: I just updated it and now cant get past the Lucas film/Disney screen now. The update was not interrupted at all when I downloaded it, but I suspect it got corrupted, contacting support, hope they can help me I do NOT want to start over.' ,

      'This is a wonderful, well made, fun game!  Also highly addictive.    Really enjoy it a lot.      With that said, the biggest downside, IMO, is that rewards are few, & far between, and there is no way to get gold bars without paying for them.  These become rather needed the further you get and for certain individual, and more difficult, "puzzles".  It can become too expensive to play (if one really want to get somewhere in this game).',
       'Love this game. Would like some competition at some point. Also, I wish there were more challenges like the Halloween treats one. It was really fun. Not too sure about the latest updates though, the owls are almost camouflaged now. But great game!',
       'Addictive but too rigged. The rules are inconsistent which spoils it a bit. Eg.  Sometimes the fairies burst one bubble of the same colour and sometimes all. There are other inconsistencies. The other irritation is noisy push notifications can\'t be turned off.',
       'Love the endless levels, they do get very difficult, though. But love the game. Wish there was a way to earn gold bars instead of only purchasing them. But love all the side babes to earn bonuses n boosters, great addition!',
       'Best of the Bubble Witch Saga games. I love the addition of decorating Stella\'s home. Such pretty things to choose from and it\'s fun. Some of the levels, I feel, are much harder than they need to be, but so far I keep going. Definitely worth a try.',
       'I did like playing this game but now its becoming annoying, due to the fact i keep losing my bonus gifts, i lost them again after building them back up, now it will not even let me open my gift chest, keeps coming up ops something went wrong please try again by tapping chest. Im on level 822 and feel like uninstalling due to these problems.  Problem was sorted i had to uninstall then reinstall, sadly i have lost all my powers and it has sent me back down to level 751.' ,

      'It is fun and challenging. Had it on my last phone and it often glitched during races which basically ruins that race. Downloaded it on my new phone which is much more powerful, thinking it would be fine, but it glitches in the same way and with the same frequency. It would be really nice if they could "ditch the glitch" so to speak. Thanks',
       'So hard to beat the game. I\'m not gonna say anything except it is PAY TO WIN. No rewards, you have to spend real money to beat your NOVICE rival, yup you read it right, novice. So freaking hard to beat the actual scripted AI. And you can\'t buy anything in shop without real money.',
       'Love the game, play everyday esp the jam tracks. Controls are very inconsistent. Seems like you are limited to how fast you can go. When  it appears you about to better your time you lose control of your bike..sick of the glitches and feels like i have to pay to win',
       'I raced 500\'s out in some of the real known Desert race\'s until I went off the freeway trying to come home from the Mojave 250 and was in the hospital for a year. Fell asleep behind the wheel, I should of died but I  made it. . . . . .',

      'The graphic are great and the gameplay is fun but what kept me going was the writing. At first I was like uhhh another newspaper? Those don\'t do anything... But I kept reading and they are GREAT. On the lower side, the drones often clip in building and can\'t be clicked or you click straight on it but get sent to a building screen instead and by the time you get back, the fast drones are gone.',
       'Soul eggs are incredibly buggy. On the higher level eggs you can go from earning 10s a sec to 1 a sec just by closing the app. The extra soul eggs through epic research when you prestige isn\'t clear enough and doesn\'t match the description. Later game is very much about waiting for a counter to hit one billion which means you don\'t need to open the app all that much. Other than that, it\'s ok.',
       'Very good game overall, relaxing and good to play if you have a short period of free time. The only thing I would say is I wish opening the piggy bank didn\'t cost REAL money because I have thousands of golden eggs in it but I can\'t get them out because I don\'t want to spend money. Maybe make it that you have to spend TONS of the in-game money to open it. I would rate this 4/5 stars, as I thoroughly enjoy it.',
       'I play the game all the time, but it needs easier and faster prestige. Three days of waiting for the next egg is bs with a prestige score of almost 1,000,000. Also "silos" hardly earn anything. That\'s my main complaint. Fix it so they earn WAY more over non play or I\'m done and I\'ve actually spent money so if you still want that, fix it.',
       'Fun and simple game that lets you gradually grow your farm at your own speed. This is a game you can play from once a week where you collect the money you\'ve collected offline, buy upgrades, then leave the game for another week; to spending a few casual hours of hunting for the drones that give you extra money and gold eggs which are the games micro-transaction currency to buy permanent upgrades that help your farm grow faster. It not so much a race as it is just enjoying your farm steadily grow over time.',
       'Edit: Latest update is thoroughly average. Some great new tools and really cool upgrades mixed in with ridiculously boring time sink achievements. They breathed new life into the game and then stuffed it up and made me sit around for 20 actual real life days for each egg waiting for a chicken counter to reach a billion. Such a shame.  I like big numbers and Egg Inc. delivers in spades. Click and hold functionality, strategic planning and approachable mission targets; one of the best in the genre.' ,

      'Was an awesome game Very addictive game! Was well done.. until the update. Needs more pens and new themes as I have thousands of coins but nothing left to unlock. Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don\'t register as pineapple hits for the counters. There\'s a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it',
       'Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.',
       'Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.',
       'Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.',
       'BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn\'t have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What\'s bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I\'m not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game.',
       'How can I say this? I can not stop playing this!! Everytime I set a new and higher record I want to achieve and I only stop until I get there xD atm with 6400 coins and everything unlocked üòÅüòÅ please release new content for months and months!! It will make me so happy! Thank you for this game.' ,

      'I didn\'t hold out much hope initially but it\'s a fabulous game. Graphics are good, there\'s a story and multiple maps etc. Its easy to progress and the special event maps were hilarious.  Definitely suitable for the majority of players and even young ones. There\'s no gore or unsuitable scenes and no constant push to buy ingame content. I wish more game developers thought like this. Properly enjoyable',
       'Great game, incredible customer service. You will never get bored with this game. Play daily as much or as little as you want. There are seasonal (timed) events to play and ongoing daily (no time limit)searches. We have all been there, missed an achievement because we logged on 10 minutes late. NO MONEY has to be spent to truely enjoy this game. Your progress or fun level isn\'t held hostage if you don\'t want to pay to play. Customer service is incredible. I was stuck and the response was quick and helpful. Even when I still didn\'t get it, think if it was a snake, it would have bitten me, they helped and never made me feel stupid. Install NOW and start having fun.',
       'Energy is spent too quickly, kind of their way of trying to make you to buy gems. I get it, and I would buy them if they weren\'t so expensive! I can barely make it through a single task, it does get quite annoying.   Maybe give us the option of watching ads for gems or extra energy, and an ad free option with minimal cost so those who would rather not have the ads get to benefit too?',
       'Love the challenge,  the mini puzzles.  The only draw back I would say.  As a new player having enough energy to complete some of the old challenges example (Valentine\'s 2017) is almost impossible.  Would love to figure out how to gain more energy. Fan page as far as I can see does not help on this.  Other then  that very enjoyable game.',
       'The instructions go by too fast,no where to look to repeat them so levels quests left half done. For example can\'t free the florists because not sure how to finish with the light beams??! Missed the hints or instructions.',
       'The only thing that would really improve this game is if you have a multi-tile selection upgrade. That would allow you to select multiple spots to dig, they would still Dig one at a time in the order of which they were selected. If they are blocked in you would have to select the tiles in order as they would become accessible.' ,

      'Was working great untill todays update error 15 cant find my location. 4th attemt it loaded. Used to be first attemt. Been a couple of weeks still taking half an hour to get app running. Same location problem. Samsung j. Still same problem but loads in about 15min under error screen. Does eventually work',
       'I have never used such a clumsy and slow app. The idea is great. The execution (23 Dec) is atrocious. This seems to be common regardless of phone or other apps running.  Definitely a poor advertisement for a network provider.  Love the data though.',
       'My family is starting to hate me. Whenever I stop to hunt some data they know it\'s going to take me at least half an hour with the numerous restart attempts to get the app going and the long wait every time it almost successfully loads. Your app is wasting their time and mine, don\'t know why I even bother anymore! Oh, the things we\'ll do to get a bit of free stuff, but no more, I\'ve had enough for now. Maybe I\'ll try again next time, if there is a next time, just to see if you\'ve sorted the app out.',
       'TRY THIS FIX... On install, I had same error 15 message, unable to find location, etc (I have a Xiaomi Redmi 3). Here\'s where I found buried permission setting not activated by default on my phone: Privacy/Location/Location Access/Permissions/Data Hunt - set "get location info" to "Accept". Also make sure location method set to "high accuracy". Hopefully this helps someone, app now seems to be working fine for me',
       'Since the update app takes even longer to open. It crashes constantly and sometimes just won\'t bring up a map at all. I don\'t understand why they needed to update something that worked fine and now simply doesn\'t,  as you can see from numerous reviews below.',
       'Very poorly coded app. Very slow at loading, however haven\'t had any issues as of yet, however it is day 1. The Google Maps app is less than half the size of this app and much more feature rich!' ,

      'Honestly I think it\'s amazing that they sell this game for free because it is one of the best games I\'ve ever played in my life. It doesn\'t take any internet and the animals in details so good and the graphics. If you\'re ever bored you should download this game and play it all the time.',
       'The game is great but unfortunately I can\'t seem to be able to use the animals even though I\'ve unlocked them. It keeps telling me to go back to that level and to unlock the animals even though I\'ve already done so. It doesn\'t even give me the one-star animals (which is odd) can you please fix this??',
       'Guys, you have a glitch that needs fixed. Side game (right now the ignite game) causes app to close every time. Also... Inserting the gold in the piggy bank takes way too long. Speeding up that process or allowing a skip feature would be nice.',
       'I adore this game. However, I have had 7 gold bars for over a year and every time I win a level that awards lots of gold bars the game tells me my bank is full... even though everything costs at least 9 gold bars. According to my math I should have over 100 bars. I would settle for two at this point.',
       'Highly addictive. I love this game but there is one fault that it doesn\'t allow your device to enter sleep mode. I have ruined 2 phone screens with burnt in images because of this. I would fall asleep playing the game and when I wake up it\'s still on the screen.  I also don\'t understand why the special games are not offered on the Facebook game.',
       'Love it love it love it....1/218..this is still one of 3 of my favorite games but... you have this golden piggy who collects gold bars.. i have filled it several times but then i find out you want me to pay for them after winning them... NOT HAPPY...' ,

      'A very fun and addictive game. I make bows all day, but it\'s nice to be able to shoot from my couch at night.  The influence of wind on the arrow is accurate when it comes to drift. A little costly on the upgrades for those that don\'t buy their way to the top, but all games are that way.',
       'Ok game, but bingo mode is a huge pain.  My shots filled out the opponent\'s card better than mine.  Stupid way to lose a lot of progress/coins.',
       'I personally would like to see my opponents record like you can in other games. I understand that in the higher price games its difficult to get even matches but when im a level 12 and i end up playing someone ranked 100 or higher thats a bit much.',
       'It\'s really pathetic that apps like this only allow Facebook login... At least provide Google login too.... Not everyone uses Facebook.... Google should make it mandatory on Google play store apps to provide Google login....',
       'It feels like I\'m playing a cpu, because the first cup is easy and my opponents only score very low points. I mean, I score 8-10 and my opposition have a hard time hitting the mark at all! (I\'ve repeatedly played it a handful of times.)',
       'Game was fine. Lately, keeps freezing and somehow opponents are getting 10\'s when I CLEARLY see them hitting nowhere near the middle. Matches are freezing while i\'m ahead, then match ends and says I lost. Somehow i\'ve lost 20 million coins, and not from legit losing either. I also just played a match for 1 million coins, i had over 1 million in the bank. I know sonehow have 0 after I clearly won the match but it said I lost. Either people are using cheats or the game is not functioning properly' ,

      'Very realistic and nice game. Missions and descriptions are entertaining. Controls are also great.   Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!',
       'Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!',
       'Its quite good but a little bit of fixing will do. The part "Slow Down thing" can you please please place that where it can not block the view of the player. It is very difficult to see whats behind it so it causes us players to crash. T.Y',
       'Why the hell they add brake when we cannot see the brake option even after landing which forces us to crash. Total stupidity do not waste time in downloading. Previously was better when there were no brakes just reverse it and stop or keep brake button always active.',
       'Its really boring... You have to do missions you cant just fly around and do whatever you have to fly through the squares and make it to the end... And who wants stripes?! Why are they so important?! Plus its really hard to control!!',

      'This a great game all around. The controls are tight and the gameplay is fast paced, and the music  and art style are both incredible.  All that being said, the best part about this game is the narrative. I can\'t remember the last time I played a mobile game that told an actual story. Data Wing really goes above and beyond to deliver a full fledged experience for the player.  Thanks Dan! You\'ve set the bar high for the rest of the mobile  gaming community and I can\'t wait to see what you\'ve got in store.',
       'This game is ingenious and amazing, and the script is beautiful and gameplay is simple and straightforward, timeless, and fun, with increasing difficulty, but also, able to go back and compete against yourself for more Rewards. The user interface is spot-on, and the graphics are perfect. They scale well to any resolution and any aspect ratio, taking up the entire screen without any letterboxing. The actual gameplay is simply a 2 button gameplay, left and right, and yet, this game kept me busy for hours. It\'s addicting, but doesn\'t require you to consistently visit the app. It does not nag you in any way.  I have not seen a single advertisement, and the developer does not have any big paywall or reward system for paying. You will not need to spend any money on this.',
       'I think it is a good idea done well. I havent had any problems so far and the game os more than i expected. I thought the game would just be full of mindless levels but it is not. It even has a cool story and i cant wait to see how it plays out. There ia a cool mechanic wherd you get a speed boost the closer you are to the walls. I really enjoyed the game and i think it deserves 5 stars. This is the only mobile game i loved so much i actually made a review for.',
       'This is the best game ever, that I have ever played 1. I loved the story (You will know what I mean when you have played) 2. The controls are very strange and frustrate some people. But I think that\'s what make the game challenging 3. THE MUSIC. I loved the choices they have made with the music. It\'s really good love it 4. The graphics are really good couldn\'t ask for more 5. Really like the secrets   PS. Would like if you could at some kind of multiplayer when you have beaten the game  - Love Ln\'TCore',
       'Vey cool! Haven\'t finished it yet, though. The only thing that would make this better would be if the controls were a little bit better and more responsive  (which I know is hard to do on mobile or tablets), and some of the levels are nearly impossible  (at least for me). Nonetheless, I like it! Keep it up with the good work!',
       'Saw this before and saw 4.9 out of 5 with over 80,000 reviews. That\'s... unheard of on the store. So I came back to try it out. Completely worth it. Gameplay is flawless, visuals are gorgeously retro and vaporwave, the soundtrack is all retrowave from various artists, and the story is really good too. It\'s not often I rate games, and even then I\'m not excited when writing them. For this one I can\'t praise this game enough. Perfect retro-styled racing gem on Google Play.' ,

      'Awesome game I have basically mastered this game. Got a high score of 2,892,204. I made the highest tile which is 131,072. This game is amazing and requires intense focus. I lost focus for a second and a 4 appeared and I didn\'t notice. Messed me up when I was about to make the 65k tile',
       'best beain adict game. but 9 grid stage doesnt fulfill. not enough grid box. the Creator cheated. i m going to lodge a complaint against you. you ve to answer my brainüòÄ anyway superr game excellent',
       'The game is great, but the leaderboards are seriously messed up.  The top high scores are literally orders of magnitude higher than it is physically possible to get.  I would assume that they have been "hacked" somehow to display these fake scores.  The developer should cap the high score at the number that is literally the highest possible score (based on the size of the board)',
       'I enjoy 2048 alot. I play it alot and I would consider myself pretty good, my high score is 250,000. When i was building on that high score, the screen glitched and swiped a number of times, ruining the order of the numbers. This has happened on multiple occasions only in this app. It\'s not such a big problem for people that are newer, but when you\'ve got big numbers, such as 8192, it makes the game unplayable.',
       'This game is challenging. I was so addicted I wanted to se what would happen if I got up to 4096.  Well ai did and it actually worked! I even have a screen shot. Fun!',
       'I\'ve been having issues with this app for months, where it will sometimes act as if it received multiple inputs in rapid succession. This completely ruins all the hard work I did getting my board state the way it was, and makes it impossible to recover. I\'m playing up to the 16K range, and it has these issues usually after I\'ve gotten the 4K blocks. 2/6/2018' ,

      'Maybe the reason people think its boring. It\'s probably because they are boring and lame. I beat the first level without a problem, they didn\'t because they feel like everything should be easy and they shouldn\'t have to work hard for anything. The game is challenging and fun if you like a challenge. If your a lame, whinny, expect nothing to be hard, and can\'t handle a challenge as tough as making toast, then this game isn\'t for you.',
       'These other reviewers are jerks! Lol. The game is awesome! And my 4 year old can even play it well!  I like it so much, I\'m downloading it onto my phone (4 yr old plays it on my old phone)  just to see how far I can get lol',
       'I would get to the title page and that was it. It won\'t let me go further. I have turned my phone off and back on and I have uninstalled it twice and installed it 3 times. Please fix.',
       'The game controls are very annoying. The character won\'t go where you want him to. During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don\'t want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn\'t want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.',
       'It\'s an disaster game. It doesn\'t even open on my phone...it just stuck all the time.',

      'This game allows for cheaters. How is it possible to discard the same card twice?????? The opponent some how discarded a card that had already been discarded. It was not picked up from the discard deck. This is impossible!!!!! Also players getting gin on first play does not happen that often. I call B.S on this game. I even spent real money. Real honest people out there don\' t waste your time or money. And if your one of the cheaters then continue playing that way all you cheaters can cheat eachother!!!!',
       'I would always hear my grandma talk about this game as a kid, but couldn\'t understand why she likes it. I love this game. Suggestions: 1. Ability to play against a bot so you can pause the game to answer a call or respond to a text message 2. Easier way to choose the table you want to sit to play. I don\'t like that you have to "leave" the table and return to the lobby each time',
       'They claim it\'s not fixed but let\'s be honest who loses 30 games on the trott and how is it when you throw away a card the other player then throws away the same card when they didn\'t take it. FIXED',
       'You have no way of earning coins! The only way you can get coins is by someone sending you some or you have to buy coins.',

    description: 'You will really feel like you are behind the wheel of a muscle car.

      'This is the best tap games out there. It really loves up to its word saying to timers, unlike SimCity and just about every other game out there. Its easy to play and advance so it sets a wide age range. I would like to personally thank the devs for coming out with this game, something a was looking for for a while. 10/10. Keep up the good work!',
       'I love being able to build your own city. I like it better than sim city because you don\'t have to wait for things, you tap to build things instead. And its a little bit easier which i like. Sim city just got too difficult after a while. Plus i love the style of this game',
       'I was very surprised  at the diversity of things you can do. And you can speed up EVERYTHING MANUALLY. Ads are optional with selective rewards of either money or one of the three materials you use to build stuff with. The exclusive currency can be bought with irl money or exchanged for materials or in-game cash. Not like any tap game I\'ve ever played, I\'m very impressed! This is a keeper!',
       'I adore this game, it\'s such a time waster (in a good way)! I wish that the camera controls were compatible with wireless mice. only reason being is because I broke my screen and I can\'t use too much touch screen. :( apart fro',
       'Absolutely love this game, its customisable and you make your city however you want to. One thing I eould like to see is alternative buildings, like instead of a power plant, a hydro plant. Also plz add buildings that can go in the ocean like bridges. Overall love it',
       'It is true that there is no timer but instead your energy runs out very fast! At the end it takes too much time to build a real city!  Also has nothing innovative comparing to other games.' ,

       'Great game but more like a sandbox game. The way you are looking will go off in random directions. Few glitches. Wish the sniper rifle had a scope. Wish there was different shooting mechanics. A little lag and too many damn ads there is even an ad for no ads.',
       'Great game, but it\'s annoying how you have limited ammo, I mean yeah! It\'s realistic, but Ammo is also expensive, and I hate how You can\'t jack a car because if they\'re at a red light, and you\'re trying to jack their car, they may start going, or when you toss them out of the car, they annoy you and sometimes KILL you. So even if you do kill them when they\'re inside of it, you\'re doing damage to the car, not to mention you can\'t even Rob stores like I thought you could. But still. Awesome game!',
       'I love it! Except, when I blow up a police car while it\'s parked, it respawns and about 18 police cars are after me! Although, when that happens, I get killed and spawn on top of the tower with the helicopter and when I do, the police car that I blew up is driving around, crashing into walls, blowing up and then going back! I couldn\'t stop laughing. So... Nothing wrong (except for the load of police after me when I blow up that car), I love it, C ya!',
       'I hate this stupid game I have just played this game and you know what happend it crashed everybody do not play this one game and the second one of this it is a stupid game i never even got to play it and i still think it is stupid sorry for the words just fix it plz JJJJJUUUUUSSSSSSTTTTTT fiiiiixxxxxx ittttttt if i could put no stars i willllll',
       'I loved it because you can get into people\'s car and then get out again then kill them because they are trying to kill you so kill them. and there is a tank and a helicopter in this game and I like it so you could kill people walking and get money or there bullets and wepends. that is why I love this game.' ,

      'I LOVE IT!!!!! Never played a Maori game on a phone before but this was a brilliant idea! Mine doesn\'t freeze,  so clearly others phones need updated lol kidding!  But overall I enjoy it a lot,  it kinda reminds me of Clash of Clans lol!  I think the only issues I have with it is it needs more stages cos I\'m keen to keep playing,  also I was unable to purchase pounamu. Other than that I\'d highly recommend it!  Kia ora ra!üòÅ',
       'Great game needs more however, purchased ponamu also didn\'t receive anything, email has been sent and game is fully updated. Apart from that great start for te ao Maori too much buthas, Tuturu Whakamoa Kia Tina!!!Tina!!! Bleh!',
       'I thought this game was cool being the only Maori game I\'ve ever played. But like a few other reviews the game kept freezing not allowing me to do anything. The graphics could be better. The ad for this game didn\'t make sense either..',
       'Ka mau te wehi! This is cool and fun. I love how the toa call out in te reo Maori. Also love hearing the native bird calls in the background. It does freeze a bit but still the coolest mobile game I\'ve played by far. Chur',
       'I\'ve enjoyed this game so far especially getting to hear the reo being spoken on a gaming platform like this. Great that this has an option in the reo but it would be better to have a quick change of translation on the Stage selction page and when you are reading tutorials as i think this would engage users in learning some reo at the same time and learn kupu as you go. Secondly it would be great to see more stages develop and even having a unlimited enemies stage/challenge where you test to see how far you can go and compare scores with other users. Thirdly, needs more clear options of what the towers do as they arent named on the selection whilst in-game. Lastly, be great to see slightly better graphics and user ability. No doubt you guys will fix the little freezes this game sometimes has. Heoi anoo, nei raa te mihi nui ki a koutou, ngaa kaiwaihanga, moo te whakawhanaketanga o te keemu nei',
       'Whens the next stages available? The unanswered question everyone wants to know!   New status: Update feels like it isn\'t going to happen. Star rating about to drop.' ,

      'reliance I bought a real money loot bundle which was for 76 dhs (UAE currency)but I did not get the loot cases. Also checked my loot place but nothing was there and also restarted the game but nothing was there.. Simply wasted money.so after that I deleted the game forever.also the game is having a lot of bugs like game freeze,network issue,sometime showing black screen,etc.',
       'I like the new update.the graphics of the chamber is very nice. My suggestion is that you can improve its value by adding entrance to the players or at least play their theme song after the game. I\'m tired of listening to the same music again and again. Plz do these changes as fast as possible. Thank you.',
       'A VERY GOOD GAME. VERY GOOD GRAPHICS. THIS IS THE BEST WWE OR FIGHTING I HAVE EVER PLAYED. ONLY THING IS MANY ATTACKS OF MANY WWE WRESTLER ARE NOT THERE LIKE STING\'S SCORPION DEATH DROP AND MANKIND\'S DOUBLE ARM DDT',
       'Now that what i need A 4 star reigns. Please add more players like Rey Mysterio, Khali, CM Punk, Ryback, etc. Also ADd new super finishers like SUper AA for Cena And Turnbucke Stunner for stone cold, Jumping Rko For Orton, Diviing Spear for reigns and Crub Stomp for Rollins.',
       'Still not providing the besic training weight to rank up the superstar and when I open elimination chamber box it stop on John Cena 4 star but provide me Roman 2 star. And now the level is so easy and rewards are less. Fix it please',
       'I lost 125 gold when i selected a one time offer during the beginning of the match and then after winning the match the game stuck and i closed the app and opened it again but was shocked to see my gold lost and also the match i won was again appearing in the story mode to play again and i had not got the rewards promised in the one time offer...... Really pissed of by this bug' ,

What a great pleasant surprise!  Please don\'t stop, if you do you will be the cause of a retiree\'s lost of complete control.  I love this application.  I  play games daily and‚Äã this game by far is number one!  Thank you so much.  Smiles and lots of kisses',

The wild witches are really beautiful and fun to play. I am well pleased with Frozen Flame. These slots are the ABSOLUTE BEST OF ANY!!!!  I just had to start over because I had to reset my tablet, but I don\'t mind at all, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME!!! I\'m sure loving this game so very much that when I had to uninstall it and reset my phone, I started from the beginning again!!!',
       'This game is rigged... Money  hungry..... even When it knows u r trying to pass a level or the trow a stupid contest or special in it\'s will just eat your money up.when u bet low your spins go fast.. when u bet high your spin slows down.. Ive been on the same level for over six months and it\'s not even a high level.. Im deleting this stupid app and sticking with slotomania where at least u win...',
       'Pretty graphics but 0 playability. Be prepared to spend thousands of usd to progress past the fifth boss, and there is currently no obvious way to earn chests or cards. Till the game is more reasonably balanced such that a low pay player can actually advance, Ihave to give it 1 star.',
       'Long story short... I downloaded this app skeptically. Didn\'t like it. Kept it for benefit of doubt. Ended up liking it. I even made a purchase. Then, I had issues with staying connected to FB. Contacted customer support in which the girl JANE just gave me the run around wanting me to say the same thing multiple times! Then, wanted me to resubmit everything I explained for the 3rd time! This rating is a direct rating toward customer support. Couldn\'t even support a pair of "A" cup breasts! And it still sucks!!!' ,

      'Gone to -3 Stars, since last update. The game is so hard that u can\'t even win the 2nd round in Arena without using spells!!! (Tower of fortune) is not more than a joke!!! Pig\'s gonna catch u in the very 2nd floor 6/7 times in a week. Hope that rovio think about the loyal players once, not only money!!! Going to uninstall if the bug not removed till next update!!!',
       'Great! Yoy guys made every arena match unwinnable (unless you pay gems for extra cards)!!! Your game is totally infected with hackers/cheaters!!! Arena is totally cheating money!!! 1 star? Not even 1 star! I will give 0 star for this game!!! Can you guys fix the bugs?',
       'Used to love this game. But now it seems that the developers have fallen to the PC agenda. This game used to be a distraction from the assault on my beliefs as a Christian. "BCE" and "CE" are simply part of the attempts to remove Christ from everything. Jesus Christ and I will find entertainment elsewhere. Uninstalling now!',
       'Is there any way you can let the animations skip with a tap? After a while, we don\'t need to be reminded of what just happened.',
       '1. Why does your yellow power line move slower the further you move on? It fills up and you get your bird back but you do a move that\'s almost the same with a more powerful bird on the very next move and it hardly moves. Is this the games way of cheating you out of beating it? There are hard enough moments in this game, you really don\'t need to be petty like that?  2. Why can\'t you talk 1 on 1 with clan members, like the leader, if you need to ask them something? You can\'t just ask "can I play in the big clan competition" to the leader. It would especially be helpful when your leader and none of your teammates talk in the chat when you want to get signed up to play.',
       'It\'s a lovely game. But the reward in clan even should go round. The current rewards setting, is unfair to some birds. That after all the birds participated in the even only some chosen set of birds get the feather reward. Please let is rotate.' ,

      'Best burnout game ever. I\'ve looked everywhere for a burnout game like this and I\'ve finally found it! Some things I suggest to put in could be a tow truck ( like Mater) and maybe a country farm burnout pit and, for a real life burnout pit, Perth Motorplex. Also if tire marks stayed on the track each time that would be heaps better. These things would make this game over the top amazing. GREAT GAME!!!',
       'I\'ve made it heaps far in the game. The more you unlock the more you win in challenges. Nearly unlocked everything. When I do ill have to buy the remaining cars, only on small problem I\'m having is that I can\'t seem to score any more than 14000pts in a run I\'m lucky to get 11000pts a run. It would be alot better if the scores all round were larger (including opponents) to make you feel like you\'re doing better at the game by scoring more',
       'FRICKIN AWESOME!!! This game is AWESOME! The controls are simple amd adaptable, and the graphics are amazing! It runs amazing for me, even on highest graphics.  Honestly theres not much for me to complain about, only that loading is a bit long. I like how if you spend just a bit more money you can skip wait times, and when you start it gives an actual tutorial. To me, if you have a problem with the game... You better hate the player, not the game.  Somethings I wish to see in the game is more customization, like body kits, hoods, spoilers, etc., more painting options, like custom colours w/ decals, and an option for how tires/tyres is spelled (tyres kinda bugs me). I would also LOVE to see a Hellcat Dodge Challenger in the game, its got plenty of power and even more weight! üòÜ 100/10 would blow tires again.',
       'My only problem is that I can\'t get more than 11,000 points. I\'ve tried different cars & tricks etc but nothing.',
       'Had to rate badly as 1 of the permissions for the game to run asked for the app to be able to make phone calls. As i can see absolutely no reason for a app to make calls on my behalf i didn\'t finish installing.',
       'The game worked fine, since I downloaded it.... But for the last 2 days, it crashes when I open it.... I emailed you guys, used the feedback option on my phone, and have gotten no response from either avenue...   So???' ,

It freezes and the only way for me to get out of it is to close the app. I think we should be able to cash in the travel vouchers, in not for coins then at least boosts. I think I\'m on day 93 of the treasure chests, and like the fact that I don\'t have to pay for the chests anymore. What I don\'t like are the rewards from the chest. If for reaching the milestone on days checked in, like day 90 I am given less resources than the level I just played, I might as well just play the level and not bother with the chest. I do love the interesting facts given about the destinations though. I do think it would be beneficial to have a button where we can contact you within the game instead of having to post on the review platform.',
       'FIRST OF ALL THIS GAME CAN KISS MY HAPPY ASS !!!  I had completed Sydney & was almost finished with Tokyo.  I went to play the game & all of a sudden my game cleared & it  took me back to the first play on Sydney.I have no Sydney no Tokyo.I am pissed about this. I really enjoyed this game but, if this is the way  you operate then I am over this game for sure.....',
       'Not enough lives....3 is mean. Don\'t know what the gems  that you win, or the student hats do. I haven\'t even cleared Sydney and levels are too hard to clear. Shame because I like the concept of going round the world. Sadly I will probably uninstall it over next few days. Life is too short.',
       'About a month ago I had 59 days straight for return bonus, then this game wiped out my progress and changed some of the levels in the beginning. Was forced to start over. As a programmer I hope you got all of the bugs worked out. I would have liked my progress my progress back.' ,

Sorry, game crashed. Good game, right until it sucks. Would even be enticed to spend a little real cash if the game money I should be earning would actually be there. But alas no, the game crashed.',

       'This game in my opinion is the best game out there cause you really don\'t have to pay for everything you can earn diamonds on the regular and a good amount of coins you don\'t have to wait weeks or months to earn and build and evolve if I was going to put this game in a category it would be the equile category because your treated and earn everything equally I more then love this game because of that not because of the addiction this game has the style and features and momentum that no other game will ever have thank you so much' ,

      'I think this game is amazing! And is perfectly good in every way!! I can\'t stop playing and look forward to getting new cars. There is just one tiny error that bugs me a bit but I can cope with it. The error is the color of the Ford fiesta xr2. When you race someone else and they have this vehicle on the card the car is black with a tiny red trim on the side but when it\'s on the track it is completely red. I do hope you can will fix this small mistake but apart from that this game is great!!! Thanks for reading :)',
       'Definitely a game for car buffs. It requires using your "mind" to win. I\'m not to sure about my rating yet. But, will definitely change if needed. It\'s unlike any game I\'ve played & I like it! Someone wrote a review that this is a lazy person\'s game... LMA√ò, I wish they would show me the games they play while they are running, swimming & mountain climbing "while" they play, smh HAHA!',
       'Game is great. And like every game had it\'s pro\'s and con\'s. To sum this game up in short it is Top Trumps with the race.   Pros: game is different to all the rest out there, car list is really well thought out as well.  Cons the only things I have to say is, it\'s so hard to win decent cars sometimes. Seems quite a pay to win game as card packs are alot of money/gold and you don\'t win alot of money either.   One thing to bare in mind is that once you\'ve completed a level you can go back and claim all the cards from that event giving you more money, cars and rq.',
       'I love the concept and it\'s been great to see how far this game has come, but I\'ve been playing since beta and nearly every update wipes my save data and forces me to restart. Luckily, I don\'t get too far into the game each time, but it is frustrating and enough of a buzz kill for me to drop two stars. If there was a cloud system implemented for saves this game would be a five star in my book',
       'Multiplayer is not fair. Have the same car with lower 0-60 time better traction, and higher mph but still lose. Match play is getting worse. I either have to spend a boatload of money or always come in last place.',
       'The game is great until you finish the campaign. All you have left is daily PvP events and the game quickly ranks you up until it\'s impossible to win with out buying packs for better cars. I have started two and accounts and they both are the same. Starts out fun but quickly turns into a strictly pay to win game.' ,

      'Game is great but there r bits just like mentioned by others. It is relly fun tho and with some minor imrpovs like not die so fast rite away and a pause or sumthin wen u r look in at ur inventory and regen stuff at home base. Game isnt setup well cuz wen I died at car crash site my body and all my gear was gone cuz car site was only good for 15 mins. I have to start over with a bare naked dude and a cleared out home site and as soon as I go anywer now I die  cuz I got no gear. Plz fix so body comes back to u or sumthin. It is fun and constant. Way good just needs some minor stuff tweaked',
       'There seems to be alot of bugs,whenever i closed this app just to wait for the energy time to recover it does not even recover but when my Network is ON then it starts to work. Please fix this bugs,Hope to see more improvements in the future.',
       'Simple to say that I dies 4 times in 10 mins after finding a crashed car went back to pick up my stuff and searched the first box only to be attacked by 4 more dinosaurs before I could come out of the inventory I was dead. It\'s so annoying spending hours grinding on a game to be killed over and over again.',
       'Other survivors somehow manage to kill me after their hp drops below zero. Feeling a little ripped off. Not sure why this keeps happening.',
       'Suggestion: in app instructions ...how to beat certain dinosaurs, what each location is on the map (exp floating heads..what is that and how hard is it to beat) , better items from crashed cars ..having a hard time getting parts for my jeep and need the jeep to get anywhere to get valuable items such as different woods and metals',
       'You needed to add more stuff into the game like a different type of bunker and also more bases to raid please, I\'m also level 25 but I have all ready completed all the available events and raided all the available people so please expand the mad and add more stuff like the stuff on last day on earth' ,

       'One of the best games I have played on Google play. Or rather it is the best games  Cons: 1. There should be a storyline with this game like a real superhero(and not someone who helps bad guys too)something I found awkward.   2.The area is descent but please add the underground train terminal with some action there too. It will just take the area to a whole new level   3.There are no days and night. No whether change, nothing.   4. Add more fighting style for the protagonist.   5. Please add more buildings and the climbing up is lethargic.   Else it is a great 100 mb game. Keep it up!!!!!! üòé üòé üòé',
       'It\'s fun but you should offer a paid version and Bluetooth controller support. If you did I\'d buy it but since I doubt this will happen I\'m uninstalling. Looks fun but too many ads and touch-screen controls for these games suck.',

Game is bestüëë',

      'Other than a few of the "encouraging" phrases being the opposite of calming ("buck up"? Really? How is that helpful when I\'m depressed?) its a pretty great game. I like the feature of being able to change time of day and weather. In general pretty calming and I gave 5 stars. But about half the messages just make me feel worse or make me roll my eyes. I tend to ignore them. The rest of the game is fantastic.',
       'Love the game but with the latest update one of the songs I love has been lost. Since hearing it been trying to find it and now I can\'t even listen to it while relaxing on my oasis. Please bring Sogaksgak, Tell you something. Or if it can\'t be brought back can the dev team let me know how to find it please it\'s such a lovely song and I keep coming across deadends trying to find it.',
       'I like this game but there are some aspects of it that confuse me. I don\'t understand the point of resetting the Oasis if I\'m just going to lose everything I worked hard to earn and upgrade. Is resetting the only way to play in the other worlds? Also I reset and am now in the star world and none of my blessings stayed like the game said they should. Please explain the full point to resetting the Oasis, other then remembrance shards.',
       'This is a really nice game! But I find the controls a bit wierd it always relaxes me...I\'ve not been able to stop playing ever since I got it! My Oasis reminds me of Abyss Rium relaxing and the graphics are very similiar and same with the gameplay c; It doesn\'t make me rage this relaxes me I reccomend this if your ok with loads of ads coming up and guaranteeing rewards -_- yeah I don\'t like that part :^ But this still is really nice game',
       'This is a good game for those which are wanting to become more mindful and less stressed. It is very relaxing and calming. I think that the game would be a lot better if it were slightly more complicated and if there were more controls. For example being able to zoom in further,being able to look at the animals up close,being able to walk on the oasis. Etc. Overall It a good game that I can get repetitive.',
       'Fun at first, and recent changes are nice.  However, endgame balance is quite poor.  If you get near or above level 1,000, there is absolutely no reason to upgrade virtues.  I don\'t even know why dandelion seeds are in the game, as they offer no value.  I\'m stuck at 1151 because it takes 6 journeys to get one level.  Oh, and ditch the reset idea.  No way will I reset now.. give a way to just start a new island.' ,

      'This game is good with a very high chance to be one of the great fishing games.  Fishing lures have short info on that specific fish and some are pretty interesting.  Always have a tournament going on and the only bad part is if your just starting out you may not have a lure u can use for that tournament. Don\'t worry you don\'t have to wait to be a certain level to participate so chances are you will eventually be able to be involved. Only complaint I have no option in settings to change kg to lbs.  Other than that you have a fishing game with easy controls that is fun to play.',
       'I purchased lure packs and built an amazing profile, then they game wouldn\'t load for 2 days so I had to uninstall it and reinstall. Once I did all my info was gone and so we\'re weeks of my time and money building up my player profile. Rip Off!!!',
       'I wasn\'t sure how I was gonna like this game, but I am glad I gave it a shot. It is very easy to get addicted to it. People who talk about leveling up fast are just impatient. Enjoy the graphics and smooth gameplay.',
       'I dont\'t know what happen, but the game wont load and stuck at loading screen forever, game cant start at all. This happen since this morning. Uninstall is the best way.',
       'I feel it takes way to long to level up. And it is vauge on how to do so.',
       'Fun game to play when there is time to kill. Not a lot of ads, but you do have to wait for packs to open.' ,

       'Game became sluggish after update, the pads sounds only occur a few millisecinds afyer touching but its a noticeable difference. Makes all songs sound terrible. Sounds often mash together eg.

      'It\'s like Episode\'s ugly cousin. Story line is okay, character look is very limited, in order to play the rest of the game you HAVE to pay a subscription fee like the game is worth it. For one month it\'s 7.99 and may I remind you that Netflix (10000% better) is the exact same price as that for a standard pack. Episode (story app like this) is much more cost-efficient and over all better because at the very least you can make your character resemble you, don\'t have to spend so much out of your pocket, and Episode also isn\'t prone to crashing like this one.',
       'Subscribed for a month..cost me $9.99.  Not bad I thought...until the game stopped working in the middle of a story. Had to restart game and it went to loading page....stayed at 10% and will Not load any further. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling ...no luck! Asking for my money back . Funny how it stopped working a couple hours after I paid!!!',
       'One ticket is too little.. plus the stories for each ticket are soooo short... other apps have it longer and you get 2 tickets minimum before the next ticket arrives.. and owh... can the characters have more options in terms of looks? Especially the guys... boring.. Plus why cant we keep the clothes that we already purchased? Stories are ok.. similar most of them..',
       'Not a bad game I like the stories. The only thing is you only get 1 ticket to read with. On the plus side you can speed up time til the next ticket',
       'OMG A great time killer I love how its just like choices and episode ‚ò∫‚ò∫ Keep up the good work!',

      'I love this game! And to everyone sqying saphires are too hard to get: its okay because now you can win them by completing challenges! And also to the people who think its too much space:  your phone itself decides that, not the creators. Thanks for this game its great fun!its great for learning about animals, as well. I have a few questions though: can flower crowns come back? Also, can spike collars be sold in the shop? Let me know. Thx!',
       'I LUV IT! And I like that this one doesn\'t have the adventures like on computers. I have a few questions like will flower crowns come back? Or will you make like this exploring place or like a phantom fortress as a new land where we can buy phantom things and NOT DO ADVENTURES bit we can still have this awesome phantom place and I know I\'m asking A LOT srry but this is my FAVORITE GAME EVER! Thanks! : )',
       'I love this game. I love playing as snowflake daisygirl. But i have 1 question. Where can i get a snowcone machine, churro machine  and  popcorn machine? Ive been hunting for them EVERYWHERE. But i cant seem to find them! And that disapointed me alot. I dont know why do jammers have  them? I started last year though. And i have a tip for this game. Can you have ALL the parties with furniture AND clothes please?  Thank You.',
       'So this pack thing is ending up making kids feel bad. You buy access to a pack and they make one or join but can only stay in it if you keep shelling out the monthly fee. They should be able to stay in their friend\'s pack if they buy it ONCE! It does NOT warn of this when you buy access to a pack, that youre kicked from the pack after the month is up if you don\'t keep paying.',
       'I think if we win a game  we get 1 saffire! Or at least those quests you get gems. please make the animals cheaper then like 150 saffires. P.s. can you tell me where you can buy the Giant Plushies?  Thank you if you reply! Edit 2: Please reply to this, I played a game and should have gotten the 3rd saffire chest! but it says I have 6 levels left and I did it, the game is fast foodies. I\'m really sad, I want the Arctic wolf ya see so getting the 25 saffires would have really helped me out! I understand you must be really buzy, but please fix this. You guys are the best game makers!',
       'Its a great game. But I\'d like some things to happen. Like, one, please make the animals and pets much less. And two, I\'m not the biggest fan for the only a member can do stuff. Like many others I think the saffires  should be easier to get. Plus, please put some new things to do on. I would love some new games to do. Anyways, great game in all.' ,

      '...ok why sega? this ain\'t the original sonic 2 android port that i downloaded about 3-4 year ago(the original price costed $3, lucky for me it was on a amazon freebe) and i mean i still have the original android port and it\'s great with the 60 FPS and updated graphics and slightly improved engine and this, this appeared on the google playstore, ads after every level and even in the menu? come on, also i can tell the diffents cuz the background and some menu textures are offset from the original(i did some side by side comparesions between apps and how i can tell the diffents between the 2 apps is one has a gold outline while the original doesn\'t) i mean heck if your going to lowwer the price... lowwer not make it appear free and make ppl pay to remove ads... no odfencve but thats just dumb...',
       'I too agree with some of the comments below. I purchased the game a few years ago and now I have to pay AGAIN to remove the ads. That is ridiculous. All users that have the paid version should not have to pay for the ad free version. Its a shame because everything else is good. Plus I tried this version and it\'s worse than the original. Lucky I have downloaded the old version before this really bad version of sonic forever got released. So I always play the old version. One bad thing about the old version is that multiplayer doesn\'t work. So frustrating as I only need one more achievement and it has to be the multiplayer one. I simply don\'t want to play this game because of all the ads. Its ridiculous to be honest.',
       'Ok, so this is a good port of the game.  The only thing is, that there are bugs with the controls.  If you jump, hold jump, and make a "joystick" input, then the directional input will match your jump input, and vice versa.  Doesn\'t sound like much, but it is super annoying when you are fighting the final boss or doing platforming.  Another thing is that the frame rate is inconsistent, sometimes running between 30-60 fps, and sometimes 10. ALSO, tone down the pause ads, its a bit much.',
       'Ok first before I get into the real review, why are you asking me if this is sad?? But anyway sometimes when I\'m playing single player it will say "2p vs has been disconnected" and bring me to the main screen. Other than that it\'s fine and good.',
       'I really like it can you make Sonic 3 on the phone too? Also for those who say this is a bad game . . . You are just not smart at all. Classic Sonic games are the best but the controls could be better for classic Sonic games',
       'Lags really badly unlike the first sonic. Should not be an issue whatsoever with my phone. Something wrong with the app.   UPDATE: Reinstalled after Jan 30 update. Still broken, horribly slow and completely unplayable. Whatever you did with Sonic 1, why dont you try that? That game actually works and I bought it. Please repair it and Ill happily purchase this one as well..' ,

      'I have only had the game a few hours and I am already falling in love with it. It is great to go on when you have a spare 10-15 minutes. The grid is larger than others so I can read the words fluently and quickly without them being hard to see. You get points after each time you complete the grid so if you are really stuck you can receive a hint for some points. I would highly recommend this excellent game.',
       'Only been playing for a few days now, and so far, I love it! Forgot how fun Word Search puzzles can be, and to have it on my phone is priceless lol.. No complaints with the app so far. I will say though, maybe they should tweak it just a tad, instead of giving a hint only after a short moment, possibly creating \'the option\' to have a hint may be a little better. Not a big deal to me. It truly is a great app, love the simplicity of the graphic design too. Glad I came across this game.',
       'I enjoy ALMOST the whole game, being a word find and all, simple, yet deceptively hard at times. Still, I wish there was a way to turn off the \'hints\' it gives, as they get annoying... unless there IS a way that I haven\'t discovered yet...otherwise, I REALLY like the game, and would suggest it to all ages, as it\'s not too tough for the young ones, but still challenging enough for experienced players.',
       'It\'s a good game but there needs to be a way to turn off hints. If you don\'t find a word in the time it thinks you should, it keeps giving hints which ruins the gameplay. I pause for various reasons like talking to someone, cat catching a mouse, watching tv at the time, etc.. Or sometimes it might take longer to fins a word than seconds allowed before the hint.',
       'I love this game. Really nice and well thought out game. It\'s educative too. But I have just one issue with it though: The flashing hint. This gets me distracted each time it flashes. Maybe there could be a hint button at the bottom of the puzzle. That way instead of it flashing and getting us distracted, we could just click on it whenever we need help. Apart from that, it\'s just perfect. Will give it a 5 when the flashing hint is worked onüòÅ',
       'Other reviews are accurate  for me.. hints become irritating in that they only flash on for a second and you miss them rather than find them useful.  They also appear too soon so you have little time to search.  I also found the occasional issue registering a word and having to go over it several times. But it\'s a free game, it\'s fun, it\'s addictive what else is there to say ? It\'s good.' ,

I just have to edit this to add that I don\'t understand why people are complaining about ads. You only need to watch them for a hint, and only briefly. It\'s a free game, and the developer has to make a living. You can pay to get them removed, but they really aren\'t obtrusive at all.',
       'To be honest, I was like this is going to be boring üí§, but within minutes, I was totally hooked. Absolutely amazing, love it. If fact, I went straight back online and got red. I\'ve not heard of this Bart Bonte before, but he\'s a bit magic.',

      'I would put a zero if I could. This is by far the worst LEGO game ever, and like always it\'s very boring and has poor graphics and gameplay. What is anything creative here? The fact that you get to choose what you build? It is so stupid on so many levels. I do not recommend this game.',

      'Classic tetris with modern graphics, you can use one touch controls or classic directional pad if you wish, both have their own advantage. I am afraid I can\'t find Bradinsky song. It\'s okay for me with advisement because EA need something to eat right? Lol',
       'Enjoyed it at first, and short adverts were expected, but recently adverts have become longer, and now last longer than the game. The latest video advert lasted inbetween games lasted 8 mins....ridiculous!!!. I understand the need for adverts, but if you can\'t play the game, the adverts are pointless, espeacially if it makes players quit.',
       'I just wanted to play Tetris. Happy to pay for it, was hoping I could pay a $5-10 purchase price and then have the game and play it to my liking. No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It\'s TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred',
       'Trying to play Tetris with these abysmal touch and swipe controls is an absolute abject mess. Just add some virtual buttons in, since your loot-boxing asses are supposedly so focussed on \'player choice\' lately.',
       'Great game, but there\'s an annoying window that pops up everytime I try and start a new marathon. The window is pretty much useless and wastes my time. Would give this 5 stars if it gets patched',
       'Since you really really want a review, when I adjust music and SFX to minimum, I expect no sound at all. Please allow for sound to be muted. Very annoying to have button that serve no purpose. Sure you need ads to survive EA big company like you, go ahead but you want to play the ad with sound over what I have playing that\'s annoying enough, at least optimise the sound so that it doesn\'t play at max volume.' ,

      'Well, I still liked Duel Generations better, and wish that that game would work again, but I have to admit that visually and game play wise Deul Links is pretty amazing. Especially for a free game. I haven\'t gotten very far into it yet, but so far it\'s intuitive and just really slick looking. However, there is one reason I still would prefer Generations, and that is because I loved the inclusion of ALL versions of Yu-Gi-Oh, not just the first series. I grew up with 5DS  and Zexal more than anything, and I wish that those series could be incorporated into the game somehow. I\'d love to be able to play as Kite or Astral or something.',
       'this truly an amazing game, there\'s really only a couple of things, why reduce the monster and spell/trap zones to only 3 cards? I wouldn\'t say it\'s bad, I just don\'t see why you\'d need to do it.. plus the average deck size of yugioh is between 40 and 50 cards, why limit us to only a max of 30 cards? (not including the 5 for extra  decks) but all in all its a great game! Finally got my six samurai deck!üòÑ also, I think it\'d be an awesome idea to put in a way for duelists to redeem the codes on the cards they\'ve purchased IRL. I bet that\'d get even more duelists to play! Just a thought thoughüòä',
       'Never played Yugioh this is the first time in this game and it is easily accessible with this game to get into this card game. I liked Yugioh better than the other TCG game like Pok√©mon,Hearthstone,Magic etc and I thought they are kind of more complicated for me because of their sourcing system like mana and energy while its all about monster cards, traps and spells etc. Very good card game and newbie friendly in general both those wanting to get into Yugioh and card gaming in general :D',
       'Found Yu-Gi-Oh on Netflix last week and decided to rewatch it. A few episodes in, and my love for the show rekindled, I got eager to play the game myself. I used to play with Yu-Go-Oh cards when I was a kid but it\'s been about 12 years since then and so all my old cards are in the loft, not that I know anyone IRL anymore who would fancy a game anyway, and not accessible right now... plus I had forgotten most of the rules too. But this app is just what I was looking for: a way to relearn the rules and have a bit of fun. Perfect for whatever skill level you\'re at with the game!',
       'Trash, true fans would never say this game is great. Only 3 monster and spell/trap zones and the person that goes first only starts with 4 cards? Really? Not to mention the terrible camera angles and rigged matches. If you\'re a competitive player that doesn\'t like to get bs, don\'t play this.',
       'I can\'t put this down. Rather that\'s good or bad is up to you, lol. I love it, I wish it was a little easier to navigate, there are a lot of graphics with the futuristic look, but other than that. It\'s a great game, very addicting, and the kid in me is loving rehashing Yu-Gi-Oh' ,
