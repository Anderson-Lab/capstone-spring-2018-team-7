     [ 'Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I\'m 20 just..üòâüòâ I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I\'m in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...üòÇüòÇ Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. üòòüòòüòò‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è',
       'Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there\'s nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.',
       'A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!',
       'I\'ve noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don\'t think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying.',
       'I really like this game. But here is why I gave it 2 stars.  I completed all of the challenges but still don\'t have have enough score to finish ranking up.  The 5 day to secret ball never works for me. It resets after 2 days even though I play everyday.  There should be a counter for how many times you switch lanes. Some of the challenges were impossible because you had to switch lanes exactly x amount.  Also I don\'t think you should have challenges that make you avoid getting the coins, because the whole point of the game is to win spheres and lanes...',
       'Fun little time killer. My only problem is that daily rewards fail to show up most days. It could be a problem on my end, but I don\'t know, and it\'s a pretty small issue so I don\'t really care.' ],

       'Some of the troops are simply overwhelming, e.g. Dragon, while some spells make the troops overwhelming, e.g. Protection on Black Night, Giant Growth on Black Night / Dragon, which generally make no chance of countering (countering is an element for good strategy game). A few suggestions to balance the cards‚Äô power and have good strategy game:   1. Giant Growth: reduce the power-up to 30%, or add time limit to the spell, or disallow the spell to cards with mana 7 and above (unfortunately Unchained Demon with only 3 mana will be spared from this).  2. Dragon: reduce the speed to 2, or reduce the power / health / attack range.   3. Protection: disallow the spell to cards with mana 7 and above, or add time limit to the spell.   4. Vempire: reduce the attack / health / speed, increase health loss %.',
       'I like it ALOT, but unless you can get lucky with good cards as a new player it wont be fun for a while. There is alot of umbalance between newer cards and stock cards, you can get screwed unless you\'re absolitely professional with default cards',
       'Game is nice,but has some problems. 1.very hard to earn gems(easy to spend) 2.need real money purchases to go for higher trophies  3.long time needed to open chests 4.I hate that piggy bank thing If you overcome these problems game would be nice.but good jobüòÄ',

     [ 'The stories are addicting and exciting. But you make us watch several ads and THEN ask us to pay for EVERY THING extra. From clothes to hair to what to say next to new chapters. I get the world revolves around money but you are getting paid plenty with these big name ads. Let the game be more enjoyable and make it free or a set price from the start for the app. You lure people in and then ask for money if they want to continue. Nah, I\'ll wait an hour for the ticket. Great game concept though.',
       'It\'s like Episode\'s ugly cousin. Story line is okay, character look is very limited, in order to play the rest of the game you HAVE to pay a subscription fee like the game is worth it. For one month it\'s 7.99 and may I remind you that Netflix (10000% better) is the exact same price as that for a standard pack. Episode (story app like this) is much more cost-efficient and over all better because at the very least you can make your character resemble you, don\'t have to spend so much out of your pocket, and Episode also isn\'t prone to crashing like this one.',
       'I\'ve only read 1 story so far. The story itself wasn\'t bad. The characters are kind of goofy looking but I like the app. You\'re able to earn gems as you go. It does give you only 1 ticket at a time, per hr. But it also gives you the option to watch videos to speed up the clock so you can get it sooner. Which NONE of the other apps like this do! However, at the moment, it isn\'t working for me. No matter how many times I try to speed up the clock, it isn\'t budging. It was working 2 hrs ago. So, IDK if there is a daily limit or what, because I didn\'t get a warning. There is something about the videos I don\'t like though... After you watch them, it automatically brings you to the app store to download whatever game you just watched the video for. Sooooo annoying! Otherwise, not a bad game thus far. It is a great time waster!',
       'Subscribed for a month..cost me $9.99.  Not bad I thought...until the game stopped working in the middle of a story. Had to restart game and it went to loading page....stayed at 10% and will Not load any further. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling ...no luck! Asking for my money back . Funny how it stopped working a couple hours after I paid!!!',
       'I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME!!  This game is amazing and a great time killer! I\'ve used the game in the past when they gave 2 tickets but I\'ve recently downloaded it, they only give 1 ticket for 1 HOUR! The stories it self is good, the characters lacks some things, the stories are too short. The \'free\' diamonds doesn\'t work, when ever I click on it, it goes black and closes the app which is frustrating. The choices in the stories are 10 to 25 GEMS which takes forever for someone like me who doesn\'t pay for gems. BUT other then that there isn\'t anything I could think of from the top of my head.  So, please fix these....',
       'So addictive I couldn\'t stop playing it. Only thing I will say is you need to get to many diamonds for the clothes and some of the decisions you have to make. X Is there any more books after Mona series study abroad ? As it did say to be continued' ],

     [ 'Graphics are awesome, but the game itself is very monotonous. You can fall asleep waiting for something to change and make it more exciting. When a change such as an added bonus does come (bomb or a rainbow bubble) you realize that it wasn\'t worth the 20 or 30 levels you just wasted your time on. Progressive enticing events need to happen more quickly.',
       'Game is good without any aproblem it do works. It\'s not a game a advertising app, isn\'t this too much hance i know you developers make money on the game but just because of this much ennoying adds when people uninstall this app you won\'t be able to make anything out of your effort can you???',
       'On level 19 I scored three stars bit it shows only two. Aside from that, no other complaints... YET. I will say thank you, though, for not aggressively pushing ads, pushing to pay to extend the aim line. So far, its amusingüòÅ',
       'This is a really fun game but my  my concerns are that when I have no balls left, for me it doesn\'t have the option to play a video to earn more but for my brother it does therefore it makes me start all over again. The other concern is that when I use a bomb for the chest it takes away a ball for example I have 12 balls when I use the bomb from the chest, I get 11 balls left which it doesn\'t do that for my brother. I hope you can fix this.',
       'I thought the levels would be more difficult by now I\'m on 143 at the moment. I enjoy the game but I\'m getting a bit bored with the easiest of challenges and without having to use the help button . I hope the game will  get more challenging soon.   Grandson aged 5 will like playing this game.',
       'I like that you don\'t have to pay for the Assistance or no stuff on the game to help you advance like the Hammers the ball that matches any color different stuff like that you just got to watch the ads which is fine with me at least it doesn\'t cost you a fortune to play I like the color on the graphics are very bright and colorful and good for children to play no violent content to it whatsoever great game for everyone across the board' ],

Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!',
       'This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you\'re willing to go broke',
       'Its the best game I have ever played. The things you can build are amazing and it\'s great that you can build your own to. The controls and graphics are unbelievably amazing. Great animal sounds to, they actually sound exactly the same as a real animal. Its also great that you can have villager\'s and your own pets. Only problem is the packs you have to use diamonds and if I don\'t have enough then I have pay for the diamonds and I\'m just a kid and my mom says no so please make the packs and the things in them cheaper. But other than that, this game is so AWESOME. üòÉ',
       'Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.',

       'I have a significant concern with how easy it is to accidentally spend the gems. It has happened at least once, though I\'m assuming it happened a second time while I was quickly clicking building a building, since fifteen gems are now unaccounted for.

     [ 'Well I like the game. It\'s fun and it is really tempting to open a really good chest because you can get a legendary. I have minor inferno dragon lava hound mega knight sparky and lumberjack. For example pretend your friend says don\'t open that ledendary chest wait until tomorrow . You just gotta open it. And Supercell it would be nice if I could get night witch.',
       'NejiOmeGa here!üôè I have got to say this game is a "quick paste first place!" type of game and I love it so far been training like a pro to be on top!!üôá I\'ve loved it ever since the updates, oh yes did I mention I\'m a returning player?? An exquisite job well done I have so many new opportunities to reveal, but so many opponents to show who\'s Royals! So all is said I just ask that you watch and battle me tuff clasherzüòÇüòÇ',
       'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'I m lucky enough!!!!!  I just started playing 8 months ago and now I earn 7 legendaries in total and 2 of them are lvl2 where as my friend is playing since more than a year he owes only 6 legendaries and 1 of them is lvl 2..... So plz do something about this we(gamers) expect better from u  Plz don\'t disappoint them who has low no.s of legendaries....... This is request from all guys who have not got luck in this game I guess...',
       'Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn\'t one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you\'re better at making farm and army games. Please make more of thoseüòñ' ],

     [ 'Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it\'s only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that\'s bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it\'s a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I\'ll rate 5 star$',
       'Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me',
       'Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn\'t really feel like you\'re getting anywhere.',
       'For as repetitive as it is I can\'t seem to put it down, it\'s seriously addictive. Maybe it\'s the great graphics or the fact it reminds me of one of my old favs arcade game  Spyhunter. A few small things I would fix are; needs a running diamond total during race to see how many you\'ve picked up. A better garage showing a side angle of your car so you can see the paint jobs and rims better and the most needed item is when you click on your profile pick there NEEDS to be a experience total! Just having the circle showing your experience isn\'t enough, I\'d like an actual number total. Also another mode to think about is maybe a side scrolling mode or overhead track mode like Grand Prix 2. All in all great graphics, music and replayability!',
       'For a shoot \'em up racing android game it\'s really addictive. I\'m always playing it. It\'s fun. My only complaint is the time it takes for the fuel to charge, 30 mins? Come on! Otherwise very challenging. Challenge accepted!',
       'One of the later updates has the game stuck in full screen mode, which makes only 4 lanes visible at a time. Music and some sounds effects stop playing after the first song until I start the next race. I honestly wouldn\'t have minded the 4 lanes thing if that\'s how it\'s supposed to be. But I know it\'s not because \'andice is asking me if I really want to exit the game. Good game to waste time with, but the devs gotta fix these quirks.' ],

     [ 'This is an awesome game that gives you daily and weekly quest\'s and offers treasure chests. Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven\'t tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.',
       'It\'s my favorite app. I love it a lot. My only issue is that it doesn\'t quite accurately update my stats especially my highest score without using a \'save me,\' longest run, most coins & gems. I would really like the developers to look into that but otherwise it\'s a brilliant game.',
       'Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a "slide," I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don\'t compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.',
       'I love all the graphics it\'s a bit like the        piano tiles it test\'s your fast skills but except it is temple run 2 love it. Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.',
       'Nice, good, adventure game.but some times your team irritating who one completed thirteen level they will easily get diamond  your giving master challenge ( now the challenge Chinese New year )who one complete your giving thirty diamond only.this offer will useful only for entry level gamers. Most of players finished fourteen level so they no need diamonds.so think about genius players.',
       'Brilliant game play with nice updates. However, certain things can be improved. For example, the gem powered power up is not clear. I am not sure whether the power up works only for one time use or for entire one run. Kindly, help to enlight users on this part.' ],

     [ 'Great game. First turn based strategy game that I have enjoyed in a long time. There is no dumb energy bar that you have to wait to refill which is amazing.  Also there are no ads unless you voluntarily watch one to get a bonus to a chest. The only thing I wish was different is that the player could unlock multiple chest at once. It\'s quite slow to open chests as it is and it would be awesome to be able to unlock more chests at the same time. Overall it\'s a great game with a bright future. I would definitely recommend getting it.',
       'Just downloaded. Like what I see so far and can play casually. No ads interfering with game play. Hope to see some strategic maps in the future. I\'ll change my review once I get to know the game better. This is definitely NOT one of those ridiculous grindfest mobile games. There\'s gaming consoles and PC\'s for that nonsense.',

It took 5 minutes (literally) to match up to someone who didn\'t fight (not a *bot* we get to fight in the beginning) as well as take a minute each to unlock a 15s chest...  Otherwise its nice!',

     [ 'WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you',
       'Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It\'s pretty decent. I\'m enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I\'ve raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn\'t a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)',
       'You "borrowed" a lot from MCOC, but as an avid Tekken player, I think you would have been better served sticking with the PS concept. Play the character you want, play their story for prizes at the end, and so on.  Using MCOC basic controls was cool, but if there is anything to borrow from them completely would have been the controls. Different offensive taps to create different moves, etc. Overall, it is petty solid, but could have been a hit if you stuck to your own game concept.',
       'iFirst of all I would say. It took me almost 30 minutes to just start the game. It was stuck in downloading screen. Later on it crashed on me  I fired up the game again and later It froze on me during the first fight. For 3rd time I started the game and it eternity to just pass through the loading screen. The data was downloading, then initializing and then loading. Took such a long time. Plz fix this issue. I really want to enjoy this game. But not like this. Even the game play is laggy.',
       'The odd bug and very grindy. Still strangely satisfying . Some fun to be had in finding ways to cheese the AI. Good for a quick tekken fix.  Edit: lowered my vote - despite phone on vibrate and game volume turned down it blasted my speakers at full volume. Not acceptable.',
       'Fun game overall, though I wish they would\'ve added more known characters. It feels like they just peppered in a couple of favorites. I am also having an issue where after a fight my progress isn\'t saved, causing me to have less health and I have to do the same fight again. It\'s frustrating to say the least, hence thr three stars...for now.' ],

Please reply or just update. Thank you.',
       'Great game to pass time. Adverts are frustrating but necessary unless you want to pay to stop, BUT very annoying when they pop up as you just lifted a puzzle piece and because of advert it just drops randomly. Also being able to rotate pieces would be handy, granted not as challenging however.',
       'Your English is so bad it is insulting.    You need to hire someone to proof read before you post requests for ratings.  A definite turn off to the game which is actually quite fun and challenging.    Requires strategic planning.',
       'My absolute all time favorite game! I used to have the woodblock version and would play that one ALL the time. The only thing I didn\'t like about it was that I couldn\'t get anything higher than 300 most of the time for the score, no matter what I did. The only time I did was the first time I installed it and played, I easily reached 1,500 points, but anytime I played after I could never come anywhere close, so I decided to look for a different game with the same concept and found this one. Instantly loved it! It\'s got more block room (so easier to get more points), love the sound effects, I don\'t feel cheated or set up like the other one, and it\'s a good way to get your mind working if you\'re someone like me who likes to think it through and plans for future possible block pieces c: plus the colors and looks is a bonus!^-^',
       'The app is fun but it needs a no ads option for purchase. Also if the game is muted the ads should be auto muted as well. Currently the play at full volume whether the game is muted or not. It\'s very frustrating.',
       'My four year old likes it and I feel like it helps him on making decisions. I can actually see him thinking what going to be him next move. I like this game and I love playing with my son. Only thing I hate is that it does have to many ads üòí' ],

     [ 'I used to love this game, very addictive but recent updates have made the game have too many elements (clubs - who cares???) Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels "fixed" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.',
       'This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.',
       'I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn\'t really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don\'t know how many more points you need.',
       'This game has many issues! It continually freezes and shuts me down. I can no longer play on my tablet, which I purchased just for games, and have to use my phone. I don\'t like using my phone because it drains my battery. I am so ready to quit this game and return to candy crush instead. Latest updates have rendered JP and other perks useless.',
       'Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the "boards" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it\'s addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It\'s becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.',
       'I really liked playing as mindless entertainment despite what I consider to be unreasonable costs of the games as you advance in levels  and even tolerated the forced ads when they began. Unfortunately 2 days ago   it refused to load and continues to ask to retry or restart.  My connections are optimal and no updates pending.   Have tried to contact support to no avail. Disappointing.' ],

     [ 'Good game however, once you\'ve taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world\'s and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.',
       'Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.',
       'It\'s a really great game! I\'m really looking forward to an update. I think it\'d be REALLY helpful to be able to purchase an extra boat that just goes around and picks up boxes.. Having to turn around all the time gets tedious. Also an online pvp would be awesome. Maybe have the ability to make clans with your friends that can attack other clans. I\'m looking forward to see what you guys do!',
       'This game is great overall and you have a great sense of progression as your ship gets bigger and faster. The problem is the controls themselves. I found it very hard( I noticed this when I reached HP or ship level 6 ) and sometimes close to impossible to fire at other ship even at point blank range. The game has a very hard time trying to focus on one ship and would often shoot at where the enemy was 3 seconds ago especially when there is more than 3 ships at once which often happens. I would recommend a fire button option to compliment the controls and the gameplay experience. As I said before, it is indeed a very amusing game and would be even more enjoyable with this added feature.',
       'please, please, please. update more maps or make it more challenging, ive already conquered all the islands and there\'s not much i can do anymore. so please, either more maps, or let others conquer my islands and let me reclaim it. i know you guys can still add up to this already amazing game. also, improve the controls, really cant see much when im steering. but over all, its a really fun, relaxing game. ;) thank you.',
       'One of me and my sister\'s favourite game. But we wish we could play together same team or against each other with bots. We don\'t  want to be against online players. If you guys do that I will tell alllllll my friends to play. Anyway great job keep up the work , you guys are greatüòÅ' ],

Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.',
       'I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I\'ve already dumped into this game and the devs didn\'t give me my in game rewards. I\'ve submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.',
       'Wasn\'t sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to "farm gold,xp,mats". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it\'s an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don\'t be jealous, just play your game and have fun.',
       'Honestly gameplay and all is good but the game is so p2w it\'s not funny, it would cost u over a hundred dollars just to complete every reward for new Valentine\'s event. If you like this game play private server instead this version is a giant cash grab. Not competitive for f2p at all',
       'Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an "annoying add". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It\'s simple, it\'s fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend.',
       'Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I\'ve progressed it\'s just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I\'m not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!' ],

     [ 'This game is very fun and addictive but should have offline mode so we don\'t have to deal with a hacker every game.  Also after new update I\'m having issues getting into the game. It says "check comnection" and my connection is fine even tried uninstalling it and all. Other games work on my phone and so does my Wi-Fi. The game just worked last night for me now it doesn\'t! PLEASE FIX!!',
       'Could you please add an offline mode...would be nice to practice on the go. Also please please please add more guns. I have been playing this game for a year and still no new guns but glad you are keeping up with the maps. I have this HUGE problem, it says check connection when I have good connection. I tried to restart my phone and reconnect but still doesn\'t work. PLEASE FIX.',
       'Just good. This game is great. The controls are completely customizable so you can make it work the way you want it to. Graphics are on point, better than 2nd Gen consoles, lesser than 3rd gen. If this game came out in the age of the PS2 I would have bought it. Also, buy a box because this game couldn\'t have been cheap to make. This game should cost like $25.',
       'I loved the game before. It was one of the best fps game I have ever seen. But after the ban in pc you guys have lost a lot of players. And I too now hate the game. It was moreover greater than counter strike go, but after the ban you guys made all of us disappointed. If you would have continued with this game on pc I am surely telling that this would be known as people\'s choice game. So please consider to it and bring back this game on pc.  Thank you,  Your great full player',
       'The game is obviously inspired by counter strike. The problem is that the thing that makes counter strike so great is how skill based it is. C-ops is on mobile and mobile doesn\'t have the best and most reliable controls which leaves a lot to luck. Therefore i think that the game should strafe away from being a counter strike clone, and try to be it\'s own thing. It also pushes micro transactions quite a bit with the skin system and MAKING YOU PAY TO CHANGE YOUR NAME! The graphics are pretty much the most realistic it can get on mobile while having acceptable frame rates. Overall not the best fps on mobile, but definitely not the worst.',
       'The best game I have ever play Is critical ops it is perfect at gameplay control comfortable and of course there graphics.But there is a problem today I have try to open cops when I come at loading and came in the menu it shows authenticating but after a sec it again comes back again j try to happens the same so plz fix it am a pro at this game and I don\'t want restart the game so PLZ FIXXX!!

     [ 'I\'m 11 and i love it so much.I have some Ideas for a toca kitchen 3. You can be able to make sandwiches and soups or stews. And more ingredients, more people. And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.',
       'I want YOU to read this Toca Boca I love it! But I have to ask, Why is there bread if you can\'t make a sandwich? Also can you make there a way to make soup? I really like your games but I am only 10,how do you expect me to pay for the games. At make 5 free like this!',
       'I like how I can give the guests disgusting drinks and food a see and hear their really funny reaction! Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!üòÜüòÜ I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!',
       'Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I\'m sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP',
       'I\'m giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won\'t make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least',
       'This is the best game ever it is also funny because I was giving the girl food and I gave her some strawberries and I put a lot of lemon, hot sauce, Barbiecu sauce,Manas,keckup,salt, and pepper... SO funny, it also sounds just like a kid is playing with the food, that I\'m eating grapes right now,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÅüòÄüòä‚ò∫üôÇüòê' ],

     [ 'When it\'s not crashing, it\'s fun to play.  Sucks when it doesn\'t load of locks up during game play.  Also it gets expensive as you have to buy packs at $99 a pop after the 1st 2.  The game play is addicting, but no fun if you cannot afford the special offers they continue to throw in your face every time you log in.  I love final fantasy games but this particular one is a money pit!.  Not to mention the constant crashing',
       'I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.',
       'This game has potential to be fun but it\'s completely ruined because IT\'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don\'t get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it\'s full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it\'s a complete money bucket!',
       'This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.',
       'The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it\'s free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15',
       'I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my "family"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we\'re like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I\'m from Michigan,we\'re both married ,but there\'s nothing I wouldn\'t do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!!

If you bought it you should be allowed to switch back and forth as you wish.    It\'s a really zen pass time  game :) also cute and interactive.',
       'This would totally be worth 5 stars if it weren\'t for the ADS. I get it\'s a free game, but its one thing to put an ad on the top or side of the screen. It\'s one thing to optionally watch ads for coins and prizes. But its another thing when full screen videos pop-up, pausing your game and wasting your time. I was honestly thinking about giving this 3 stars just b/c of how annoying that is alone.',

Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls. Would be nice to turn off the help lines, too.',

     [ 'Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can\'t play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.',
       'One of the few games that I don\'t mind spending a bit i.e. $10+ every month. Requires team guild effort to achieve stuffs together definitely gives a good feeling. Event is weekly and community is lively. Card\'s artwork feels like Rage of Bahamut but using matching puzzle style to deal damage. Skills of card matter as well increasing the complexity and fun. Only thing to improve would be cheaper ingame currency to encourage more people to have better decks thus higher activity rates.',
       'It\'s a lot other games of this type. I haven\'t been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you\'re looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn\'t find any more connections, that would be great!',
       'My big complain is that I cannot enable notifications, I\'m on a pixel phone and it is no where to be found in the settings menu, I just uninstall and reinstall the game to see if it shows up. It\'s really inconvenient as a guild leader to not be able to get notifications. Thank you',

Maybe make some exchange rate for silver to gold without changing the silver availability or price. Someway that gold can be acquired beside the little in the ground. I understand the game has to make a profit and so you should but more people would continue to play instead of giving up Anyway just a couple of thoughts.

The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there\'s only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can\'t beat them! Keep making more awesome games!',
       'I can\'t help but love a mobile game that doesn\'t constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it\'s tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.',
       'This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn\'t always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing',
       'I really like the game. But there\'s one thing that annoys me: when I don\'t play this game for a few hours and then I do another battle in dungeon, the game crashes after killing last monster in that battle.  I found out that if I switch on mobile data it works. So I wanted to asked why is that. EDIT: now all works just fine. 5 stars',
       'Gameplay isn\'t disrupted by ads unless you want some free coins once and awhile. They aren\'t throwing the loot boxes in your face either.  The coins per hour/minute seems to be while playing only. Not sure if that\'s a glitch or how it is meant to be.',

Gonna put a hindrance on the event that\'s over on Friday. Do hope it\'s resolved soon. Still like the game tho, but would like it better if I can play.',
       'Right.  First off, If you are not a fan of Idle games, then don\'t play. This is the epitome of an Idle game.   The Early game is pretty simple. Click, Collect, Make your way to Level 80. You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn\'t bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn\'t been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event\'s are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events\'  All in, pretty good.',
       'Well guess they deleted my last post cause I complained that the game took up 1.8 gig till I uninstalled it and reinstalled it then lost my saves because of bad programming.   Don\'t waste your time or money on this company.',
       'They put so many buttons to purchase things ion the main screen. When tapping as is the nature of the game, it brings up confirmation for your purchases. If you\'re trying to play fast, you could easily spend $20 in mere seconds without noticing. Put all the purchases in one place instead of cheating players.',
       'Good game but you need to fix your ads, half the time they either crash the game or they won\'t load and freeze the game so you have to restart. Also the game will randomly just close sometimes for no reason. Enjoy the game but there are definitely some bugs that need to be worked out.',
       'Game was fun until the Ad time increased from 30 seconds to over 2 minutes. I\'m not going to watch over 2 minutes in Ads (up to 6 consecutive time in a row totaling 12 minutes) just to play the game. Disappointed they made this change.' ],

     [ 'Nice game. I like the concept of rebuilding but this game was meant to kill time, I hope so. Keep adding characters and what we require is a hell lot of mini games so that they may keep coming and coming and coming. I do not intend to harass you but try to add more and more mini games after each update. I\'m sure that in the course of  time you may be able to compete with the best games ever created but do not make the game larger than DWTD 2. Add more new locations too otherwise we will not be able to consume the tokens. The game is nice because you do not have to consume money for characters and get them through gifts instead. It is also nice because tokens can be collected easily. Please think about my opinions. I‚ù§ this game.',
       'The character models are cute and all, but the games are getting a bit repetitive. WAY too many ads. Like, ridiculously too many. The app forces a couple right after you finish some of the minigames. You have enough to offer us - forcing even more ads on top of that is tiresome. Get rid of them.',
       'Dumb ways to die 3 gets 3 stars. No, seriously, I loved the first 2, but this one is not good. Only 4 minigames, not really different each from another. Remember FASTER FASTER FASTER ? It disappeared (I miss it), and is now ADS ADS ADS. The goal here is just to use money and play as often as you can for ADS ADS ADS. The main thing here ? Minigames ? Nooooo, just getting (or buying) tokens and use them to repair houses (no impact on gameplay). Why would this game be nice ? The graphics are still good. Yes, that\'s all. Have a nice day. ADS ADS ADS',
       'Best game of all time I mean you have to try this or else your life could be boring and lonely the 1st and 2nd are also really good check em out and you can\'t live with out this game. My point is best game ever',
       'To be honest, I don\'t think this game updated at ALL. Dumb ways to die 1 and 2 were GREAT but this one... not so GREAT.  First of all,  there are only for games that you could play.  Second,  it\'s not as creative as the other ones. And third,  the only good thing about it is that for ME there are no ads.  The list goes on but that\'s for you to find out and for me to uninstall. üòêüòêüòêüòêüòüüòüüòüüòüüò¢üò≠   Im VERY disappointed',

THIS game, however, has only ONE ad at the start of each game, and allows you to mute the sound "once" for all future ads. It\'s simple to click the ad off before the game commences. *wink* The background is lovely and the graphics are wonderful! So relaxing. The happy little "card dance" animation after each win is nice, as well. Thank You!',

     [ 'It feel like developer tries to cash is as much as possible. You can\'t develop without paying. You saving crystals just to get 3* hero to feed it to your 4*. Game don\'t stop when you receive phone call so you easily can loose alliance energy without doing any attack.',
       'It\'s a fun game. The challenges and levels are interesting and keep getting harder. But if you resource well and plan your strategies, you can play a lot smoother.   Only thing I don\'t like is the recent update... I now cannot play my regular levels. I can only do the Titan challenge and the raids... please fix ‚ô°',
       'I really enjoy this game. Being in a powerful alliance really helps. What frustrates me the most is the inability to obtain 6 star characters. I have tried paying for epic summons, nope. Upgraded my Castle and training yard to level 20. Nothing but 3 stat and an occasional (duplicate) 4 star character. I feel like I should be at endgame status by now. I lose Raids often because in the Platinum tier, most people already have all 5 star characters. What\'s the incentive to keep playing?? Tap Sports Baseball 17, for example, give random gifts of high level players that encourages players to continue playing their game.  Please allow us easier access to top tier 5 star characters!!!',
       'You totally ruined the raids.  Now it always puts you against higher players and gives them massive turns.  You messed it up it your newest update. No way to win and totally unbalanced.  You waste massive food never to get anyone your level and lose massive trophies. Bad bad bad',
       'Absolutely love this game but my screen has now gone black after loading. Cant play it any more. Why has this happened? If i uninstall and reinstall will i start all over again? Very unhappy. üòØ Update: restarted tablet and is now working perfectly yeah üòÅ',
       'Serious you are greed monsters. Someonevplays snd plays. To get anything you want people to pay through the nose for total random. Get decent heroes takes either your life or your wallet. Grind do an elemental summon and give the same hero you have. Its randomized to make you play more or fork over tons of cash. Ready to rage quit and not play any of these types  of dumb  games.

     [ 'I really like this game, kind of wish the progression system was a bit quicker though, other than that, the tight controls, open world and variety of creatures you can eat make it a solid game. The special sharks look really cool, and I even considered buying one until I saw the 50$ price tag.   On a side note, what\'s the difference between this app and the Hungry Shark World?',
       'i would rate 5 stars... but.. something with the cloud save broke, i used to have the megalodon, without any cheats.. but now i have the mako. could you fix this somehow? And do i email the support team? Im not good with all the emailing stuff.',
       'My apologies for the negative review lately. But to be honest, I have to use VPN just to log-in in Google Play and enable cloud sync or else, I wouldn\'t be able to sync my progress. Just a little request, can you make the gameplay smoother for lower end devices, such as devices with 1GB RAM? It lags frequently during gameplay. Thanks a lot!',
       'Amazing game. I completed this game in 48 minutes Hahaha! Because I used luckypatcher :) I downloaded the luckypatcher in Googlechrome But it can harm your Device..... And the last shark is Moby dick His baby is as big as Megalodon.',
       'The is the most intense game ever.When you think you\'ve got it ,it\'s gone. Can\'t figure out how to boost. Controls aren\'t the best.Rhis game could improve. Oth er than that it\'s fine I guess.Too many pop up ads. Really frustrating. I want to play the game not look at ads. Sometimes  you can\'t back out of the ad.',
       'I thought it was SUPER DUPER AMAZING. Keep that game like this and don\'t change it.

     [ 'this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates',
       'LOVE this game!! Literally, I don\'t think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it\'s just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move üòú',
       'I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.',
       'A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it\'s really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it.',
       'The game is addictive. Mediocre ratings are because there is a bug. On all games on all levels I\'m getting a network error and I\'m not connected to a network viewing a hint. I have been connected to numerous networks and reset the phone. This needs to be sorted.',
       'Quite addictive and challenging isnt just about solving the puzzle though because requires a certain amount of precision in drawing various shapes that work within the games physics. One mistake and time to restart. Addictive nonetheless and provides some good challenges and perhaps outside the box thinking. Perhaps the drawing tools could be more precise e.g different brush thicknesses? would help but bloody bloody bloody good anyway..' ],

     [ 'The best survivor royale esque game you can find on the play store. Takes up immensely less space than others like Rules of Survival. Anyone can play this, no matter the quality of their phone. It\'s intense solo, duo, and squad gameplay will always have you coming back to take a shot (no pun intended) at another win. An amazing feature is it\'s voice chat communication system. You can talk to your teammates (though unfortunately, I find most players speak Spanish. You may have more luck.) though i wish there was a text chat as well. It will hopefully come in the next update, bur I would definitely recommend getting this game. My only other suggestion is new maps, a night mode, more weapons, and attachments.',
       'I love this game so much, but what about more structures? Also I wish there was a chat in game that you can just type instead of voice chat, also the number one thing I wish you guys could add in or fix is the snipers bc they are weak... also I think there should be a counter somewhere when people dismount the plane so we can Dee how much are still in plane and how much already left  That\'s all',
       'good game. but I think u garena should add more trees, buildings, and others. and I thinks its good if we can play 5-10 players in one team in squad game cause in GUILD the max. members\'re 20 players. sorry for my bad english',
       'Loved this game so much! A tip for dev, You guys might wanna try to block/disable cheaters from the game on the next update though. It\'s starting made this game unjoyable to play anymore. Hope you can see my review, thanks for all the effort you gave to us guys!',
       'Dear GARENA DEV PLEASE DETECT THOSE MOD USER AND BANNED THEM ITS UNFAIR TO US THAT PLAY LEGITIMATELY ON THE BATTLEFIELD WHILE THOSE CHEATERS EASILY TARGETING US... ESP-NO GRASS-NO FOG-AIM BOT... IT WILL MAKE THIS GAME FOR GRANTED IF THIS WILL CONTINUED... bad english',
       'More Update Please.  There\'s a lot of things to repair here. Give more attention to the target pointer, sometimes the avatars body cover the pointer and also the enemies. Give more options on how to communicate easily like putting commands and specially on group battles. Some of vehicles are not functional, like trucks. To be realistic game set-up, all things in the game must be functional, except for those cars like junk. Thank you!!! Salute!!! :)' ],

     [ 'Its an awesome game. The new concept of supercell id is cool but switching is little time taking. I Would request you guys to make it easier or add some shortcut to switch accounts. Because it is really difficult to change if you are in poor network zone. Plz consider this. Otherwise the concept is really good it saves RAM of phone as u dnt need play games and services updated. üòÄ',
       'This is a very good game and I highly recommend it but there are two small changes I would make.    1) I would make it so that you can move the object in your village i.e. trees, rocks as there are afew seasonal decoration that I would like to keep but they are getting in the way of my village.    2) I would also make it so that you can put more then 1 builder on a construction to cut down its time or add more builder.    But other then them 2 changes I think it\'s a great game and I\'ve had lots of fun with it.',
       'The heroes should be for all players from the lower level. They can make their own choice to choose the hero or switch them. If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy? It\'s the strategy game, not for only the big or strong players. Thanks!!...',
       'It is a good family game and it is a way to play with lots of friends and even make some new friends in your clan. It does not take lots of money to complete they game it only takes skill and dedication. I have played this game for years and have had many different accounts on it, but you just have to dedicate your self to one on those accounts to get a good high level account',
       'What happened to the game I used to enjoy? Now everything is turning into a spam fest. Strategy has been consistently removed from the game with each update. BH still has a bunch of AI issues. For the first time ever (as a max 11 and misc other accounts) I can honestly say uninstalling has crossed my mind.',
       'Coc is on the first place in my games list. It is very addictive and enjoyable. I am looking forward till the day town hall 12 comes. I am not much happy with SUPERCELL ID thing. Because it is not much easy to use. I recommend using the normal GOOGLE PLAY sign in method because it is much more appropriate for me. Overall COC have become my life. I also recoomend to have a time limit for coc, like coc automatically switch off if the user plays coc more than 1 hour. Long Live COC!' ],

     [ 'Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?',
       'This game is pretty good, for the most part. The only problem is the bots you go upagainst are  way to hard. I can never win. I would have gave them 5 stars but I gave them 4 stars because of the bots. And the game is kinda hard to control. When I move backwords on a veichel it goes up.',
       'I would have given this game a higher review than three that I have given it, the problem is that I have noticed a problem when trying to save some money. For me at least when trying to save money through the daily giveaway/present of playing the game everyday it has stolen money from me discreetly whenever I get around the 1000 coin mark sometimes it is one hundred sometimes I have lost 400 with no explanation as to where the money is. It is for this reason that I have lowered my rating. (Besides the disappearing money I enjoyed the game.)',
       'The physics is very hard to grasp leading to many fails and the bots often drive backwards and forwards until they can drive up onto my head. There\'s also no start timer, leading to the bot ramming into me before I can figure out what\'s happening. Great with human opponents, however single player makes me want to throw my phone out of my window. Great concept, horrible execution.',
       'This Game is really fun but the Spicky car is really stupid because it\'s so easy to die... really stupid... but other than that, the games awesome and I got the fist car thing but when I want to use it I can\'t find it üòë... the games the büí£mb. But the update I don\'t have so you should probably not get the update because people are complaining about it. AND ALSO ...CARS KEEP SPAWNING ON TOP OF MY CAR KILLING ME!!',
       'I hate this game it makes me so stressed and the AI is rigged also the David and Goliath mission i try to win they win 5 out of 5 of the first 5 matches and I\'m afk they win 4 out of the first 5 matches this is f@#$ing stupid P.S impossible to get new cars the machines just gobble up your coins like the game where you try to grab a plush toy but it always fails because it\'s rigged' ],

     [ 'They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It\'s definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you\'ll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.',
       'Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don\'t be fooled. This is a pay to win game.',
       'I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that\'s cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!',
       'Game plays fine. No ability to choose mode is a major letdown. I did the $20 test to see if you can actually buy anything valuable. The answer is no. The game is geared towards the have money people. Update 2/23/2018  The queing is under 10 seconds. After Lunar New Year update you can earn upgrades better.  Discounts on purchase items is better.',
       'This game was great until about 5 days ago, that is when it started to take 4 to 5 minutes loading time for each game mode to start. Now my attention span prevents me from waiting that long to play one game. What happened game developers?.... !!UPDATE!! Okay it must have just been the servers. Because they\'re back up and running at 32 seconds loading time for a war. This game is great. I can dig it can you dig it',
       'I totally like the game and all but there must be balance between different robots especially..... some robots have a big advantage like the haechi with 3 medium slots and its dash ability.. its like u cant even aim at it......  Also please remove the components so that everyone is able to buy newer robots... u can make them available in gold or silver or even workshop points' ],

     [ 'I got a new phone and I did transfer everything and it transfer my game but it started at the beginning again  I put alot of money on this game.I need it back can some please tell me how to get my game back or money I spent over close to 200 dollars on this game is so addictive. I don\'t get it cause I thought all my games save on Google or facebook all my other games are were there left off so please tell me I didnt waste all that money to start from the begining. I made this comment like 5 days ago I emailed provider of game waited 2 days then called Google only for them to tell me I need to get in touch with the game provider. Then I sent another email with purchases I did and my email and my phone number and nobody still has got back to me or commented on my review. So what do I do now my patience is running out. I even called the number that Google has provided for me for the provider and all I get is a voicemail which I cannot leave a voicemail.',

       'Really liked this when I first started playing. Honestly,there is no point me keeping it now. Can\'t perform my operations,as don\'t have bought staff and ward not on the appropriate level. I can\'t get any new staff,as I don\'t have enough hearts,and once you are at a standstill like this it take FOREVER to earn hearts back. Have loads of cash but nothing to do with it!! Game seems to be designed around getting people hooked initially (as performing operations etc is really fun), but then can\'t continue or progress without purchasing hearts!! Not wasting my time with it any longer.',
       'Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I\'ll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx' ],

     [ 'The gameplay is unique and challenging and fun but this game feels like a demo as all the other game modes (PvP , co-op etc) are locked for free users. And you can\'t even use checkpoints without paying them( like SERIOUSLY?!) So once the game is over you have to start all over again if you are a free user. Apart from that this game definitely deserves a try from people looking for casual , relaxing yet challenging gameplay.',
       'Great game This is a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing aesthetics and highly addictive. Totally worth the $2 for the premium version. I do have one problem though: even though I am pretty decent at the game, Google Play won\'t give me any achievements even though I\'m sure I have earned some. It won\'t even let me open achievements or leaderboard pages. Is anybody else having this issue?',
       'Smash Hit Smash hit is awesome because it has a lot of intensity in the game so I get to let my brain work a little.  It kinda let your brain decide if your should hit it or not. I also really like this game because the game is kinda hard so it challenges me a little bit. So who ever made this game I appreciate it. One more thing about Smash Hit is that it brings my family together because we take turns playing the game to let our brain think. Thank You!',
       'BEST GAME EVER... Love this game,  a must have on every phone.. Well worth the price, amazing graphics.. Also bought the VR version truly unbelievable. Just 1 wee problem... When you reach infinity there is not a lot of glass to smash for extra balls which is a must have especially when it goes super fast.  Thankyou and keep up the great work..',
       'Spectacular Shockingly Good Game This game is addicting and amazing who thought breaking glass could be so fun. I mean somebody thought of something random when they made this. I I love it it is just so amazing. If only the person who thought of it made the game so that you didn\'t have to pay for some stuff like extra levels. Still if you\'re reading this and you\'re questioning if you should download this or not you definitely should.! üòâüòÄ‚ò∫',
       'I love this game.  It\'s very simple, just go without getting hit by glass or running out of balls, but it is a lot harder than it sounds.  I am forever telling myself I have time for just one more attempt, it is very addicting.  The 3d design on this is amazing and creative.  Up at the top it says to write a SHORT review, so this will end here.' ],

I hope my tears will help u guys. :)',
       'Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it\'s just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............',
       'For this game to be so simple compared to todays games and grafics, I love it. I spend hours sometimes playing this.  Not to mention they keep upgrading and making it beter and better, keep it up fellas....i havent experienced any of the problems mentioned withthe updates others have but until then great game',
       'Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!',
       'Its a very good game without any tension of wining any difficult task...I like it very much and its not much addicting I have played many games but its very different. controls are also good but this game needs some practice . I am enjoying this game because the tasks are not very difficult but at the same time not very easy its a perfect game and the main character of the game is very funny he always sleeps in the vehicle.....so finally.... I like this game very much',
       'At first I wasn\'t sure how good the game was but after playing it several times on Android and Windows 8.1 phone, I like it.  It doesn\'t weigh down on the phone\'s processing power. A very addictive game!! Give it go.' ],

     [ 'Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!',
       'Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can\'t just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can\'t advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it\'s basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.',
       'Love this game, its an addictive time killer. But I would like to have replays and not sure if it\'s only my device because I haven\'t seen other reviews about it but it doesn\'t have an accurate count of flips, my friend counted 11 and it said 3.5 I do many more (yes at one time, before landing) and it still says 3, 3.5, 4',
       'In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it\'s newer it\'s boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star',
       'This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said "add break". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them.',
       'The game desparately needs to offer more coins as skill level increases.  The frequency of coins remains the same while the skill level demands more and more coins (in the thousands).  Watching ads helps, but the player finds themselves doing that exclusively, which defeats the purpose of the game.  Physics, graphics and gameplay are good.' ],

       'Such a shame that the makers of this game are greedy. This is an awesome game with some great stories but unfortunately you need diamonds to make alot of decisions and you don\'t get given many as they want you to buy them.  So there\'s no way you can play the game properly. The diamonds are so over priced. If they were cheaper I might be inclined to buy them. So with regret I\'m going to have to delete this game. Greedy people thanks for ruining what could have been a fun game.',

It has been nearly ten month of my being connected with Choices, and I can still say that it would last for a much longer time. Keep going Choices team.',
       'This game is Fantastic only problem is that the Diamonds and keys are too expensive. I LOVE the stories specially The highschool Story but still with the same problem of overpricing the ingame currency. I purchased some diamonds just to support your spectacular game but please try to make the game a bit more affordable so it feels more rewarding at the end knowing that you didn\'t spend a fortune on one story when there\'re countless beautiful stories. Thanks for creating this game that lets me step out of the boundaries of Reality.',

Please make an update where you can move these things while pets are out, or get my pet unstuck for me. Otherwise I won\'t be able to continue the game due the the inconvenience it\'s making.

     [ 'lnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'I love the game play and graphics. But I payed for adidas female clothing and an aquarium previously on the game, and then when I restarted, they have gone. I spend ¬£3 on it in total and I actually spent more money on other things that didn\'t come back in the next game, but it\'s understandable because they were lifestyle points and you know it\'s currency not clothing or furniture. I uninstall sims sometimes a bit of always go back and before my items were there, but now they\'re not and that really frustrated me. I actually ended up in 2017 spending  ¬£10 on sims freeplay and that\'s the only money I think I will ever spend on ot now because if you restart,  you don\'t get anything you wanted. Please fix this because I spent that money and I could\'ve bought something else with it but I didn\'t because I like sims.',
       'First, I don\'t like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don\'t like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you\'re just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!',
       'Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools "playable",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it\'d be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.',
       'Unless the devs see to this problem, I will not bring ratings back to 5 stars. One of my sims suddenly vomit on the skateboard ramp after skating & now I can\'t clean the vomit up because I end up pressing on the \'skate\' action instead. The vomit puddles are ugly but I can\'t remove it. I need some help here!!!!',
       'Love it addictive,if u like the sims on the pc you will like this.If you are a patient person you don\'t need to spend money either. Update it has lost stars as I don\'t want to spend money and now you need vip to get to the next stages of things. Disappointed with this. If you didn\'t have to pay for anything it would be 5 stars.' ],

     [ 'I got to the Moon my second launch! Fun game for doing a launch while waiting for the bus etc. It\'s simple and I like it! Couldn\'t figure out how to decouple my boosters simultaneously. Very nice work on this app! It\'s KSP but mobile version very cool! The music is cool too! My suggestion is to add some reentry heat affects, more sounds like parachute opening sound, etc but I\'m sure that\'s on your list.',
       'So I\'ve been playing the game for a couple of months now. i think that there is an awesome game here, with already plenty to do. I do also think that there is lots of room and need to improve upon this. As I have been playing for a while, I do notice it becomes quite challenging to escape orbit with enough fuel to make it to other planets, like mars. i do recommend you add a cheats section that you can enable in the settings, with unlimited fuel, larger build space, indestructable rockets, etc. I also recommend more bits and pieces for building, like bigger and more powerful thrusters, or air vents for turning in space. For later development, a satellite system would be much appreciated, as well as a little spaceman that you can control when docked at a space station, or when you\'re on a planet. Thank you for an awesome game!!!',
       'I love this game, i\'ve been landed surface in every celestial object few times, included Sun. I also recommendation to other friends in forum to play it.  But, I want suggest to add some simulation like : - Rotation planet. - Perihelion/Aphelion. - Perigee/Apogee.  And also some feature : - List for delete few space trash like empty booster in orbit. - Name rocket every launch (it make fun & realistic).  Thank You',
       'I am so addicted to this game. I love everything about it. I just wish there was a place to donate to you (developer). Also, I would love it if there were more rocket parts. Also, I wish there was a thermosphere you had to get through to get on planets. All in all, I love it! Can\'t get enough!  Edit: Thank you so much for the reply. I\'m sorry I wasn\'t clear on the thermosphere part, but i think the reentry effect would be lovely. I just can\'t stop playing. And I\'m SOOOO excited about rovers and things! Thank you so much again! :)',
       'Bee looking for a game like for my entire years ! this is the best rocket game, I have ever seen in my life travelling to space , I like the sound system , formation of building materials is compatible ,graphics are excellent to the 2D platform . I like the physics of the game. Please keep it , ur the best Space programmer of all times (GOAT). Is it possible to add a space shuttle and moon rover ?    Regards. Please fix up batrrey issues . my phone heats up a lot .',
       'I absolutely love this game, but I keep having a bug where either the close up or the tragectory map goes completely black so I can\'t see or control what I\'m doing. It started  becoming more frequent after a few days and even after uninstalling and downloading again the problem persists. Please fix this! Everything else is amazing: the gameplay, the allowed creativity and the ease with which one can learn new techniques.' ],

     [ 'Meh, it\'s ok. It would be better if you could have ALL the rooms though. It kinda defeats the point of making the game free in the first, place. Anyway, i think i came across a glitch... So i was playing the game and i went downstairs. Then there was a button that said: "Unlock All Rooms For 20 Minutes!" So i clicked it and my game crashed. The button still shows up when i play the game tho. What do i do?',

It won\'t give the  ad to unlock all floors. I already answer the question but it won\'t give the ad. Because of that I\'m started to hate this f***ing games. If you repairs it I gonna love this game only if you repairs it. Please repairs it before I sue you. My father was a policeman.',

The whole game main screen becomes unresponsive and stays like that no matters the game is restarted or the damn phone is. Get this thing sorted out Miniclip. You have a reputation to maintain or not?',
       'At first I was skeptical about this game. I had downloaded it and went without playing for a couple of weeks. Then,one day I just happen to open the app and play. Best move I ever made for an app! This game is just flat out addicting, fun and challenging.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much fun it is and that there is, most of the time, something new.  Chalkenign friends and new people always makes for a challenging and fun time waster. Even if I don\'t have the time to play, I still make time!! Haha',

       'Uninstalled and reinstalled app because the update made it to where the game was unplayable. Went to login, using Facebook credentials. It says it failed because I would not allow them access to my friends list. Something doesn\'t seem right about that. Never had a game NOT allow me to login, after denying access to my friends list. Sorry, would prefer you not send messages to all my friends with my name tagged on it.',

     [ 'It is  great game, for ages 10 and up even 9 is okay. It is cool that we are building a town from scratch, like from the prehistoric time, and building our way up. Not like other game that start you off with big present day buildings. It doesn\'t cost a lot to do things like building and removing things, some object are free, they give the right amount of money and you can always win some more diamonds. In other games you would have to pay to remove object and buildings are ridiculously expensive.  It is hard to make money in other games and to make diamonds. I personally at night put my hunters too make things that take 8 hours and in the day things that take 5 to 15 minutes but sometimes 1hour. It is a very good game, it is almost as a real life city town, empire.',

     [ 'A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it\'s a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you\'ve done them and reached level 10 on both, there\'s really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.',
       'Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I\'ve basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I\'ve got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.',
       'Be cool if there is boosts. Example if you get 3 perfect you get a free auto perfect boost or something. Also plz add a line of code to stop people from the date/time bug abuse - save current time to file. Player won\'t get money till that last input time has passed.  Also be cool to spend the coins on boosts',
       'Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot\'s more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn\'t bother me that much. 5 stars for the team',
       'It\'s a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the \'colony\' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you',
       'Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!!

     [ 'Good, with a major flaw I\'ve ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I\'ll tap, and the game won\'t register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I\'m on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I\'ve closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It\'s an issue I\'d like to see fixed.',
       'I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance',
       'Great simple game with AMAZING colours‚ù§ I love this...dead simple and fun. It took me ages to work out how to unlock the new skins...click on the banner that has the amount of diamonds you\'ve collected and what looks like 3 sheets on top of one another  (it comes up before you press the start key...)',
       'A Great Game For When You\'re Dumpin\'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin\' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I\'m in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren\'t too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I\'m happy to say that. I don\'t like to stay too long. Great game!',
       'So,  basically it\'s a pretty fun app to play when you\'re bored. It\'s a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It\'s a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don\'t really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!',
       'Some faults Overall a simple yet addictive game. Too many ads. The game ends and instantly an ad appears and your still hitting the screen so you automatically click an ad. I\'m sure advertisers don\'t want to pay for a click that was purely a mistake. Also the leader board has people on 5000 points. I can\'t get past 78 after a lot of playing so I can\'t see 5000 points is scored without a hack.' ],

I do believe giving an emergency C-section for an illegal is a bit much for a story line, but whatever. Totally makes sense. I love how we\'re able to take care of the premies and foster them until they\'re adopted! 6/10 - Would play again if bored.',

It\'s enjoyable to see people have the ability to buy what I worked so hard during the last 3 years for a mere $10. I haven\'t enjoyed this game in months, it\'s a chore to still play. Download only if you\'re willing to drop a fortune.',
       'WTH HAS HAPPENED?? Been playing for 3+ years and have NOT EVER seen the game "rolling" system so broken. I have not rolled anything worth a $$@ in almost 3 MONTHS. Don\'t give me the it\'s random thing. I have never had anything like this until after an update a couple months back. You have obviously changed the system and it is apparently to screw the long timers in favor of generating more $$ but it\'s only making long timers like me BORED and frustrated!! I\'m not spending any more money until it\'s fixed. Tired of wasting cash!',
       'I\'ve been playing for almost 4 years and CC used to be better before you could purchase top level heroes. IGG really sucked what little competitive nature was left in the game out with pay to win. If you want to spend money on a game and still be competitive, play Summoners War instead.',
       'nice game for the others saying that this is a copy of coc it has a lot of difference this game is more easy to play than coc. coc is a hard game more time o upgrade more time on things in this in only 5 m its fast becouse it is free and you already have a hero if you start the game in coc you ned to be th lvl 7 to get it or 8 idk but dont say that coc an cc is the same becouse your wrong of saying that they are the same (^_^)',
       'What stands out the most from other games of this type for me is that you get heroes and that you don\'t lose fighters in battle unless they die whereas in other games like clash of clans you lose all you fight with regardless. Plus it\'s just an incredibly addictive game that you can do well with even if you don\'t spend any money.',

Never win anything and the bet cost is so high that after a couple spins 100k coins are gone! Please please please do something!',
       'I do very well when I play as guest! Not so well with my FB account! It would be wonderful if you would loosen up a little and offer the 1 item I need in several map rooms! But I do love playibg Bingo Blitz xx',
       'Bingo Blitz rigs games in boost levels. If certain power ups are in play and you have boosted cards the game is stacked against you. Will will not get a bingo with a 2x power up playing in legendary boost. The company knows, this was brought to their attention. They resolved it by blocking everyone from commenting on their FB page who publicly spoke out about the rigging. Do not buy credits, do not get sucked into this game. You will regret it.',
       'Since the game updated i cant play its black blocks. This is very bad and i love this game. Im very unhappy. I contacted support without any results. This the reason for my low rate sorry',
       'This game sucks! Only play to waste time. Bingos go ridiculously fast and not given enough chips to play properly. Might have to uninstall.',

       'I like playing this game although i find that male characters do not have many long hair/ girl hair options available to buy unless you are vip or have diamonds. I think i speak for many people when i say that boys and girls should have more hair options from the opposite sex, for starcoins, as some people may take offense if they are strictly only allowed "boys hair"/ "girls hair" unlsss they are paying for it. I think you could inmprove further by making it easier to earn starcoins and another way to earn diamonds because many people do not want to/ cannot afford to BUY items in a fictional world.. Overall, i think this is a well rounded game, with a few improvement points, however i enjoy being able to have my own unique style in a virtual world :)',

     [ 'Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.',
       'Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you\'re given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.',
       'The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item.',
       'Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.',
       'Game is fun until you run out of lives. Then you either pay money or watch a video. I\'m ok watching an ad to get extra things, but just to play the game? Disappointing.',
       'It is inexcusable to allow ads to make such noise when both my phone is in silent mode AND I have the sound off in the game settings! I went over other reviews and the developers wanted to know which ads. Seriously?! How about all of them?! They have to be aware yet refuse to fix the problem. Do not download this intrusive app. Also I get a migraine with the annoying "Ready? Let\'s go!" voice when the sound is on.' ],

Nothing but kids and teenagers talking about sex and asking for nude pics of each other on Instagram. If you can block all that out, more power to you, and enjoy what would probably be a pretty fun game otherwise. I tried it for a few days and am uninstalling it for the reasons I mentioned above.',

But I think it is completely ridiculous that you have to wait 4 hours for more passes.  Overall,  if you don\'t mind waiting and are a very patient person then I do recommend this app for you.  However if patience is a virtue you don\'t have then you should find a different app.',
       'Great app, just too many of the same type "romance" stories over and over again. It feels like only one person is writing stories on here, when It claims to have over 55,000 different stories. Each time i try to search for a new book to read a new, the same twelve pop up over and over. Fix that please. I very much enjoy supporting community made books but it seems like it\'s just a popularity contest on here, with the same story line and plots being used far too much.',

I have gems and so many story progresses I need to keep. Please help! üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠',

Still haven\'t been emailed back since last time. It\'s been three days with the app messing up.',

     [ 'This is a very entertaining game that is simple to play. It has provided me with hours of fun! The only thing is that I wish there were more combinations, there are things I\'ve tried that you\'d think would make something but don\'t. For example, Crayon (or Pencil, or Charcoal, or Paint) + Paper does not make Art.',
       'The interface is not so good. Big icons are not convenient, we have to scroll down long everytime, I could only imagine how much effort would it take if I had 500 items discovered. Please make icons small or a different tab just for icons or just make it like little alchemy one.',
       'This game is pretty addicting. I get stuck sometimes but I always find something new.  Small issue though, I it won\'t let me pull rust out onto the screen for some reason. I\'ve used it before, but now it won\'t let me use it anymore. Perhaps it is an issue with my phone rather than a glitch in the app.',
       'This is leagues better than the original alchemy game. There were a lot of bugs but they\'ve all more or less been patched out. It took me 2 months of playing everyday to get all of the items and combinations cleared.',
       'I love this game so much. I\'m stuck on trying to make life but it\'s not frustrating it\'s challenging and I like it. Also, for all the people getting pissed off because the items disappear and you cant \'use\' them anymore it\'s because you can\'t combine them with anything anymore so it is put in your encyclopedia so that doesn\'t waste space for the things you can use, it\'s actually a very smart game mechanic. I\'m pretty sure it even says that in the tutorial.

     [ 'The 30 host cap immediately becomes pretty difficult to work around, especially when you need to have duplicates of the  hosts to increase their max level cap/attribute score as well as duplicates of hosts for hat colours. I\'m hoping there\'s a way to increase this later in the game. Also, synthblood is incredibly difficult to obtain especially when you need more to fix higher level hosts. Overall though, the game is pretty generous with currency, so I don\'t think I\'ve ever ran into a hard building wall that made me think I had to spend money on it to progress further. So far, I\'m enjoying the game and looking forward to the updates',
       'I\'m very happy to have stumbled upon this game to satiate my cravings while I wait for season 2. I am enjoying this game so far. It keeps me hooked at a comfortable distance, not demanding. I love the quirky animations, the charming stylized set and character designs. My only qualm about the gameplay is the waiting time in Diagnostics. I thought spending 40gems for an additional host slot would mean two hosts being diagnosed at the same time. Instead I find out the 40gems was for the que. Also I\'m confused about the Escalante Technician daily task. I have completed the test in the church and yet the system is not rewarding me for it. Is there a particular test in Escalante that I have to do? Anyway great job to the game devs!',
       'Pros: 1. Good design and SFX 2. Balanced currency and gameplay 3. Detailed and reasonably complex  Cons: 1. Unnecessary level cap (level 25). I noticed that after reaching level 25, no additional exp is received for doing stuff.  I hope this level cap is removed, as there are still Escalante missions that require level 30, 35,..., 50 to take part in.  I feel like I am wasting my time and effort by catering on hosts when my supposed XP for those actions are neglected simply because the limit is at level 25 right now, when it should be at 50.  Please fix this, I really like playing this game. But because of this premature level capping, I\'m afraid this would significantly lessen my motivation in playing and spending on the game. Thanks.',
       'Great game and pretty entertaining.',
       'So far so good. Few glitches but its fine.',
       'im stuck on the loading screen and im at level 13. overall its a pretty good game. but it lacks something. may i suggest: trait inheritance of a target host. sending gift/social points shouldnt restart from the top. warehouse to an inactive host human worker characters hard swipe to change location/map delos room upgrades' ],

     [ 'This game is awesome but here are the things like really want in the next game. 1. I need to disconnect with Google play to delete my old saved progress full of mistakes. Please add this feature. 2. Zombies are too hard to beat . Please decrease some of their capabilities. 3. There must be an increase in chest slots . 4. Please decrease the quantity of wood logs to cook. Otherwise all of our hardworking to gather logs while be replaced by only a few meats and others. 6. Please add another source of getting seeds. They are too hard to get.',
       'The game is ok.. i love the idea.. but in all RPG and similar games you can accuire your items from when you died from your body in that zone.. also its good when you enter the inventory to pause the game.. when entering a zone the game should give some time before reseting the material and monsters if the player re-enters the same zone.. These are the most critical points so far i have encountered.. please take these in consideration.. thank you',
       '16 energy to move to the nearest forest!! Don\'t expect to build your house or collect resources in a day. This game has potential, but the energy spent to move to a forest is just too much that after an hour you would have to spend money to get energy just to collect resources. It\'s a shame that the gameplay is really smooth but the game is focused on making you pay to win/build in the first hour.',
       'As I have not heard of this game (it showed up in my recommendations), I would like to say that this game is beautiful! I do recommend other people to play it. The graphics are highly amazing and basic control is outstanding! I love the idea on how you can pick up items that you put down and rearrange your base the way you want it. Although, I did have several connection issues, but overall everything is in tiptop condition. Keep up the good work!',
       'Quite the gem. Kinda surprising to find a ftp title with actual depth on mobile but so far it\'s great. Looking forward to more updates on the future. Also, to those complaining about energy costs to move to other zones, that\'s only to run there as you can travel (albeit slower) for free of you choose. Not to mention you can speed up this process through crafting later on.',
       'This game\'s great, I loved it until I saw the ammount of energy it costs to travel to the nearest forest. Could you try and fix this and anything else that the reviewer asked? The game\'s even better than Last Day on Earth, it\'s like a zombie survival in the middle ages, just make some improvements and this\'ll be the best survival game in Play Store' ],

Unfortunately it\'s built around microtransactions so if you\'re feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don\'t understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it\'s likely you\'re going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren\'t aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don\'t expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!',
       'I love this game! One thing though, I believe that there are too many plants that cost real money to get.

Besides that, this is a really great game!',

       'It\'s honestly a fun game, and I\'d love to use it as a stimulating activity (ah, who am I kidding, it\'s just a great time killer), but it makes my head hurt-- and that\'s a problem. I\'m not even the type of person that is negatively affected by fast-paced graphics or rapidly changing colors. It\'d be five stars if it didn\'t give me headaches, but, for now, it gets three; good graphics, smooth gameplay, but no matter how great the app, it isn\'t worth physical discomfort. (Note: if you are looking for something similar, try "Run". It has the same sort of concept, but without the advertisements and headaches.)',

Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don\'t get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don\'t mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!' ],

     [ 'This is the best life simulator game by far. Instead of just focusing on getting rich this game has many other focuses like love, nationality, jobs, kids etc. The one thing that isn\'t at all necessary but I kind of want to see is a avatar for the character you\'re playing as. Perfect game. üòÅüëç  EDIT: hi just reporting on a glitch in the game. There\'s an option to transition your gender bit even though my character is over 18 they can\'t do it. Otherwise still a perfect game.',
       'I think it\'s incredible and I am hooked. Although I do hope for more such as, instead of just instagram famous, perhaps become a famed scientist, actor, writer, astronaut or business person OR be known as beloved (or not so) Educator/Teacher etc. A bit more drama added with partner/children good and not so good. Varying reactions to their dilemmas, perhaps even a child dating, married, having a child (grandkids) and other random child updates with or without the option to react accordingly. Overall, addictive and thoughtful game.',
       'Hi - playing this game for a few months now and a big fan. I suggested during beta phase that there should be an option of money management as well. We can be a millionaire but dont know what to do with all that liquid. We should be able to invest in moveable and immoveble assets. Should be able to open a company/business and invest in other company\'s stocks etc. This game will be even more interesting that way. Hope we will see these features soon. Thanks.',
       'I have been playing through the beta phase, and am completely hooked. You can pick it up and play whenever the mood strikes. It is easy to grasp, every new life is different, and it is engrossing without being addictive. Once you\'re done with a life you can create a new one or close the app and move on with your real one. There is no waiting for something to build or happen, there are very few ads and most are by choice to gain something. There are no in-app purchases to enhance game play, its all there from the beginning. The developers have done an incredible job with a simple concept.',
       'First of all, congratulations on the full release! I\'ve been playing this game for a few months now and I\'m absolutely hooked. Whenever I\'m bored or don\'t want to use my phone\'s data, I just play this game. There are a few things that I think would be cool to add in or go more in depth with, but other than that, this game is borderline perfect! I reccomend downloading',
       'It\'s simple in design and gameplay but not boring. Much better than other life simulator games.  I\'ve been playing this since while it was in beta and enjoyed it more with each improvement and update. I\'m looking forward to what else they add.  My only problem with it is job selection is boring and there is no way to save the current life you\'re in in case you want to come back to it at a later time.' ],

     [ 'This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn\'t as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn\'t there but now it\'s forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.',
       'Seems like controls tend to be problematic, and synchronisation has to be adjusted for every song. However the game is wonderful, precise, compelling and worth spending time on! Everything is well thought, new levels and lines are frequently added. So far my favourite app ever, looking forward to playing some new levels and the match option.',
       'I really wish you guys didn\'t update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can\'t listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!',
       'Amazing game... Loved it...üòç The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it\'ll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it\'s okay üòä',
       'It\'s an amazing game. Sure I run around my bedroom screening every time I fail next to the end.... but there is something about this game that makes you happy. Is it the music? Maybe. Is it the back ground and the way it moves?possibly. It\'s all of those things plus more   In a nut shell I really really really really really really really really really love this game :p',
       'Good songs. That\'s about it. The hitbox detection and lag spikes are horrific, the checkpoint system is a blatant cash grab, and what annoys the most is that the timing of music+taps (the core mechanic of the game) is completely broken. It is significantly easier to play the game with audio off, so that you don\'t get distracted by the miss timed turns. Doesn\'t even fulfill it\'s most basic selling point. Atrocious.' ],

The only things I don\'t like is that you have to buy the full version for $5, alhough if it was entirely free I\'d probably get bombarded by ads.. A fun game, nonetheless!',
       'Unique offering by Infinite .. I haven\'t seen a game like this before nor did I expect to .. you form a pot as it spins on a pottery wheel. You can widen it, narrow it, make it taller or shorter. The goal of the game becomes forming pots as per Aunt Chloe\'s instructions and then painting it as she dictates. You send the pot to her for cash.. and more pots to make. The controls are decent but a bit quirky at times when trying to form the pot.',
       'Fantastic and very creative game... I give it 4 stars... And leave 1 star only because its brushes are not free after african.... it is my humble request to developers that please provide some more brushes for free....

Moreover, it will be addictive if say for eg. after scorring 10,000, 30,000.. coins, more features can be unlock. And yah, it will be fabulous if we can update more facilities. But now, after earning more coins, I want to uninstell it because there is no more options left, no more reasons to play.',
       'The only reason why I hate this game is because: you want us to purchase the whole entire game without even allowing us to try out the other designs which I find ridiculous and yet with such a beautiful game why would you withhold the other amazing designs from us?

     [ 'GAH! They\'ve over complicated this game with unnecessary graphics and gifts and prizes etc. I couldn\'t even figure out how to get into the levels for a while haha. I\'m sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn\'t want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn\'t change it. Uninstalled after 1 day.',
       'Caution! Needed access to my personal files including photos to play the game.  I denied and could not start the game unless it had access. Uninstalling after this review.  Don\'t let programmers and hackers get a hold of your personal files!',
       'Graphics are good, game play can be lame at times when you get birds that are incapable of completing the level. You can\'t buy the game and that bothers me. I spent $20, (to support the effort) but am trying to keep it at that.  Others have spent $100 and more. Greed ruins this game. Just finished a level that was designed to be beat only by spending money. Spent hours trying but finally paid and beat it. The game play is not consistent. If you have a bad day it will let you win, if you\'re winning, suddenly an opponent that should never be able to beat you, kicks your ass when you\'ve played perfectly.',
       'Gone to -3 Stars, since last update. The game is so hard that u can\'t even win the 2nd round in Arena without using spells!!! (Tower of fortune) is not more than a joke!!! Pig\'s gonna catch u in the very 2nd floor 6/7 times in a week. Hope that rovio think about the loyal players once, not only money!!! Going to uninstall if the bug not removed till next update!!!',
       'This game literally "cheats" as you get stronger. No, not challenging, it cheats. Can\'t tell you how many times I\'ve dropped a bomb or solid rock on a tiny piggies head only for it to roll around and laugh at me. Picking cards and the elevator game are obviously rigged, and I\'ve been kicked out of challenges/arena AFTER winning only to have to start over (most of the time after spending gems and spell cards) I will find another game to spend my time and money on. Thank you very much!',
       'This last update wiped my game progress , i lost all my gems pearls and spells ... needless to say im pretty ticked. I have spent alot of REAL money on the game to get where i was and i highly doubt the developers will make good on their mistakes' ],

     [ 'Fut can not be developed with this building team. Football is one of the most attractive games but how this fut goes? In Vs attack mode, what the hell meaning do chances have? Players must creat chances by themselves not the game. You must let them play whole game and create the chances by themselves. EA is a big builder in football games and develop a lot but have you ever thought how your fut only stands at this place?',
       'The game is nice for every football fan.... Nice controls and good graphics...events are awesome... There r different game modes.. the only thing that I don\'t like after the recent update is that while playing campaign mode there are many stages which requires u to be in certain lvl in VS mode.... I think both the modes should be independent.. otherwise it\'s a fabulous game... The most awesome football game in play store right now.',
       'overall its an awesome game great experience. but Its hard for free to play players to complete and go through the events..... the icons are too difficult to get please make them a bit earlier to get, it will be awesome to have them in the team.... its difficult to get elite players in a pack of 500 fp totw pack n few others packs too... the vs attack mode is great.... EA please make sure that the free to play players to get a good experience of getting new and better players....',
       'Very good game , addictive..I love to play this game.. Events are fun.. But not at all happy with the team hero, if you play for 3 month also you won\'t be able to proceed further.. Very very slow process, icons are very much hard to get It will be much better if individual player stats added like goals, passes. It will be more fun if you guys fix it',
       'Fifa mobile is a soccer game that lets you be a manager and manage the best team. This game have well made graphics and gameplay. The events are fun, campaigns are exciting and attack vs attack are addicting but, no games are perfect in this case it is hard for free to player to complete the team hero event and daily microtransaction are needed. I hope EA will adress this issue.',
       'It\'s a good game and very addictive but I don\'t like how the number of fans resets at the end of a VS Attack season. It makes it very hard to progress and I am not enjoying it as much as before. The team hero and icons events are very hard to win and I think they should be made a bit easier for the players. Would have given 5 stars if it wasn\'t for this.' ],

     [ 'I really enjoy this game, but I have found a flaw in the design. The game speeds up as you go and after a point it doesn\'t go faster, but after around 10,000 you notice the ball start to move forward on the screen and after about 20,000 you don\'t even have to move the ball to not die. It just misses the spikes. I know you might be thinking Its not on the leaderboards, but that\'s my next complaint. Im currently 6 on the leaderboards, but I\'ve gotten a better score and it won\'t update. I quite frankly destroyed that score and it doesn\'t show up. Thank you for your time and I hope this helped',
       'Game is great, far too many ads, after each level AND major issues with the videos giving rewards. I watched 4 and only received 1 reward which makes the game unfair and not worth playing.',

The game is incredibly fast paced so you can play up to about 4 games in 10 minutes. It\'s never boring and always keeps you on your toes. Both sides are fun.

First it is really hard to earn alot of money in one go of a match. Also why cant we gain experincw after a match instead of having to pay. The price to upgrade gadgets is way to overpriced.

It includes a sniper rifle that does triple the damage that the starter sniper does, as well as 250k cash and 100 gold and a ton of tokens.',

Otherwise it\'s a fun game, but you won\'t get past the ads for too long without uninstalling likely.',

The only down side is that the spins cost alot of coins and those coins can be hard to earn. So 4.5 stars i would rate it is that was a option but its not so i rate it a a big fat 5',
       'this game is the bomb. it is stupid that they asked you is this game beautiful, of course not, people die, and crack their necks, backs, and shoulder blades. This game all in all soooooooo fun and you should totally get it. just say no if you want to write a reaport on this game because it will ask you is this game is beautiful which it is not. GOOD LUCK, good  night, new york city. at late night talk show with stephen colebert......jk',
       'Would rate give starts, but the amount of ads is absolutely ridiculous. I\'m actually thinking about uninstalling please fix that. I know you want players to pay but in all actuality, it\'s quite stupid. Anyway, I do believe the game is quite fun',
       'I  am still going to keep this game but it definitely need a new update like Flip Master which is way better. On Flip Master you can upgrade your characters  So they are better and have more skill but on here they stay the same. The last time I got the game it was fun but this time the characters are stiff and you can hardly do any flips. Definitely keeping Flip Master as my favourite!  Fun game for people who: Want to mess around Need a game that doesn\'t take to much skill Need a game to to pass five minutes  Everyone who likes this game should definitely get Flip Master because overall it is so much better! Hope my advice helped for future updates',
       'Whatever they did last update broke the game for me, this is why I never buy anything in these games. No way to contact anyone to resolve any problems.  Game gets boring anyway',
       'I love this game a lot. The only problem is that when you do the Dailey spin, you only get like coins. And then with the coins you can buy another spin which is what I do. And I get even more coins. It\'s really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and' ],

It would be nice if there was background music of some kind and a glass breaking sound effect when you went through each barrier something pleasing to the ears  Oh and shorter ads would also probably be good.  It could also use more roads and balls and barriers to work towards. I feel like this game has a lot of potential though hope it keeps being updated.',

I would be happy to email the video to you..',
       'The game is a challenge within itself. I normally prefer to play game games that are satisfactory. But this game is very wonderful. As it comprisses of a rolling ball that is running over  an uneven path. So basically there can be competition between the bro who travelled the most distance. It also requires a good solid attention power along with patience.. So i would say its anice game. As of gameplay the is no ending or starting in the game it directly starts and that makes it more interesting. But at the same time also boring. But i would say that if u download this game u will definitely uninstall it after almost a month. Good game and waiting for an update ‚úåÔ∏è',

First, if you could upgrade the cars more and you didn\'t have to use the cards. Like us money to upgrade engine parts, buy body kits, etc. And there\'s some kind of a sound glitch. The sound stays on for just a few races and then all of a sudden it stops working but I can still play the game.' ],

It keeps telling me to go back to that level and to unlock the animals even though I\'ve already done so. It doesn\'t even give me the one-star animals (which is odd) can you please fix this??' ],

     [ 'The game is alright, but I  have some frustrations with it. For one, sometimes when you release the ball, the aim will move suddenly and cause it to hit off of your intend target. Also, it isn\'t cool when you start a new level and you have no available moves (you can\'t pop any bubbles! ), Sometimes for a number of turns, sometimes in the middle or at the end of the level. Usually it is manageable enough. Still frustrating tho. Maybe it is an international challenge of the game..  Overall a decent game',
       'Uninstalling. The controls are imprecise (ball would slip off the desired direction occasionally) and the order of the colours would make it impossible to win on occasion. I can forgive the first thing (muscle) but making it impossible to win is not forgivable.  Work on the algorithm.',
       'Too many ads. Devs are getting greedy with how many ads they put in, I got 3 before I even got to play. Don\'t bother with this junk.',
       'Games really nice good mind challenge, great for color match making if color blind. You may not know what colors your matching however, ever since i started playing i\'ve also been getting better at matching my clothes and random day to day organising of colored items. Love the game however the ball simetimes seems to go where it wants to instead of where you released it... I noticed this a few times i would aim let go and the line would randomly jump to a new spot and the ball shots almost a completely diffrent location',
       'It was great at first. Addicting. I was really looking forward to more levels but they suck. Too many kinds of bubbles. Why did the update change old levels too? Major disappointment.  Edit 2/19/18: it was back to being great when they took away all the extra kinds of bubbles. But after a few hundred levels...they\'re back. Balls with three locks, slime, water bubbles or whatever that is. Lured people back in and then disappointed again.',
       'Good for killing a bit of time.  Too many adverts and the sequence of colours appearing make levels impossible without playing lots of times. Used all the gained coins buying 20 extra balls for 1 level and still only had balls of a colour I couldn\'t hit... Ice balls make current level close to impossible. Just swapping where ice is without removing anything dozens of tries and not got even close to finishing.' ],

I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',

       'God ide, men d√•rlig udf√∏relse. I en digital verden hvor mit gammeldags TV abonnement for l√¶ngest er udskiftet med TV2 Play er det simpelthen ikke holdbart at man ikke har en udgave som "synkronisere med TV2 Play" (forsinkelse p√• ca 1 minut).

Jeg forst√•r hvordan det kan v√¶re vanskeligt. En n√∏jagtige synkronisering er umulig n√•r reklamerne (TV2 Play) afspiller er en anden device (fx Smart TV) end den Reklame Bingo k√∏rer p√•. Men s√• lad folk g√¶tte en r√¶kkef√∏lge af reklamer og f√• point efter hvor mange rigtige de har.

Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.',
       'This game is both funny as serious it\'s a great way to make kids understand the danger of some things around them. Like trains and wires and different things. As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.',
       'I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I\'m playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can\'t complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that gameüëç',
       'I think that there could be less ads. When I\'m trying to replay he game an ad pops up which is really annoying. What I would say is that this is an excellent game but just less of the ads',
       'I love it and all that but it should really make some more valentine mini games because it just gets boring after a while and the thing i don\'t like about this app is that every time when you die it just goes onto an advert which are so annoying. Everything else i like and the app is actually quite good and funny aswell',
       'I think dime ways to die is awesome! I think Dumb Ways to Die is awesome educator for kids and other things and stressed really fun to play and this review is going to get like a hundred likes so I\'m posting these for people and other stuff stuff I love you America so so much so so much scream loudly' ],

     [ 'Hello! I\'ve seen this game many times from the ads and I tried installing it and later found that this game was really intertaining and fun. Anyways, I am having problems with the game\'s connectivity to the internet. I am using 4G in playing the game and it seems that it does not connect very well, other online games connect well to the internet. I think that is the only issue I have in mind. Just hoping for more smoothness though.. But I love the game, it is worth the time playing. Thank you!!',
       'I dont know why you chosen Retro style graphic and i hope for a change. There is a lot of IRANIAN players but PING is over 250ms and too much delay. Add iran flag. Google play sign-in is not working. Add more skins. Events are just bunch of objectives and prizes, add more artworks and stuff for events. Other things are good for now. Thanks for the revolutionary IO game. Congratulation on 10million downloads üíù',
       'YOU GUYS ACTUALLY LISTENED!!! Im so happy right now because when I saw theres a new update, I immediately downloaded it to see if I can play it without crashing. I can actually play it now with my friends! A little bit of framrate drop but still... I can play this wonderful game. Im going to totally recommend this game to my friends. The devs of this game are the best devs in the Google Play Store. Again, Im truely greatful and I thank you guys. :D',
       'simple, fun, addictive gameplay, good graphic with unique animations, great events that keep players active which is good, have great potential. dark adventure loading still takes too long, i already dead when the loading is finished. crashing and some bugs in event tab. talking about awaken system, man atleast dont downgrade the stars or reduce the percentage of downgrade, finding awaken item is already damn hard. this great game need new character and more feature but not p2w. keep the good work barbarq !!',
       'It is the best game I\'ve ever played! With simple graphics and gameplays, you won\'t notice how long you\'ve played! Generous with presents daily and very recommended to spend time. However with the new update, I can\'t connect and it stayed on connecting. Tried to change internet source, but to no avail it\'s still there.  I would like to ask the developers, to reply as soon  as possible, on what should I do to get rid of this problem.',
       'Feels like lots of players are AI bots. I\'ve won my first 10 matches with a 10+ holyshit mega kill every time. Looks a bit pay to win as a champ you must buy has a very OP skill. The amount of awakening to hit 5 and get the extra skill is astronomical and will require money to be spent. Also, not one person is speaking English. It\'s all Spanish/Portuguese.' ],

     [ 'I love Beat the Boss 4! But there are some things that I would like to be fixed. For example, when naming your custom boss, the name duplicates. The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can\'t go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.',
       'I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i\'m asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting',
       'This game needs a lot of work done. So many glitches its really weird and hard to explain the glitches that happen. One of them was the screen uncalibrated itself an it was moved to the upper left side , an the right side was just black . idek if that makes sense but it shouldn\'t happen.',
       'The game is amazing, but it is pathetic at the fact that there are ads popping up every 2 minutes and there\'s no way to remove them... I would be happy to pay to remove the ads, I won\'t be playing this game until this is fixed. I remember playing this game years ago, I understand you guys may be making more money from displaying ads than people paying to remove them.',
       'I really love this app it is so fun to play but there is a glitch that happened to me and my brother when we were playing, the friend thing didn\'t work and we were logged into our accounts and the loading screen was just black outlines and Joe\'s face. I\'m pretty sure it didn\'t load like that before but over all, 5 stars! Have a good day/Night!',
       'I\'d happily purchase this game but that doesn\'t seem like an option. Tge ads, especially the LOUD BLOW UP EXPLOSIONS game that go on for 30 seconds are especially annoying. I\'ll gladly buy it, if only to not deal with Fing ads all the Fing time!!' ],

Not sour grapes but all to often when you are in an unbeatable position the opponent will throw 4 doubles or exactly the right sequence of dice to win. This im sure is to encourage payment of coins. Not the best because of this bit could be.  Its a shame it ruins the fun totally!! Edited as the dice really are pants! Ive played many backgammon games online and they do not re-act like these do. There is definatly an issue that needs to be resolved as they don\'t drop as they should. I am sure the other reviews are accurate regarding the dice',

I Played in clubs professionally 38 yrs.  When I\'m winning other players roll 6-7 dbls in a row & win with impossible odds at the end of the game. 14 dbls in 1 game - NOT in real life.

     [ 'This game is great, it\'s a lot of fun. Until it decides that you\'re not allowed to pass the loading screen.  Then there\'s the premium store. The pricing is pretty outrageous for a mobile game. $35 for a t5? I paid less than that for my Matilda IV on WOT. Please address this issue. So we can actually show you our patronage. You occupy our spare 15 minutes. Not hours daily. Think of where this is played and charge accordinly. That\'s all I have to say.',
       'It is very different than the computer version in terms of captain skills. You have to choose which bonus to use once the ship is fully upgraded and you have to find and save upgrade warship blueprints. I understand the need to make an income. Not particularly amused though. Other than some of the difference\'s that I have an issue with and the lack of being able to transfer  account info over from the computer version. It is a fun way to play on the go. Just wish I had access to my 30 + in warships that I have for the desktop. Not feeling the need to repurchase the same premium ships for the second time.',
       'I do like this game. The support team is good and are helpful when they can be. But the silver and points awarded are much too low in my opinion, when in comparison to the costs of modules and supplies consumed during battles. Also the supply crates could stand to be better. The ships are pretty awesome and are very well rendered. Very good graphics. Everything runs smoothly with no lag or server issues.',
       'Connection issues. Don\'t bother with playing on hotel Wi-Fi. The mcDs or the coffee shop. Forget about it on 3G. Because you need to have a full wired connection just to not hop around the map with the superb lag spikes. Spending tons of time shooting and hitting the enemy getting zero registry. In short good looking game spent hundreds of hours on the desktop version. But this doesn\'t seem keenly executed. Not connected to my desktop account? Why bother?',
       'This is a great game!!.  Yes, computers have issues, yes its short then the PC version.  This is not a PC.  This is a great 5 minute break.  I play the PC game too.  Its flipping fantastic.  The programmers at WOW are brilliant  and they care about the product.  If you love histroy, Warships, strategic games pitting you against other human players.  GET THIS YOUR GAME.  There are other warship games.  None get it more right then WOW.',
       'The games mechanics and controls need an overhaul. The secondary weapons should be automated as fast firing ships operating in touch screen controls requires immense micro management. Second, the post battle screen graphs extremely limited battle details and the UI is equally as lacking in features and navigation. Finally, the battle time is far to short and the majority of battles are ended with ships still in action on both teams. Potential to be a 5 star rating when the mechanics become as user friendly as they they are on PC.' ],

Then I  quit,  and go back in,  sometimes can get to drawing board,  but not with the word selected.  Grrrrr. Also solo challenges do not reload.  Badges are meaningless,  no clarification on how to use words. Above All combined makes this game tedious and boring.  The only fun part is watching the opponent\'s drawing take place.  Humorous but not worth the effort of trying to play.  Uninstalling for now.',

Fantastic idea ruined by greed. If you don\'t mind long unskippably unrelated adverts to waste your break at work then go for it because the game itself it top.',

All have to do to avoid ads is not restart until the respawn timer clears, so they aren\'t that bad, and it\'s really cheap to turn the ads off.  I would happily do so, it the app would run for more than 5 minutes.  If it wasn\'t for the crashing, I would rate it 4 stars at least.',

I would rate it 5* if there was a reason for why you level up and why you keep spinning for little lightening bolts when you do level up  as once you have bought the small amount on offer they are no longer needed. Add more things to buy and give the game a reason for levelling up ü§òüèº',
       'Smooth game. Plenty of fire ball options and endless level options but after every death you have to watch  15 second ad. EVERY DEATH. Which just spoils the experience and all. I understand ads but like after 3 deaths that\'s fine. But after every death and some are unskippable. So download of you have patience. It\'s worth it of you have time to spend',

And half the time you will click to change your ball or rings and it won\'t load or do anything. This game is full of glitches. Would be an amazing game if this was attended to',
       'A wonderful aesthetically pleasing game.  Get as far as you can, with as many points as you can while unlocking different fireballs and portals. I would love to see how this game evolves in the future and i have not seen as many ad\'s as people claim so perhaps that issue has been resolved? Working perfectly on S8+',
       'TOO MANY ADS, every time you die you get an ad and that\'s just being money hungry what ever happened to games without long ads what\'s the point if you\'re gonna make a game and 1/3 of the gameplay being ads. Perhaps every 10 or 20 games, or just have those small popup ads, but don\'t ruin the gameplay because you want money. I\'m uninstalling and I\'m sure other people are as well.' ],

     [ 'this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It\'s a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that\'s it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame',
       'Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn\'t came in two years it probably isn\'t. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don\'t pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges.',
       'Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.',
       'I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.',
       'Funny characters, endearing cartoon aesthetic and enjoyable game play, but after a couple hunts forces you to wait over 8 minutes before you can actually play again (in order to entice you to pay to make the wait times go away). What kind of game compels you to QUIT out of BOREDOM after playing it for 5 minutes?',
       'It takes way too long for the levels to reload and I\'m not sinking thousands of dollars into a game just so I can play it. It  is ridiculous the a put of money you need to pay to even play this games. There should be more drones for a cheaper price (if not free.) Although the game is fun you don\'t get to play it much unless you are willing to shell out thousands in the long run' ],

If someone could fix this for me or refund me that would be great. I just got 6 new babies and she can\'t use any of them which is ashame cause she loves this game.',
       'Bought all the babies when I first downloaded the app. Everything was working great. So when the most recent (3) babies were available for purchase I bought them, but now those babies don\'t work!.... I\'ll give five stars when you get them to work. In the meantime, I think I should get a refund on my money.',
       'Downloaded this game for my daughter and we never got to play because the game will not load. It gets stuck on the bottle screen and then has a black screen after that. She has Nabi tablet, so I will keep the app for now and just disable it. Please fix soon!!!',
       'Bought the game early on, then after an update with new babies they mixed the new babies in.  So you are left with a child constantly wanting the new babies.  A horrible money grab.  Otherwise a fun game.  Shoyld not show the locked babies mixed in with purchased ones.',
       'Dang, I wish the purchases I made on 6 more babies for my daughter would just work! She loves the app, but gets frustrated that the whole app freezes when she clicks to play one of the other babies. Wouldn\'t recommend this app because of that... it\'s just stealing my money..',

       'Please reduce the cost of things on store and do something in your next update so that the player can get more and more diamonds from the hit list. Please reduce the cost of jet pack.

       'Honesty its just like GTA which a great thing but the thing is the installation time let me share my experience to one and all reading hear... When I was downloading it at the first its done but it starts downloading once again but I am not sure is it my problem but I just wanted to share with you guys... The game is boss',
       'It\'s a very great game,Nothing but love.   But I got a notification  that there is an update,I updated the game but I still can\'t find the new added missions in the game. Secondly I am on day 87 and my day 90 supposed  Reward changed after I downloaded the update.',
       'I don\'t understand why  diamonds are required to craft materials. As a F2P player it is difficult for me to craft new materials. The old updates never had this rubbish. Please fix ASAP.Will install again if it is fixed.',
       'This game is fricking lowkey lit. But could you add stunt trick such as backflip or frontflips that gives you money any time one of these are perform on motorcycles. And cars could get cash as well by drifting or something. Also can we buy one or two houses that have a garage so that we are able to store vehicles there. Thanks and keep up the good work. Oh one more thing can we deliver the car we own for free and rent the others for a certain amount of time that would be awesome.' ],

       'UNINSTALED   Need alot of gold (money to get it) to finish special even its true...!!! you can\'t finished that even if don\'t have it. yes it\'s a MONEY MAKING GAME..!!! actually, it\'s pretty good game but you need to improve your server, it\'s fu**ng so long... need 5 minutes to enter the game. please even if  I got a good internet, still to long long time to enter the game. please‚Äã fix it up.',
       'Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won\'t reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.',
       'When I started playing this game I really enjoyed it. But now I realise that in order to progress, you MUST spend REAL money. I am a family man, with a wife and 6 children, I just wanted a game that I could play when kids are in bed and wife is in bath, I don\'t have cash to spend on games, the worst thing is the 7 Day events, you cannot beat them without spending money. Very disappointed. Good game but don\'t expect to progress very far if you don\'t want to spend money.',
       'Crashing a lot . The screen goes black very frequently now and the frequency is increasing day by day. Fix this!! Otherwise a great game. I will give 5 stars if you fix this issue. Most people with moto g5s plus has this problem. I uninstalled it u fools dont even care',
       'Please solve these issues after last updates. Watching an ad is not reducing the remaining time for getting fuel, it is only reducing appx one minute which is not good. It used to give one life against one ad, now watching 10 ad for 1 fuel is like watching ads for 8 minutes to cover 10 minuted wait time which is meaningless.' ],

     [ 'Good game, please add more customizations, make a custom skin is hard, please make it easier to fill in and please buff sniper rifle, please have a invisible armor button, have hats and that you can create multiple maps. Also, I hate that everybody has auto sight and auto fire on, so that people cant enjoy that much fun because you basically just would get killed instantly just because of people who let the game play for them.',
       'This game is a good game. I gave this game a 5 star rating cuz its sup awesome and also me and my brother play it at school if this had a 10 star rating you know i would give it a 10 star rating and also can you add a minigun and also i hope this game never dies and i hope to remember it when i grow up',

     [ 'Enjoyable game. Don\'t have to spend money on diamonds unless you\'re after a top look. Best played when linked to FB which means you can borrow from friends\' closets. Would rate 5 stars but recently I am having issues opening results in my in box. Every time I receive a result the page opens halfway then I have to exit the game and reload. Playing on an Asus ZenPad, anyone having the same issue or have a solution pls?',
       'I have been playing Covet for 4 yrs every single day! Being in the fashion industry I find it so interesting that the products you dress your models in are real items you can buy in real life. They have a great collection of brands but Im excited to see more.   And contrary to popular belief you dont have to spend a dime to play. My strategy for this is I play the daily challenge with either past seasonal clothes or i borrow from my fashion house. If your vision and outfit is great you will win the free item regardless of whether it is in season or not. By doing this you save $500 a day and i wait till a covet series comes along and play it till my heart and imagination is content.   Take it from a Covet junkie, you will be hooked for years!',
       'Loved the game when I first started to play. Beautiful clothes. Great model looks,  a LOT of fun. Until you get further in. Everything is so expensive and what you get for diamonds in a day is very little. It was disappointing to say the least. I had a few friends who played and could borrow from their closets but none of them play anymore. Probably for the same reason I am about to stop playing myself.Give better incentives and give better prizes and maybe I will play again. Bummed out, the game has great potential',
       'Game does not give enough rewards to play on a daily basis.  It\'s too expensive to play for what you get.  Mostly I didn\'t like it because the,  "earn diamonds," section was bogus!!! I made qualifying purchases to earn diamonds and got nothing. I was pretty disgusted with it after that. I submitted requests,  complaints, went through all the hoops to redeem my rewards and never got them. I would not have spent the money had I known i would Gerry nothing for it.  Do not trust this app to follow through with promised rewards!!!.',
       'Great pass time and fun to play. For a while I do nothing just for the daily diamonds but I don\'t mind because the game is just overall fun to play! Maybe it would be better ifyou earned more cash for entering style challenges but... STILL FUNüòâ',
       'Im simply addicted to the game and i usually play like 5 times a day and i would\'ve happily gave it a 5 stars if i could vote. I ALWAYS get the error message "there was a problem communicating with the network". I contacted the support team several times but its useless so until i can vote normally i wont be satisfied' ],

     [ 'Cross platform across Apple and Android and PC makes this game a fluid joy to play, without the feeling of a toned down mobile port - due to its 1:1 experience from the PC. It\'s the only Blizzard game u can play on Mobile. I\'m a legend (highest skill tier) ranked and totally F2P so the people who say this game is pay to win or random luck do not understand the game. Paying for is meant for helping you finish your collection fast. Overall highly recommended.',
       'Lots of fun over and over again. It doesn\'t get boring because of all the expansion updates that keep coming up. You need to readjust your decks to adapt with the new cards that get released. Didn\'t give it a full 5 because of the lag and graphic issues that keep coming up for me and others of the forums.               Playing on a Note 5',
       'I\'m trying to link my account to my other one by using my blizzard account that I already have. But it just makes me do the tutorial and after I completed it, it just keeps on doing the starter stuff. Even though I already have a blizzard account with my hearthstone rank 20, but it just restarts me back to ,25. I\'m not sure its a glitche or I\'m doing something wrong but It just wont let me log in my account.',
       'I used to play the old tcg and this not  close to be a good card game. All it is is monster with power, moslty no spell, no artifact, no nothing. This game is boring and is lagging so much on the cellphone. Shadowverse is ways better for a similar formula, has a really good storyline and a waaaaay more generous. When you buy card for HS you get mostly nothing. They had the chance to do something good, everyone love the lore of warcraft, but they BS it.',
       'What the hell? I played this game about 2-3 years ago and i really liked it (on that time). But now when i came back I just can\'t win anyone. I tried to win on rank 25 about 10 times. There always players with full deck of legendary/epic cards, 25 RANK, DAMN!',
       'There\'s apparently no coming back to this game. If you stop playing for a bit and come back you\'ll never be able to catch up. I\'ve tried building decks but everyone playing has the best cards already and unless I buy card packs I\'ll never catch up.' ],

This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you\'d have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun',

That has happened at the minimum of 10 times to me with every one being a ALL-IN pot. In the MEGA BONUS SPIN don\'t get hopes of winning the MEGA BONUS. Expect the lower scores 100% of time & by all means don\'t spend money on a spin. Look it\'s a good free game for awhile until game determines it\'s time to pay to play. All the "FREE" games are like this so don\'t expect this one to be different.',

     [ 'This game is amazing! Everyone needs to play this. I would\'ve given a fifth star however you need to not only buy all XXL sharks to unlock the "!!" Sharks but max them out. Definitely download this, just one tip. Don\'t delete when you have progress. I\'ve downloaded, played, got bored, and deleted 3 times. Now I\'m never deleting it. I have so much progress, if I never deleted it the first time I would have everything in the game',
       'Finally! For the the longest time I\'ve been waited, the gaming performance has been improved! No more annoying lag and the gameplay feel a lot smoother now and I am so happy about it. But the graphics still needs to be improved because it doesn\'t look too good and some minor bug needs to be fixed.',
       'Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it\'s so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I\'ve had to start all over again... but the fun continues!',
       'Do not upgrade your Sharks.  The bigger the shark, the more difficult it is to play.  Big sharks have more drain on health and hunger, causing you to die more frequently. Impassable areas due to size of !! shark and less fishes to eat when health gets low.  Not to mention how slow these big sharks move!  The more you spend on bigger sharks, the less fun you\'ll have.',
       'This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don\'t play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don\'t make us wait foreverrrr!',
       'I\'ve had to start this game all over from the very beginning 3 times. After working hard to get all the way to the top sharks, the app will suddenly refuse to connect to your Facebook account and want you to start a whole new game. Waste of time. Very frustrating. Not enjoyable at all. Find a game that\'s enjoyable. This one is definitely not fun.' ],

It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven\'t bothered to update this in years.',
       'Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can\'t stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn\'t happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can\'t buy any of the bikes.',

I was going to go buy the gohst bike but it makes u pay for a year subscription for it and all the other vip bikes. It use to be 7.99$. that new update made the game worse.üòîüòî',

Even i haven\'t sleep for 2 days, felt like an alien or zombie, etc. But this game cheers me up alot. Recommended ? Yes! Good job dev, just download it guys. Lu pasti hepi dah! Keren!',
       'Pretty cool..It was actually a little more than i expected.  The bikes are cool. They seem to be modeled after actual bikes, but perhaps didnt want to pay 4 the licensing to use actual manufacturer names.',
       'One of the best motorcycle game to date, weather conditions are great, bikes are great and handling is great, but the bad ai on higher difficulty level a few times are ridiculous and messes up everything.  Sometimes a truck speeds up to 150km/h just to close off that small gap, where you could slip through, but next time all cars in all lane slow down at once, so you can\'t pass anywhere, even though there\'s nothing in front of them. This is really annoying, when every second counts and there\'s no way to pass them for 4-7 seconds. Apart from this the game is great. The keep changing weather conditions is great too.',

     [ 'Wonderful! Game by first touch   But I can\'t wait till the hearts üíö are filled!  So Reduce the time. Improve this game more and more and create a new exciting games.  I have finished 390 levels. And I have a doubt what is the last level and what happens after it? All the best for ur future and I\'m a biiiiiiig fans of u guys!!  Hands off',
       'This now a prize example of a freemium game that needs a premium option. I would gladly pay ¬£10 as a one off purchase to do away with the need to say for lives. In the past games worthy of a one-off fee would offer it and this issue such game that should consider it. I will never pay for any in app purchases on any game and I am sure I am not alone. This has 5* written all over it but the long wait times and exorbitant cost of energy replenishing means this doesn\'t get anything higher than average.',
       'Loved the game but if the life was free this waiting for minutes to play again is not cool. Also noticed if you have to score more than 1 goal and you make a mistake you have to start from the same goal you already scored. If we can get the requirements before each challenge that would make it much more fun otherwise I love this game a lot keep updating for more seasons. Thank you. I am on Level 560 with 1257 stars I am awaiting Season 29. If you can also create a full football game with same concept. This is a Great game!!! Thank you developers keep developing Great games like these!!!',
       'SCORE  HERO RULES This game is so sick dudes. It so cool that this gives us idea that how to play soccer or football. Gameplay is so smooth . They players show us some epic skills . It has an commentary. The worst part was the heart. I can\'t wait till it get refilled ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ this. Graphics are great . Just reduce the time of refilling the energy . Overall this game cool. Thanks for the game FTG.',
       'Do you know what? This game is really bad. If you\'re calling this game really good, then you must be blind. The graphics are really bad, it is really laggy and whenever someone puts in a review, you don\'t fix it. You never do any updates to impove this game also. And the fact that you have to wait for your hearts to regen is so annoying. You should remove the hearts *now*. That is why I think this game is so bad and that I rate this game 1‚òÜ.',
       'I am a football player and I watch alot of football so I know that a shot directed lowly towards the bottom far post must definitely get in. But this game won\'t let you score with that strategy. The keeper dives from one end to another. Ridiculous. And why do I have to repeat goals I have already scored? Pathetic' ],

     [ 'At the rate you get coins it would take youbabreally long time for you to redeem for five dollars, but the ads are not very intrusive, and the game works.  If I can get an extra 5. Bucks by the end of the month, I\'m happy.',
       'There are far too many ads in game that you have to deal with, and game limitations basically force you to purchase stuff in order to even approach something resembling actual progress. What makes things worse is that there really isn\'t much of an actual game to be played here, just spin once, wait for the ad, spin again, wait for an ad, repeat until you uninstall the game permanently. I\'d only recommend this game to someone looking for an actively painful experience.',
       'The amount of ads is truly ridiculous. And if you intend to actually make any money at all with this game you will have to play for probably over a year to make 1 dollar. don\'t waste your time',
       'I really like this game. It\'s a great time killer but can you please not have the double reward and x2 thing pop up all the time. It is really annoying',
       'Nice game it\'s nice to make a bit of money. But.. there are just to many ads. I do not have a nice and normal experience while using the app. If you can lower the ads it will be a good app. I uninstalled because the ads where way to annoying. Please lower the amount of ads. Thanks',

     [ 'Would be nice if there was a redo button for the last move. I\'m very quick when playing and I often misplace a block. Also, why does the Apple version have stars and the android version doesn\'t? I was trying so hard to earn enough stars to buy the colour packs on my iPod, and I got quite disappointed that I can\'t do that on android. I guess I\'ll just delete the game off android since there\'s really no goal to the game now.',
       'Very fun and addicting but nice calm relaxing game. Ads only happen after each round and not a big deal. If you want to keep playing this game FREE then add up with the package. Quiet whinning about ads. Someonbe has to pay the creators for this game including the upkeep and updates. How else will the creator make his money? 2 choices, either gets ads or charge to download. So I can deal with the ads. It\'s a FREE APP.',
       'Really annoying when ads pop up and you have to start from scratch. That\'s really my only complaint about this game, but it\'s a big complaint. It sucks to feel like you get really far and then all of a sudden it stops in the middle of the game. This is a finished game not an interactive advertisement where it stops you from going further.  In all honestly it plays simply and I like it a lot but it needs some improvements.',
       'Way too many ads. I just need something for my fingers to do while listening to podcasts but this constantly interrupts my listening pretty much after every round. I really liked the game but I have had it with thw ads and am uninstalling. It\'s just not worth it.',
       'I really like the game but as many others have said their are too many ads. Ads after every round and sometimes in the middle of the round which makes you start over and that gets annoying. Too many of thr same ads. I also agree their needs to be a redo button. It does get a bit pintle after you hit the goal but still fun.',
       'Too many adds, and it makes me restart every time an add plays, I\'ve only had this app for 1 min, and have already played 50 rounds... Not. Cool. I would be okay with the adds if I could at least pick up on where I last left off.' ],

Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don\'t register as pineapple hits for the counters. There\'s a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it',
       'Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.',

The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.',

     [ 'I really like playing the game. It has great animations smooth gameplay and isn\'t too easy or hard. The one thing I dont like is you can\'t sell your old equipment or skills. If there was a shop to sell them or add runes to them or be able to combine them to make either new or more powerful ones of the sane type I would give this game 5 stars.hopefully the Devs will take this and add this feature in a update. Speaking of updates, I just installed the latest one it was like 403MB but nothing changed! What was the update for then?',
       'The game is a lot of fun but there\'s one big problem the only way to advance in the story mode is by leveling up and getting better armor but the only way to level up is in story mode so your other option is spend real money on better equipment. So it\'s kinda just a money grab. If that was fixed I\'d give it 10 stars',
       'The game is good and i like it..  But after every fight you must connect to internet,, honestly this sucks.. Fighting game needs much comfort ability but every being online its really boring and it eventually slows which makes the game awful Please fix this up  Shadow Fight 2 is more portable and nice thought this will be better than two but for this update Shadow Fight 2 Is the best...',
       'This game made me rage. Insane difficulty is literally impossible.The loot is trash, upgrading armor and weapons is better. In the fighting system, when you get cornered, your basically screwed. I miss the mechanics in Shadow Fight 2 where you cant hit him when he fell on the ground. It a really good mechanic to give your opponent a chance. But thus game, there is no mercy at all. You still get hit when on the ground which sucks. C\'mon developers, you gotta fix this!',
       'Classical pay per win game. Once you advance (e.g. lv 4-5), winning against the computer in the main quest is only possible after several days of waiting for free cards and random levelling of the weapons via chests (gained via duels). Glitches in skills usage are also observed.',
       'Great game in terms of graphic and gameplay. The only thing that sucks are the paywall in this game. Almost impossible to pass the story mode with weak weapon that we are given. The box drop rate also terrible. The only way to level up is by completing the main story. I will uninstall this game till they fixed this system. Really bad system.' ],

       'This is as simple as it can be, yet perfect in every way. Relaxing music that doesn\'t distract you from your game, smooth gameplay, easy controls. I liked the fact that you are tossed into the game without any tutorials, left on your own. I am not really into puzzle games but I completed this game in a single afternoon and it had me asking for more.',

       'It\'s so captivating I finished it in a single morning! I love how challenging the puzzles are at the same time they are fun. The level 49 made me go crazy because I couldn\'t get it right, I had to draw the squares  so I wouldn\'t press the wrong one. I totally loved it and I\'m so going to download red!',

I just have to edit this to add that I don\'t understand why people are complaining about ads. You only need to watch them for a hint, and only briefly. It\'s a free game, and the developer has to make a living. You can pay to get them removed, but they really aren\'t obtrusive at all.',

     [ 'Love playing but have 2 suggestions. We need another mill.  When we have large orders to fill it takes forever to complete those orders because the mull is tied up all the time. Maybe every 40 levels add a mill purchase option. When selling on the market, we need an option for a blind add or a neighborhood only sell or trade.. make these upgrades and so far game would be perfect!',
       'It\'s great to be able to buy from other farms in theory. But there are WAY too many times that you click on something and it\'s either sold or not even in the roadside stand at all. The for sale paper needs to update quicker.  Also, it\'s very hard to accumulate any \'west bucks\' in this game and you need them to do almost anything, so the game is a big money suck too. I\'m deleting it.',
       'I love these type of games just like hayday. I have noticed it freezes and takes ages to load the newspaper. Also would be helpful if it could tell you who needs help in the newspaper would help filling orders quicker. Also I have noticed alot of people selling the same parts and harder to get others and it\'s extremely rare to get the land parts without paying',
       'Update......I have learned there is a chat feature AND a neighborhood group you can create.....so excited to get to level 19!!!! Would give it a solid 5 stars if we could have an actual chat option with friends. Looking for a new game to get away from FV2, but can\'t find one with the same chat availability.  Add this and I am hooked!',
       'The game doesnt give enough case vs things to buy or fix.  Also have issues with getting product into the alloted spaces.  I thought it was my screen but had it cleaned thoroughly and it still happens.  It takes several attempts!!!  The story is cute.  The graphics are cute as well.  Ive noticed it has a couple of choices from other games Ive played on older phones. I would suggest the game to others but get the issues fixed and itll be a 5star game.',
       'I love playing these games. I\'m not sure why we are rating gameplay they offer apps not a game. It\'s crazy how they ask us to rate game at the beginning of game. We haven\'t learned the bad points. This game makes us pay for treasure chest instead of giving us to them free like most games. Which means we have to pay for everything. Totally not fair. Takes the fun out of game.' ],

     [ 'I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn\'t have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn\'t get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren\'t vigilant of their customers and don\'t take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.',
       'Great game with a lot of potential.... There can be so many more additions to make this fps better. More grenade varieties? A spectator mode? Clan levels that allow more players to join when we reacher higher levels? Gun balancing changes? I feel like the Cerberus should be buffed. It is expensive, and the 3 shots at once doesn\'t allow for many attempts for kills. Adventure mode for more gunbucks? Death match option? Allowing us to pick the map? I understand the game is fairly new, so keep on adding changes and new improvements. Thanks for listening!',

       'Game is really tooo gud, graphics also nice n smooth controls but u guys released only one game mode(Team death match), but in lot of fps games they provided free for all, bomb mode, Flag capture n many more modes.. If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games üòÄ n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area.',
       'The best shooting game ever. Lobed each and every single thing about this game but there a little suggestion that we can see the player if they are online or not but how is this if we can see there live going on matches? That concept will be great and games lag sometimes so if you can fix this and add my suggestion in guns of boom that will be hell great!! #the best game',
       'I love this game so much. I have been looking for a good shooting game for years and I never found one until I came across this. This is perfect. Me and my friend would spend hours on this game. I have been playing this for about 6 months now. It\'s perfect. I think the best thing about this game is how organized everything is. It is very self explanatory. I found everything and it was easy to do so. I also love how they update this game very often. Great game. I haven\'t had any problems with it. I can\'t wait for updates later on to come.' ],

     [ 'So far, I dig this game. Although, the individuality of it is scarce. I still play it and enjoy it. It\'s not identical to other games of this type, as the challenges are similar yet different. The scenario of the game is basic with the others. I have a variety when it comes to games, this one has similar sound affects to other games that I, personally, downloaded. (But they\'re also from the same makers.) This game is over all.... Good so far.. I would recommend, linked my account to this game and invited friends and family. (I only do so, if the game/app is worthy. I\'m a picky bull!!!!) Overall, you\'ll have fun! Cute toys and  unique power ups, with a slightly (10%) twist.',
       'Definitely addicting. The levels are challenging, the tools are fun to figure out and the reward set up is not unattainable. The only other thing is they grew more wise  for the latest update, you can\'t change the time on your phone to add lives anymore! Probably better that way, one (read: I) should pace themselves when playing....',
       'This is by far the most fun I\'ve  had with a game app! Its so cute and  colorful!  And each increase in difficulty  makes you want to keep coming back for the next challenge.  What also makes it awesome  is a no brainer,  its great for children and adults alike.  BIG THUMBS UP!',
       'Really enjoyed the game until I was entered in a two week tournament.  Now, the boards are incredibly difficult and I can no longer earn prizes on a regular basis. Of course, I suppose that\'s by design so I spend money. Which I won\'t do. I just want some "bubblegum" to past the time.  Now, it\'s making my blood pressure rise...  Also amazing how many 5 ‚≠ê ratings they get in one day without the user giving explanations on why. Seems suspicious...',
       'I  love this game but why does it take 30 minutes for a life to refill and also why does everyone who plays the game not receive ten lives only some of your players this needs to be fixed it\'s not fair I\'ve been playing for years and only receive five lives at a time when others receive ten lives.I play other games and the lives refill every 7 to 15 minutes. Can you please make changes',
       'Really an exciting game. But there is a small problem. Sometime when I run the game it\'s not response (all animation are moving, but it isn\'t resopnse when I press the screen) , so I have to close it and run it again many times till it response. Hopefully you will fix this problem ASAP. Thanks!' ],

     [ 'Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it\'s just my phone. Also I\'m not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)',
       'I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the "mine" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it\'s nicely done!',
       'I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.',
       'Overall the app is really great. It\'s the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you\'re not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.',
       'Input delays keep getting me killed. Instead of marking a bomb my input sets it off. I\'d prefer two different inputs for marking or removing tiles.  I\'m using a stylus too so I know it\'s not an issue of accidentally hitting the wrong tile.',
       'excellent game & one of the best minesweeper apps on the market EXCEPT there\'s no zoom in feature! makes it impossible to play harder modes on a phone cuz you keep accidentally tapping mines when you\'re trying to clear the spot next to it :(' ],

Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed thisüòÄüòÅüòÄüòÅüòÄüòÅ.',
       'Please add more cars and make the graphics more realistic, and make the sounds of the cars realistic, unique, and smooth. Make each car have its own sound, the sounds they\'re supposed to have. Add the car stats and add a nitro feature. Add the brand each car is supposed to have. Make the cars spit fire!. Add weather conditions. Please add cars like: Ferrari F50 GT, W Motors Lykan Hypersport, Ferrari FXX Evoluzione, Hennessey Venom GT, Bugatti Chiron, Ferrari FXX K, Mclaren P1, Dodge Challenger, Chevrolet Camaro SS, Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4, Lamborghini Veneno, Chevrolet Corvette Z06 C7, even the Devel Sixteen Prototype.

Graphics don\'t lag at all. Please fix. Also would be great if you could add some button to start and stop a timer in free mode so we can set time challenges for ourselves. I like the game but it is unplayable after a few minutes after the recent updates',

       'This has to be like, my 5th or 6th reinstallment of this game since there\'s no ingame reset, but darn well worth the data(little bytes). I usually like more realistic car games, but even the "extreme" warp in physics in the gameplay doesn\'t distract from the fun. These are the cars you\'d want if you\'re trying to beat the traffic, run from the cops, or solve a parking dillemma. Great fun time killer! One thing though, the other reviewers are correct in their complaints about how often and when ads pop up. That shouldn\'t happen smack dab in the middle of a maneuver.',

Like I woodnt mind if you had a small one at the bottom is the screen but the fact it pops up at random in the screen is really annoying and finds the game. I do love this game but the ads ruin it.

     [ 'I didn\'t hold out much hope initially but it\'s a fabulous game. Graphics are good, there\'s a story and multiple maps etc. Its easy to progress and the special event maps were hilarious.  Definitely suitable for the majority of players and even young ones. There\'s no gore or unsuitable scenes and no constant push to buy ingame content. I wish more game developers thought like this. Properly enjoyable',
       'Great game, incredible customer service. You will never get bored with this game. Play daily as much or as little as you want. There are seasonal (timed) events to play and ongoing daily (no time limit)searches. We have all been there, missed an achievement because we logged on 10 minutes late. NO MONEY has to be spent to truely enjoy this game. Your progress or fun level isn\'t held hostage if you don\'t want to pay to play. Customer service is incredible. I was stuck and the response was quick and helpful. Even when I still didn\'t get it, think if it was a snake, it would have bitten me, they helped and never made me feel stupid. Install NOW and start having fun.',
       'Energy is spent too quickly, kind of their way of trying to make you to buy gems. I get it, and I would buy them if they weren\'t so expensive! I can barely make it through a single task, it does get quite annoying.   Maybe give us the option of watching ads for gems or extra energy, and an ad free option with minimal cost so those who would rather not have the ads get to benefit too?',
       'Love the challenge,  the mini puzzles.  The only draw back I would say.  As a new player having enough energy to complete some of the old challenges example (Valentine\'s 2017) is almost impossible.  Would love to figure out how to gain more energy. Fan page as far as I can see does not help on this.  Other then  that very enjoyable game.',
       'Hi, really like the game, but I\'ve just done the new jungle story and on completion of the story received a lot of gummy worms for energy, carried on playing, closed and came back to the app 30 mins later and they have all disappeared?? Could you please put these back in my rucksack so I can use them, was over 60, 000 energy that I have just lost, please sort this out as I love this game and I can then give it 5 stars, many thanks, Louise Anderson',
       'The instructions go by too fast,no where to look to repeat them so levels quests left half done. For example can\'t free the florists because not sure how to finish with the light beams??! Missed the hints or instructions.' ],

     [ 'I love this game. Just like other reviews say, it is addicting and because there are constant tasks to complete. Plus!..unlike other games, there is no way you ruin out of coins/money. The cities bring in alot. I can\'t agree with one reviewer that megabucks are hard not come by.  I began with 25 I believe (now at 32) and some of the tasks to complete give megabucks without spending actual money to even purchase some.  All in all, try this game and you won\'t run bored of it.',
       'Great, but really needs "sell all" function for dealing with store house and "pecial buildings" components.This is a really quality game, looks amazing, works well and has good timed construction projects. However, as others mention it takes SOOOOOOO long to accrue the assets for construction and the mega bucks for expansion. You have to be VERY patient if you are not willing to part with actual cash. An idea might be to offer a conversion of coins to megabuck, maybe get 1 buck in excahge for eg 5,000,000 coins?',
       'lnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'The new update is great! Really appreciate the chat system. But it could be better... maybe add some functionality to the capital buildings and states.... maybe bonuses to taxes nd pop, loans, and coop science and military missions. The prices of capital building materials is ridiculous. Fixing these will make the state system look more complete.',
       'Best game!! Very addictive, Been playing this game for over a year.. although, there are still alot to improve!  I hope the developers will include edit mode in the next update so that the players can rearrange their city..Also, I hope they will also include a 360 rotation of the city and add factories that can also create materials needed in the game like the railroad materials and steels. I am looking forward with this updates!!',
       'Been playing for more than 3 years, i lost count. But this is a wonderful game which encourages teamwork and neighbor support. There are barely any paywalls in this game and  if you have hundreds of facebook friends who have this game you can easily get the materials you need to expand your city. No limits so far.

Even all the member of the house use chinese, brazilian, its better if all language translate according the language we choose in game from the option',
       'I have played the game for about a week.  In all that time I have never been able to communicate with other players in the game, or change my avatar.  After a several day period of asking for assistance from the developer\'s support, they have finally concluded that unless you have a 4G connection, like verizon, or at&t, that the chat, and avatar change parts of their game will not work.  At least they suggested I spend money on 4G, and see, if that solves the problem.  Very depressing.',
       'Great game with some serious server lags and crashes. At this point I can\'t play for more than 5 minutes without having to restart it. Very frustrating and makes me avoid battles. The lag will prevent you from using spells and being able to fully compete against the enemy. When this happens it takes days to heal your troops. Fix the lag and this has the potential of being a 5 star game',
       'Hello dev... Please try to solve the duelling problems. I got stuck every time someone challenge a duel with me. I cant even use any of my heroes ability. And many are having this problem. Please try to fix this issue as soon as possible or im not spending another dime in this game... And please don\'t bother replying back with send a text to our page on fb or etc coz it takes decades to get a reply so just freaking solve this issue please. Thanks',
       'This game is destroyed by money. Every realm has at least one player who spends thousands of dollars and just skews the gameplay away from a fair contest. Wouldn\'t hesitate to give a 5 if there was a cap on spending',
       'A great game and extremely addictive once you really get into it. Well thought out. It can be very time consuming but that is what makes it great. The grind to level up Heroes makes me want to come back and carry on, unlock other heroes and further upgrade my Kingdom. My only issue is the fact that resources are hardly able to be kept. Being under constant attack from other groups and unable to allow my Kingdoms walls to regenerate properly before I am able to move again seems to be a recurring issue and one I do feel needs to be looked at and tweaked. Nonetheless, I\'m impressed with the game. Continue with the good updates and this game could be one of the best mobile games out there.' ],

     [ 'I played it a long time ago and i stopted like 5 months ago. Then now i reinstalled it and:  1. I could not enter my acc  2. I could not connect to facebook or google play.  3. I had to pay each time i danced wich sucks.  Till that update this game was the best game/app ever. It was so fun and so great that I just wanted to play nonstop.  I mean before this big update u payed for a song and u could dance on it as much as you liked. Now it just ain\'t fun anymore.   Please return to the classic game or your gonna lose much much more players like me.',
       'Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren\'t enough. And one of them didn\'t work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.',
       'I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.',
       'It\'s fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I\'m bored. I love the songs and dance moves it\'s awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it\'s awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don\'t know how to dance then you should download this game it\'s perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.',
       'Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn\'t have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!',
       'I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn\'t make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun.' ],

     [ 'This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!',
       'Great game, I totally love it. I don\'t mind the ad but I get annoyed of too many questions of Selena Gomez/Taylor Swift/Beyonce/Ariana Grande etc top hits. How about the legends..like David Bowie, Prince, Foo fighters, Guns n roses, Smashing pumpkins.. other than that, u all admins really rock!!  Edit: So I finally get questions like hits by David Bowie, Oasis..so cool. Well done fight list!! And they do consider our suggested answers!!‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§',
       'Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it\'s good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can\'t take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren\'t recognised either. I\'d enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.',

Only things I don\'t like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option!

     [ 'To many ads, even if they make the game free.. Pathetic. Conflicts with game when trying to back out of them and even crashes. Inconsistent game play, twitchy controls at times. Unplayable shots where one number on power scale is to hard the next one down is to soft.  Multi player has a feel of being rigged at times.  Potential for a good game but not yet in my books.',
       'Super fun game, but WAY TOO MANY crashes. I\'ve been struggling with a level several times only for the game to crash mid-level and I lose all my progress getting booted back to the beginning. Infuriating!',
       'Some observations: ball does not rebound off rails as they should, especially the back and side rails near the hole, where the ball hits the rail and stops dead. Part of miniature golf mastery is using the rails but not in this game. And when the ball is against a rail a shot is allowed as if the rail was not present. After a shot the screen should automatically rotate close to what the next shot would be expected so as to minimize manual rotation. I was making a long swipe to rotate almost 180¬∞ and my finger hit the power slide and an errant shot was made. Most hills are not smoothly sloped but instead very angular. Hitting the bottom of the slope causes the ball to jump in ways unanticipated rather than roll. This is golf, not basketball. I uninstalled the game because it just wasn\'t as fun and realistic as I had hoped.',

I also love the art of all the snakes; watching them evolve into huge monsters! My only complaint is that choosing custom coats of paints for the snakes can be teddious, as some of the spots are really small. Also, adding more customizable hats would be nice, though not needed. All in all it\'s a really fun, addicting game. Good job!!',

Everyone has their own way of saying, yes that\'s how I would if I really could.  You end up creating a bond or developing a relationship  with it.  Take it to the next level!  Gear ratios and n02 pushezes and grip are all good but let\'s envelop.  I know I would play more if I could truly express my kickass whip that represents  me that I have to drive!  You have a clean and immersive game. Less is more.  Thank you',
       'Best Drag racing game in Google play store. If you have a addictive personality don\'t play it. I do suffer from that first race was on Dec 312017 as of Feb 22, 2018 I have 208 hrs on the track 23 in the garage own 22 cars and spent over a Benjamin on it in less than a month. Ya gotta have some smarts to play and win. Money helps with extras. Only time I\'ve had a issue with it was this morning a season ended I was upgrading a Tier 5 car and paid with game money and didn\'t receive part. Still a 10 star game... Great job Developers!!',
       'Very cool game with good graphics but beware for this game is based around paying to play. The purchases aren\'t cheap either. If you\'re not careful you could find yourself spending hundreds yet still not getting what you need to beat the bosses. So if you\'re into forking up your hard earned cash by all means enjoy.',
       'Game is really great! Amazing graphics, amazing cars, lots of continuous fun! A few bugs and connection issues which can be frustrating at times especially when your team depends on you for points. Though I believe they\'ll eventually fix these issues as this is the BEST racing game out there and it\'s only getting BETTER!',
       'Customer support has won me over. They have literally provided the best resolution can think of for the game removing all my fusion parts. Hopefully I don\'t have many issues in the future but this one time moment has definitely filled me with confidence that in future, zynga will fairly sort things out.',
       'IT\'S BROKEN It won\'t load up rare imports screen and when I tap on the rare imports button it doesn\'t do anything even when it tells me to go onto rare imports screen please fix this as I can\'t play otherwise.

If not for the overwhelming ads, I would have given a 5 (IMO, the ads should have been mostly at the results page after 3 races, not after every race). Matchmaking is done so that everyone has a chance to win.  But, at the end, it\'s not about the ads and not about winning. It\'s all about the race!' ],

     [ 'Purchasing the other ponies is worth it. Don\'t know why other people are complaining. It\'s only 5 dollars, you could get a DQ lunch for 5 dollars. Anyways, game is amazing. What\'s cool is that you can reset your progress so you can have fun all over again. Amazing work Budge Studios!',
       'This game is my 5 yr olds favorite thing to do during trips. She loves the music and animation, and the gameplay is entertaining enough to keep her engaged. It\'s definitely worth the few bucks to get the add free version.',
       'Installed it, launched it, after the bungie screen was presented by a full screen ad for some game involving a woman + handcuffs + panties. Not a good look for a game aimed at children, my 6 year old was standing behind me.',
       'Remove the paywall and just charge for the game, it\'s worth it and people will buy it. But the way you can\'t unlock ponies without paying is insulting. Such a shame... I\'ll be sure to avoid any games you make in the future. And, yes, that\'s a bit harsh. But if we all don\'t stop letting devs get away with this kind of thing every company will turn into EA and will ruin the fun of gaming.',
       'Ads popped up every 45 seconds. I timed it. Made the game useless for my son (4). And he really wanted to play it too.',
       'My daughter loves this game so much! Good job guys. However we need your help, i made a purchase to unlock all ponies, however, somehow they got locked again and we needed to purchase again to unlock everyone. It was kinda disappointing, please help us on this matter.' ],

On lvl 70 20k team power Im forced to fight vs maxed teams lvl 120+/35k+ biggest bu!!$hit. Tower diamonds nerfed so its impossible to reach floor 30+ without spending 190gems. Major daily after last update nearly useless as well. On lvl70 (2 months) got only 1 5* bird so forget about high star team. Uninstalled.',
       'More or less meh, can do with or without. Asks frequently if you enjoy the app, if you say "no" then that\'s it. However, only if you say "yes" will it ask you to rate it. Pathetic that the developers don\'t actually want feedback. Needs some smoothing out on a few things, but Rovio doesn\'t care.',
       'Love this game!  One star deducted because game constantly freezes (usually after pvp), have to close out and restart.  It\'s annoying, but love the game enough to just grit my teeth and bear it!',

     [ 'Definitely a game for car buffs. It requires using your "mind" to win. I\'m not to sure about my rating yet. But, will definitely change if needed. It\'s unlike any game I\'ve played & I like it! Someone wrote a review that this is a lazy person\'s game... LMA√ò, I wish they would show me the games they play while they are running, swimming & mountain climbing "while" they play, smh HAHA!',
       'I love the concept and it\'s been great to see how far this game has come, but I\'ve been playing since beta and nearly every update wipes my save data and forces me to restart. Luckily, I don\'t get too far into the game each time, but it is frustrating and enough of a buzz kill for me to drop two stars. If there was a cloud system implemented for saves this game would be a five star in my book',
       'Incredible game. Awesome concept. Two complaints to developers. High speed loop-when you win, it starts detracting points. And also certain mph based drag races,I run out of road but the challenging car gets like 60 miles of road. Besides these, fantastic game.',
       'I think this game is amazing! And is perfectly good in every way!! I can\'t stop playing and look forward to getting new cars. There is just one tiny error that bugs me a bit but I can cope with it. The error is the color of the Ford fiesta xr2. When you race someone else and they have this vehicle on the card the car is black with a tiny red trim on the side but when it\'s on the track it is completely red. I do hope you can will fix this small mistake but apart from that this game is great!!! Thanks for reading :)',
       'Multiplayer is not fair. Have the same car with lower 0-60 time better traction, and higher mph but still lose. Match play is getting worse. I either have to spend a boatload of money or always come in last place.',
       'This is an amazing game and I think Hutch Games did an amazing job putting the collecting and racing features of the game together. Buying packs is very expensive, but in some ways it is a nice challenge to work hard to get the thrill of opening a pack. I love being able to collect and race so many real cars. For a suggestion however, I think it would add a lot to the game if Hutch Games made it so there was a section where you could put the cars that your keeping only for collecting. It would just be easier to get them away from the cards that your using to race.' ],

     [ 'So I\'m changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it\'s a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I\'d rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!',
       'GAME CODE reveals ROLLS ARE NOT RANDOM - they\'re pulled from a table of predertirmined outcomes, designed to MILK YOU FOR MONEY at a set rate, based on PvP, reg. Game, Event, Boss, etc.  Just like slot machines & video poker (which i programme).  You must \'assemble\' high scoring games, like a puzzle, with majority of yahtzees sitting after 4 or 8 rolls (1 or 7 bonus \'dice\'(money) spent)... Like a choose your own adventure book that can cost Hundreds of Dollars.',
       'This game is fun but I don\'t know if it\'s a bug or they\'re doing it on purpose but it seems like you can never win the extra challenges they do to win prizes.  I have watched the game say I lost when there\'s no way the computer opponent could have gotten enough points to be me. I messaged the game creators about it and never got a response. I\'m about to uninstall this game.',
       'Scopely is the most greedy, disgusting company I have ever seen. The ads they have littered into the game play literally crash the game at least 4 times during a match. You will see about 10 ads on top of the crashing per game; you could be in mid roll and the ad will ruin it. So desperate for money.. Don\'t support scopelys terrible practices.',
       'This game cheats! Don\'t get me wrong, I love it and am going to keep playing. But WAY more often than it should, it tallies up your opponents score wrong to make you lose. I count and take screen shots. If you get upset at things like that, it isn\'t for you. But if you don\'t care that much, like me, it\'s absolute fun! Adorable names given! Awesome dice to win! Very entertaining! Battle real people or the game! Just don\'t be a sore loser even when mathematically your a winner!',
       'I\'ll give this game more than one star once the showdowns are less about the computer clearing and more about real challenge.  Once you start a showdown the computer conveniently never gets a bad roll.  Which wouldn\'t be a big deal except you have to wait to challenge them again unless you want to pay for extra dice which is used to unlock everything else.  Kinda cheap.' ],

     [ 'It just lags now. The new update made it to where my chat, my character, and my animations won\'t work. I run about as fast as a turtle, and I am not pregnant. Please fix!!!! I love this game. I have a few questions if you don\'t mind... Can you guys add in multi-player mode, like single player mode, that we can pick up our pups, it would be cool to add that option in the top left menu. Thank you guys so much!! Love the games!!',
       'Most realistic wolf sim I have found out there, with the ability to get a mate, have cubs and your own den in which you can invite players into. There are also multiplayer game servers and an ability to create your own public or private game. You can also play as a wolf, fox or lynx and customize eyes, pelts and add masks/hats and scars/clothing. Its just AMAZING! Also saying that you don\'t have to pay to play and in-game currency is easy to get.',
       'I have only had this game for a few days, so I can\'t write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it\'s up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.',
       'Love it but pleeeeeaaaase make it possible to play as a boar or a rabbit or deer. Also I think it would be really nice to have a hunger and thirst bar because there is no real point in drinking. That way if you dont have enough food or water you start to lose health.  Also I don\'t think we really need stamina from the food we eat.  These are just suggestions but I really really love this game.  Best simulator out there.',
       'On one of the quest, I think 11. There ia a syrange new animal and I went to the game menu for information and there wasn\'t any. It looks like a brown rabbit, I tried killing Rabbits squirrels and deer, but It wasn\'t the right animal! Is it in the snow biome?  Anyways hope you can help me and otger quest 11 users. It\'ll be great that when you get the same animal twice it counts as duplicate. For example "Wolf Common Duplicate +(however acorns). Thanks and the update is great!',
       'Could you add more animals to play as? And a world idea could be a dessert. I love this game, and the others you\'ve made, so I know you will make awesome updates soon! Keep up the good work. If you fixed the glitch were you eat and jump at the same time you fly, if you fixed that can you please put it back. It was fun... XD' ],

     [ 'The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I\'d like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.',
       'Thanks for new upgrade . Even when the game was slow i didn\'t stop playing. I love this game. It\'s not only a game for me...i am a President of my club and i have to lead my members... in less than one year i reached level 50 and almost all land expanded...just  you have to understand how to play... be smart... some advice for beginners  start participate in mayor competition...this way you will grow faster',
       'I absolutely love this game. I play it all throughout the day. I\'ve made really good friends with the people in my club, and we are all over the somewhat new "club wars" feature. There was a lag, but it was recently fixed. There\'s always something to do in this game, and you can play at your own pace. You don\'t have to spend real money to play the game, but I\'ll admit that I spend a dollar every now and then for the 30 days of green buck income. I love this game so much that I\'ve even started a second city on another device with my other email.',
       'Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It\'s very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again',
       'I would of rated this 5 stars if I didnt loose all mt progress I tried logging in to google play but it said sorry mayor this city is linked to another device. This is the same phone I\'ve had it on so im really really ANGRY about it so yeah. Help me get my old city back ELECTRONIC ARTS . My city had over 100,000 population I had the airport Dr vu\'s tower and the port and everything else apart from the building so yea. Im so bummed. HELP ME PLZ',
       'Great game. But what I miss are written below.   1. Direct search & contact any city.   2. Invite a city to be friend from within game.   3. Direct private message with a city from within Game.   4. Make a city tagged as favourite city or liked city.   5. Want a clean viewing mode of own city without those construction hats and other info symbols on top of  building being constructed.  I think they are massively missed. And if you can provide these facilities then it will be the best game of it\'s class.' ],

     [ 'Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can\'t without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.',
       'First up the images used as what the game looks like are fakes. I saw too many polygons.... (Shudder) Secondly there is no start menu. NOPE! Just some fancy loading screen and boom you\'re in the game without a chance to look at the controls. Plus your first mission is ruined by the tutorial at the worst places on the track.   Bad game knockoff. If you download this just delete it. This game is [EXPLICATIVE]',
       'Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that\'s excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.',
       'Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?',
       'Update: so I\'ve been playing for several weeks now. You cannot win with maxed out mods, racing the same level cars. They\'re twice as fast and you can only knock off 3 cars at the beginning of the race and you\'re unable to catch with others. Even if you spend money, you will not get 1st place in a lot of the races. Very unbalanced game. Whoever programmed the ai should be fired  Fun game, but the intrusive ads are ridiculous. It pops up in the middle of a race, before and after the race, finished off by asking you to pay to remove ads.',
       'I don\'t know what the game is even like. I couldn\'t even get past the loading part because it won\'t let me tap on the screen.  I find this very irritating because I like trying out new car games. But please promise me you won\'t play this game any further as its a waste of your time.' ],

       'I like the game, it helps pass time. My only complaint is you make it super hard to do anything without having tonso3ns real money. Which is ridiculous. I get that you need to make money off of this, but don\'t be so ridiculous about it.',
       'I never pay for supplies in these types of games but with this one there\'s no point in playing anymore if I don\'t. You simply can\'t earn enough coins to keep playing. Additionally their ratios for resources are all over the place. I often found it didn\'t make sense to use the "higher" option when a lower faster option was more cost effective. I will be deleting now at level 6',
       'Such a great and fun game but you can\'t do anything without buying food, money and diamonds with real money. No videos or exchange options. Would have played a lot longer if these options were available instead op purchasing with real money. Such a shame.',
       'I really enjoy thie game especially the archipelago tasks. The quests on my island are pointless and so hard to do though. It took ke about a week to save up 1000 coins to give to the mumumba guy.  This is really a long time to earn money. Its a little better now with the adverts as you can skip times and earn coins watching videos.' ],

     [ 'Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven\'t gotten very far yet. Thing I DON\'T like is you don\'t get an average..... IF you do, I\'ve yet to find where it is in the game. That\'s in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! üòâüíØ',
       'So far I really like plating this game. Its the best bowling app I\'ve tried. The only thing I don\'t like is that most of the balls are level locked. I understand why its designed that way but I would like to see a better selection to purchase with chips that aren\'t level locked. Also, provide more ways to get cash and diamonds besides only being able to purchase them.',
       'Quick fire is the best but theres only one down fall, the seconds. When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. üëçüëçüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..',
       'I have been playing for months and spent a fair bit of money on this app and also was enjoying playing until all of a sudden all the graphics went pink and now i cant play. Not happy!!! How do i fix it? Don\'t want to delete it really as i will loose all my chips and special balls. Someone help please !?!?',
       'I did like this fame but my lane keeps turning pink along with the ball so I can\'t actually see anything like where the ball is going.... and on quick fire again turns everything pink and don\'t let me take any shoots what do ever.. think it\'s a glitch in the game I\'m not sure but tried restarting the game and the same thing is happening again and again... on all the different lanes and extra games in bowling king...',
       'It\'s a  fun game but it\'s rigged. I think if you have a billion chips you shouldn\'t be able to play on lower lanes. I thought you were supposed to be matched up with people who are the same or close level. How is it I\'m bowling against someone who is level 171 and 8 billion chips and  I\'m level 43 .' ],

Making one mistake at lvl 190+ and then having to go back to zero was so frustrating it was the main reason i uninstalled.

I have played many coco games, (almost all of them) but this one is the bestest of them all (if that\'s a word üòú) mainly because A LOT is unlocked including the SPA!!! (Crazy, right?!?!?!) and there are so many things to do. Plus it also reminds me of subway surfers..... The one thing I love besides the spa, is the restaurant. As far as I know, only fitness girl has that..... So definetly, it\'s a plus..... üëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòã',

Gems too difficult to earn without buying them, and purposely easy to accidentally spend them. Too many ads too. I\'d rather have paid for the game. Deleted it after a  day or so.',
       'Game has so much potential and is a blast. I\'m giving it a bad rating because gems are insanely expensive and they have so many buttons to hit to "use 200 gems to remove 3 lines" as one example or another to lose 200 by placing the button right above the back button on a phone. Super lame move on devs to intentionally take insanely expensive gems from us by mistake. No confirmation or anything, just boom, gone. Lacks ethics to say the least rinow',
       'Not What It Used To Be  The second to last update I did for this app switched the aim of the ball to slightly off from where you point it. So now have to compensate (guess a bit) when you\'re aiming which makes play more challenging.  Likewise, levels beyond about 440 are becoming impossible to beat w/o saving like a weeks with of bonuses to use on each level. Beating one level a week is hardly fun anymore! I may be uninstalling this app soon.',

I just got a new phone and was bummed to have to start all over (had gotten to level 360) but my new phone came with an updated/better version so now I\'m stoked on it all over again.

       'Great game, Love it! Very creative, fantastic graphics. Not so difficult or loss of life\'s to where you can\'t even play.  Yet still challenging.  Only negative is lots of ads. Would gladly pay nominal fee to get rid of them.',

This game is perfect because it\'s not so difficult that it\'s not fun and I don\'t have to worry about wasting my money on imaginary things!',

It\'s challenging but I\'ve yet to get completely and frustratingly stuck. This feels like a game designed for fun not to make money though "buying lives"',

I am pissed off that they went after hashbro but not other knock offs. I liked MLP Puzzle Party this game is so boring. Not only they ripped off peak games they ripped off the music from Genies and Gems from Jam City. I will uninstall!' ],

Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.',

The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)',

There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn\'t have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it\'s Definitely Not a game you\'d wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!',

It\'s sad that even after so many feedbacks given for excessive advertisements still developers are running with it.

And when it comes to Movement just in General....my Main Problem, But NOT the Only Problem was the Movement in Exactness of where I\'m Trying to Move my Guy (My/the Shooter) just Stinks!! - The Game itself....I Love It!!!',

    description: 'This is by far the most flexible word search app on the market. Multiple configuration options create a game that exactly corresponds to your device and your expertise.Play with an English word list or choose one of 23 other languages.Designed for fun games from the smallest mobile phones up to the largest tablets.Bored of seeing the same words appear repeatedly? Frustrated at looking for bizarre words that are not even English? Struggled with grids that are inappropriate for your device or difficult to read? Word Search Ultimate solves all these problems. You can configure:1) Grid size    Specify exactly how many columns and rows to use (from 3 to 20). Even non square grids (e.g. 12x15) are possible.2) Screen layout    Choose how much screen space for the grid and how much for the word list, using our unique movable split bar.3) Difficulty of the game    Specify approximate proportion of words that are written diagonally, backwards or vertically (e.g. allow no diagonal or backwards words, ideal for introducing children to Word Search).4) Difficulty of the words    Specify the size of the dictionary to generate a game, from the 500 most common words (good for kids and language students), up to 80,000 words.5) Maximum # of words    Choose the maximum number of words to find in one game, from 1 to 150. This will provide enough words to fill a 20x20 grid.6) Minimum & Maximum word length    This helps avoid searching for many small words (a common problem in word apps). Also useful for specifying really difficult games (e.g. set both minimum and maximum word length to three).7) Highlighting    Mark the already found words, or keep the grid unmarked and easy to read.8) Word list layout    The word list can be arranged in columns for easy reading, or close to each other to minimize screen space.9) Language    Choose the language of the word list, from a large range of downloadable dictionaries.  24 languages are currently available (see below).10) Orientation    Can be played in portrait or landscape mode. Just rotate your device and the display adjusts automatically.11) Word categories    Choose the words to find from a range of categories; e.g. animals, food etc.This app gives you the ultimate power to play the game just the way you want.Each game is assigned a difficulty level from 0 (easy) to 9 (very hard). The difficulty level is determined by the settings. Each difficulty level maintains the high scores (measured by fastest time to complete the game). The game displays the best 20 scores for each difficulty level.Compare your high scores with others around the world by using Google Play\'s "Game Services".Other features unique to this app:1) Two methods of selecting words: (i) the classic swipe (ii) by touching the first and last letter of the word from the grid.2) Game aid if you are having difficulty. You can choose to reveal a word that you cannot find.3) View the definition of the word from an online source (e.g. Wiktionary), optimized for viewing on a small screen.4) When you play with a word list in a foreign language, the word definition will (where possible) be in your own language. This is great for language learning!Additional Features planned for a future version of this app:1) Blind mode.  The word list is hidden. Instead you must find the words within the grid. Useful in combination with word categories.2) Play against others.3) Give us feedback on other features you would like to see.Dictionaries available are English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, French, German, Italian, Indonesian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Serbian(Latin), Serbian(Cyrillic), Slovak, Slovene, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian and more coming later',

     [ 'Alright, so the game is pretty good. All I ask for is more tricks, and the ability to upgrade some bonuses (coin magnet, feather hover thing, and the third one that I haven\'t grabbed yet.) All in all, if you could do that, it\'d make the game so much greater. Apart from skipping missions and revives there\'s no use for coins.',
       'The thing that makes this game great is the visuals and the audio. It is absulutley beautiful and the art style works so well with the type of game. Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I\'d very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there\'s a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style',
       'Good graphics, but can get boring after only like 3 minutes. Also the makers of the game should add a another different mode where your running away from a villager/camper and see how far you can get. You could improve or modify this mode that i have made if you want',
       'The game is addictive, but i cannot play it more than 10 minutes at a time, because it gets boring. The awful part is that since 1 week, i dunno why, it crashes while i\'m playing.. Anyway, it\'s addictive because after you start playing, you start thinking about it while you\'re not playing',
       'First off, I\'d like to give a big thank you to the developers for this game. It\'s amazing.  However, I\'ve been encountering quite a few bugs lately. One day, picking up a hover feather crashed the game. Today, I can\'t pick up llama horns, and the background blur that happens when you go into the workshop stayed into an actual run. I took this as a challenge and continued playing. I\'m on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 9.7 running Android Marshmallow.  This is just to tip you guys off on some bugs.',
       'Was really enjoying it until the most recent update. You guys broke the ad version. Now no ads play to get a revive. Disappointing as it was working fine. Why oh why did I say yes to the update? It\'s as if you wanted to force free players to buy the paid version.' ],
    recentChanges: 
     [ '+ Improved the Premium Alto\'s Adventure experience! To get back into the action faster, Premium users now receive one revive for free per run.',
       '+ Fixed an issue with watching ads for coins.',

And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.',

     [ 'This game is perfect for anyone who loves magic, fantasy, collecting, and a whole new level of adorable! Dragonvale takes everything to the next level! I highly recommend it, as it is a amazing game, my most played, and I hope everyone else enjoys it just as much as I do. Five stars! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü Edit 2: I was re-organizing my islands by Element the other day, and I had just finished the Plant Island. I put down a Oversized Oak Tree, and immediately, a image flashed through my mind: a young girl, sitting on a branch of the oak tree, a book in one hand, a baby Plant dragon sitting next to her. Stretched out in front of them was my Plant Island, the dragons freely soaring, the other islands in the distance. And that sparked a inspiration in my head. I just wanted to ask; can I write a Dragonvale book, which takes place at my park? Please let me know !  :)',
       'Cmon Backflip! Okay look I love Dragonvale, I\'ve been playing it forever. First off I lost my amazing park a while back and that really sucked. But now I am restarting and I go to buy the beginners pack for 9.99 and it says there was an error and i wont be charged...come to find out it did charge me and i didnt receive anything! Please help',
       'I have been playing for a while. After events you get a day to turn in your event specific currency for the prizes, even though the event has ended. Well for Gardenia\'s event, it turned in all my roses before I could exchange them. I had over 25,000 and was so pumped to get the new dragons. Now I don\'t have any roses and 25,000,000 extra coins i don\'t need. Please help. This is a very frustrating bug.',
       'I really love collecting all of the dragons and the fact that you can theme/decorate your park too. But the amount of types of decorations are unbalanced, the majority that you can currently buy in the market are just plant and earth type while there are very few decorations of the other types (such as air, cold, etc).',
       'When I first had it it was super fun. Then I saw a game I wanted so I deleted it I did that before and got it back I could log into facebook and go to my old island. But this time I could not. I was so far and looking forward to seeimg my dragons but it did not let me go to my old island. It left me im tears that I had to do what I did all over again. So I deleted this stupid game and gave this. If I could rate 0 I would',
       'its ok, and you might think you cant li e without it, but trust me.... after a while year of playing, which is what i have waited to wrote this review, the game play becomes very repetitive. sure try it out, its fun, but not something for the rest of your life. dont put money into it, you will regret ir later.' ],

     [ 'Awsome game. Completed all levels without any hack jzt waited  for hope   ( the lives ) evrbdy shld try this. Sry i gonna uninstall this app only bcoz i finished all levels. Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.',
       'The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don\'t get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new "enemies". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you\'ve lost some lives. But that\'s not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.',
       'I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It\'s more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.',
       'Remember the old days when platformers taught you through trial and error how to interact with new game mechanics? If you don\'t like that, you\'ll hate this game. So much fun, so creative, and once you start to get down one of the new features, it ramps it up and keeps you learning creatively how to beat the level. I love this game, it\'s a fantastic platformer that will challenge you to learn as you go instead of giving you a tutorial every time something new comes up.',
       'Completed all but just couldn\'t get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I\'ve ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.',
       'I love this game üòçüòç it is my favourite but.... I don\'t like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it\'s a great ideaüòãüòã btw i loved it üòçüòçüòç ill give it 5 stars thenüòäüòä' ],

     [ 'I absolutely love love LOVE this game. Im no bot i swear. This game is so addictive. Gameplay is great. A few suggestions however. Sometimes i find my "sword" just going right through some fish, and it doesnt kill them. Also, maybe switch up some ways to get Stars. I find myself saving so much to get the 99k sword fish and never buy any other fishes. I feel like the players should work their way up slowly and not have to play with only the "daily reward" fishes. Just my suggestion  Thank you guys!',
       'Great game, good servers, rarely any lag, and addicting. However, the price for characters is pretty steep, their not even worth buying since you\'ll get better daily characters by the time you have enough stars to buy a good character. Save up for the end game characters. Also, the left joystick is fairly close to the edge of the screen and makes it a little hard to stay on the screen. You get use to it after a while but it would be nice to have other control setups or custom controls.',
       'Great game. Just the spawns on Kill the King and stuff suck since people can spawn right in you. Also, it is kinda rigged when you have the default fish vs someone with one of the best ones.',
       'You guys have so much potential and you can do allot I know it! Dab on the HATERS (even though there hating you because they can\'t make a game and hate ads) but one thing WHY IS ALL CHARACTERS 99.99$ I know other games do it but still lower price and I will rate 5',
       'I love it so much I even play it 22. 3 a day.  But one problem is that you need to lower the skin price',
       'Addicting, Fun, Thrilling. It\'s absolutely a game you have to try. It\'s way fun, and a little competition never hurt anything, right? Keeps you on the top of your toes, or on the couch with your eyes glued to the screen.' ],

     [ 'Amazing game, great time-killer. I discovered a game breaker: if you go into the settings after you die, the number of coins you got in that level, [the number in the brackets] becomes equal to the total number of coins. Keep going back and forth into the settings, and the game will eventually ask if you want to triple the coins by watching a video. Instead of tripling the number of coins you got in that level, the number of total coins you have gets tripled.  Instantly triple your wallet every run.  I want the devs to see this and see if they can patch it because I really like this game and I want the coins I earn to be legit.  Thanks for your time, Mike C.',
       'It has a progression system, but it\'s completely worthless. The only reason to try to win belts is to get weapons that serve no purpose. You can win most of them by paying 200 coins and getting a random one, but you can, for some odd reason, get duplicates. Not to mention the fact that coin combos actually do nothing, not even useless cosmetic items, nothing. I think adding function to the weapons (e.g. Making long swords slightly longer range or making small weapons quicker) could add more depth and more of a reason to play the game. Overall: It\'s a good timekiller.',
       'Great game. Best for killing time. Great concept. Need to add a  counter for counting the number of people killed, otherwise awesome. Also there is not much incentive to play to win belts. Make playing with boss again free. Add new opponents (not bosses but the minions) . Make the game a little less challenging. Also remove the brief stun completely',
       'Really fun game. Nice graphics and simple controls. More depth to combat system would be nice. There is no point in achieving coin combos. It does not affect the amount of coins won. Add a multiplier for coin combos, as well as a score multiplier for chaining combos together without missing enemies or coins. Don\'t allow duplicate items to be won. Very annoying to grind and grind for coins, only to get a duplicate you can\'t do anything with. Lastly, an option to pay to disable ads would be nice.',
       'Good game. Though it could be better. Make range on weapons and protection when you have armor on. Then you should be able to unlock new settings besides the train. Multiplayer would be cool. Another (and the last) thing you could implement is a way for you to go back and beat the bosses you defeated already to earn money. Despite all the flaws I\'ve stated, it\'s a good game and time killer.',
       'The game gives you an unskippable mission to get kills with a certain type of weapon and then will never give you that weapon. I\'ve opened over 100 chests and never got a two handed sword, so my options are pay real money for the the weapon (what they want) or delete this cancer app. I get you have to make money but there are better ways than stopping all progression and ruining the fun. Overall good game 6.7/10' ],

     [ 'Amazing addictive game. Try it out! Not too many ads, and just the right amount of challenge without pulling your hair out. Sometimes there\'s a hidden dot in the title, or ones that are almost the same color as the background, but it\'s not bad enough to lose a star.',
       'Updated with no fix...  problem still persists.  No exit button and controls for the back button are very wonky. Need to add dedicated exit button or fix what happens when you tap / swipe the blank park of the screen. Trying to bring the controls up from their hidden state selects options is frustrating. You end up starting games. Very unpolished controls, imo.',
       'Cool game, only bad thing is that tutorial levels are rated as bronze so you can never have all gold.. I tried doing the same tutorial three times in a row, then it is counted as gold, but when you exit the game and enter again that it is bronze again',
       'Interesting puzzle type game.  Using rope is a bit challenging on small screens.  It used way too much background data which is not have related at all.  My phone gets hot when using the app.  Uninstalling',
       'Different and fun. Not too hard but still challenging.  Daily challenges are impossible to complete though (bug?) , so don\'t bother with them (hence my only giving 3 stars)',
       'This right here is a work of genius.  My only wish is for an undo button, for when you accidentally touch a part of the screen and it places a spot/cut/bridge in an unwinnable spot.  Especially annoying during daily challenge that you can\'t re-do.  Also, I would like to be able to retry any level, such as the daily or randoms, even if it wouldn\'t "count". I\'m convinced every so often there is an unwinable level, but you can\'t even test it or let the devs know because once you fail it goes away permanently.  Still, a great, great game... I really hope there is a V2 some day.' ],

       'This game is great but it could be so much better.   1. The expert AI is too easy to beat. Risk players normally gang up on an opponent, if they are dominating. There should be a legendary option.  2. It would be nice to have a match summary and timeline at the end of a game.    3. There should be an auto-save game feature when playing against the AI, in case the game drops out.  Edit: They seem to have addressed my third point.',
       'Very unfair, questionable dice rolls against computers, obviously rigged so that on single player you can never win, and then online it pits you against people who are expert when you\'re a beginner so you can clearly never win. Very rigged, fun when you get the chance to play which is once every 12 hours due to them asking you to buy the premium version. Highly unfair',

Every single time I play my turn (in a multi-player game that is) I get disconnected! .. and I\'ve to replay it again .. only to get disconnected again! and so on and so on till my time runs out. Sometimes in the middle of all this \'replaying\' I even lose my troops to other players .. VERY FRUSTRATING! And No .. I\'ve both a very good data and wifi connections.',

     [ 'Okay listen, this app is surely good and relaxing, but I must say, i am having trouble with getting the game right easily. What I am trying say is sometimes the game freezes and I am coming upon some glitchey reactions. I would really appreciate if you made the game a little more calm or just review some things you can edit. I would like to keep contact with you. So if you have any suggestions on how you can make the game a little better just let me know. I\'m looking forward to some edits here so I hope you can figure something out. I\'m not trying to be bossy, I\'d just wanted a little arrangement for your game. So just keep working hard on your games. Thank you very much! Okay now I gotta play the game. Bye!',
       'UPDATE- STILL NO MORE LEVELS ONCE I\'VE GOTTEN TO 1190.. IF THIS IS THE END PLEASE LET ME KNOW SO I CAN DELETE APP AND MY HUSBAND CAN STOP WASTING HIS TIME PLAYING IT!!! ITS BEEN COUPLE WEEKS AND NO NEW LEVELS HAVE BEEN ADDED, SO RATING IS NOW GOING DOWN. FIX THIS PLEASE! I love this game but I\'m on level 1190 and there is not another level after this. It did this before on a lower level and after a few days there were more levels. I shouldn\'t have to wait for levels to load up or the game itself reload levels.... my husband is going to catch up to me!!! Fix this please!',
       'I\'m not trying to be a hard ass, but I take issue when games like yours automatically goes into a tutorial mode instead of offering it as a choice. It drives me crazy. If your game gave the user the choice of either to use the tutorial or not my ratings would be between 4 & 5 stars.',
       'Does what it says on the label. Airplane mode takes care of the ads. Happy to make a purchase to remove them though. Good time wasting game. Thanks guys for a great app!',
       'Forcing you to watch timed adds even after you win a level is bs. Its jarring, pulls you out of the game and makes the whole thing suck',
       'The only game I keep playing until level 450 and above, and still going. The only minus is there are too many ads, but it\'s no problem when you\'re on WiFi. Keep up the good work.' ],

     [ 'Love this game...best WWE Game on mobile, and I\'ve played them all. So addicting I spend money on it. I do wish it was easier to get TP, and tokens to level up superstars. I\'ve been playing for almost a year, and have EASILY spent 6 or 700 on this game, and only have 1 three star superstar....only because i bought TP  and Arn Anderson crate over Christmas!! For some reason, I\'m still addicted.',
       'Real talk. The game is a blast but if you are going into it thinking its free to play you will be in the pit of misery for a long time. It takes money to get up to par really quick and its always fun to watch the cpu combo you to death when you have 0 control over it. But take the bs with the good and its a fun game but dont think for free is for me on this one. Gotta pay to play.',
       'Much better update. Battery life is actually decent. No freezes yet. I like the new system to make more coin. Still a grind, but I don\'t mind. I spend some money here and there. Suggestions: bring women\'s division. Unlock finishers, seriously, Bray Wyatt doesn\'t use a Stone Cold Stunner. Please add new music. Thanks!',
       'Love the game except now it\'s not going past the loading screen and can\'t get on to play has been like it since last update... have waited giving the benefit of the doubt that a new update may come and fix whatever bug has caused the issue but still no joy... please fix galaxy s8 new update still not working',
       'Overall its a great game. Problem is once I do a feud, after the brawl.is over, the page keep flashing. I cannot do fued anymore. I have to leave faction and rejoin, all my previous top 10 scores are reset. Its keeps occuring. Anyway to rectify?',
       'This is a casino game not puzzle game. Because this game always depends on luck. Every event, every pull, every bags, every milestone boxes all are checking the luck just like casino games. I give maximum performance in this game in December and February event, but i get nothing from the events.They kick my ass every time.They always show that, u get this rewards from this event, but there is no chance to get the rewards. I will be say, if u like casino game, so u will be enjoy this game.but i hate casino game, I like puzzle game, that\'s why i don\'t like this game.' ],

It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn\'t like how easy the drawings were and I don\'t think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn\'t recommend this game if you don\'t like colouring. It\'s ok!!!!',

Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn\'t color the whole background, because what if you didn\'t want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!',

You just colour and then press the pencil button ontop of the rubber in the pictures right bottom corner and then do the glow pen thing . Some people may don\'t know so that\'s why they don\'t like it . It\'s good when your travelling or when your bored . O THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!I like it',

     [ 'I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.',
       'I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn\'t work.  So I pressed the \'X\' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I\'m pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE \'X\'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I\'m triggered.  Please fix that.',
       'I really, really love this game, but, I keep losing my ball count and I don\'t understand why this is happening. For instance, I have 90 balls and I\'m supposed to have 92, I don\'t get the 92. I will give 5 stars until the bug is fixed. The ads I don\'t care about because that only happens at the end of each game which is ok. Please fix this so I can give you 5 stars.  Update- I figured out why I keep losing my count with my balls. Everytime I get the balls by the number blocks, it wouldn\'t count themüòê I could get a lot further if this was fixed. If this keeps on happening, I\'m going to uninstall this game. I hope it doesn\'t come to that because I really love this game. Please fix asap!!',
       'If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.',
       'It\'s good at first but you\'ll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.',
       'Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I\'m not spoiling it, but I will tell you it\'s a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don\'t know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.' ],

I\'m not trying to be mean but maybe there could be some other leotards and the update and some more hair dues because all of those buns and people may not like that\'s just buns people may want the braids that you always have in your other games. I mean the French braids and they keep going down into a braid, all those things would be nice!',
       'Its os fun how you want it to be. But pls do more like the balance beam and vault because this game is just right for me the cool thing about this is pretty much everything but pls do the balance beam and the vault becuase im liking this! All the features are really working well but when you spin the gymnast to get a little look it is like laggingüò£ but i love this game totally 5 stars! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü! Who ever made this app its so great keep on the updates! And pls pls PLS tell me if theres an update of the balance beam and the vault!',
       'This is from my daughter, "I like the game but there\'s some things about it I kind of don\'t understand. Some of the controls are a little difficult like the one where you have to tap 1 or tap 2 when she\'s practicing. And its fun. Some of it I like a lot."   This is from me, "the app is annoying until you buy it. It downloaded a ton of icons (ads for other games) to my picture gallery without informing me. My daughter likes the game a lot and it\'s fun, but a bit intrusive with the free version. The gameplay is good overall."',
       'I downloaded this game for my little sister and the first thing she said was that there are way too many adverts and I agree because whenever she clicked on say the dress up or nail salon or gym and adverts would always come up. The game also lags too much even though she has a brand new IPad. However at this time I would not recommend this game. My sister said that she would play the game again if you reduce and have a limited amount of adverts. As well as the advert problems the game keeps telling me to buy everything and it pops up every time I think when you press the \'X\' button it shouldn\'t show again. Please fix this now. As much as my sister loves this game the adverts really annoy her. Would not recommend this game!!',
       'It was reqlly fun to play but it really repetitive doing the same thing! I wish the  vault and beam comes out and maybe a freeplay side of the game then a stroy and aslo bigger events!',

     [ 'Pretty cool game. Like the simple concept of taking something we have all done at one time or another and turning it into a video game.  Genius. I really like the sense of accomplishment I get when I make a trick shot like a bank shot off the boss\'s head and no rim just straight in! It\'s like he shoots he scores! The crowd goes wild! ..fake crowd roar...',
       'The game makes me feel things down in my nether region super fun to play. When I throw the paper ball I\'m like sweeeeeeeeet. I daydream about playing when I\'m at work. The second I get home I get undressed and play me some paper toss.  Thanks you guys over at paper Toss you really know how to have a great time. If you guys would like to hang out some time and toss some paper I\'d be down. hit me up some time',
       'After the last update the game sucks so bad. Tons of add, lag, the interface moves poorly, after 5 minutes i just gave up and uninstalled it. Used to be so much fun before. Please go back to the previous versiob!',
       'I had given up on life and was resigned to spending the rest of my days in isolation, a stranger to socialising. Then this game entered my life and has completely transformed me and changed my life forever. Thank you for turning me into a complete and utter tosser.',
       'Golden rule- never fix what\'s not broken. Applies here. Paper Toss 2 a great game & addictive, didn\'t need upgrading to Paper Toss Boss! Also why were my past high scores & achievements not retained? Disappointing.',
       'Wow, this game is fantastic! How have I not downloaded this before?? The controls are easy to use and very responsive. So far I haven\'t run into any bugs so that\'s good. I really enjoy using different objects to throw in place of the paper ball, which is actually my favorite. The fact that each object is affected differently by the fan makes this game flavorful. Really great job with this!!' ],

     [ 'A very fun and addictive game. I make bows all day, but it\'s nice to be able to shoot from my couch at night.  The influence of wind on the arrow is accurate when it comes to drift. A little costly on the upgrades for those that don\'t buy their way to the top, but all games are that way.',
       'Starts off ok but completely rigged to deplete your coins and to get you to spend money. Bow repairs and inconsistent wind effects among a couple of tactics. Also payed to upgrade my bow and sights and it was gone next time I logged in.',
       'Love the game, BUT there\'s a glitch in chest bow where it locks up for 1 shot, multiple times a day. After you shoot without being able to aim, the bow works normal until the next jam. Looked for a place to submit info for possible fix, BUT game doesn\'t provide a place for feedback. This is only place to air complaints :(',
       'Ok game, but bingo mode is a huge pain.  My shots filled out the opponent\'s card better than mine.  Stupid way to lose a lot of progress/coins.',
       'I really like this game but it is quite frustrating that I played many times to get a new gear and spent 200 000 on one which has a red cross in it and makes it nearly impossible to shoot promptly. What a stupid idea to have a cross with the same colour as the board itself. They shouldn\'t be red, blue or yellow.',
       'Game was fine. Lately, keeps freezing and somehow opponents are getting 10\'s when I CLEARLY see them hitting nowhere near the middle. Matches are freezing while i\'m ahead, then match ends and says I lost. Somehow i\'ve lost 20 million coins, and not from legit losing either. I also just played a match for 1 million coins, i had over 1 million in the bank. I know sonehow have 0 after I clearly won the match but it said I lost.

     [ 'It\'s like owning your own transportation service like Uber or Lyft, but in arcade Crazy Taxi meets Monopoly. If you hire drivers to your service, you not only make more money, but you expand your  territory. I love the diversity of the characters, how you have new with the classic arcade characters like Axel, Gus and Gena. And I also love the concept is modern, but has the classic arcade concept and feel with the scratch cards, gems, and money. Bonuses are earned through accomplishing objectives, and of course, ads. Thanks Sega. üëåüëç‚ù§',

     [ 'After using it for more 2 weeks here is my review;  This is a great time killer and addictive too. Nice collections of tools, items, etc. But when we tried to play using wifi this lagged like anything. Dead slow and we had no fun of playing and competing. The developer may look into this or give us any guidance for smooth 1vs1 play via wifi.',
       'I just started playing this game and I don\'t think it\'s live matches. The opponents have ai style movements. I\'d like to play against other players in the matches. I\'ve been crushing the ai and want to try real people. But all in all it is very fun. Best badminton game I\'ve played yet. And most realistic too. I\'ve played badminton for about 15 years so it\'s nice to finally find a good badminton game.',
       'It lags everytime we use the multiplayer and the developer needs to look on the Bluetooth connection as well. Super lag. :( please update this coz I love this game a lot!  Update:  Wow! Thanks for giving me heads up! I seriously appreciate for looking into this. :) keep up the good work!',
       'Hi,  It\'s been almost one month i am using this game. But there are many problems in this game: 1. game is slow in a multi player mode. 2. Most of the time if you play one on one using wifi or personal hotspot. The game will connect you with yourself only. 3. Most of the time you\'re unable to connect with with your friends only. In a month i connected with my friend thrice only.  I have a screenshot also where you can see that the game is sending a join request to myself only not my friend.',
       'decent minimalist animation, so game is smooth since u are against ai/bot. pretty much wont lose, when u have unlock all item and stats. need an update for tournament against real player. and additional moves or trick to create a bit complexity and thrill to the game. if u like something easy and relaxing this is the game.',

     [ 'Good game but be warned to really get any good characters you\'re either going to have to pay lots of real money or you\'ll find yourself grinding forever the same nodes to upgrade the characters that you have. With that said this game is a big improvement over heroes of dragon age of which in many ways this game is modeled after . It seems very clear that some of the devs from that game migrated to this game to start it up. The last update at 02-26-18 freezes at loading screen and then force closes come on devs get on this!',
       'I love this game but an issue im having since the newest update os why im giving 2 stars at the moment. Ever since the update the game will not load. Says "loading cantina" then closes the app completely. Im gonna end up getting kicked out of my guild...please fix this! Soon as its fixed it will return it to 5 stars bc the overall game is badass!',
       'I played this on and off since it started but now I am back full-time and it has always been improving and growing. Big star wars fan and can\'t get enough of it? This is the next best thing. The game is very complex so I suggest if you are only starting out, check out starter guides on youtube on how to have the best head start  and enjoy! üéâ',
       'My game had been freezing after last update. I ended up turning wifi off and using mobile data once it got to the update it asjed if i wanted to switch back to wifi. I did this turned off mobile data and it has worked now. On android hope this helps some other people out',
       'Fun to play  but remember keep up grading thru the gamewith your charaters of all range of types and you will have fun remember the further you go the better your characters will play for you best of luck... be prepared to be flogged alot before you know it you start winning but its all about strategy in your attack as well as your player strength and abilities good luck and MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU...',
       'Graphics are good, turn based matches are decent to play.  Not a casual game, you have to be pretty devoted, takes a lot of time to play with so many daily events.  Character packs can be pretty expensive if you want to buy them rather than grind (think ¬£80 for a couple of characters, then the cost to level them, talking hundreds).  All the best characters coming out now are behind a pretty steep pay wall.  If you go on holiday or mover over time zones, the payout times remain the same meaning you either have to play at strange local times or dump your account.  Lots of people have complained but it is just ignored.  Lose a * for that region bug and another for ignoring it.' ],

     [ 'Very realistic and nice game. Missions and descriptions are entertaining. Controls are also great.   Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!',
       'Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!',
       'What is this. I was on level 1 and i just got to the last checkpoint and when I had to land it crashed when it took so much effort into going through them checkpoints.

I would assume that they have been "hacked" somehow to display these fake scores.  The developer should cap the high score at the number that is literally the highest possible score (based on the size of the board)',

When i was building on that high score, the screen glitched and swiped a number of times, ruining the order of the numbers. This has happened on multiple occasions only in this app. It\'s not such a big problem for people that are newer, but when you\'ve got big numbers, such as 8192, it makes the game unplayable.',

     [ 'The game controls are very annoying. The character won\'t go where you want him to. During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don\'t want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn\'t want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.',
       'Maybe the reason people think its boring. It\'s probably because they are boring and lame. I beat the first level without a problem, they didn\'t because they feel like everything should be easy and they shouldn\'t have to work hard for anything. The game is challenging and fun if you like a challenge. If your a lame, whinny, expect nothing to be hard, and can\'t handle a challenge as tough as making toast, then this game isn\'t for you.',
       'These other reviewers are jerks! Lol. The game is awesome! And my 4 year old can even play it well!  I like it so much, I\'m downloading it onto my phone (4 yr old plays it on my old phone)  just to see how far I can get lol',
       'NC and you know what you doing today beautiful lady and her husband to be with u but I can\'t wait till I see you in the car and my mom said she will be here for me to go to the store and get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get the money for the first time I was just wondering if you want to be a good day at work and I don\'t know what I',
       'This game is stupid because you have to get a part of the key just to get more lives and the bad guys are technically cheating because they have guns I made it to the last level and it was impossible to beat the boss because he puts fire everywhere on the second level the guy keeps shooting you so it took me an hour to get off that stupid level  it took me about five days to get of the last level but I suggest that you just play the first level. This was a ripoff it doesn\'t make sense to wait that long for a stupid freaking game I\'m to cool for that dumb game. Another thing that is stupid about the game is the remote controls its confusing because they all look the same they should put the names of what that control does in the buttons. And the thing builds the stuff for you at a scale of 1 to 10 I pick 1  I rather play with realistic legos than the iPad ones don\'t waste your time on waiting for the game to download  its a ripoff',
       'It is awsome I love how on the last level (the black night) has two levels the black night and the vampire  the whole game is so fun I\'m done the whole game still play it all the time  but it needs more levels love it so much  so it needs MORE LEVELS' ],

     [ 'I\'m really fond of this game and love the gameplay and quick paced matches. The new update is AMAZING!   There are a few things that would make this game extra perfect for me!   Must have character customisation. This would be of big amazing to me. Char customisation makes me bind more to certain characters. The rings we get don\'t have much value to them except for upgrading the characters.  Could have non-ranked matches. I would love the option to play/practice against rivals or my own friends.   Should have quick chat responses. Would like to communicate before and after the match with simple reactions. Like Good luck and I win, tee-hee!',
       'To many ads unless you make some kind of purchase. Loading screens seem to take longer than I\'d like. You can\'t at this time play with friends as Opponents are automatically chosen. There is still some characters ability noise in the game even if you have music and sound off. I\'d like to see characters abilities not to be so similar, but it isn\'t taking away from the game at the moment for me. With all that said though the graphics are great, the game is fun, and it\'s worth the $1.99 purchase I made.',
       'This is one of the best mobile games I have played I a while. I probobly have a bias sense I love Sonic so much. However, if one thing could be added I would say it should be a converter for the Red Star rings to normal rings. Unless you want them to be payed for. I don\'t really care either way I\'ll just buy the Red Star rings but I brought up that idea because I currently have 23,000 rings just kinda waiting to be spent. Maybe incorporate phone backgrounds or some customizations for the game that cost extra rings? Thankyou so much for the new update and if anyone I\'d debating on installing it just get it. You\'ll have fun, trust me.',
       'Love the game, but there\'s something wrong.. Well... I think Cream is kinda rigged. Her items are a bit OP for the other players which makes it an easy stage into a extremely hard stage. And also, the deduction of trophies in 4th place is too much! Please make it lower (like maybe at around 5 or 8) and change the deduction of trophies in 3rd place 0 (These are all just suggestions I have). If you read this SEGA, your games are great and keep up the good work!',
       'This game is if Sonic Dash mixed with Racing. And I LOVE IT!!! One suggestion I have that I don\'t think many online multiplayer games have, add some sort of singleplayer mode. Otherwise, great game! I like that it\'s free with ads being removable via in game purchases (which I did), controls, graphics, and soundtrack are outstanding, overall, I love the game, and I look forward to more updates in the future.',
       'Please add a custom character, there is one in the main game so there should be one here to. Also please add infinite, cubot, orbot, and eggman. Also some more variety of music and areas would be good. Thank you for reading and for the great game! :)  (Edit): we need a friending system and to be able to customize our characters so that we have SOMETHING to spend rings on. And Espio needs some serious buffing because right now, he is pathetic.' ],

     [ 'This game is ingenious and amazing, and the script is beautiful and gameplay is simple and straightforward, timeless, and fun, with increasing difficulty, but also, able to go back and compete against yourself for more Rewards. The user interface is spot-on, and the graphics are perfect. They scale well to any resolution and any aspect ratio, taking up the entire screen without any letterboxing. The actual gameplay is simply a 2 button gameplay, left and right, and yet, this game kept me busy for hours. It\'s addicting, but doesn\'t require you to consistently visit the app. It does not nag you in any way.  I have not seen a single advertisement, and the developer does not have any big paywall or reward system for paying. You will not need to spend any money on this.',
       'I think it is a good idea done well. I havent had any problems so far and the game os more than i expected. I thought the game would just be full of mindless levels but it is not. It even has a cool story and i cant wait to see how it plays out. There ia a cool mechanic wherd you get a speed boost the closer you are to the walls. I really enjoyed the game and i think it deserves 5 stars. This is the only mobile game i loved so much i actually made a review for.',
       'This is the best game ever, that I have ever played 1. I loved the story (You will know what I mean when you have played) 2. The controls are very strange and frustrate some people. But I think that\'s what make the game challenging 3. THE MUSIC. I loved the choices they have made with the music. It\'s really good love it 4. The graphics are really good couldn\'t ask for more 5. Really like the secrets   PS. Would like if you could at some kind of multiplayer when you have beaten the game  - Love Ln\'TCore',
       'Vey cool! Haven\'t finished it yet, though. The only thing that would make this better would be if the controls were a little bit better and more responsive  (which I know is hard to do on mobile or tablets), and some of the levels are nearly impossible  (at least for me). Nonetheless, I like it! Keep it up with the good work!',
       'Saw this before and saw 4.9 out of 5 with over 80,000 reviews. That\'s... unheard of on the store. So I came back to try it out. Completely worth it. Gameplay is flawless, visuals are gorgeously retro and vaporwave, the soundtrack is all retrowave from various artists, and the story is really good too. It\'s not often I rate games, and even then I\'m not excited when writing them. For this one I can\'t praise this game enough. Perfect retro-styled racing gem on Google Play.',
       'I don\'t often play games and I never review them. But this game absolutely merits five stars.       The writing is stunningly brilliant, kind of like if Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was made into an arcade game.  A very simple and somehow-complex 1980s arcade game.  With lots of fun and poignant nerdy jokes, and all female characters.      The story is full of mystery and human intrigue, and somehow also a nihilistic treatise on technology and how it functions in our life. And I sincerely apologize if that ruins any surprise for anyone still reading this review.' ],
