        "The first sign of a pathetic casino app is that they  never respond to public posts. Just another trashpile. Almost as sad as double down and that's saying something. Just another jackass casino. Plus I have no interest it waiting for this clunky piece of junk to load. Garbage. They could care less about your entertainment, they just want your money. Still a pile of manure.",
        "Just like every other online slot game, you start out winning big, lots of scatters and bonuses, but then comes day two when the wins stop and the loosing begins. All they want is for you to start sending your real money to buy their play money. The daily bonus on this game is pathetic. If you collect the daily bonus every day and save up for a month straight, you would probably be able to play for an hour or so.... That's If you keep your bets small.",
        "Hands down the best online casino app I have had the pleasure of playing I just wish you guys would have had wild wolf or triple Fortune. Other than that it's a no brainer this is a must have app and I would recommend it to anybody who is in to playing slot machines. Thanks you guys",
        "i really enjoy playing these games But why all the adds, let me give you an example.  At the very last second of the game and the ball is kicked for a field goal and all of a sudden an add comes in that a challenge is over. Do u ger my point. This happens over and over again.",
        "It SUCKS! This is the biggest joke of an online casino.  Bet high and you lose every single time.  Hell, bet anything and you lose.  I have so much better play at a real casino where I actually win.  They randomly turn off features effectively shutting games down.  People need to be investigated.  Their rating of a 4.3 is a complete lie.  Every one I know rates this app 'bad.'   Every game on here plays worse than at a real casino!",
        "I thought everything was great. Then it has froze . With a round circle on the left side of the window. Says collect my $202 credits. Have uninstalled and reinstalled twice. Now I stopped can't play. I e en bought credits. Still partially frozen.  Help I"

        "I liked the game so much. No! I love it, but it's just that I'm now on level 65 but I'm stucked since I only have few gems left and I needed to extend the time, and buy some customers which I find amazing just to save your energy and the stage but I also find it hard since I have already completed 3 stars from lower levels and why is it that I can't play the levels I have already completed? I would really suggest that lower levels would still be played just to be able to collect gems. I hope you can fix this issue though. I'm so loving this game and I'm getting addicted to it. I got stucked on level 65 on my two days of playing. Thank you",
        "Moving on is hard on some levels because they are specifically designed for you to use gems and they are hard to come by. However, If you are patient enough you can eventually earn them. I enjoy that you don't have to drag the items to the customers. It's definitely an enjoyable and challenging game. I'm currently at a \"coming soon\" stage where I can no longer move ahead. I've been waiting a long time and do not want to wait forever. Please do an update soon!!!",
        "I love this game! So few games actually suck me in, but this game had me addicted right away. I play on my phone and laptop. Yes I have two different games at different levels lol. I love how upgrades are so easy and it isn't impossible to upgrade or move on. It gets challenging as you go up levels but it's so fun.",
        "Great game but some levels really hard I cant pasd this one level im on for days maybe update make it easier pass level I'm on I just did update...I hope so... love game anyways great game to.. identical cooking joy to map was a great game to but also hard get passed certain levels that game to n I can try play fast with my hands to still cant pass to not playing  cooking joy anymore going stick with this one see if game gets easier to",
        "It's fun till you run out of energy. They get you too rate the game right away while you are having fun with free lives. Give you enough lives to rate it good then the lives end and you have to watch a min advert or 30 mins for one life Regen. OR PAY. They just want your money at that point. So sad.",
        "Brilliant little time waster of a game.. yet.. once you start getting to the higher levels.. the less chance of earning gems and i aint noway paying for them.. last time I stupidly paid for gems on cooking fever..and got my account hacked into! Big lesson learnt! I do still play this alot tho so overall, definitely a good game. üëç"

        "Would of given 5 stars if it wasnt for the 300 energies as it doesnt go very far, would be better if it refilled twice a day instead of once. Why do you have to spend money on special scenes they should be unlocked if you picked the right choices not pay for them. Apart from that love the story and the graphics are great if these issues could be sorted that would be great",
        "I downloaded this due to the narrative and the reviews, but I am not a fan of this game. 300 energies (30 sentences) is very short I get through it in about 3 minutes and then you wait an entire 24hours for another. I love the storyline and the graphics so therefore this would be good for someone who is a slower reader. It's a shame but I will be uninstalling.",
        "Wish there was more energy or like an easier way to get more energy. I get 450 energy for the day with the initial 300 and playing the mini game which gives 100 and watching the adds which is 50. But it's not enough I feel like I only get about a couple sentences in and then I run out. Maybe if you could play the mini game every hour or two to get the 100 energy and watch the ads around the same time to get 150 instead of waiting 24 hrs it would be better. The story progresses too slowly with that little amount.",
        "This game really addictive!! The only problem is they don't give you enough energy.üòíyou either have to buy energy or play a mini game to get more energy. The highest energy points that you can get is 100. Plus the 30 points if you watch a video. Other than that the game is AMAZING. The graphics are realistic. It has a lot of romance too. You should definitely download this game if you're not bothered about the energy points.",
        "The game has me hooked. I'm big on reading so I fly through the 300 energies. I've spent $10 repeatedly, even $20 for energy and it feels like it was gone in the same amount of time as the 300 energies. If you allowed maybe 4 refills a day, it would be amazing, or some other way, maybe to just keep playing the minigame. There has to be something more other than 20 energies for a video once a day. But despite the lack of energy, this game has me so disgustingly hooked. I love it so much.",
        "I think this game is really good. I just have one problem. Even though it says my energy is full, it feels like I have nothing. And also the mini game 100 energy seems to last longer than the initial 300 you receive. If you could fix this taht would be great. And if it's designed like this can you make energy spending more efficient?"

        "They listened. Offline play for single player modes has been patched in like iOS version. Now I can recommend this. It's a huge upgrade to volt that we always wanted but never got. Deep fighting system, not tap fighter free to play garbage. It's a simplified control system with the unfortunate one button special mode for noobs, but taking the time to learn fighter combos and how to use sp moves properly is very rewarding. Just waiting for a patch to separate sp button players from real players online and it's complete. Crossplay would also be nice. Thank you Capcom for listening to your paying fans.",

        "I absolutely loved it compared to the other games because it's absolutely free with literally thousands of levels and different menus (so you don't get bored)... It's a great balanced of easy and challenging (but still achieveable without spending a single cent)... My only complaint is that every now and then it hangs (but that's quite rare)... Great job!",
        "The only problem I have with this game is that, if you have brought everything out of each of your stores and still have coins available WHY CAN'T WE USE OUR LEFT OVER COINS AND BUYS SPOONS? Cause you can't do nothing with left over coins in each state. Other than that, it keeps me ready for any challenge.",
        "The game is fun when it works. Every time I unlock a new restaurant or a new region or bonus level or ANYTHING it won't download. I get a \"connection error\", and the only way to get past it is to delete the game, re-download EVERYTHING (which clocks in at over 100mb) and try again. Update 3/15: I emailed the devs over a month ago and have yet to get even an automated response.",
        "After all changes in Dublin its n impossible to win levels without purchasing spoons and boosts. It was a great game but it slowly got ruined by the greedy developres i guess. Well..guess what! I am not spending a dime on it and I will just stop play it.",
        "This game is fun, but it would be much better if they make it so that you can watch video ads so that you can get more spoons, boots, and lives. You can only watch a video once or twice for a life. I definitely won't spend my actual money to play this game. It's not a home counsel game.  Also, this game gets difficult quickly. I'm in the Paris level and barely making it through. I like to play this game for fun and to pass time. But the difficulty increases makes it not as fun.",
        "I love this game but the fact that you can't use coins to buy spoons really annoys me. I wish they at least had an option to convert coins to different currency so that you can buy stuff in the next locations. What are you meant to do with your coins after you've finished the city?? It's such a waste."

        "I stop playing C C because I loved this game... I noticed that we use way more than we get!! And to only get a few tickets for every 10 Bingo's then having to wit for 22hrs....only 4 tickets and hr...and it takes way to long to get to the next level and when do reach it we get very little tickets!!! Dont have to many deals to get both tickets and special prizes... Also how does it when a game starts right after a tournament that I end up in the thousand plus  rank below the bronze??? As much as I love this game think its time to give it a rest until there re more incentives to bring me back!!!",
        "My game keep freezing up and not submitting my scores not giving me boosters I acquired during that round. Please fix the issues and give me back my points and boosters. Thank you   I just played again and I played the whole game but when it's time to tally the score the game freezes. I lost 3 footballs and a treasure chest plus my points. Please respond to my issues. I haven't heard from anyone yet. But I still like the game. Just want it to stop robbing me....",
        "This is definitely a fun bingo app. Where it's lacking or otherwise could be improved, comparatively to ther Bingo games, is the daily spin wheel & daily sign in bonus. Daily 24hr sign in should provide a much larger number of free tickets & include daily free power ups. Earning one or two power ups w a single spin of the wheel is anticlimactic! Power ups are a vital way to  daily tournament advancement, bingo wins & simy make playing more fun. Completing a pizzule is impossible without power-ups or making a purchase. However, a big win for this app. is the ability to sign in each new day to a new tournament which helps level the playing field. Special tournaments and/or the add' side bonuses, like the \"turkey daub\" made playing & making a purchase worth wild!",
        "Good, keeps me coming back for more. The only thing I don't like is there is no way of getting that many puzzle pieces in the time. Could you maybe let us play till we get the Puzzle Complete to get the rewards.",
        "I am addicted to this game. I think you should get more power ups instead of ticket's. Cause you run out of power up's. I feel you should get bingo power up's instead of ticket's. On the bonus spin they should add bingo power up's of 4. I need more bingo power up's. And would like to get power up's for daubing every number called each game. I need more power Up's. And the game should give you tickets when you get every number that is called correctly on each card every game that you play.",
        "The new additions of the outlaws was great, but then you added all these \"special\" days that serve no purpose but to make people spend money. I have spent plenty already but not for every game. Sorry guys, bad move. Too greedy."

        "The game is great Game is great, user friendly and all, one of the best 3d mmorpg.. The only problem is that its starting to get complicated with all the new functions such as the divine cards and the crystals, EF.. Dont make the players do too many things, the selling point of this game for me in the beginning is that theres not much to do, so i can just do my work while in auto or go out and still be able to finish everything in the game before reset.. Now the working players cant keep up.. Which might force us to quit..",
        "Great! Pros- Graphics is great(Doesn't give headaches like other arpg games). Skill combos looks cool. Game is easy to understand. Cons- Classes are gender locked and male classes sucks. Suggestion- Add 1-2 more classes male and female. Question- When is the new Server going to be released? It's boring when all the other players are already OP, I only see 2-3 newbies everytime i login.",

Now, people don't even bother to join RB. I think if the rewards were to be changed with something more useful, then players will be encouraged to join RB again, thus forming more solid guilds and more players. Just saying...",

        "I'm not a fan of mobile gaming, but this game is truly something else. I love The Walking Dead, so I gave this a shot, however, after playing Road to Survival (or whatever it's called- it's the TWD game based off of the comics), my expectations were pretty low. This game though, is not Road to Survival; it's so much more. This is how you do a free to play game with microtransactions right. You can buy a lot in this game with money, but you can easily obtain everything on your own, and quite frankly, it's more fun to do that anyways. This game is super addicting and gives me something fun to do when I've got a few minutes. I've been playing it for months, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon.",
        "Just a suggestion, it'll be SO MUCH MORE AWESOME probably 10 stars for TWD fans if you could do better missions or events that allow us to get better opportunities to farm for TWD character tokens or class tokens, and also more chance for farming or creating weapons instead of the current set up now. Don't quite like the fact that when deals are awesome but they cost a ton! Try lessen the value a little bit and im sure some players dont mind spending (just my opinion). But overall review, its awesome for TWD fans out there!",
        "It's got good action in graphic. Been playing for a 2 years in 10 month's now.Stay human and Survive.  Up dates all the time love it keep them coming Robert Cregman. Thanks for making the Walking  dead show And game. New stuff to do all the time. In wow all these new survivers. There are some loading issues action issues movement issues alot more mission.",
        "Originally gave you 4 stars, but its one of only a couple of mobile games I have never deleted since installing. Constant content coming in, great use of TWD licence! Keep up the great work- seriously from someone who hates most mobile games!",
        "I've been playing for over 2 years. A few more new maps would be nice and stop nerfing our great traits like interrupt and wrestler! Other than that, great game and great community.",
        "Really good strategy game. The thing that lost it the 5th star is that when I started a second game on another device, it won't play ads for free stuff"

        "This game had potential, but nerds more. More control over your character. More, a lot more, inclusion of the character you create. And I may be alone here but I want greater customization of my character. If I had it my way my buffed dude would be buck naked, and boned.   However I had to say had, because I've played one time. All I've ever gotten since is \"connection timed out\" message.",
        "I love this game for it concept and content but it hasnt functioned correctly on any phone ive attempted to play on.  Currently, upon game loading up, i go to start and it says \"connection timed out\" and wont connect to server. And says the same fore every server so I cant play. Would love to be able to play again!",
        "I must admit this is the first LGBT game I've ever played and it's quite entertaining. The male sprites are very manly and attractive. The art illustrations from the bar are really gorgeous, wish there were ways to collect them in a gallery. I love the way we can customize our main character's cosmetics. Aside of appearances, the RPG content, battle mechanics and character development are a nice niche. The chat needs a little improvement and the server connections are unstable; I often get a connection timed-out which is quite an inconvenience. Overall, I really enjoy the gameI'm looking forward to more outfits and new characters released in the future.",
        "Made in-app purchase but item never arrived in game. Contacted developer and issue was never resolved. It's been over a month and I'm still waiting to see results on the issue. The most I've seen is a couple emails and a review reply. If you contact the developer, don't expect any swift responses and definitely don't expect the issue to ever be resolved.",
        "I love the game.  I played with it for 5 days in a row to get Augustin but now i can't pass 71% loading time without crashing.  I noticed when i changed the server from Tender Loving Hall to other servers it works ok again but sadly all gains are lost.  I wish there's a way to retrieve my character.",
        "I've been having the same issues as some other users. It's been working just fine for the past few days, but I tried to play it today and it won't go anywhere past 71%. I would really like to stay on the server I've been on than start all over on a new one."

The wins are far below expectations. in other words, the wins are way below the amount of coins spent. That's a turnoff for me. You wait so long for the bonus and get almost nothing in return.

        "Overall this game is very well made with stunning graphics. But there are also some issues with the game, 1. Game doesn't support controller input 2. Joystick and button configuration option would've made the game even better 3. And the most important issue is that it is unable to load the 2'nd chap after i finished the 1st chap, I updated the game hoping this bug is fixed but still it isnt. I tried \"restore purchase\", \"download all chapters\", but nothing seems to work. Please fix this issues asap!",
        "Graphic is ok. But i wanna say i can not find any FF game felling in this Game.  I think FF already gone.  I remember my first FF game was FF 7 and i loved it. After that i played FF 6, 8, 9, 10 and i can not find any felling from FFX-2.  For me,No FF anymore from FFX-2. This is only the game for kid not for FF fans. I hope SE will provide real FF   game style in future as your guys did in FF 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.",
        "The game itself it's very well done just what you'd expect from Square Enix, the graphics are good as well as level design, the story is a nice approach to Noctis's life. I'm saving for FFXV pc which comes soon so this will have to wait.  Now, the screen sometimes turns off while waiting and it takes too long to load and the gameplay doesn't work like it should everytime specially in the stealth jumps.",
        "PLEASE ADD CONTROLLER SUPPORT!!! or at least a virtual dpad option. Great game, i enjoy the gameplay far more than on console. However, i have far thumbs and cant even see the game, let alone the combat ques. This has prevented me from even finiahing the first chapter. Once controller support is added i will gladly buy the full game!",
        "As much as I would like to play this game, it baits you with chapter 1. The gameplay (at least in that chapter) is fun, but very basic. Most of the fighting is automatic...  Then you get to chapter 2, and surprise! $20 to play the rest of the game. Chapter 1 is very short, so I doubt the game is worth more than $5.",
        "Was excited to play, but the Revvl Plus, it does load two cutscenes in the beginning into loading screen then stops there and stuck on loading screen for more than 5 minutes. Probably needs fixing for Revvl. I've redownload it twice to see if it would work but it doesn't. And I have plenty space in my phone."

        "VERY Good game. As f2p(buying monthly crystals). You can compete with the payers you just need to be patient. Very generous game. And we are all excited on the upcoming TOWER OF GOD COLLAB.  But still almost all of us want to nerf pink bean. Its too damn op.  Thanks for a wonderful game. Long live fwtr. Many years to come",
        "Well nexon it's been 830 days for me and I still semi enjoy that game. I feel as of lately you guys are thinking with your wallet and not with what's best for the game. Your adding too many game breaking heroes and not balancing them. Cam and bean are super broken but y'all will keep pushing out recycled content without fixing issues the community brings up.",
        "By far the greatest Tactics/SRPG game on android. The game is by far the most generous of any game of it's kind. You can collect every single character, gear, costume etc just by playing the game. Sure it's faster to pay here and there but if you don't want to spend you don't have to. I would highly recommend the $5 a month crystal package to buy soul gear. I've been playing this game for over two years and hope to play many more.",
        "Great game, not pay2win, a bit grindy,  the dev is generous, overall an amazing game.   I have one issue though, after the recent update, whenever I do the auto-retry function, it seems to crash every nkw and then. Can you guys look into it? Thanks!!",
        "Great game...awesome visuals. Cute avatars. Wonderful story. Tactical gameplay + animations. Although the hero ability skills icon could use a bit more definitive aesthetics.  Too much ingame resources...the tutorial didnt quite explain what each of it are for....hope to have more elaboration. Overall...great game...loved it...cant wait to collect all the characters! :D",
        "im sorry to write this again...  i have download it and install... but stack at 59%, it says \"incorrect patch data... bla bla bla... '' damn i was three time repeat and still the same..  please help me... i loved to play it again..."

        "Over engineered upgrades which are clearly done as a gold mine for DroidHen. Result is you either pay to win or massive grind. Defender II was more balenced in this regard but still a huge grind too. I think World Raid is a myth since it has never worked. It apperently lasts about 30 second but I don't know since it mostly throws an error. I've gotten in twice and it immediately goes to Stage Cleared with &gt;97% beast life left.",
        "Bug that you have to wait endlessly to enter daily raid seems to be partially fixed. But: 1. Raid is even more fraudulent than before...no mattet you defense, dragon will one hit you. Fraud, there is no reason for a mechanic you cannot do anything about except exploitation! 2. I have all the upgrades and do pretty much max dmg, but there seem to be people out there that do 20 times the amount I do...except they don't, because they simply DO NOT EXIST!!! AS IN BATTLE MODE THEY ARE SIMPLY MADE UP BY THE DEVS! THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY REAL PLAYERS!!! 3. The skill that decreases % of all dmg does not do so...it virtually does not reduce damage at all, but still it costs 50 crystals per % point. Also fraud! 4. You pay for somethin but you cannot keep it. If you change your phone, everything is lost forever! This is criminal behaviour! CONCLUSION: Probably the most fraudulent and criminal organisation out there. BEWARE AND DO NOT INSTALL, AND FOR CHRISTS SAKE, DON'T SPEND MONEY ON IT!!!",

Or when you jump off a train and there is one of those things you have to roll under but you have no time so the police catches you. Or maybe I am not good with those things. Yeah, probably just I am not good at this game.",

Can't that be possible at least for a week if one on it to her their records it shud be like that for the rest of the week. Most importantly  subway surfers consume too much data. But wen updating every month and for that reason I humbly demand that this game company provide physical cash reward for those who are consistent for us to tell others who are asking us who subway surfers help. If we tell them benefits we derive I bet u more people who are lover of games will wanna be part of subway. Trust  me....  Tnx in anticipation",

        "This game is wonderful for me since I'm very Shakey and tapping obsessively is very fun it's a little confusing to upgrade but when you figure it out it's very fun I loved it and recommend this to everyone",
        "Awesomeness!!",
        "Fun",
        "The game has bugged out now the hero's that did the time challenges are stuck I cant get them back.  I think it happend when the anniversary update hit and I put them in a time challenges during the time.  When I prestige and go to the time challenges it goes straight back to the main menu. And when i do have hero's  in the adventure mode it cuts to them when I pick the time challenges.  Please fix this.  And also happy anniversary üòÄ   Problem was fixed thank you very much!üòä",
        "The game is fine but like all mobile games or eventually gets to the point where it's purely about you parting with money to proceed. That being said even tho this game uses ads for it's reward system it's actually quite pleasant, at no point did it become ridiculous or over the top. I really do appreciate how much of a back seat it it feels like the adds are taking to gameplay.",
        "Almost A Hero is an incredibly fun game with lots of interesting heros to use to battle near endless hordes of baddies. I find myself loading up the game multiple times a day to grab the free chest as well as to push through another couple waves before my next prestige. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in this genre!"

        "Good from the start,  but the truth comes out pretty quickly.  Eventually you're going to have to spend real cash for no guarantees. Pretty much impossible to get far in the game at a certain point. Loot crates are a joke. Items you need to evolve you're person; almost impossible to get and require to much. In general they quickly suck the fun out of this game. Probably will uninstall if their system of things doesn't change.",
        "Game is amazing Love it. Customer service well you have none. All you get is automated message and no way to speak to someone about any issues. You give them what they need and no one fallows up on it. All you get back is the same automated response. Then they remove your ticket. So if you have problems with the game don't bother contacting them it's a waist of your time. THERE'S NO ONE THERE FOR YOU. Can't get my account back. That's all I want. It's simple NO???????",
        "Another month, another violent smash and cash grab. Putting an entire LT behind a character requirement that 99.9% of the player base has next to no chance of getting with obfuscated \"odds\" that require one to spend 1000s of dollars for a \"chance\"(not even guaranteed) to get a character. At this point, I'm only updating the game to keep my reviews more relevant and higher weight.",
        "It's a good game. Awesome graphics, great gameplay,amazing superstar etc. But not good for free player because you don't get good superstar and rate of getting better superstar is very very low. Even some time in 4 pulls. I didn't get any 2 star silver card. Please make rare superstar drop rate more or I can't go any further in this game and make this game more free player friendly.",
        "Basically I have been playing this game over the past year... It is a totally addictive and 100% entertaining game... Only downside which has forced me to stop playing is that I have just acquired a new phone and attempted to load the game with my login details (for both Facebook & Google) but have found that I now have to start from the beginning again... I've now become mildly disappointed unless this can be fixed I don't think I will be playing again as I put too much time into this for me to start from the beginning again!!!",
        "It is my favrt game ever when i play this i stuck with this game I want to say something  now it's giving  too many ads and a problem  when I log out it says only one thing again and again that this account using on another device  but it's not real and what I do I am help less and I can't get new powerful superstars üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠when I open with cash he always give me duplicates..

        "Pleasantly surprised by the smooth, user friendly interface. Love the openness offered. When I first started up, I had no idea what to do and noticed everyone around me fishing so I did the same.  (What I was supposed to be doing was staring me in the face.) I give it a 9/10, only because from what I have seen so far, seems slightly Pay To Surpass maybe... not win, but I am just starting out.",
        "I'll write a proper review in time. I'm here because the game asks for a rate once you hit lvl8. To be clear, I'm having fun. It's a well though out game based on what I've seen so far, and I'm looking forward to seeing what comes next.",
        "A very good mmorpg indeed. But sadly there's too many bugs. Got totally pissed of it, now i've unistalled it! never coming back till the bugs are fixed!!!",
        "Everything is good, only one thing is the problem.. its tooo much log and somtimes its freeze.. hope admin give free gift items. Or custom.",
        "Would have liked to try this game but it keeps crashing during login. Sometimes before, sometimes during, and once after I selected a sever it crashed once the splash screen came up. Samsung Galaxy Tab 3",
        "All is good except the monster available is too few for even two players. Hate this type of game. Dear myself just don't install it again"

Why change something that wasn't broken!! üò°  UPDATE...since the second update the game is back and I LOVE it. Thank you so much for sorting it out. I genuinely love this game!!",

Game constantly crashes, cannot play for longer than a few minutes before it crashes, can't go into any other hospitals because it crashes, can't watch videos because it crashes.....*STILL crashing, even after new update. I'm now getting a message on update screen 'this app may not be optimised for your device' - this app worked perfectly fine before update, why now is the app not optimised??",
        "This is A cute game to play doctor and all.  I just wish earning coins did not take so long, because to add on a clinic or expansion, it takes up all your money.  Also to purchase item for the hospital, the cost of each item goes up after you purchase one item. Like the waiting room chairs starts at 40 coins after a few chairs it is now at 70 coins per chair. Like how unfair is that?  Like is their a limit to how high each item gets?",

        "Very laggy, took up alot of space on my phone. Wouldn't let me drag anything from one place to another. Very annoying. Don't reccomend"

        "I used to play this game and it never gave me the option of saving before and it still doesn't. That was over a year ago. I love this game but when I had to get a new phone I had to start all over, so I didn't play for a long time. I just recently redownloaded it and it still doesn't have a save option. When are you going to change that? I play one of your other games and it has a save option. When are you going to give this game a save option because I have mentioned it before and nothing has changed. I want to keep playing but I would also like a Google play save option in case I have to get a new device.",
        "This is a great app. It has great graphics and doesnt make up anything from the actual show like other games do. My little sister is just crazy for this game. She even pursuaded her friends to get this game! Amazing game, no flaws. Definetly worth 5 stars!",
        "I like this game. But there's a bug. When I try to watch a video to play a mini game for free, the video freezes but the pop up ads don't freeze.... It doesn't make sense.  Why add pop up ads when we're already watching them for the free mini games.  At first I couldnt put this game down, I became addicted, but since the bug started to happen, I started to lose interest.",
        "I'm not sure what happened but my game reset. What also stinks is my game used to be glitchy when I'd leave the game a day later and come on, not even two seconds passed in the game. If highly suggest to stay on online mode since that seems like the only mode that keeps time",
        "This is bullcrap! This is the second time this game has all of a sudden stopped working and I cannot get back in to play. I am soo disappointed that you keep letting this happen!! I seriously could use some HELP!!! Please FIX this issuse immediately!!! I want to continue to play MLP... :'(",
        "I will give this game 5 stars if u can get some help.  When ever I try to open my inbox to look at my shards or collect the hearts I have been sent,  my game just crashes. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game,  playing offline,  clearing the cache data and almost everything else I can think of. Also when I try doing anything with twilight I can't do any tasks, plus I can't find twiligr either.  Please help me. I love this game. But I may stop because it keeps crashing"

        "I think this game is awesom.. sometimes I get in a shootout and I'm taken out before I can get a shot, that just makes me want to shoot better.. but most the time I'm battling it out till the till the time play stops, then I get to view everyone's score on both teams and see what rank did what.. Not only is this game  challenging and exciting,  but NO ADS.  5 stars from me",

        "It's sad to see people complaining and giving bad reviews about crashing but not knowing it's probably because their device is  g a r b a g e. I have j3 6 which is pretty bad and still runs well. Very optimized, sleek game. Also alot of updated to keep the game fresh and the microtransactions are very fair.",
        "Very fun game, wish it wasn't energy based, would definitely enjoy it more. The fishing is 'new' right now and i have to say the percentages are garbage. 75 percent is more like 50, 50 percent is like 10 percent,  25 percent is closer to 50. This is just my personal experience. The games is really fun though, expect to get annoyed with the fishing percentages however. Also energy gets spent super fast in this game, very fun yet very limited.",
        "It's good and alot of fun but it's a bit of a tedious grindfest. 150% item find and I found nothing after going through ten dungeons. I want to keep playing but it's just another pay to win type. I understand you need to make money but I can buy a full loadout of epic equipment and run through a great portion of the game in no time. It's definetly worth giving a try but unfortunetly it's not for me.",
        "I fell in love with this game as soon as I opened it the first time. But there is a problem which forces me to give it a 2 star rating. It kicks me out of the game every 5 minutes and that way I can't get any progress done. I absolutely enjoyed the little playtime I got and I want to play it more but it won't let me. Great job otherwise devs!",
        "Fun and amazing game, great time killer for me, I just love these pixelated games so much.. to be fair it sounds like it's more Terraria and pokemon mixed typa thing y'know.. 5 stars",
        "Been playing this for about a week.  It's a lot of fun with a variety of different things to do.  Running out of energy for doing dungeons doesn't matter a lot as there are three or four other things to do in game that don't require energy.  Will be making a purchase to support the devs.  Good game!"

As with most 'free' games, there are lots of incentives for you to get out your wallet; if you're as unwilling to do so as I am, you'll have to be patient. Can't fault the developers. Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat.",
        "If you want a game you can tap on a few things then come back a few hours later, this is it. Not any real goals though so after a while you do feel what's the point but the graphics are good and the events are good too but it needs better goals to help you achieve something. I just do what I want for now. Still play it though"

        "I always have enjoyed the community of Adventure quest/ Dragon Quest. Helpful and mostly, kind as well. Moving from 2D to 3D won't be easy but I'm greatly looking forward to updates and to see how AQ3D advances as its players grow. There's a lot of grind in the game for collectables to make weapons/armor and a neat crafting system. Addicted for sure, and a quriky plot to follow like 2D was. Thanks.",
        "The game is awesome! I used to play adventure quest worlds way back when there was that place that was just crappy drawings. This is better than that, but you guys really need to get going on that pet store and real estate. Also, along with the list of destinations, you should also have a map to fast travel with like in the flash game.",
        "After leaving myself waiting for blood cape to be crafted I logged out thinking all was well. However upon re logging in today I find myself back to level 3 and sat in the pub near the start of the game. Lost many hours of game play that i have no intention of repeating. Uninstalling. Shame as this game was pretty good.",
        "Thank You for the Response! And Nice Update! Everything is cool but the thing again is the game just got laggy and stuff sometimes crashes that it didn't happened before, I don't if others notice this but I just want to say but really Everything is COOL and once again thank you for the response! Keep Up The Good Work!",
        "Game has potential to be great but too many dragon coins will limit the fairness and equality of fun free players get. It's miniscule but there are already p2w aspects to it.",
        "Ok, this game is great. But why don't you stop making spinoffs with the Same name like this(adventure quest) why don't you just focus on one? You decide"

I am not here to complain and I'm not saying anyone else is in just wanted to let you know that some of the ads don't show up on the tablets you can hear them play but can't see them and as I said (some). I have managed my way around it through memorizing where the close (x) is just from trying to tap every corner but I would like not to have to do that hehe. But like I said I can manage, it's just that I know someone who would like to play but can't really stand that lol my mom hehe anyway I just thought about it would be nice if she could play too and it might help as well. Thanks for reading and listening and have yourselves  a nice day and night. Plus thanks for this game!",
        "I love this game because is it active! I can play it all day and not get board! Keep up the great work everyone!üòõüòõ ( there a lot of ads every 5 minutes though. I don't know why. Pls fix that and the game will be even better! Respond to me as soon as you can! Thanks you for your time to listen to my opinion!",
        "I love this game! So much,very addictive and very unique!  I would rate 100 stars if I could!You can battle, feed dragons, do clans...ECT ! Every update it gets new things!  Best dragon game ever!You would love this game, just get it! And it's free!There are so many islands too! You can connect it on Google play to save the game or Facebook! The dragons are so cute!!! Please get this game! There are so many activities  And tournaments!",
        "I love this game so much but... I used to play this game a year ago then I got tired of it then I returned yesterday  I had a Facebook account that even has a legendary called Ice cream , so I signed in back half of my dragons are gone , my farms , my island everything that's why I rated 1 if I could get my account back I would rate 5 Thanks. Sincerely,  A Google Player ( Facebook too ).",
        "good game but y'all gotta fix how valuable the gems are. its impossible to get lots of gems without paying and you're only rewarded 1 per video. and then it costs me 150 gems to get TWO hatchery spots? that's bs. fix that and I'll give 5",
        "There is an unnecessary amount of ads. I understand representing your sponsors, but at what cost to your customers? General game play is also very challenging for new players  as far as leveling up dragons, collecting coins/food, and even breeding times are ridiculous."

        "Wish the hearts were half price and that I could replay episodes without paying a new ticket. I've spent an embarrassing amount of money, about 900usd and counting. The overall quality of the stories is good. The variety of characters is good, but it would be nice to have more than one female love intrest per story. Go Persephone! üòªüòöüíò",
        "This is great! The best romance game I've come across. Only thing is maybe more female love interests and definitely have a system that gives you like 5 hearts a day? Just to get those back because I haven't played the game in a week and a half because of no hearts.",
        "Hearts are too expensive and the hearts needed for some choices are way too high. Daily loggin rewards don't have a good enough chance to get them either. Stories are great and I enjoy them very much. Would recommend for others even those who don't want to spend the money. I myself haven't paid a cent because of the high prices.",
        "I really enjoyed reading different stories. Loving this apps.Just please add more tickets... and also it takes forever to waitq for the next season or episodes..it spoils my excitement.. please don't make us wait .. your stories are all really good..just make it more fast in adding new season or episode please please please",
        "I've been playing the game for a really long time now since I was 13 or 14 and am now 17 turning 18 this year and I'm sooooo happy with how it's grown but the one issue I have is the hearts thing. I can't pay the specific amount to get a whole stash of heart and it really bugs me because I love the options that you give us but I don't have hearts...can you please look into it and come up withe something ?",
        "This game is addicting and is very fun I think you will love it.I did so try it out and see what happens.The one I loved the most was gangster love ash so I advise you to try that one out if you want.Also with the gangster love series try out chance he's fun"

        "Top tier player here, I've been enjoying the game greatly for the most part. My biggest issue would be that energy takes years to recharge. If it was shortened to one or two minutes to Regen one energy then that would be amazing. Another issue I have is that I think all players should receive one SSR when they complete the tutorial. I have a whole team of them, but others aren't so fortunate. Thanks for your time, if one or both of these are changed I will rate this 5 stars!",
        "In short, games got amazing potential. Amazing manga-like visuals? First I've seen for an app. However, they NEED to make the d*$&m game more F2P so the player base is more welcoming, how TF is it you can ONLY get Pandora at VIP 8?!..   Also, many-many other great games do offer lifetime gem login purchases.   Just saying. ;)",
        "Nice. They added new characters. I'm waiting for Namida, Brandi and Sora's SSR forms, hope they come soon. There's one problem I'm having with the recent update though. I can't play Soul Towers Battle in Special Trials because my phone keeps crashing. The gameplay in other areas are running smooth, only the Soul Towers Battle causes my phone to crash. Fix it please...",
        "I really loved the gameplay and the characters, but then all of my dadta got lost and i had to start from the begining. I made it so far within the story and leveld up my characters so much. Grinded for a few hours to get the materials and money i needed. It was all for nothing. Fix this bug pls. Hope this doesnt happen to your account",
        "Not so much a review, but I can't figure out how to unlock the last two outfits.(Gal.cat and the blue yakata). Any help much appreciated. Cannot find guides anywhere. Is this game p2w? Somewhat but you can unlock everything without paying.",
        "It's just a pay to win game. I'm very disappointed for the energy bar... I need 13 hours and 36 minutes to recharge to full at this point. Difficult to upgrade characters and their skills and everything you want to do you must pay. As a game (idea) awesome but unplayable if you can't afford it"

        "Guys its an non bised review plz read it no offense to the game lovers   Well I will be pretty clear about this game. Its a rip off ik u guys worked for it but free then it becomes premium. Its better to play other games on pc which are times bette thenthis pro game because I would pay if it was up to the point but its not even equal to the freeware in terms of gameplay. Sorry for the bad review but i had to be honest",
        "FREAKING RIP OFF!! PAY TO PLAY!! NOW I KNOW WHY I uninstalled it the FIRST time!! HECK I want to just throw my hard earned money away, I CERTAINLY won't do it by waisting it on stupid pay to play phone games!! Get a FREAKING life and STOP trying to go WITH the Flow and Go against it and ACTUALLY make games THAT don't require ANY money involved or vip or packages and so on!! Just add include them in the game as you progress"

        "This game is so perfect when it comes to graphics, gameplay and physics.. But the only problem is that the items we can buy by using coins is limited. What i mean by that is, almost all of the items are being sold by gold tickets (which i cant top-up) . please add more items that can be bought by silver coins.. I have like 16.5k on my acc and i have nthing to buy... Please read this and make this possible ..if possible thankyou..!",
        "I have been waiting for a game like this since DayZ. I am truly addicted to playing this game. I do however wish that after you get shot and knocked down that you would have a chance to restore health rather than die. But I do understand that if that were the case, the games would last a lot longer. I love the game, the graphics are as good as could be expected for a mobile device but the game play is so fun!! Great job!",
        "I think this game has more things than other games but the graphics is some how really i can't describe it. It is good and it is not just like that. That is the describtion.... I joined today and  played with squed and i won the game me only. Hope you will enjoy this game and happy wishes all of you",
        "NOW THIS IS FRUSTRATING!!  I EMAILED YOU LIKE,  20 TIMES NOW!  ABOUT THIS GAME BECAUSE I AM STUCK IN THE LOADING SCREEN.  I UNINSTALLED IT THEN INSTALLED IT AGAIN AND NOW I AM UNABLE TO CONNECT TO A SERVER! I WASTED MY TIME AND DATA ON DOWNLOADING THIS GAME!   WILL YOU PLEASE FIX THIS FOR CHRIST SAKE!!  PLEASE BE PROFESSIONAL HERE!! COME ON!!",
        "The game is amazing but there are a few huge things that need changing and adding! First off translation is something everyone will need to get the bearings of the layout of the game. Second you can buy anything in the shop with out top up hardly anything good can be bought by coins or diamonds. Final the biggest problem ( my opinion ) is the audio. I don't recall there being audio for foot step and the map icon didn't exactly help locate the enemy when in a building. Gun and vehicle audio isn't so good it needs to be lowered when in the distance and louder up close. Overall this is an awesome game keep it up",
        "Soo many glitches.  1) items are not getting picked up. 2) automatically transfer me to places I been before. 3) sometimes i just die before i even touch the ground. 4) keep teleporting me away from my target  area. Sooo disappointed.. there are much better similar games which is working fine."

        "Another rip off game. That tries to slowly bleed you dry of money. The rewards for victory are so small it's almost impossible to upgrade your base unless of course you pay for a shield,but even that's a scam cause with a shield you can't atracvk enemy bases.  Everything is basically pay to upgrade or spend forever trying to save up and even then. Bottom line ftx games are a scam. A shame too I really liked the game at first. But once you start buying stuff for it, it keeps you in a position where you have to keep on paying to have a chance.",
        "Many time bought gold as soon you'll purchase gold the same time upgrades of building will increase by 20 bar of gold... I check twice before purchase was 100 bar for upgrade building as soon as I purchased went to 150 bar of gold ... the same building to upgrade... and rewards are like nothing ... used to loved it a lot but now seems to less liking it because of this..anyways game is awesome but need to invest a bit if you need survive out there in cartel",
        "Great fun",
        "Waste of time and money. You watch adds for a speed up, nothing happen, you install other apps for gold, nothing happen, you submit a report to customer service,nothing happen, they send back problem solved and they didn't do anything about. I bought gold for the app from one of their sponsors, nothing happen. I report it , a girl named Daria sent me back a email and said problem solved, guess what...NOTHING HAPPENED",
        "Total rip off dont waste your time or money. Ever since update..its horrible. The developers will swipe your gold away (basically your money) and give an excuse that your bank or Google issued a refund. After showing and providing evidence that your never received a refund...they do nothing about it! Straight run around. And good luck talking to support..generic responses like the one they give on here.",
        "This was the best Game i ve ever played but every new update creates alot trouble and tension of users. Forta spoiled the games fun. Now they want people to spemd money on scorpion. When they make them. They will introduce a sicario for that too... really dissapointed with tge way you people robbing money ftx."

        "This is my full honest review. Madden Mobile is back!! I'll admit before it was not fun and I complained that you need to pay to win but EA really did good when I came back to play. The game is fun and is somewhat easy to get 100 overall players and now they are bringing back Draft Champs and I have seen early drafts and it looks great. The promos are great. I would like to say great job EA on bringing this game back and making it fun. I always want to play everyday and build my Ultimate Team",
        "I have played this game for 3 seasons now.  I can't even begin to say all that is wrong, but one of the things that stands out most to me, is that your players stats mean nothing.  You spend a lot of time and effort completing events and grinding, and improve your team only to find out that when you play a team way below your level, it seems that that teams players are much faster and tend to play way above their ability.  this game seems to have the liberal bug that everyone is equal.  I am done with this game, don't get caught up with it, it's not worth the waste of your time",
        "Thanks alot EA for this new head to head style. Great to know that all the grinding and work put in is only allowing those who have a 100 overall or better reap the rewards. Everytime playing one of these individuals they have a counter for every single play. This really turns me off to the game.",
        "For the person hoping to find Madden 18, this is the closest thing you are gonna get. Yes, it doesn't have practice mode or my player mode, but it DOES have a incredible roster of players that you bargain for. The graphics are pretty good for a game on a smartphone.  Overall, this game is a MUST HAVE for NFL fans. 10 outta 10.",
        "You know I really like all of the Live Events but when I get these old collectible cards that aren't worth anything I have to cut them one by one. It takes way too long and I've got over a hundred. I would suggest having a way to group delete or in Madden terms \"cut\" the old dead weight."

This app has great opportunity to be the greatest boxing app. Thanks and good luck",

There's so much potential in this game, but if developer just thinking about money then please, just make this game a PREMIUM one..",

        "Love this little game! I wish we had five life's, Three just gets me started. But overall, it's a great game. Getting like Candy Crush the higher the level the more impossible it gets to finish. Please don't make it so hard to win. I keep having to use coins to buy lives. Can never build up enough to amount to anything. Also you can give cash on the scratch off card. PLEASE !!!",
        "Very hard and not as fun as the other games but  because you cannot even solved one level in a 3 lives. My friends do not want to play when I showed them how it is being played. I've noticed that the first part of level 3 is more fun now than before. But still the 2nd and 3rd level is very hard. I admire those who completed the whole cities. They must be geniuses in algorithms in solving the 9 moves in one level. The most amazing part of this game are the graphics.  Awesome really awesome.  Very well done. Still playing this game but also still cannot convince my friends to get out of CC and other games. Will keep on trying though.",
        "This game is set up to STEAL a certain number of lives before you can win a level. Some levels, like Venice, level 79 may never be won. I have bought extra lives twice, extra moves twice, I REFUSE to make anymore purchases. If this was a truly user friendly game, it would BANK any extra moves, lighting, and other bonuses you've earned but did not use. But no, it throws them out. STEALS what you have earned. BANK it for me, I earned it, I should get to keep it. I'm done with this game.",
        "I am glad for the staff at big fish they did a wonderful job getting me back play after all my levels where lost.. They found them all and it made me happy that i can play where i was.. I can not play to often sometimes and had taken me a long time but look forward to every new city i get to open a new and all the challenges i get to participate in.  Thank you all for this game",
        "Fantastic game!  I love the graphics and interesting bits of trivia shared every time a landmark is built.  I also like the extra daily challenges and the special events that open up every so often.  Gummy Drop is challenging but can be played without needing to make any in-app purchases.  One con: the game starts you with three lives (lives replenish after 20 minutes), but in order to permanently increase your lives to five, you must pay $10.",
        "Surprisingly fun! I was setting the ads for this game everywhere but thought they were really unappealing. Work on your ads a little to emphasize the fun prizes for completing levels, the enjoyable hunt for tour letters in old levels, the history of the buildings you save! So many great things happening in this game."

        "It's been a year since I've last played this, still fun. I've been playing this from day to night as far as I could remember. Hopefully, the bugs where the downloading restarts are solved. Nice Gameply as ever, getting hooked to this once again.",
        "This game is fun and addictive. I like that you don't have to work very hard to get decent leveled characters, and having everyone be overpowered makes the game fun. My only problem is how multiplayer is a little wonky sometimes, mainly when the app suddenly freezes during a battle.",
        "Feels satisfying and stress-free , cute characters too. I just have one problem, when it gives me a notifications of free polygons or similar to that, I go check but I don't get anything. There appears nothing in my giftbox.",
        "Great graphics and music and very f2p friendly for a gachapon game. Lots of banners with guaranteed top tier units so if you follow the Discord or Reddit community's advice on when to pull, you can make the free gems go a long way. The more characters you have, the more quests you can do to get more characters, so it may seem slow in the beginning but eventually your character collection will snowball until you have more waifus than you know what to do with!"

You guys always claim how much you appreciate your players, why not show your appreciation by increasing the number of spins a player can win from 5 to 8, 8 to 10 and so on. Now that would be a great update  (without making it more difficult to win free spins) that all players would appreciate & it will make your game more fun to play. Knew U wouldn't respond.",

        "Great balance between encouraging players to support the game through purchasing gold AND rewarding them for playing.  Plenty of attention is given to players who do not want to spend real money,  as you can make 5-10$ equivalent in gold per day watching ads and playing the game, not to mention the free chests you get a few times/day. The offers from the chests only ask for 5$, a very fair price for the goodies you receive.   The buildings and landscapes are beautiful and detailed. There is a wide selection of buildings and the cities really come to life.  This is a great game to relax when you have a few minutes of downtime, I'm dont play many city builders but this is one of the best.",

        "This is an updated version. My last post was from I think September or maybe October, but this game is truly AMAZING!!! The story line itself is great as well as the side story's that you can read as well. This game has changed so much from when I started playing this game in August. The events are great but I think the developers can give a little bit better rewards then just XP juice and more jewels as well as heart stamina, but other than that the game is perfect no glitches and non of that stuff. The one year anniversary was amazing thank you for that!! I can't wait for season 10 and the future seasons of Moe Ninja Girls!!!",
        "There really isn't anything negative to say about \"Moe! Ninja Girls\" the story is great, every character is deep and likeable, even if you're a free player each chapter is long enough to keep you coming back and paying is definitely worth it,too. It looks great and sounds great to boot. I honestly don't like mobile games at all but this is amazing and would be even it were a console or pc game. To me this is THE perfect app on mobile so download it now! And devs: I hope you continue to support the game because if you guys keep making seasons,I'll keep playing. Love you guys! &lt;3",
        "The story is really the best part of the whole game. The ninja fighting seems to be arbitrary , as you can have high stats and still lose a match. Collecting new gear is fun but you don't get as much new gear as you would like. Sometimes the game stretches the abilities of my Amazon fire eight and crashes under Google Play add in. This story definitely makes it worthwhile playing though it's funny and titillating!  ;-)",
        "Amazing story! Great characters. Other similar apps dont compare. Im playing completely free so far, just finished Season 1, and many awesome event stories. Well worth my time. Yes you have to wait 4 hours between chapters, but who cares. Its actually a nice pace.",
        "Cute anime girls. Only things is that the gameplay was really simple. I've played some dating games before and usually there's more options or they appear more frequently. And the ninja fight mini game was also simple. I don't know. This game seems to get good reviews so maybe it's just me.",
        "The game's quite sensational! You wouldn't believe how hooked I am to this game when I finally found it then played it. The story is quite good, the cast are very unique. All in all, a great game. Oh, it would be nice to add some mini-games that allow players to gain nineys/gems other than the ninja fights. Also, there were some hick-ups with some of the dialogues where the words don't make sense but it's still readable."

        "Incredible mobile game, even for older gamers! Incredible mobile game, one of the first fully realized AAA titles on Android.  No stupid IAP, micro-transactions or paywalls after initial purchase.  Vast, procedurally-generated worlds with numerous biomes and biome-specific items, bosses and events, making for great replayability.  A deep, relaxing game of crafting and building OR a PVE game OR multiplayer. Even has a great tutorial and cloud save to sync across devices.  Playing on Nexus 6p and I have no problems with controls, even as an older gamer.",
        "Hey,  so this is gonna longish review... what I have to say about this is while  it is similar to Minecraft in the way that it is open world it is a completely different game. It has the graphics of your old 16 bit Dungeon Crawler games in a huge and immersive environment that is always changing. As a PC player of the game I can say that I am pleased with the port over onto mobile devices. I wouldn't ask for anything different!",
        "PLEASE Fix it. First I Love this game, only I can't access the game online. No cloud saves, no multiplayer, I got this to play with my son and so my kids can play together. Would love to give the app full star's, please fix this so that I can. All that asides its still a lot of fun, still recommend this highly. Just got to update what I said, now I can't even access the game. All the gear that I've made/found is gone if I have to reinstall. If I didn't like the game I wouldn't mind but I do, so it's only disappointed me more. PLEASE fix this so that I can play this awesome game with my son before I fined another great game we can play together on our phones. Maybe I'll start with that minecraft game he's going on about.......",
        "Great game, and enjoyable by whole family on local multiplayer. Terraria PE has come a long way since its early days. Waiting for new updates. The only issue I've seen is that for some reason 360 Security flags this as a trojan malware possibly due to so many access permissions that Terraria asks for. Devs this is something you may want to clear with them. Otherwise keep up the good work.",
        "I LOVE the game but you need more bosses And wepons that you can forge together to get unique wepons and armor (like say you want the special effect from one armor set but you want the def fom another you could forge then together and get the special effect and the def). You also might want to add a extremely hard boss like duke fishron, but lots of them! It would add so much play time onto the game, but you would like i said earlier new armor add tools.",
        "I've played this game since elementary school till now, I'm still fall in love playing this game. Even though sometimes it gets salty when you lose something or the bug, but... Idfc =D. For the devs, could you add more stuff from PC to this mobile version ? It'll be cool to have chimney and other good looking decorations for the house"

        "This game was absolutely perfect and was very much enjoyable, but now to unlock the full experience you have to pay. One of the reasons I enjoy this game and recommended it to my friends is because it is one of the only games that isn't locked behind a paywall. Overall, I have had countless hours playing this game, and trying to land on everything and return successfully. Instead of the microtransaction, why not institute a merit-based system for unlocking parts?",
        "Very great!  Here are a few suggestion from me to make your game more enjoyable :)  1. Can you please make the earth scale correctly because its diameter is around 12.000 km and moon orbit is around 380.000 km  2. Please make a smaller powerful engine like the 9 engines of the falcon 9  3. Please make a button that is simple to cycle from another rocket to another one to ease the attempt of landing a booster  4. Please add an ocean on the earth for some splashdown  5. The last one. Im a free 2 play player and i cant enjoy a majority of the new update :*(",
        "This game is awsome. Loads of fun. Told my friends about it. Could you add a free sandbox mode and more free parts. Thanks. Keep up the good work. Shouldn't have added micro transactions. It just ruined the game for me. Had to take it from a 5 star to a 3 star. Please bear this comment in mind for future updates. This game was 100% free when i downloaded it in december last year. Since then, you added a new build system, free parts which make the game absolutely amazing, and then you add pay for parts. Thats just buzzkill.",
        "Very fast and simple rocket building and great graphics. I wish there was a sandbox mode with infinite fuel. Also there is no indication for loading screens when you hit the launch button. Somethimes you think you tapped the button and end up sitting there for a minute or two wasting time.  Edit So glad they made a small payment option. Well worth the money and glad to support",
        "Great!  Only thing I miss is the ability to rendezvous and dock with another object.  In a moon landing, you could leave a stage in lunar orbit and pick it up for the outbound burn.  Also, karman line should be 100 km??  Edit:. Great updates.  I have no idea how to use docking to reattach parts that have been undocked though.",
        "Can you please add option to center the map on the rocket/vehicle when being in the map mode? It is difficult to switch between near objects in the current version, since I assume the map is stationary relative to the body in which influence sphere we're in at that moment. Also, a \"docking guide\" would be cool in some future update"

        "This rpg is best so far.. I've tried many rpgs like avabel,  toram etc.. This is the best so far...with great controls.. i love it.. But it would have been better if we can fully inspect other players... Also PVP for pvp players coz most of the rpg players are up for pvp instead of pve.. I hope u'll fix it. :) sorry for my bad english lol.. And this is the first time i wrote a review XD.. Love this game..",
        "Amazing game, loads of fun. if I could just control it better. this game is great! it's got really good graphics and it's an acceptable MMORPG. especially for on-the-go, in your hands, and your phone, it's great. however the controls are really rough, I can't really move and turn my camera at the same time; and that is what really gets me. it takes me out of the game when my camera doesn't work well with trying to attack and move my camera and trying to move and jump at the same time.",
        "Yea this game is awesomeness!!.  I've been playing for about two months and unfortunately it's already getting repetitive. All the running around without mounts is boring and I think you desperately need to introduce dungeons and a solid PVP system.  I'm really liking the characters, graphics and the controls are out of this world awesome. The man quest is fun but the side quest need some work. Thx guys and Please please, considering adding to the game.",
        "OK been playing for a week now & can rate this a 5* all them way! Graphics are awesome, story is cool. Run's smooth on my tablet. The download was huge but worth it in all the bonuses they give you after, wow! When I hit B.W.T. and said I need to download more I sighed loudly haha. Then got the bonus stuff and the game is just cool. Pat yourselves on the back nice job!!!",
        "Asobimo strikes again! Combined from the unreal engine graphic and asobimo's creativity, this game really gives what its promise. The graphic is amazing, the gameplay is addicting and story is interesting. Unlike the others MMORPG in the play store in which almost every game have exactly same gameplay with only the UI and Characters that make them different.. the tittle as well lol This game is far different from those \"crappy\" games. Worth a try and worth your time. the size of the game is kinda huge tho it means the game has quality!",
        "This game was awesome, though the download was lengthy. I would love to give a better rating, but after I reach chapter two the game stops. I can't get it past the part where I pick which character I want to play. Overall, when they fix this, It will be awesome! I was actually able to choose everything for my character, attributes, looks, etc. The only thing I have wished so far is that there were different races to choose from as well. If they did that, this would overall be the best game I've ever played, from game consoles and all."

New & old player can snatch 1 SSR player but this new event though why you make it more depressing feature ? i figure playing this game is like working to get money.... i thought this game suppose to be fun and bring childhood memories, i know you need effort to get gold ticket but this \"effort\" is all based on luck already see many people day 1 got 0 gold ticket day 2 got 5 gold ticket...... just how? seriously if u want to make new event at least make it friendly for user i dont see point to play this game all night long to get that rewards your just making people to stay aeay from your game not attracting them shame event",
        "the game is just awsome but it has many cracks. the problem now is that matches don't start they keep loading forever this all happens when the photos in the missions menu appear white space. i don't even know the reason behind it ! i would rate the app 5 stars if it got fixed.  everytime this happens i have to reinstall the app",
        "Remind me of childhood anime.. Good game but have some minor bugs as far as I played.. Should be add ability to substitute players in middle of match, not only when half time rest.. Maybe some dribble or combination attack skill should be used to pass multiple players and get our player closer to the keeper. Please add more story match. Also fix regular online match, it's always freeze.",

Even if it was massively  over priced. Would be even better if you could save load outs for weapons and perks.",

Also the new zombie hero (Huge-Giganticus) needs to be nerfed as soon as possible. Lastly, whoever makes the daily challenges needs to stop, they are practically impossible to beat and the reward isn't that great.",

Moreover, players who had issues about the internet connectivity problems of while they're watching an ad and letting your opponent to win in multiplayer. Not only that but the Super Block Meter is keeping a lot buggy. Fix these problems now."

        "RobTop please reply but if you have an account but you can't log in to it and nobody stole it then how are you supposed to get in your account? And the game is the best ever also check out my level it's called china666. IDK why I named it that, the icons are cute just to say. I think everyone in the USA should play this!",
        "Awesome! I can play this game to make levels, play levels, friend people, And customize the avatar! Also, you can play the main levels! This game is really fun to play! And the last thing I was gonna say: You get user coins in levels, Secret coins in main levels and stars in main levels and other levels!Also you get orbs and diamonds on new best. And if you complete main levels! This game is so good. You get colors too! Everyone should play this and never delete it. This is one of my favorite games I was ever playing in my whole entire life! I will play this everyday since this game is so amasing and cool. I will play it already like now. And I like 2.1! And I liked 2.0. But when will will 2.2 be here? In 1 year! So let's keep playing until robtop makes 2.2. But I don't need to wait for 2.2! Cause I don't know what will happen in 2.2 but let's see!",
        "I swear this is one of the best games you could ever play it involves timing but the soundtracks are amazing almost infinite user created levels and 22 regular levels to play. Subzero and Meltdown plus geometry dash world all offer free content that is including light but this is 100% worth the price that it is listed for. Even though I'm not like a certified critic I would still recommend this to anyone 5 and up to whatever age",
        "It is awesome, and you should get it.  Geometry Dash Lite, I mean.  The idea itself is not originally theirs, but they dominated it when they used it.  The music is also amazing, and the fact that you can try making your own level is just even better.  Also, if you did not know, it has levels that are not in the free version.  So there you go, my review",
        "This game is awesome!!!!!!! You can make levels, icons, and other cool stuff!! If you were reading this rate description I hope download this game. :) Now im a bit concerned that now every time i get on a online level it freezes. Please fix this and ill give you back 5 stars. Really now when i click on begginer pack on map packs they're hard",
        "2.11... a great update for icons and change. But. I am now missing 19 of each shard and only 18 ice shards for whatever reason. I wish that didnt need to happen but oh well. Also if a level doesn't exist any more you can't delete your comments off of it. Other that that I love this amazing game. #Rubrub"

        "Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I'll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx",
        "I couldn't get enough patients, I couldn't get enough cash, and my staff energy seemed to drain way too fast. I love the surgery games but you maybe get one of those a day. I ended up uninstalling when room upgrades said they would take 12 hours. Too much waiting, not enough action. I liked the story so far too. Maybe I'll reinstall in the future if the times go down.",
        "Controls don't work properly during surgery! There is lot of lag while performing an action while the timer works properly. Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "Love the overall feel of this, though some things need tweeking. For example, I only have half of the staff available and am now getting far too many duplicate cards concidering how many I have left to get. Makes it feel all too much like it's pushing people to spend real money, something that always ends with me deleting the game and moving on. Hope this doesn't happen in this case, but I'm not holding my breath...",
        "It's a nice game, I like the concept, you get to operate on patients and manage a hospital. Problem with the recruitment part, it was always giving me surgeons and wasted 200 hearts on the same person. There should be an option if you want to fire someone or replace with another staff. The biggest issue is with their connectivity, internet connection is very stable works with all apps except for this one, no idea why. Fix it please I would hate to delete this game. Thanks.",
        "This game will cheat you! I  upgraded a bunch of my characters but the next time I logged in nothing had saved! The funds I used to upgrade were also gone, of course. Don't waste money buying anything because the upgrades you make just disappear."

        "Brings Back Fond Memories I love this game! I spent countless hours playing this in the early 2000s. The controls are easy enough to understand and the text is legible on my LG V10. I don't if I'd be able to read it on a smaller screen, they are not kidding when they say this is meant for tablets. If you've got a tablet or phablet I can't recommend this game enough.",
        "A classic perfectly adapted to the phone platform This game is a MUST-have for any rpg lover. The D&D mechanics may seem i bit weird in the beginning, but you will learn in time. The replayability value of this game is almost infinite. Personally I have never played any kind of game that would allow me to play as many hours in so many different ways. The game excels in its easy to handle mechanics, fun dialogue, compelling story, great ammount of side-quests that are actually enjoyable. Hands down best Apk for this platform. Worth every penny.",
        "Great Classic CRPG BGII was definitely a breakthrough in its time, but it still holds charm and depth that many newer games can't even touch. I have this game for the Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge and I can tell the chip set on the phone is grinding gears with the games engine. It's playable but only when the right character menu is minimized but it still gets choppy when multiple spells are being  cast. With the specs on the s7 this shouldn't be the case. Hey Developers any input/ advice on how to solve this issue?",
        "Amazing! There's a lot to love.  First, if you played the original, this is just as good with extras.  Granted, it's a bit harder to see everything, but it's what happens when you take a computer game and make it available for a phone.  Beamdog has brought additional characters, adventures, magic items, portraits and voices to the game to expand the character creation.  Some expansions are dull (like the arena unless you love grinding) but more of this rpg is on the way.  It's truly the best classic game reborn.",
        "I have a special request. I have purchased very possible version of the bg series, and have played as long as the game has existed. Call me a war vet asking for a wheel chair ramp but could you guys implement the imput of  points or the option to roll. 20+ years of rolling for stats has earnt me the option. Other than that perfect game, worth every licence for every platform. Either let us input stats with option to roll or make a shadowkeeper for android please.",
        "Game is great, as I've played it on another device. However on Note 8 it does not take up the whole screen, and the usable screen is significantly smaller than on s7 edge, and is barely playable. When I force it to full screen in settings, then touching on sides of screen are not recorded accurately. For example, when I try to resize the text box, it toggles AI instead. Makes the game virtually unpayable."

        "Great game! The only thing I can think of to make it better would be to have a google+ login. Some of us prefer not to bind to FB. But, all in all, great. Edit: cannot get daily login rewards \"abnormal time setting\" my date and time are consistent with where I live and I have not altered them in any way. (Auto set) Still no other way to bind account except Facebook. This will eventually get you a lower rating from me.",
        "At first looks simple and can just auto everything, but you'll eventually reach a point where strategy has a truly major impact on gameplay. Really well-made, only complaint is Gem Card gem bonus should be in Mail, not Daily Task, so busy people can maintain their purchases. Edit: Also the potions used should not be deducted if disconnected in middle of battle. Kinda expensive to keep restocking certain potions.",
        "The game is good... but 100k download is suck atatistic for a 2 year old game.... u guys need new user base... dont u guys advertise in google network ads or adwords at least.... even brave frontier got 10 mil download from playstore",
        "i think this game is so great.the story line,the grapichs,the gameplay,everythink is great. except one: LOGIN!! why must use FB account??? why not google account or use ur own system???.who was play this game too but he's login use guest account cause he doesn't FB account,and when te app update he loss his all data in his account.he was level30 squad when that.he very disappointing and stop play this game again.now just me who play this game until now",
        "As a f2p gamer i find this game quiet balanced. Not too overpowering privileges for cashiers makes it an enjoyable game. Been playing for 2 years. One thing that concern me is that i wish there are chat notification 'cuz i find it hard to communicate with my guildmates. And also there is the combat system which is a piece of shit actually because i have a warrior squad with 6.2k power just lost in the job change level 6 with 5.5k squad power which is frustrating considering the big power gap. Please reduce the difficulty in accordance of the recommended squad power and maybe i will have a better opinion on this game"

        "Plarium do not like Aussies. They charge us extra money for offers.   A top end offer is $100 USD for the Americans. Which is $120-125 AUD after currency conversion for Australians. Yet for some reason our offers are $160 AUD. $35 AUD more then we should be paying.   I do not know how this practice has gone without incident as I thought there were supposed to be good anti descrimination laws and consumer laws in place that prevent the charging of extra to countries just because they do not like that country.   This is a morally disgusting practice as it is the same concept as charging more to others purely on the basis because they have a different skin colour, gender or religion.   I want to know why Australians are paying an extra $35 AUD then we should be as other mobile games. One example being Battle Mobile do the correct currency exchange rate and only charge $125 AUD after conversion from $100 USD. If other mobile games do it correctly why are Plarium choosing not to?  Edit: @ Plarium employee who just lied in response to me. Plarium set all prices up themselves through Google Playstore. NOT Google.",

        "Tactical monsters is a great turn based strategy game. There's enough complexity to make it interesting but not so much that it's overwhelming. It has both single and multiplayer game mode options as well as fun challenges. Collecting cards is addicting and fun. Warning, it makes you want to play  more! One of my favorite things game is how fast it is. Battles are quick but still enjoyable. It is possible to do well in this game without paying. One last thing I like about this game is the support. The developers are constantly updating the game and fixing issues.",
        "Great game, but after the last update the game isn't stable, when you play pvp often the timer freezes and you can't do anything beside closing the game, or you just cant do any action, and then you miss your turn, please fix it, and I'll give it 5 stars because the game is really awesome. Problem solved!",
        "i uninstalled the game but i made sure to bound my account to googleplay however when i installed the game again i cant get my previous progress and have to start over again please fix this.... Overall the game is really good for people who like to play strategically.",
        "For a game called tactical monsters, I was unpleasantly surprised that most units are actually humans and not monsters. Fighting is very basic with only having melee and ranged arrows. No magic, no way to buff allies, not many choices in combat. Overall a very boring and lackluster tactics wanna be type game. Hexes for movement are also very small and no back button to take back moves. I would not recommend playing this on a phone at all- Reply to Camex Games: First, try using spell check next time. Second - I did play several missions past the \"tutorial\" and none of the units given had magic or skills that opened up the game past a hack n slash. Third - Its not my problem to play dozens of hours in your mediocre phone game waiting for it to get interesting. If your game isn't good within the first hour, no one wants to keep playing for the next 10 hours. Fourth - how many monsters you have hidden in the game is irrelevant, as the units you get at the beginning of the game are mostly human, in a game called Tactical MONSTERS. Fifth - Giving monsters 3 basic skills that don't offer much tactical option when you can't customize them, isn't interesting. Sixth -- Add a back button",
        "Game is awesome! One of the best tactics game I ever played, and I play those a lot. Would be a great implement if we could zoom in or out during battle, and also some little story on campaign would make it more enjoyable. 4.9*",
        "I can't open game it go on 100 and then say network problem so fix it my all friend are playing this game and reach much higher and my game is not starting üò¢üò¢ plz plz plz fix it for me if no then sorry I had to uninstall it"

        "Quick fire is the best but theres only one down fall, the seconds. When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. üëçüëçüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..",
        "Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven't gotten very far yet. Thing I DON'T like is you don't get an average..... IF you do, I've yet to find where it is in the game. That's in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! üòâüíØ",
        "The Game is good. Some things to improve it:  save your profile using your Google Account. Play with Friends in Tournaments (ie. Teams, Challenges), ability to givie Hearts to friends without using Facebook Also can you PLEASE improve the notification! My friend sends me Requests to Bowl & most of the time I don't get notified. Thank U",
        "I did like this fame but my lane keeps turning pink along with the ball so I can't actually see anything like where the ball is going.... and on quick fire again turns everything pink and don't let me take any shoots what do ever.. think it's a glitch in the game I'm not sure but tried restarting the game and the same thing is happening again and again... on all the different lanes and extra games in bowling king...",
        "Great graphics and realistic feel to the lanes. Controls are a bit wonky, however, and purists won't like being being able to steer the ball after it leaves your \"hand.\" LOTS of attempted upsells, but its free to play features ain't too bad on their own, either. All in all, a decent little bowling game.",
        "I have been playing for months and spent a fair bit of money on this app and also was enjoying playing until all of a sudden all the graphics went pink and now i cant play. Not happy!!! How do i fix it? Don't want to delete it really as i will loose all my chips and special balls. Someone help please !?!?"

        "To the guy that says stop bitching cuz it's free. Reviews are so they can get feedback to improve the game. What good is the game if you can only play 2 games a day? There are too many other games out there that are free that customers can get chips to play for hours. This game should take care of their loyal customers before they move on to some of the other games. So many have posted about the small amount of chips received and they added the spinning wheel, maybe by reading the reviews they are listening and trying to improve chances of getting more chips. If everyone continues to give low reviews, maybe just maybe they'll increase our chances to get more daily chips!",
        "Purchased 90 rockets pack. Explained to me how I used all 90 in one game? Smh, that's too much.. So y'all want ppl to purchase rockets each hand. Y'all can do better. Chip packages as well. Maybe u will get more to contribute to the game. Smh, better chip packages probably will definitely help this game. Especially the price of chips to play verses what the rooms payout... Really is at a disadvantage to players to even purchase.",
        "I usually love this game. However, today I decided to treat myself and purchase some chips to get the last two battle ships that I needed to get 800 chips. The game is so frigging rigged it's just sad. It took all 600 chips that I bought and all that I won trying to accomplish a goal.  I will NEVER purchase chips again, especially in this game.",
        "Most of my purchases lately have been strange disappearing chips and rockets i have spent SO much  money on this game!!! and another thing i could not access any games for 2 days now but it TOOK ALL MY CHIPS AGAIN SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE I HAVE ALREADY CONTACTED YOU IN REGARDS TO THIS.",
        "Good variety of games. Not many free chips once the first few rounds are played when compared to what the rounds cost. Be ready to buy, buy, buy if you aren't patient. They have added many more chances for free chips. Thank you guys.",
        "I love the game again.  I'd been struggling with glitches and now they're fixed  I'm especially loving the free chips you give sometimes daily!  I've become re-addicted to it!  The new format IS easier to see, but it gets slightly boring when the two cards you CAN daub don't get any numbers!  It looks as if you're phasing out the gems, which is fine with me; I'd rather have all free daubs, chips, and only a FEW coin power plays.  The free daubs make all the difference between winning and losing.  Also, would like to see winning bingos actually give me the items I need to complete rooms and for you to increase the daily chips for every completed room."

        "As expected, it looks and performs amazing. Fighting mechanics and modes are pretty innovative and thrilling. It is quite stupid to compare the console version with mobile one. Each one has its own unique style, so they should NOT look the same, cz' each one provides the fans with a different gaming experience. This surely increases the already huge number of fans of Tekken. 5 üåü game",
        "Very good game. Good graphics and easy game controls. I am a very good fan of Tekken and you give me a good game for my phone. The only thing is that is a little harder to get the caracters because you have to get 10/10 parts gems to get the caracters. In the controls if you can run without charging an attack and can give another single attack wile running thru the opponent it could be great. Other wise game is awesome thanks.",
        "WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you",
        "Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It's pretty decent. I'm enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I've raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn't a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)",
        "First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I'll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC's (and MK's) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.",
        "As a long time Tekken fan I am happy that we have a version for mobile. I am also quite impressed with how smooth the gameplay is. The graphics are impressive for mobile. I'm underwhelmed by the controls though.  For me Tekken is all about the controls, and while I didn't expect a full controller interface. I feel like there could have been a better control layout available. Also the interface and game play menus feel quite busy, like there is too much going on. They could take a note from the wb fighters on mobile in this regard."

It's a good game for me.  I can give it 4‚≠ê, an increase from previous rating.  8/13/17 Just about 2 years later from last rating. I'm still playing.  10/11/17: I continue to play this game with the added annoyance of the interactive advertisement.  I am to the point that i will purchase this game for a small fee (.99) just to get rid of the interactive advertisement.  Interactive advertisements are there but it's not a requred interaction.  They have added a timer.  Great job.",

By the time you have passed the top half of the mission,  you don't gave enough goes to beat the level,  like I say, impassable which makes it impossible. Con!",

        "The game is fun but it cheats way 2 much! I should have beat a level again and it made me lose. I'm almost to the point of deleting it. I was in level 195 with 1 move left 2 beat the witch. I only needed 3 and made a 5 move play and I lost again. This is about the 10th time I've lost due to this game cheating. I haven't deleted yet because I like it but if it cheats again I'm deleting it like the other games that cheat. Today 2/15/18 the game is still cheating. I watched 3 vids and it said I didn't watch until the end. Ugh this game is fun but I'm ready to say forget itttttttt bc I keep complaining and new issues keep arising and they aren't even responding."

        "A+, such a great classic i never even realized how fun this was going to be on mobile.i have the consol  version and i like this version better keep a full battery so i can progress in the story. Also cant wait to ride my bike when i get to that part. and great fun on the sk8t board and really is a joy controller support as well. thanks Rockstar GAMES for cool bmx bikes ! it would be nice idea to be able to customize bikes and skate boards we could only dream. thanks for all the effort that was put forth in this Rockstar title. some of the oldschool best.",
        "I thought it was going to be hard to manage this game with the touch controls etc but NO totally wrong, it's super easy as they've reworked them for IOS and Android and you can also customise them too, plus the game still looks great even after so many years. The only place I can say where it loses on performance for some weird reason(patch maybe?)is when you enter a bathroom(lol)but who the hell stays in the bathroom for the whole experience haha. I definitely recommend buying if your a fan of the game!",
        "A great port of a fantastic PS2 game with amazing graphics for a phone.  I play on the Galaxy S5 which is a pretty old phone and I only have to deal with small frame rate drops in high population areas in game. Other than that, the game is the same, amazing game I grew up playing on the PS2 and Wii. I would recommend buying the game.  ONE PROBLEM: I recently received a phone upgrade and went from using a Galaxy S5 to a Galaxy J7 and for whatever reason I can't play the game on a newer phone. Pretty strange to say the least.",
        "yes, the controls can be annoying at times but nothing a Moga gaming controller can't fix!! makes the gaming experience a WHOLE LOT BETTER!! Love this game cus it's a ps2 classic always loved it!! ALWAYS WILL! just wish they made a 2nd one to this plus it works great on my razor phone sadly couldn't play it on my axon 7 due to the axon being a 6.1 software.",
        "FFS Rockstar, Works great with my Shield Tablet K1 but won't even install on my Shield TV 2015 because you guys marked it incompatible despite allowing it on the STV 2017? They're the exact same device? It works perfectly once side loaded as well. Please whitelist the Shield TV 2015 R*, Nvidia have confirmed its your issue so please fix it asap.",
        "When it comes down to mobile games, I could never really choose what games to download. The moment I saw this game on the Google Play Store, I lost my mind due to the fact that Bully is by far my favorite Rockstar Video Game! I've played it on Xbox and now on the Mobile addition and man, I got to say that Rockstar did an amazing job with the updated graphics! The game play is amazing as always and the controls are very easy to manage! The game never lagged out on me not once, and I've got to play it on my new Galaxy S8. I recommend this game if you're looking for a great story line and free roam experience. The map is decent in size and you get to beat people up all The time lol!"

        "Fun, easy to play, complex to reach higher levels, this game has, so far, been great. No microtransactions (thus far) to continue playing, which is a huge plus. A few have stated a couple of bugs, which I agree with, adding only one other comment; I do wish their was an offline option for at least some gameplay. Online still necessary for a lot, but offline to run some dungeons. This could, in theory, help with some server space, as well.",
        "This game is one of the best game I ever played in mobile. I love the graphic which is cute and there is so many content, so it's not boring. And another positive side, you can get the special currency easily in the game. It's not a p2w games ^^ but the sign board was one of the best micro transaction I've ever seen. Try it and you'll see.. it's a lot of fun ^^",
        "I've been looking for a game like this for ages! I was a fan of Runestone Keeper and wanted something similar for my phone. These guys knocked it out of the park. I rarely spend money on phone games, but these guys deserve every penny and accolade coming their way. Fun and  simple, yet brilliant in execution and design. Tons of content already, and I can't wait to see what's next. Keep up the great work!",
        "This game is so much fun! My only complaint is that the gear is gone when done with the maze, so you start it over. As well as \"learning new titles\". It gets kinda old having to start that over every time you beat a full maze. But that aside, this game is definitely addictive! Keep up the great work!",
        "Your game is amazing. You guys are amazing. After everything you went through, you deserve these stars at the very least. Your game isn't pay to win, it's just a grand experience and I love it.  One of the BEST games on the market easily.  Keep up the good work, you're all doing fantastic.  Respect",
        "I've been playing like nine months and it's very addictive you really grow and have many choices. It's truly free to play and gems are everywhere. Buying a signboard for real money is the best bang for your buck and a lizard if you feel like buying something else.  Totally recommend it. I only hate getting creator gumball is so expensive other than that it's a great game. It's a game that goes as fast or as slow as you feel like playing."

        "Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning",
        "The MOST AMAZING racing game in the mobile device. The gameplay, graphics, and the controls were perfect. Also, the tracks in the game were so real like I was racing in real life. I also loves the cars that were added in this game, it looks so amazing. But, what I like the most from this game was online real-time racing. There were no other racing games that has this feature. Just have suggestions, add custom race mode. In this mode, you can chose tracks, daytime, amount of opponents, and also the laps. And also enable to invite friends to custom race mode. Also, probably adding weather system will be better. Last, make the cars could do rev-bombing. So, at the start of the races, you could have some pretty good start. Although, keep it up Electronic Arts & Fire Monkeys. Hopefully, these suggestions could help the game become much better and better.",
        "Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.",
        "Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I'm just going to name some things that I'm sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I'm just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!",
        "the graphic, control, and gameplay is good as always, but the problem is, i played this years ago just with a device with 1gb RAM and i have mid-high graphic setting, but now im running with oppo a37f and i think it can run this game with a mid or mid 2 graphic setting... but no, my game always set to the lowest graphic, could you guys fix this problem? i love this game and i'd like to enjoy it in its best performance",
        "It's a great game where you can race and customise your own car. However here are some ideas I would like you the imlament please  1. If the cars from the NASCAR can get the custmizeing like all the others.   2. To extend the custmize can yo add a tab where you can put spoilers, air intakes And other things you would put on a car.  3. Finally to make this game real racing 3 if when a race of just go to see all the car you have.  There be a \"i\" button that will give the player real information about the car the player is looking at."

        "I love this game. Just like other reviews say, it is addicting and because there are constant tasks to complete. Plus!..unlike other games, there is no way you ruin out of coins/money. The cities bring in alot. I can't agree with one reviewer that megabucks are hard not come by.  I began with 25 I believe (now at 32) and some of the tasks to complete give megabucks without spending actual money to even purchase some.  All in all, try this game and you won't run bored of it.",
        "Best game!! Very addictive, Been playing this game for over a year.. although, there are still alot to improve!  I hope the developers will include edit mode in the next update so that the players can rearrange their city..Also, I hope they will also include a 360 rotation of the city and add factories that can also create materials needed in the game like the railroad materials and steels. I am looking forward with this updates!!",
        "Great, but really needs \"sell all\" function for dealing with store house and \"pecial buildings\" components.This is a really quality game, looks amazing, works well and has good timed construction projects. However, as others mention it takes SOOOOOOO long to accrue the assets for construction and the mega bucks for expansion. You have to be VERY patient if you are not willing to part with actual cash. An idea might be to offer a conversion of coins to megabuck, maybe get 1 buck in excahge for eg 5,000,000 coins?",
        "Good game but......after a day into it you make no coin. After every level upgrade it pushes the (buy) equipment option. Not to mention every time you level up. You got to.exit out 15 boxes.before you can continue. Good game but, it's a failure on the free to play aspect.  My rating is fair and final. It's a (ok)  game but many better ones out thwre",
        "The new update is great! Really appreciate the chat system. But it could be better... maybe add some functionality to the capital buildings and states.... maybe bonuses to taxes nd pop, loans, and coop science and military missions. The prices of capital building materials is ridiculous. Fixing these will make the state system look more complete.",

        "I find it a little tricky to navigate sometimes, since it makes my on-screen navigation bar disappear. I like it but maybe I would like it more if there was a back arrow? Also the ads are pretty annoying. They randomly pop up, they're always a video, and there's not really any insentive to watch them. But all-in-all, it's a good game. It's pretty entertaining, it isn't very time consuming, and I'd say it's at least worth a try. Thanks for reading",
        "Really disappointed. I played the party game to win the St Patrick's badge. I came 2nd place when it finished and ift said I had won a badge but it doesn't appear in my badge collection. Then I notice that the party game has been extended by another 24 hrs. Now I'm 96th place. That's not fair. I won that badge fair and square can you give it to me, please?",
        "I love this game, but the ads are over the top. Can I pay to make them g away again? I don't know what happened, but I had a paid version with no ads before? I played a few games but the abundance of ads made this a stresser instead of stress relief. üòü",
        "I love the game but HATE the way advertisements are difficult to dismiss. You are forced to view the same annoying ads (mostly for silly bubble popping games)... and sometimes the cancel \"x\" button is so small it won't close the ad when clicked multiple times. I've been playing this game over 2 years and just had to CLOSE the app because I couldn't dismiss an advertisement.",

        "Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.",
        "There's always a bug when there's about to be substitution of players causing the players in possession of the ball to run like headless chicken. Pls fix that. Add SULLEY MUNTARI of Deportivo La Coruna to the game pls. 'Need FTS18 with embedded dream league soccer ffs! Seems many players who have their current teams in the game are missing. Lawrence Ati of Sochaux in Ligue 1, Joe Dodoo, and many more. A quick update with massive changes will be great 'cause the game currently sucks!!!",
        "DLS is one of the best games on Android. Just need some improvement in training mode, Training is full of bugs. And where is Ball change mode?? Please add new stylish Match Balls. AND PLEASE ADD NEW CELEBRATIONS IN NEW STYLE!! Need more realistic Gameplay. Really hope that you guys fix all small bugs soon. I'll rate 5 Stars!! ‚ù§üëèüëè",
        "Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don't get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a \"Create a Player\" option under 'My Club' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It'd be so nice if you add that.",
        "Look what I experienced. Dls needs development. The commentry needs more reasonableness and intelligence. The behaviour of each player, at least the famous ones should be unique. Controls need more improvement. Add real team logos for the opponent teams. Update players team data according to the recent transfers. And one more issue, while playing local multiplayer we need an extra device to connect two phones. This is a bad experience. If we can connect with each other simply by connecting wifi and hotspot of the two phones respectively, it would be great and simple.",
        "It is a brilliant game absolutely loved it. But it cud add something first can it have every player's data like if i bought neymar then can it in records give his number of goals, assists, appearances and second after every player's stats that his pitch map how many interception he did and etc not just motm bur every player"

Really fun to play, this is the longest time I've ever played such a game in my phone. Absolutely love it!",
        "this game is good till about 8 hours in where your waiting days to build anything. Gems are really hard to come by so you have to be wary about how much stock u have. And there's no way to dispose of unwanted items in your warehouse (that I know of) but yeah, it's a catchy game",
        "Pretty much a money pit. It's designed to frustrate you into spending money. Everything takes stupid amounts of resources to build or expand. The expansions are tiny. It becomes impossible to fill orders because they all want items you can't make because you cant build anything. Caravans usually ask for ridiculous amount of things and you have no storage room. Everything takes too long to make or regrow so even if you have room, the caravan times out. And the rewards for filling them is measly. It'll still take weeks to get enough to defeat monsters that block expansions. Don't download if youre looking for a fun game.",

I will gladly support a game I like by making purchases but I'm not about to spend my house payment just to progress IN A GAME!! Not cool, and makes me regret the money Ive spent so far. On to the next!!",

        "This game is really fun!! One bug I have found though is when you reset you're ascended points it gives you 20000 back no matter how many ascended points you have. For example I had 2 ascended points put them into damage reset it and got 20000 back. Gotta fix that. Over all it's a really fun game",
        "So far it's a very fun game. The music reminds me of old rpgs, and the random loot reminds me of Diablo. I'm about an hour into grinding and have only been forced to watch one 30 second ad but you have the option to watch a few more for items or perks. No bugs seen yet. I got a little happier when I left the game on and my lil hero's went into the dungeon without me.",
        "Can be very fun but is confusing at some points. For example, while attempting to ascend, you must lose the battle. Capturing beasts is also confusing and im still not sure what they are even used for. Otherwise, great game!",
        "This game gets very complicated very quickly. The game's mechanics of clicking on your character to heal them doesn't work often because the characters move quickly.  If you lock a specific item it still allows you to sell it with no notice. Overall a decent game that has too much to offer up too early.",
        "Auto play ads, and loading message on the screen at all times.  Power ups for sale at all timed.  These are the features that turned me completely away.  You should stay away too.",
        "They say it is fun playing this game, bit to me it's not. Why? The words are so very tiny cant read message written in it. If you let the letters enlarge it i'll give you 5 stars"
