     [ 'Well, I still liked Duel Generations better, and wish that that game would work again, but I have to admit that visually and game play wise Deul Links is pretty amazing. Especially for a free game. I haven\'t gotten very far into it yet, but so far it\'s intuitive and just really slick looking. However, there is one reason I still would prefer Generations, and that is because I loved the inclusion of ALL versions of Yu-Gi-Oh, not just the first series. I grew up with 5DS  and Zexal more than anything, and I wish that those series could be incorporated into the game somehow. I\'d love to be able to play as Kite or Astral or something.',
       'this truly an amazing game, there\'s really only a couple of things, why reduce the monster and spell/trap zones to only 3 cards? I wouldn\'t say it\'s bad, I just don\'t see why you\'d need to do it.. plus the average deck size of yugioh is between 40 and 50 cards, why limit us to only a max of 30 cards? (not including the 5 for extra  decks) but all in all its a great game! Finally got my six samurai deck!😄 also, I think it\'d be an awesome idea to put in a way for duelists to redeem the codes on the cards they\'ve purchased IRL. I bet that\'d get even more duelists to play! Just a thought though😊',
       'My app is not opening. I love this game wish you have have out more different cards in the packs. I would like to see swords of reveling light. A bunch of rare magic and trap cards. You should not be able to use Odion\'s chain reaction duel sense in the PvP duels.',
       'Never played Yugioh this is the first time in this game and it is easily accessible with this game to get into this card game. I liked Yugioh better than the other TCG game like Pokémon,Hearthstone,Magic etc and I thought they are kind of more complicated for me because of their sourcing system like mana and energy while its all about monster cards, traps and spells etc. Very good card game and newbie friendly in general both those wanting to get into Yugioh and card gaming in general :D',
       'Found Yu-Gi-Oh on Netflix last week and decided to rewatch it. A few episodes in, and my love for the show rekindled, I got eager to play the game myself. I used to play with Yu-Go-Oh cards when I was a kid but it\'s been about 12 years since then and so all my old cards are in the loft, not that I know anyone IRL anymore who would fancy a game anyway, and not accessible right now... plus I had forgotten most of the rules too. But this app is just what I was looking for: a way to relearn the rules and have a bit of fun. Perfect for whatever skill level you\'re at with the game!',
       'Trash, true fans would never say this game is great. Only 3 monster and spell/trap zones and the person that goes first only starts with 4 cards? Really? Not to mention the terrible camera angles and rigged matches. If you\'re a competitive player that doesn\'t like to get bs, don\'t play this.' ],

As an f2p player, I struggle a lot against other paid player who have a lot SSR character, although its not impossible to gain one, but it required a lot of patience...and luck.

       'While I definitely enjoy the game. There are many flaws that I see in the game. That would be the energy. Perhaps what could be done is a full refresh on energy per level and lowered timer for energy. My next thing is chats. There are many weird censorships like when I type farming, it censors rm. And for things like faction chat, i think you should get an alert on it like how it is in private. Thats all I can think of off of the top of my head. Otherwise, you\'ve done a great job so far uBeeJoy! Im definitely intrigued with the storyline. Leveling may be slow at times, but whenever I do level up, I enjoy the parts of the story unlocked!',

Would be better if more free chips were available for those who cannot afford to purchase them such as pensioners. Daub alert should be on all cards for those with vision difficulties. A lot more fun to play when unlimited power ups are active.',
       'I started with Bingo Bash and am now a bingo junkie! I really like the different ways they have made it more fun and challenging. You don\'t have to spend a lot to play and to win. I love it!! I haven\'t had any bad incidences,it has all been good to go...Bingo!!! Been playing BB for a year straight,now. I am definately hooked. The rooms are getting more interesting each  year! This isn\'t your Gramma\'s Bingo anymore. Enjoy, I sure do.',
       'But says you can use coins to buy chips and havnt seen where I can do that yet. Ive traded Gems for a chip and coins and I dont get the chips everytime. When I have 2 cards and I Bingo on one and Im still playing card 2 why am I not allowed to Bingo on that one as well when that happens ? I have done that a couple of times. But wouldn\'t accept it. Love it now thank you for fixing it !!!!',
       'I would really like this game more if u took the rocket out, or have it as an option. I dislike that part immensely b 1/6 update. Getting bored with it. Obviously with bingo u have no control over numbers called. But so far and few do u get a bingo',
       'This game is cool, need to fix the near last calls of numbers to be able to press it for a bingo, doesn\'t give you a chance, game over. It\'s ridiculously hard to get buy cards and most duds. aside from that I like it, double up is cool. Need more game to continue to level up. Been playing awhile and I still enjoy bingo bash',
       'This game is addictive and with each new game the pay out gets a little better. Wish they didn\'t cost so many tokens to play. But hey got to try to get us to spend money somehow. I guess I\'ll just have to keep winning. I\'m hooked not ashamed to say it. I had 4 bingo games dl on my phone now only have this one. I\'m picky about my games so it must be good' ],

     [ 'I really love this game. Of course it WANTS you to spend real money on it, but you don\'t really have to to make progress. Just set stuff up then go back to it later. As per other reviews it does take a while to load, but due to the excellent graphics, music and overall feeling of happiness I get playing this - they are forgiven.',
       'Okay, this is probably the most honest review I will ever take the time to write. The game is beautiful and entertaining...just like everything Disney does. The other thing Disney does EXTREMELY well is suck money from you (I live in Orlando - I KNOW this, Man). I\'m not proud of what I\'m about to say but I just spent $30 on essentially a "Russian Roulette" for Alice in Wonderland characters. It\'s like this...the game is entertaining and enjoyable to an extent...but if you\'re money concisious don\'t download this game. I\'ve played a lot of app games and this one FAR surpasses the need for real money. The game is entertaining and fun if you semi/kinda love Disney stuff because of nostalgia or whatever...but if you\'re a die-hard Disney fanatic...this game will bankrupt you. So, fear it.',
       'This is a literal waiting game.   Little to no reward for waiting hours at the very start.   I tried being patient and sticking to it but the waiting just gets longer.   It\'s a money sink.   You\'ll not make any progress.   The chests are a joke, the rewards are a joke, and you\'ll never unlock new characters.',
       'I\'ve given it 5 stars but really it would be 4.5 stars. The prices of things in this game are stupidly high and they don\'t make it easy for you to get money and gems. It will take you months just to save up to expand one square in the kingdom.',
       'Amazing game, even for those who prefer to not spend money like myself. The only thing that I am curious about is that some of the characters need to be bought with gems, but then the reward for completing a set is significantly less gems, so I feel as though the gem based rewards should be for collecting all the characters in a set aside from those that have to be bought.',
       'OK I love this game, however have a problem, I recently broke my phone had to send it of to get fixed. Have uploaded this game to my iPad have clicked it over to the correct game to keep my level however gets right to the loading section then kicks me out. My iPad is up to date, can you please fix this bug. I haven\'t played for a few games, the tempary phone I have won\'t let me play either. Please fix..' ],

     [ 'Final Fantasy Record Keeper does a great job at showing FF History in a condensed form, while keeping true to the core mechanics that the original hexalogy has started. From the big mechanics like the ATB system, limit breaks and summons! To the smaller details like needing to use the camp menu to heal, sort and re-equip before each battle. The game does have one huge issue, and that\'s the really long loading times, and input lag outside of battle. It ruins an otherwise good title.',
       'So after the update, I now have to create a new account. Ive played since release just to lose it all. Spent money on mithral. A little help please devs',
       'Man I love this game.  It\'s even better with Kingdom Hearts!  For those that lost their account like I did, you\'re likely using the wrong email address.  Apparently I needed to use my sisters email even though I connected with my Google account.',
       'Its a great game but one thing I don\'t like is the equipment summons for 11x being too much mythrils . I wish that getting mythrils were quicker to get or lower the amount needed to use 11x weapons summons. But overall its a great and fantastic game.',
       'Fix the problem with the Google play sync and will change to five stars.... Having to re sync my Google account every time I want to play is getting old fast.... Thousands of people are talking about this same problem online. Might wanna fix it quick before we all just quit playing',
       'Please fix the background music issue as every so often it would just cut out and I\'m left doing the battles without the music. Please fix this issue. Rating 3 stars but I put 5 as if i rate 3 stars, the review seems to get deleted. Please fix the music issue. 3 stars from me until this issue has been resolved' ],

     [ 'Such a shame. The game is great, really enjoyed the concept however it is a prime example of how monetisation strategy can ruin a game. Gems too difficult to earn without buying them, and purposely easy to accidentally spend them. Too many ads too. I\'d rather have paid for the game. Deleted it after a  day or so.',
       'Game has so much potential and is a blast. I\'m giving it a bad rating because gems are insanely expensive and they have so many buttons to hit to "use 200 gems to remove 3 lines" as one example or another to lose 200 by placing the button right above the back button on a phone. Super lame move on devs to intentionally take insanely expensive gems from us by mistake. No confirmation or anything, just boom, gone. Lacks ethics to say the least rinow',
       'Not What It Used To Be  The second to last update I did for this app switched the aim of the ball to slightly off from where you point it. So now have to compensate (guess a bit) when you\'re aiming which makes play more challenging.  Likewise, levels beyond about 440 are becoming impossible to beat w/o saving like a weeks with of bonuses to use on each level. Beating one level a week is hardly fun anymore! I may be uninstalling this app soon.',
       'Games fine. I refuse to rate a game well when it\'s annoying ads start pushing political agenda against gun owners. Will go elsewhere',
       'Great game.   But one of the adverts is a virus.   The IG Academy advert wrecked my game and now my phone\'s being a pain in the ass',
       'I really this game, plenty of challenging levels, very addictive for sure. I just got a new phone and was bummed to have to start all over (had gotten to level 360) but my new phone came with an updated/better version so now I\'m stoked on it all over again. Sometimes I wanna quit this game but I never do.' ],

       'I don\'t know how good is game on other languages but in Croatian it sucks. I\'m deleting this game because of constant repetition of non-existent words in Croatian language... Even all dialects included. I even purchased few times coins just to see which word is it and it wasn\'t Croatian.',
       'A good idea overall...but.. in Croatian language to many non existing words..Ads are so annoying that I wanted to uninstall game couple of times but finally I kept it. Please review and update database of words you have and reduce amount of ads...and than you will get five stars from me..',
       'An ad after EVERY SINGLE TASK? Really? Too much for me, thanks. Otherwise, the game is fun, graphic is good, I like the variety of languages to choose from. Battery goes to hell while playing, even with sounds off - that\'s also an issue.',

       'I have been playing this game for a long time! Was up to 550 million this morning and no matter what hand I had, I always got beat! If I had 3 of a kind, the one and only other person in the hand would catch a straight. If I had a straight, someone would catch a flush! Game is rigged somehow. I\'m going back to WSOP',

Dh already decided who must win and who must lose, it got nothing to do with cards and your luck. once Dh chooses some to lose,  that person will lose whole day. BIGGEST NO to this game downloaders',
       'Update.  Got up to 10 mill in chips. Been playing for couple days on and off. Lost almost every hand. Played straight up or all in. Don\'t waste your time. Crooked game play hoping you\'ll buy chips. Your beat dh I\'ll  never buy chips!!! Played 35 hands and did not match a card. FIXED SO YOU\'LL  BUY CHIPS. LOSERS. Read further into the reviews. The couple they show make there  game look good, the rest show the truth. Figured it out..... on the weekends people  that buy chips get to collect off non chip buyers .... so do not play  if you don\'t  buy chips!!!',
       'Lose, lose, lose. Thats pretty much all that happens in this app, because they want you to keep buying more chips. It wouldn\'t be so bad if you had a few wins in between but once you show them you can afford to buy credits, you lose even faster. Too damn greedy!' ],

     [ 'Hate the new update. What\'s with you and all these chibi things? You\'ve done it before and based on the review, your players love the Mature and Realistic style much better. So why you changed back again? You have totally Lost your Identity and Uniqueness as LoA game.  If you planned on doing this, why don\'t you do it in the first place? so we don\'t have to waste our time and money!',
       'What\'s with the chibi hero icons? 😭 The artwork was so good and everything works smoothly before the update. Also, during battle, it\'s lagging. In my  opinion, the previous one is way better than current. I\'ve been a fan of different LoA versions, please don\'t ruin this one. 😟',
       'I *HATE* the new style. The reason why I liked this game in the first place was because there were no chibi characters. Dominion has no instructions and seems rather useless - but could be developed into something cool. The team formation doesn\'t have a way to sort your characters (I wish it was ordered by BR). I can get used to the new layout but for right now adjusting is hard. Thanks for developing the game more but please go back to the original character designs.',
       'I started playing this game few days ago and I liked it so much. The graphics, controls, story all we\'re very interesting and addictive. Until the developers decided to update this game and completely ruin it and making it just like other mainstream RPG genere with ordinary graphics.   They just completely removed the story of the game and now every stage looks like I\'m playing some Angry Bird infact even that game has some story to every level.   In conclusion, this game was more fun before the update but now it\'s like ordinary RPG.',
       'Update on 2/23 made the game worse. Originally i gave this game a 5 star but with this update it feels more like a 3 star if not 2 star game. I get that you have to update games to keep it fun but sometimes you shouldn\'t change something just for the sake of change. Why not add content instead of trying to fix something that isn\'t broken.',
       'Originally sold on the realism of artwork, then slapped in the face with ugly-by-comparison cartoon representations after last update. If they want a game with this style, go make one. Don\'t suddenly apply it into a game people are already invested in and were sold on realism in character visuals. Every preview image for the download page is now practically a lie. Might come back, despite the complete lack of foresight and consideration to the players, should they properly change the artwork back. Otherwise I\'ll be uninstalling and thinking twice before ever touching another GTarcade related game.' ],

       'At first I thought it was great, but now I realise it\'s just another PAY-TO-WIN game... You\'ve got no chance if you come up against a paid-for character like Batman. It\'s such a shame this is the way game devs are heading these days.',

Aside from that a very cool game. To be at the very top it is pay to win. Besides that really cool. Lots of heroes and therefore possibilities.',
       'My first review disappeared so I will leave another.  This game was great at first, then it started inserting the buyable characters such as Batman, Assassin\'s Creed and they are so over powered, one of them can take down your whole team without taking any damage.  Game is now so unbalanced that it isn\'t worth playing.  Until they fix the game, it worth playing.  Unless you like wasting money to feel like a god with over powered characters.  Game is dead, play something else.',

They will auto reply and say plenty of ppl still have fun without out paying, I made it to level 65 and it\'s just not true.' ],

     [ 'My favorite game I have ever played on mobile.  Thought I wasn\'t going to like it the first day until I read a review that said it was better than the regular game. Went back and played it. Now I have logged in every single day since launch day last year. I actually love it so much I play with two separate accounts on two different phones. Now that\'s most definitely something I will probably never ever do with another game ever made. That should say it all right there. Best role-playing game on mobile. Best game on mobile I have ever played and I\'ve played hundreds. Nuff said.',
       'The new arena future is great. But there is lots of room for improvement. If they start linking it with money then all effort down the drain.  Edit- Now I am starting to dislike the game. Event Rewards are no more good. If you pump lots of money then only you get good characters. Arena feature doesn\'t allow us to select players in public matches .',
       'Good game though if you want new characters expect to pay for them! Get about 10 free then from their either pay £90 or dont progress any futher. Would rather spend that on my ps4. Apart from that gd style off game, shame im starting get annoyed that cant progress or gain new characters. Hopefully devs will sort it out before i give up on it?',
       'It\'s been a month now and the bug still hasn\'t been fixed. LET ME HOST IN THE ARENA!!!! I can only join matches from my fellowship but whenever i try to host my own to get more trophies it would never lead me to the part which level i want to do. I just get stuck on the "connecting to matchmaking" loop. Please',
       'Decent game. But the back to back events keep us from kicking players from the fellowship. Its extremely annoying. I\'ve submitted a ticket but it didn\'t solve anything. Fix this issue immediately.',
       'Overall a cracking game to waste time, good story and gameplay mechanics for a mobile game are top notch. Only faults are it takes so long to earn enough mirian (money for upgrades) and gems for new characters but overall a fantastic mobile game, maybe even the best I\'ve ever played.' ],

     [ 'Played many times and game play is ok and its quick to connect to opponents. But the dice suck!! Not sour grapes but all to often when you are in an unbeatable position the opponent will throw 4 doubles or exactly the right sequence of dice to win. This im sure is to encourage payment of coins. Not the best because of this bit could be.  Its a shame it ruins the fun totally!! Edited as the dice really are pants! Ive played many backgammon games online and they do not re-act like these do. There is definatly an issue that needs to be resolved as they don\'t drop as they should. I am sure the other reviews are accurate regarding the dice',
       'Really?? Its absolutly riggged!!, cant believe people rate it 5 stars... first you win, they ask u to rate it and them you lose with impossible dice combinations... dont waste your time and money with this app.',
       'I\'ve been playing this on my computer & 2 other cell phone for months. Since Xmas update I have installed & uninstalled from my cell 35x & the screen locks every time at 94% & won\'t play. PLEASE FIX!  Game was the best I\'ve found & I really enjoyed playing it.  Almost Impossible to use skills against unbelievable - impossible rolls & Dbls. Some players know how to hack game.  I Played in clubs professionally 38 yrs.  When I\'m winning other players roll 6-7 dbls in a row & win with impossible odds at the end of the game. 14 dbls in 1 game - NOT in real life. Never in life rolled 10 dbls in 1 game.',
       'The game is rigged and they steal 25% of all your winnings... They\'re after your credit card like starved vampires after fresh blood! AVOID IT',
       'Ive had Backgammon Live and Playgem. This game seems a little better. Seems to help other players. Don\'t tell me the luck of the rolls!!!!',

     [ 'WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you',
       'Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It\'s pretty decent. I\'m enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I\'ve raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn\'t a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)',
       'You "borrowed" a lot from MCOC, but as an avid Tekken player, I think you would have been better served sticking with the PS concept. Play the character you want, play their story for prizes at the end, and so on.  Using MCOC basic controls was cool, but if there is anything to borrow from them completely would have been the controls. Different offensive taps to create different moves, etc. Overall, it is petty solid, but could have been a hit if you stuck to your own game concept.',
       'iFirst of all I would say. It took me almost 30 minutes to just start the game. It was stuck in downloading screen. Later on it crashed on me  I fired up the game again and later It froze on me during the first fight. For 3rd time I started the game and it eternity to just pass through the loading screen. The data was downloading, then initializing and then loading. Took such a long time. Plz fix this issue. I really want to enjoy this game. But not like this. Even the game play is laggy.',
       'The odd bug and very grindy. Still strangely satisfying . Some fun to be had in finding ways to cheese the AI. Good for a quick tekken fix.  Edit: lowered my vote - despite phone on vibrate and game volume turned down it blasted my speakers at full volume. Not acceptable.',
       'Fun game overall, though I wish they would\'ve added more known characters. It feels like they just peppered in a couple of favorites. I am also having an issue where after a fight my progress isn\'t saved, causing me to have less health and I have to do the same fight again. It\'s frustrating to say the least, hence thr three stars...for now.' ],

My level is back to my previous gae; however to my shock, all my hard-earn power-ups are 0 now. Is there anything you can do to retrive them back??TT Thank you~~ I really enjoyed this game.',
       'This game is great! The characters make the game play more fun than just matching items. And when I get close to not beating a level their lips quiver and worry and make me laugh. So if you are a lighthearted fun person you will love this cute game.',
       'Best match game! This matching game is the best from all of the different matching games I\'ve tried. It\'s so colorful and refreshing! The characters are adorable and I love the art style. It\'s also really fun when you\'re about to fail a level and the characters get teary-eyed. 😅',
       'A lot like candy crush with some interesting twists. Every switch from puzzle screen to menu screen brings up a loading page that takes a really long time. Over all though a good app for kids.',
       'Just keeps getting worse!  Great update! I have to close it after 3 games because the screen flashes!  You get x3 and they give you 1. All the "review highlights " are from an older version!  May have been ok back then, but jam city has added scam to it. Unable to remove last cracker with balloon, yet they take one of them from me. Watch a stupid ad and the screen goes black or flashes.  Restart and that life has been lost.  Or, watch an ad and you don\'t get the booster.  Some levels are faded and cant be played.  Shut it down and that life has been lost.  81 did it 3 times.  These people have no integrity.',

     [ 'Love this game. Its not pay to win like so many others however if you choose to pay its priced fairly. Lots to do on a daily basis and seems to be pretty fair when summoning/ pulling/picking as well. I got a great pull my 2nd try. Doesn\'t seem rigged like other games where you never have a chance of getting anything good. This game seems fair which I can appreciate. I\'ve played and tried many games. I\'d definitely recommend this game whether your looking for a fun game to play or just something to pass the time. Keep up the good work 7 Palidans.',

     [ 'I\'ve played CE for almost a week now. I like the art and concept of the game. Interesting idea of heroes. I highly recommend it if you enjoy playing idle rpg games like dungeon rush and idle heroes. The only problem that I noticed so far is there\'s limited things to do. More content is required for extended gameplay, otherwise 15-20 minutes everyday is more than enough to do everything there is to do. A 5 star, nevertheless. I don\'t see any reason to be a VIP yet.',
       'Dev\'s other game, Epic Summoners, and this one, are essentially clones of other games. But, as games like Grim Dawn are essentially clones of Diablo, yet do the genre justice, so do these games. You will find so many familiar mechanics to other popular games. Done well, my only issue being the "need" to spend cash to truly advance. Other than that, art is awesome, enjoyable, and worth at least a download and playtime.',
       'This game is similar to other idle Rpg games  and has good graphics. The casino seems a little rigged but that\'s my only complaint. I played this game for 1 hr without paying any real money and progressed pretty quickly. If you have the patience you can progress in the game without paying any real money.',
       'I wouldn\'t even call this a game, you\'ll "play" 20-30 mins worth a day and all your doing is collecting things and put them into slots. The graphics and art are actually really good that\'s why I download this in the 1st place.',
       'Pay to progress, simple as that. Servers are dead as no one wants to fork out cash for every event that on the whole offer no real game play. Remaining players have spent hundreds and lord it over people like children. Emphasis on paying is madness, it costs £20 for 10 scrolls. You need 600 for top tier reward... Played a shameful amount and without paying you get nowhere. But drop rates and RNG is so poor you don\'t want to pay.',
       '15 minutes after starting game and I\'m still not able to do anything just follow tutorial squares... Maybe this game is just a tutorial. I got level 12 by just pressing yellow tutorial squares. It\'s like when teacher tell you to write on board 2+2=4 without letting you to solve it on your own. And after that you just follow instructions, will teacher give you certificate of nuclear physics. I don\'t know when tutorial ends, but I have enough, and I am uninstalling this "click here" game.' ],

       'It might not seem so, but has highly strategic gameplay and very good management, good sound overall and beautiful artwork. You don\'t need to spend tons money on it, but, progress can be quite slow - especially evolving heroes. A lot of it is based on chance, which is not the best, but not the worst kind of chance. A bit confused why it is impossible to praise clan members same or lower level - surely low-level players could use the little gold unlike the high-levels, and high-level players would use the food. Once you get to lvl 100, you actually end up with having almost no way to get food and might as well stop playing.',
       'I\'d love to play for more than 10 minutes a day. 125 energy and a map takes 9 energy and lasts ~1.5 minutes.  The amount of grinding required is way too much for so little energy. The first 4 days or so, you level up fast enough to build a surplus of energy, then you struggle to do anything after the honeymoon is over.',
       'I like your game nice way to kill time, but it becomes clear the first time a player tries to upgrade char abilities that devs are only in it for your hard earned money, players must be VIP 5 to purchase extra points to upgrade character abilities.  VIP requirement makes it impossible to level 5 character crew and evenly.',

However I noticed that I purchased chips all the time. The game takes all the chips each time and you have to repurchase. I have a Samsung Galaxy 6 Edge Plus. I have tried to install DoubleDown Casino many times and it always crashes. So for now I will not install it on my phone. I am still playing,its addicting..but i am still looking for other games to fill my time.',
       'Graphics are totally messed up at start up.  I cannot see games. The games that appear are games I do not play. I have deleted and readded casino but games are still not showing. Wheel spins give low points. Hard to get high points. When you manage to get a good score, it takes away until you get low. I like the games but often lose down to nothing. I will not buy credit for any games I play so if losing  credit is an attempt to get me to buy, forget it. I have kept this casino open longer than any others because I actually like the games.',

     [ 'The stories are addicting and exciting. But you make us watch several ads and THEN ask us to pay for EVERY THING extra. From clothes to hair to what to say next to new chapters. I get the world revolves around money but you are getting paid plenty with these big name ads. Let the game be more enjoyable and make it free or a set price from the start for the app. You lure people in and then ask for money if they want to continue. Nah, I\'ll wait an hour for the ticket. Great game concept though.',
       'It\'s like Episode\'s ugly cousin. Story line is okay, character look is very limited, in order to play the rest of the game you HAVE to pay a subscription fee like the game is worth it. For one month it\'s 7.99 and may I remind you that Netflix (10000% better) is the exact same price as that for a standard pack. Episode (story app like this) is much more cost-efficient and over all better because at the very least you can make your character resemble you, don\'t have to spend so much out of your pocket, and Episode also isn\'t prone to crashing like this one.',
       'I\'ve only read 1 story so far. The story itself wasn\'t bad. The characters are kind of goofy looking but I like the app. You\'re able to earn gems as you go. It does give you only 1 ticket at a time, per hr. But it also gives you the option to watch videos to speed up the clock so you can get it sooner. Which NONE of the other apps like this do! However, at the moment, it isn\'t working for me. No matter how many times I try to speed up the clock, it isn\'t budging. It was working 2 hrs ago. So, IDK if there is a daily limit or what, because I didn\'t get a warning. There is something about the videos I don\'t like though... After you watch them, it automatically brings you to the app store to download whatever game you just watched the video for. Sooooo annoying! Otherwise, not a bad game thus far. It is a great time waster!',
       'Subscribed for a month..cost me $9.99.  Not bad I thought...until the game stopped working in the middle of a story. Had to restart game and it went to loading page....stayed at 10% and will Not load any further. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling ...no luck! Asking for my money back . Funny how it stopped working a couple hours after I paid!!!',
       'I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME!!  This game is amazing and a great time killer! I\'ve used the game in the past when they gave 2 tickets but I\'ve recently downloaded it, they only give 1 ticket for 1 HOUR! The stories it self is good, the characters lacks some things, the stories are too short. The \'free\' diamonds doesn\'t work, when ever I click on it, it goes black and closes the app which is frustrating. The choices in the stories are 10 to 25 GEMS which takes forever for someone like me who doesn\'t pay for gems. BUT other then that there isn\'t anything I could think of from the top of my head.  So, please fix these....',
       'So addictive I couldn\'t stop playing it. Only thing I will say is you need to get to many diamonds for the clothes and some of the decisions you have to make. X Is there any more books after Mona series study abroad ? As it did say to be continued' ],

     [ 'The game is good, but the multiplayer needs to be fixed.  It hangs on load and results in the player losing money or gems with no recourse.  It randomly drops ships, and when one player immediatlely gets the best ship and the other player doesn\'t receive any ship until 10 rounds later, it is impossible to catch up.  Fix the multiplayer, then you get your 5 stars.',
       'I was trying to take advantage of the first time deal. I purchased a deal and for some reason Google play didn\'t allow me to  complete the charge. The next day I look in my bank account and I have been charged for what Google play said I couldn\'t do and I was charged another $4 when I didn\'t even click on anything. I want my money back. That is real shady that you would charge someone for a service that didn\'t even go through. And where did a $4 charge come from. And there is no way to ask through support to get that back so I\'m taking this here where others can see. Don\'t spend money here or there will be random charged in your bank account.  Update: I do not want a thank you, i want my money back. There\'s no way to contact the developers except through Google play which already seems shady.',
       'Definitely not worth it. Was fun at first, but after the updated quests, the game took a serious nosedive in quality. Now you HAVE to beat the opponent in order to get anything, otherwise you\'re out 1000 gold. Before, you would get something just for playing. The new PvP just sucks.',
       'The forced ads are so frequent and annoying. Pvp either freezes and steals your coins or you win and lose coins. Probably over 100,000 coins lost this way. Game has potential and is fun, but company took this fun game and made it not worth playing',
       'Pretty decent game, shame you need to pay gems for the second last ship. The PvP is fun but half the time reduces my gold when I win. Cannot see the devs replying to any messages so unsure if they care',
       'Th game is fun and addicting. Way to many ads!!! Ahhhh My gold counter doesnt always register after endless mode is over. Gives me dble gold if i watch ad but doesnt register after endless battle sometimes. Would gave better review but that sux when it happens. Fix!!!!' ],

     [ 'This is my new favorite game. I love the heroes and the quests. It\'s fun trying to get the best heroes and build the perfect team. My only issue with this game is that it sometimes shuts down while I\'m building a team for a quest or right after the quest before I can collect the rewards. It has shut down at least 4 times today alone. I hope this stops happening after the next update.',
       'Game is horrible,everything is rng based,and i mean everything. Gacha is the worst compared to any game released and i dont mean spend 30$ and complain,spent over a thousand in 2 momths to try for 1 of 2 main healers and still nothing combined with regular diamond income,meaning none of the top connects are doable. Arenas and events are all pvp or ranked vs top players where you stand no chance what so ever. Overall this games horrible and not worth your time or money.',
       'It\'s a fantastic game. The only problem I have come across is the summoning function. When I was able to do my first summon, I got a few rare characters and I was happy about that. Then I saw this summoning event where I could get some special units, so I saved up the in-game currency to summon them. When I did summon, I got some of the same characters I had summon before. To back up my suspicions, I restarted the game several times to get the currency to summon again and kept getting the same seven "Super Rare" units. The game itself is almost a solid 5 for me but the odds of getting a promoted unit through a summon will probably disappoint.',
       'Lots of collectables an quest to do with a friend an chat room an doesn\'t require you to dish out alot of money to play a give it\'s a 8 out of 10 it\'s lots of fun',
       'Games pretty fun. Really easy and cute art. Just a bit slow with load times even with the full game downloaded.',
       'An awesome game it has a good story, character, and Music/BGM. Each characters has a backstory, this is a very great game' ],

They\'re not annoying like some games that repeat the same darn words throughout the game. Uuuuuugh! So annoying.  Thank you developers for not destroying the fun in this game by putting repeating vocals. The music is calming, the graphics are awesome! I don\'t have the funds to purchase power-ups, etc., but it\'s still fun! This 51yr. old lady thanks you bunches! 🙆‍♀️👍',

I had completed all the winter levels and was up to the new year levels and it\'s been wiped back to 167 of winter levels only. Also was about to hit 1000 stars, now back to only 411 but all my arendale achievement are there. Lost interest now. Don\'t want to have to do it all over again.',

Updated 2/28/18 - was working 4 days ago and now I only get a black screen.',

     [ 'I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn\'t have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn\'t get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren\'t vigilant of their customers and don\'t take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.',
       'Great game with a lot of potential.... There can be so many more additions to make this fps better. More grenade varieties? A spectator mode? Clan levels that allow more players to join when we reacher higher levels? Gun balancing changes? I feel like the Cerberus should be buffed. It is expensive, and the 3 shots at once doesn\'t allow for many attempts for kills. Adventure mode for more gunbucks? Death match option? Allowing us to pick the map? I understand the game is fairly new, so keep on adding changes and new improvements. Thanks for listening!',
       'I REALY LOVE this game but the only thing is that I\'m on level 10 and when ever I play in a battle and win I only get 200 gun bucks. PLZ can I have money transported to my account.My name is PRO_ADMIN.I would REALY HAPPY if you do😕.By the way this is also for my FAMILY and they would love it if you do ):  . I am only 10 and I know I\'m asking for you to do a big thing but my family would really be happy😊.My brother\'s acount is PROGAMER and he is only 6. PLZ if you don\'t reply or do something then it\'s ok ):  .',
       'Game is really tooo gud, graphics also nice n smooth controls but u guys released only one game mode(Team death match), but in lot of fps games they provided free for all, bomb mode, Flag capture n many more modes.. If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games 😀 n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area.',
       'The best shooting game ever. Lobed each and every single thing about this game but there a little suggestion that we can see the player if they are online or not but how is this if we can see there live going on matches? That concept will be great and games lag sometimes so if you can fix this and add my suggestion in guns of boom that will be hell great!! #the best game',
       'I love this game so much. I have been looking for a good shooting game for years and I never found one until I came across this. This is perfect. Me and my friend would spend hours on this game. I have been playing this for about 6 months now. It\'s perfect. I think the best thing about this game is how organized everything is. It is very self explanatory. I found everything and it was easy to do so. I also love how they update this game very often. Great game. I haven\'t had any problems with it. I can\'t wait for updates later on to come.' ],

       'Not bad at all! Awesome strategy game , it\'s all on how you decide to use your  resources (diamonds) . Don\'t even have to Recharge much and still move up in ranks & power. Got hooked on it more than Coc.😃😀🖒🖒',
       'You guys might want to consider making occasional, if not regular update for the game, especially on the events. At least keep up with the regular, basic ones. It was enjoyable. Missed the old days even tho so many changed drastically for good or for worst. The difficulty in everything is not really bothersome but if the minor rewards are slightly helpful, they could bring a fortune to you guys and us, players. Conclusion, please give us what we deserves 😊',

I tried reopening the app and i tried resetting my phone too, to see if it was just a glitch. Please do something about this. I would like my gems back',

You loose all you troops and you don\'t have food to develope new troops and it takes forever to get enough food and train new forces. And you are attacked again and so on. Unistalled game right after that. Alliance is no help.  They have copied whole game from the Zgirls game. Just a little different graphics',

     [ 'Great game. Loving it. I noticed when you go into the Alter, there is a note telling you your capacity limit at the bottom but in the Mana gem screen it doesn\'t tell you. Are you able to add this feature? I can never remember my mana creating limit.  If you make more mana than can fit in your mana storage line, you lose the excess.',
       'AWESOME!!! Originally, I was very reluctant to download this becuase I though it was going to be where you just sit and watch your character do everything for you. I HATE those types of games... This however is actually how I was really hoping it would turn out to be! You can move freely! The levels are linear and its not very open, but thats okay! You see each piece of equipment on your character when you wear it, which is absolutely essential to me! I will not play a game where my appearance does not change, so this has all in all met my expectations! Another RPG worthy of my collection! Thank you!!!',
       'What started out a 5 star wonderful game has dropped to a prime example of how Not to treat loyal players and followers. With the latest update to "rebalance" which stripped long time players of attack powers, levels and hit points the developers should take notice of how many people no longer spend valuable time on their offerings. This is sadly another one for the uninstall button because after months of grinding to improve my character to now basically start over isnt worth it',
       'I am uninstalling this game unless you give me back my power and previous level before the update. You reduced my power, but all levels are at the same difficulty level. That is not adjusting difficulty, that is infuriating.',
       'Great game!   Edit(after recent update)- The game became meaningless. All the hard work invested in it went into the drain. NOT WORTH PLAYING ANYMORE.',
       'Very disappointed with the new changes to the arena pvp. The ability to enlist teamates that are infinitely more powerful than you has made it so that it no longer matters how strong you are, you will likely be dead very fast and be watching your teamate fight another teamate. No skill required now, just find a strong friend. Very discouraging....' ],

     [ 'This game is perfect for anyone who loves magic, fantasy, collecting, and a whole new level of adorable! Dragonvale takes everything to the next level! I highly recommend it, as it is a amazing game, my most played, and I hope everyone else enjoys it just as much as I do. Five stars! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Edit 2: I was re-organizing my islands by Element the other day, and I had just finished the Plant Island. I put down a Oversized Oak Tree, and immediately, a image flashed through my mind: a young girl, sitting on a branch of the oak tree, a book in one hand, a baby Plant dragon sitting next to her. Stretched out in front of them was my Plant Island, the dragons freely soaring, the other islands in the distance. And that sparked a inspiration in my head. I just wanted to ask; can I write a Dragonvale book, which takes place at my park? Please let me know !  :)',
       'Cmon Backflip! Okay look I love Dragonvale, I\'ve been playing it forever. First off I lost my amazing park a while back and that really sucked. But now I am restarting and I go to buy the beginners pack for 9.99 and it says there was an error and i wont be charged...come to find out it did charge me and i didnt receive anything! Please help',
       'I have been playing for a while. After events you get a day to turn in your event specific currency for the prizes, even though the event has ended. Well for Gardenia\'s event, it turned in all my roses before I could exchange them. I had over 25,000 and was so pumped to get the new dragons. Now I don\'t have any roses and 25,000,000 extra coins i don\'t need. Please help. This is a very frustrating bug.',
       'I really love collecting all of the dragons and the fact that you can theme/decorate your park too. But the amount of types of decorations are unbalanced, the majority that you can currently buy in the market are just plant and earth type while there are very few decorations of the other types (such as air, cold, etc).',
       'When I first had it it was super fun. Then I saw a game I wanted so I deleted it I did that before and got it back I could log into facebook and go to my old island. But this time I could not. I was so far and looking forward to seeimg my dragons but it did not let me go to my old island. It left me im tears that I had to do what I did all over again. So I deleted this stupid game and gave this. If I could rate 0 I would',
       'its ok, and you might think you cant li e without it, but trust me.... after a while year of playing, which is what i have waited to wrote this review, the game play becomes very repetitive. sure try it out, its fun, but not something for the rest of your life. dont put money into it, you will regret ir later.' ],

     [ 'Gree support sucks. They don\'t typically solve problems, or even provide appropriate responses to questions. Tapjoy doesn\'t pay out gold offers and isn\'t held accountable by Gree to stand by their offers. Game has come down hill over the years.',
       'Very slow, lags, when you tap on anything, attack, raid, change base, deploy units, buy units.  Just takes forever. That\'s on Android phone, and on iPad 2, takes 5 mins to start, then will just crash, used to work sometimes.  I have been playing for a few years, and it just gets worse.  Otherwise would be good, but if you spend money on gold, it should work.',
       'The game itself is good fun, but it\'s ruined by anything but normal missions can\'t be completed without buying gold from the Gree store, the most frustrating thing is the constant crashes. I am running a completely up to date, vanilla Pixel2 and a 25mbps network and it will crash almost every time, no amount of updates to the game over the past 3 or more years, or my multiple platforms, has changed this. There is massive lag everytime you conduct an action, or change screens. Please, please make it more quick & stable!',
       'Game was good when was under the hands of Funzio.unfortunately ever since Gree takeover, there had been nothing but glitches, dishonest scrupulous non-ethical in-game strategies to trick players of their progress and money. I wouldn\'t advise players to continue spending or start playing this game',
       'Gree either just doesn\'t care about the customers that play this game,  or they have  hired a bunch of bumbling idiots. Always have the same mistakes and problems every time anything is changed, new campaigns, etc. Hard to advance if you don\'t spend real money, but why spend money on a game with such a crappy team running it?? Don\'t waste your time unless your goal is aggrivation and frustration.',

     [ 'Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.',
       'Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning',
       'Absolutely amazing game!!! I\'m a huge petrol head and this ticks all boxes considering it\'s a phone game. Love the controls. Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress.

I\'m just going to name some things that I\'m sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I\'m just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!',

For some reason, I\'m still addicted.',

It takes money to get up to par really quick and its always fun to watch the cpu combo you to death when you have 0 control over it. But take the bs with the good and its a fun game but dont think for free is for me on this one. Gotta pay to play.',

     [ 'Well the energy situation is beyond annoying. You only get very little for free and the prices for the energy and just WAY too expensive. I do like the story a lot though and will probably take 8 years to complete the story so I don\'t have to pay 50 bucks',
       'My absolute favorite of all of the Is it Love games. Colin is an amazing character with an equally amazing backstory, and the way he connects with the MC is just incredible. The twists and turns in each chapter leave me craving more of the story. The energy they give you is somewhat lacking, but I\'m used to it by now. Highly reccomend!',
       'Really don\'t like how the guy treats the girl, what a scumbag! Plus I\'ve been playing for over a week and the plot is unbelievably slow, the energy doesn\'t last long enough. There are much better otome style games out there.',
       'OK, so I absolutely agree with everyone that the energy you get for free is nowhere near enough & packages are too expensive for what you get. I know, I\'ve bought many. This story particular started bad, but now that I\'m at the end, I\'m hooked. Please continue to update. I have lots of bought energy going to waste!!',
       'I don\'t really like the concept of earning energy every 24 hours. But I\'ve got to say every time i see that message when my energy runs out. It leaves me on a cliffhanger and it keeps me in the story. Even if the energy wasn\'t there i would still play the game to my hearts content! Overall AMAZING story and characters!!',
       'Decent game but I refuse to pay the amount of money they want once the energy for the day is gone. The wording is often wrong for the story and the plot could be better. Big issue for me was how overpriced and poorly written this game was.' ],

     [ 'Really like this game. It\'s like the love child of Civilization and Clash of Clans. Love the fact there\'s a different designs for units and buildings when using different nations. Lots of strategy and depth when it comes to battle. Also, includes events based on history. The only thing on my wishlist for this game is that they add a nation unaffiliated with any country and does not have special units so players can play through the default units and buildings through the ages like Yuri in C&C.',
       'The Best Strategy Game I\'ve ever played. Its because It has Unique way to play than other games.Every Level u go U will find out fun & adventures. I got addicted to this game. Speacilly I like the gameplay of this game because Its seems so real.Like,Survived soilder will return to your base,troops vs troops fight, no magic spell,Human made Weapon used in this game which is possible & I love unlocking new ages here. Supper Cool Game',
       'Best empire game I\'ve had. And I\'ve downloaded probably all of them. Great aesthetic changes when upgrading buildings. The fact you can actually strategically place troops and attack is awesome. Love that resources respawn and that there\'s animations when farming them. The different nations with their advantages is a lovely touch.  The one draw back I would say is that it\'s expensive in a new players city to fulfil the task to join an alliance. Not a huge issue. Just would be nice to join friends sooner.  All in all amazing game. Great work Dev team',
       'Fun game, although there is pretty strong pressure to purchase upgrades to complete missions after an hour or so of gameplay. Two stars because the "crown" reward. System does not work. As it should. Several tasks were completed for rewards and the reward never showed up. In fact, the reward mysteriously disappeared from my queue. Feels fishy to me...',
       'Really great game like clash of clans, but mixed with the old age of empires or empire earth. Only problem I\'ve encountered is when I go to upgrade a building, no matter what level I upgrade it to, the preview picture looks like a level 1 version of the building. Other than this, the game is fun and constantly updated. I miss how easy it was to get trade goods.',
       'There are offers for getting crowns by installing and and reaching some points in other games. Even though I completed them I never got the crowns. Furthermore the game is repetitive and absolutely unreliant on any kind of skill. The one thats further ahead in their build tree is the winner 99% when battling. The enjoyment this game hast to offer dwindles, when comparing this game to similar ones like lords mobile or forge of empires' ],

I don\'t get it cause I thought all my games save on Google or facebook all my other games are were there left off so please tell me I didnt waste all that money to start from the begining. I made this comment like 5 days ago I emailed provider of game waited 2 days then called Google only for them to tell me I need to get in touch with the game provider. Then I sent another email with purchases I did and my email and my phone number and nobody still has got back to me or commented on my review. So what do I do now my patience is running out. I even called the number that Google has provided for me for the provider and all I get is a voicemail which I cannot leave a voicemail.',

I can\'t get any new staff,as I don\'t have enough hearts,and once you are at a standstill like this it take FOREVER to earn hearts back. Have loads of cash but nothing to do with it!! Game seems to be designed around getting people hooked initially (as performing operations etc is really fun), but then can\'t continue or progress without purchasing hearts!! Not wasting my time with it any longer.',

Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I\'ll have them all...

     [ 'I really like playing the game. It has great animations smooth gameplay and isn\'t too easy or hard. The one thing I dont like is you can\'t sell your old equipment or skills. If there was a shop to sell them or add runes to them or be able to combine them to make either new or more powerful ones of the sane type I would give this game 5 stars.hopefully the Devs will take this and add this feature in a update. Speaking of updates, I just installed the latest one it was like 403MB but nothing changed! What was the update for then?',
       'The game is a lot of fun but there\'s one big problem the only way to advance in the story mode is by leveling up and getting better armor but the only way to level up is in story mode so your other option is spend real money on better equipment. So it\'s kinda just a money grab. If that was fixed I\'d give it 10 stars',
       'The game is good and i like it..  But after every fight you must connect to internet,, honestly this sucks.. Fighting game needs much comfort ability but every being online its really boring and it eventually slows which makes the game awful Please fix this up  Shadow Fight 2 is more portable and nice thought this will be better than two but for this update Shadow Fight 2 Is the best...',
       'This game made me rage. Insane difficulty is literally impossible.The loot is trash, upgrading armor and weapons is better. In the fighting system, when you get cornered, your basically screwed. I miss the mechanics in Shadow Fight 2 where you cant hit him when he fell on the ground. It a really good mechanic to give your opponent a chance. But thus game, there is no mercy at all. You still get hit when on the ground which sucks. C\'mon developers, you gotta fix this!',
       'Classical pay per win game. Once you advance (e.g. lv 4-5), winning against the computer in the main quest is only possible after several days of waiting for free cards and random levelling of the weapons via chests (gained via duels). Glitches in skills usage are also observed.',
       'Great game in terms of graphic and gameplay. The only thing that sucks are the paywall in this game. Almost impossible to pass the story mode with weak weapon that we are given. The box drop rate also terrible. The only way to level up is by completing the main story. I will uninstall this game till they fixed this system. Really bad system.' ],

     [ 'I\'m really fond of this game and love the gameplay and quick paced matches. The new update is AMAZING!   There are a few things that would make this game extra perfect for me!   Must have character customisation. This would be of big amazing to me. Char customisation makes me bind more to certain characters. The rings we get don\'t have much value to them except for upgrading the characters.  Could have non-ranked matches. I would love the option to play/practice against rivals or my own friends.   Should have quick chat responses. Would like to communicate before and after the match with simple reactions. Like Good luck and I win, tee-hee!',
       'To many ads unless you make some kind of purchase. Loading screens seem to take longer than I\'d like. You can\'t at this time play with friends as Opponents are automatically chosen. There is still some characters ability noise in the game even if you have music and sound off. I\'d like to see characters abilities not to be so similar, but it isn\'t taking away from the game at the moment for me. With all that said though the graphics are great, the game is fun, and it\'s worth the $1.99 purchase I made.',
       'This is one of the best mobile games I have played I a while. I probobly have a bias sense I love Sonic so much. However, if one thing could be added I would say it should be a converter for the Red Star rings to normal rings. Unless you want them to be payed for. I don\'t really care either way I\'ll just buy the Red Star rings but I brought up that idea because I currently have 23,000 rings just kinda waiting to be spent. Maybe incorporate phone backgrounds or some customizations for the game that cost extra rings? Thankyou so much for the new update and if anyone I\'d debating on installing it just get it. You\'ll have fun, trust me.',
       'Love the game, but there\'s something wrong.. Well... I think Cream is kinda rigged. Her items are a bit OP for the other players which makes it an easy stage into a extremely hard stage. And also, the deduction of trophies in 4th place is too much! Please make it lower (like maybe at around 5 or 8) and change the deduction of trophies in 3rd place 0 (These are all just suggestions I have). If you read this SEGA, your games are great and keep up the good work!',
       'This game is if Sonic Dash mixed with Racing. And I LOVE IT!!! One suggestion I have that I don\'t think many online multiplayer games have, add some sort of singleplayer mode. Otherwise, great game! I like that it\'s free with ads being removable via in game purchases (which I did), controls, graphics, and soundtrack are outstanding, overall, I love the game, and I look forward to more updates in the future.',
       'Please add a custom character, there is one in the main game so there should be one here to. Also please add infinite, cubot, orbot, and eggman. Also some more variety of music and areas would be good. Thank you for reading and for the great game! :)  (Edit): we need a friending system and to be able to customize our characters so that we have SOMETHING to spend rings on. And Espio needs some serious buffing because right now, he is pathetic.' ],

     [ 'This "game" is like empty calories. I ingested it ate it up and left hungry.  There is no goal whatsoever to this game. It is a glorified add campaign intended to keep you going on and on with a false feeling of accomplishment in order push ads on you or make you buy perks. Want to double your earnings for 20 seconds? Watch a 30 second ad. Want to improve earnings for four hours. Watch an ad. You get the point. Of course you can buy these perks but why do any of this? The "game" never really does anything whatsoever. No milestones, no real goals, no anything. Well after about 3 hours of game time and the equivalent of add watching time I am off to ingest something with more substance.',
       'I have seen this as an ad. I thought I should give it a try. It worked out. Before long, I reached level 15. Now I\'m on level 32 and I have 1.092 aa gold! I automated 100% of my farm!  I\'m already making lots of gold with automating potatoes. Potatoes give away so much gold! Good update.  Keep up the good work. Thanks, Idle Farming Empire. What a good replacement for Farm Away.  Idle Farming Empire is like the best simulation for farming. I gave the game 4 stars for a reason. I liked the game! Look under the review! There\'re many people rating the game 5 stars. It should really be rated 4 stars.  Over 97,800 people rated 4 and 5 stars. I like this game. Thanks for everything.',
       'AMAZING! I love this game. It is so addicting and a great way to pass time and boredom. I think though for one small improvement you could add a thing where there are like \'mini games\' and you earn coins for that. Using those coins earend in the mini games you spend it on things like watering cans, fences for live stock and more! This was only some suggestions for a bigger game if you can have or make a new game called like farm life or something like that....LOVE IT...',
       'I LOVE THIS GAMEE!! It\'s so addicting and once u get used to it, u can\'t stop playing it! It\'s a great time killer and it auto saves (not of u connected to Facebook.) Again, I love this game and I would recommend this game to EVERYONE because it\'s for all ages (unless u are a very serious person) JK LOL! :D',
       'Like so far But, 2 issues. 1- I don\'t Facebook or do any social media so needs to be a way other than ads for those bonuses. 2- daily rewards Don\'t happen. Shows that they were collected but will not activate unless I have enough diamonds. Please fix. Play offline on tablet and hotspot to get daily reward.',
       'Great and addicting game, but with one major bug. I went to collect my idle money and I watched a video too double it (46 billion total). But when I hit the button to collect it, I never got it. All the money dissapeared and I got nothing. What\'s the point of an idle game, if you don\'t get anything for being idle?' ],

     [ 'So I played it on my iPhone e and loved it. Recently o got a new phone and it\'s am android. I connected to my Nintendo account and loaded it up. My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I\'m not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr',
       'Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I\'m paying £9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn\'t make it worth the price being asked.',
       'I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',
       'This would have got 5 stars had I been able to share it with my 2 kids via family share. I refuse to pay £30 for all 3 of us to have access to all the levels.  Great game though. Fun, quick and easy to play. Many hours spent between us. So many levels too.',
       'Super Mario run is a great smartphone game it has the very addicting toad rally and remix ten and the simple, but very rewarding controls. The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars',
       'Its good fun but extra world tour levels are needed to sell the full game, both after purcgase and before. But if you delve into the crevices of each mode and extract every bit of play you\'ll find out whether it\'s worth it' ],

I hope my tears will help u guys. :)',

I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it\'s just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............',

Not to mention they keep upgrading and making it beter and better, keep it up fellas....i havent experienced any of the problems mentioned withthe updates others have but until then great game',

I am enjoying this game because the tasks are not very difficult but at the same time not very easy its a perfect game and the main character of the game is very funny he always sleeps in the vehicle.....so finally.... I like this game very much',

     [ 'This game is great, it\'s a lot of fun. Until it decides that you\'re not allowed to pass the loading screen.  Then there\'s the premium store. The pricing is pretty outrageous for a mobile game. $35 for a t5? I paid less than that for my Matilda IV on WOT. Please address this issue. So we can actually show you our patronage. You occupy our spare 15 minutes. Not hours daily. Think of where this is played and charge accordinly. That\'s all I have to say.',
       'It is very different than the computer version in terms of captain skills. You have to choose which bonus to use once the ship is fully upgraded and you have to find and save upgrade warship blueprints. I understand the need to make an income. Not particularly amused though. Other than some of the difference\'s that I have an issue with and the lack of being able to transfer  account info over from the computer version. It is a fun way to play on the go. Just wish I had access to my 30 + in warships that I have for the desktop. Not feeling the need to repurchase the same premium ships for the second time.',
       'I do like this game. The support team is good and are helpful when they can be. But the silver and points awarded are much too low in my opinion, when in comparison to the costs of modules and supplies consumed during battles. Also the supply crates could stand to be better. The ships are pretty awesome and are very well rendered. Very good graphics. Everything runs smoothly with no lag or server issues.',
       'Connection issues. Don\'t bother with playing on hotel Wi-Fi. The mcDs or the coffee shop. Forget about it on 3G. Because you need to have a full wired connection just to not hop around the map with the superb lag spikes. Spending tons of time shooting and hitting the enemy getting zero registry. In short good looking game spent hundreds of hours on the desktop version. But this doesn\'t seem keenly executed. Not connected to my desktop account? Why bother?',
       'This is a great game!!.  Yes, computers have issues, yes its short then the PC version.  This is not a PC.  This is a great 5 minute break.  I play the PC game too.  Its flipping fantastic.  The programmers at WOW are brilliant  and they care about the product.  If you love histroy, Warships, strategic games pitting you against other human players.  GET THIS YOUR GAME.  There are other warship games.  None get it more right then WOW.',
       'The games mechanics and controls need an overhaul. The secondary weapons should be automated as fast firing ships operating in touch screen controls requires immense micro management. Second, the post battle screen graphs extremely limited battle details and the UI is equally as lacking in features and navigation. Finally, the battle time is far to short and the majority of battles are ended with ships still in action on both teams. Potential to be a 5 star rating when the mechanics become as user friendly as they they are on PC.' ],

     [ 'Good fun until you figure out that you only need to build area 52 up. At level 500 it jumps by 5000000% or something stupid. Meaning can clear a planet in just hours. Needs a different hook to it. After a few planets it\'s a bit stale.  The choices to buy in multiples of needs moving. With fat fingers I\'ve caught the research aswel as hitting Max a few times',
       'It\'s a good time killer. The thing that makes me think about deleting this app is how it keeps overriding my phone. I keep turning notifications off for this app, but the game will turn them back on again. It\'s so annoying to have my phone buzz just to find out its just this stupid game telling me my scientists are done or waiting for a task.',
       'Usual game where numbers get ridiculous and good at killing time. Very good features and well balanced - so far. Like with many of these games nearer the later stages the completion time can be calculated and nobody wants to tap for 211 years to complete the next round. Hopefully this game sidesteps that.',
       'Update to previous review: Devs seem on it. After the last update there seemed to be a bug or two. A couple of us let them know and they fixed it within a week. Good game, come and go on your own time, well maintained. Thanks guys!  --------- I\'d have to agree about the slow down for the red bacteria after the update. It used to come between 1.5 and 3 mins. Now I can go 10 minutes looking at the screen before one comes. It makes the game more of a waste of time than fun. Other than that, I was really liking it. Played it more than most games.',
       'Yes it\'s a tapper buy done is a very unique way and totally worth your time. The fact that your goal is to destroy planets and that you are sending all your energy to the planet makes sense that you have to start back up. Been playing for almost 3 months and I keep checking back in to destroy planets.',
       'After the last update it became unplayable. Crashed all the time. If they fix it it will be a great game but until then avoid it. Tried again after the last update. Still unstable. Not worth the wasted time.' ],

     [ 'This game is perfect for those who played any moba style game. 2 buddies of mine play this the same we used to back in the first 2 years of league of legends. Short games, almost no existence of any real "pay to win". No heavy dedication required to get started. Great for the casual and hardcore gamer. Not for those who haven\'t even seen a moba style game before. Just needs more items to buy in game, but can\'t expect perfection from the start. Overall 4.7 from me',
       'Cool game very fun few negative though. Snowballing is way to easy one death and you basically lose lane. The controls need to be better they need a target lock mode. Its hard to keep on your target even with hero icons on. Being able to only use the jungle talent if you have a jungling item on sucks. its so hard to comeback if any bit behind as i said snowballing is to large.',
       'If you love League of Legends are definitely going to like and enjoy playing this game. One of the best games out there. You don\'t need to spend any money to be one of the best players it\'s all about skill and having a good team structure it\'s nothing about spending hundreds of dollars of real cash to get the best items because there are no best items! You do not have to pay to play this game and be the best!',
       'The connection and reconnecting sucks, I always end up idle or AFK because apparently my connection sucks but it\'s perfectly fine. Reconnecting takes forever and by the time it\'s done the game is already over and I\'m reported for AFK when it\'s not even my fault the game\'s connection sucks.   Other than that the game is fun to play and a good time consumer but they need to work on better connection. I kept on getting warnings for my AFK when the game kept on glitching and it affected my phone so I had to restart the whole thing.',
       'Game is an absolute blast.... when it works. I am constantly getting diced in lobbies right before a game starts meaning the game punishes me for something that is server side. I know my Internet connection is fine because I hopped on LoL and discord just to check my ping and it is at a stable 40 whilst this game says I\'ll have over 500. Because of this it makes it hard to enjoy because of the credibility system. If this issue gets fixed I will change my review to a 5 star because the gameplay is superb for a mobile game and a moba',
       'Played both the international version (arena of valor) and the Chinese version (honor of kings). It is the better mobile moba in the market with great control and smooth gameplay. Having DC heros in the roster is a big plus.   Downside is the lack of content compared to the Chinese version. Sure it\'s a fairly new game, but if this game wants to be as successful as honor of kings it need a lot more content to keep players engaged. More meaningful events (not the crappy one that give you 5 gold for winning matches), way better skins (seriously check out the skins in honor of kings, so much better) thats actually appealing to people. And please let people unlock arcana pages with gems instead of paying real money.' ],

     [ 'Wonderful! Game by first touch   But I can\'t wait till the hearts 💚 are filled!  So Reduce the time. Improve this game more and more and create a new exciting games.  I have finished 390 levels. And I have a doubt what is the last level and what happens after it? All the best for ur future and I\'m a biiiiiiig fans of u guys!!  Hands off',
       'This now a prize example of a freemium game that needs a premium option. I would gladly pay £10 as a one off purchase to do away with the need to say for lives. In the past games worthy of a one-off fee would offer it and this issue such game that should consider it. I will never pay for any in app purchases on any game and I am sure I am not alone. This has 5* written all over it but the long wait times and exorbitant cost of energy replenishing means this doesn\'t get anything higher than average.',
       'Loved the game but if the life was free this waiting for minutes to play again is not cool. Also noticed if you have to score more than 1 goal and you make a mistake you have to start from the same goal you already scored. If we can get the requirements before each challenge that would make it much more fun otherwise I love this game a lot keep updating for more seasons. Thank you. I am on Level 560 with 1257 stars I am awaiting Season 29. If you can also create a full football game with same concept. This is a Great game!!! Thank you developers keep developing Great games like these!!!',
       'SCORE  HERO RULES This game is so sick dudes. It so cool that this gives us idea that how to play soccer or football. Gameplay is so smooth . They players show us some epic skills . It has an commentary. The worst part was the heart. I can\'t wait till it get refilled ❤❤❤❤❤ this. Graphics are great . Just reduce the time of refilling the energy . Overall this game cool. Thanks for the game FTG.',
       'Do you know what? This game is really bad. If you\'re calling this game really good, then you must be blind. The graphics are really bad, it is really laggy and whenever someone puts in a review, you don\'t fix it. You never do any updates to impove this game also. And the fact that you have to wait for your hearts to regen is so annoying. You should remove the hearts *now*. That is why I think this game is so bad and that I rate this game 1☆.',
       'I am a football player and I watch alot of football so I know that a shot directed lowly towards the bottom far post must definitely get in. But this game won\'t let you score with that strategy. The keeper dives from one end to another. Ridiculous. And why do I have to repeat goals I have already scored? Pathetic' ],

My biggest gripe is that the "read more" section states that it comes with unlimited practice deals but this is not true and each practice game costs a "deal credit". This means you run out of free credits quickly which means the app is not really free and ongoing use will cost you the monthly subscription.' ],

       'This game is now officially garbage. Dont waste your time or money.   UPDATE: A few things have been fixed. The eggs however are a giant mess. There is little rhyme or reason to what comes out of which egg. I keep getting the same things out of golden eggs as well. Its frustrating to see someone get out of a 5k that i get out of my golden egg. The spawns are terrible. Its always the same creatures everywhere you go. The speed cap is yet to be fixed. So many players are quitting due to the champions and eggs. There is less and less people chatting on the Facebook pages. It\'s a fun game, but is so frustrating at the same time. I hope the devs fix the issues.    The game has been niantic\'d with this last update. People are upset about the changes on the fan pages. I won\'t be spending anymore cash and it seems that\'s the consensus. I\'m very disappointed that a game that was supposed to listen to the fans and be a different AR game has gone the way of pokemon go.  It was a very fun game up until today.  Update: it\'s worse than I even realized. Lures and essence and pointless now. The glitches are out of control. The speed cap came back after the "bug fix". PvP is one sided. I don\'t even bother with it now. With gen 3 coming out soon, I find it hard to believe they will retain daily players. And automated responses don\'t make people feel any better about the situation. It was a fun game for a minute.',
       'This is a terrible rip-off of pokemon go. I get that pokemon go can\'t be the only AR game out there, but at least be original about it. Aside from a couple different features, it\'s just the same, but ... worse.  In fact, I\'ll make a list of things in draconius, and their pokemon go counterpart: Essence=Stardust Evolving=Evolve Power-Up=Power Up Bestairy=Pokedex (The bestiary is a little understandable i guess) CP=CP (Real original with that one, huh?) Stones=Candy Copied fast/charge move system. Apprentice\'s Sphere=Pokeball Master\'s Sphere=Great Ball Ruler\'s Sphere=Ultra Ball Arcana Caramel=Razzberry Magical Doughnut=Pinap Berry (except it increases "essence") Unicorn\'s Marshmalow=Nanab Berry Crystal of Wisdom=Lucky Egg Pheromones=Incense (though there is the daily change concept) Lure=Lure (and works the exact same way as well) Perpetual Dragon\'s Cocoon=Incubator Dragon\'s Cocoon=Incubator (×3) Small Healing Potion=Potion Medium Healing Potion=Great Potion Great Healing Potion=Hyper Potion Potion of Complete Recovery=Max Potion Ressurecting Potion=Revive Pillar of Abundance=Pokestop Pet=Buddy And as far as I can tell, there are 2, 5, and 10K eggs just like in pokemon go.' ],

     [ 'I love this game, it\'s really fun. The only thing I wished was that when the characters level up, it actually does something more than raise their health. Like, increase stats in the place their working, or increase production. Maybe not every level, but there should be more benefits to leveling up. When bringing wastelanders back, let\'s say they are gone for an hour and you start to bring them back, when you get to ten minutes before they get home and put them back to exploration, they shouldn\'t jump back to where they started, from an hour. Idk. But I love the game.',
       'This game is so very exciting to play. As an avid fan of nearly all Bethesda games, this is a great mobile representation of their Fallout Universe. The gameplay is enticing and there is always something new around every quest; however it should be noted every quest storyline has variance, the quest gameplay is similiar between all. Comparing your dwellers from the beginning to a week into the game and there is a sense of accomplishment. The customisation of the dwellers and vault rooms is satisfying. The only thing I would add that isn\'t already presented, would be multiplayer. A way to send dwellers or explore eachothers vaults. If this option exists, and I just don\'t see it, I apologize.  Great game. Love to play.',
       'I really enjoy Fallout Shelter. As a huge Fallout fan, I had to try it when it first came out. Stopped playing for a while when I had built a huge vault, but now with the quests there is a wonderful long time motivation to it. I especially like the quiz quests where you have to prove your knowledge of the main series games, the legendary dwellers from the main games are also a very nice touch.',
       'I really enjoyed this game but upgraded phone from s5 to note 8 and can\'t get my old game save back. Tried to follow steps and load from cloud but nothing loads. Wouldn\'t really care about starting over so much if I hadn\'t spent money on the game. Hopefully developer helps me out. I can screen shot order history to verify in game purchases if need be.',
       'Huge fan of the Fallout series  and this is the perfect mobile spinoff. Same feel with the graphics and humor with an addicting play and plenty to keep you hooked.  I just wish they\'d hook you up with a Mr. Handy for free, it would really help gathering resources while not playing.  All in all a disagree may have for Fall of fans or new comers.',
       'Fallout shelter is a fun, beautiful quick game you can keep coming back to. For me fallout shelter is one of my most favorite games on mobile and keep coming back to even after over a year of playing it. They keep updating it to. There are plenty of things to collect as well as people u might know from the other fallout games. Really really fun and love the cartoony graphics as well as the easy controls. Great to kill time' ],

     [ 'This game is awesome. The girls are beautiful and the songs are nice. There are a couple of errors I be having with the game though. I would have liked if they had subtitles to the songs so we know what they are singing. Also give us a chance to earn more gems and scouting tickets.The scouting I think is also not fair. I would scout single ten times and not get anything but a rare. While my friends do single scouts and get ur and SSR. YOU won\'t get goods cards unless you pay or do the 11 scout. The pricings also could be improved',
       'Warning! This game is freakin\' addictive. Good graphic with cute characters. Recommended for anyone who loves idol genre ... Suggestion: please fix the lagging. The circle disappear sometimes during the live show. Sometimes the app even doesn\'t recognize my finger touch that makes me miss a circle. But overall. It\'s a good game  .... ALL HAIL PRINTEMPS AND GUILTY KISS',
       'I love the game definitely but with the new update, it keeps telling me that there\'s a transmission error then when it went through and finished connecting, it said that the data transfer was successful. I haven\'t transfered anything to a new device or anything like that. The only options I\'m given is to contact support and start a new game in which I definitely don\'t want to do. It isn\'t my connection because everything else on my phone that requires WiFi is fine and I can use it. Is this because of the new update?',
       'I love the game and it\'s wonderful!!  But...  I had i don\'t know like a glitch or something.  When started to play the rhythm game while I playing suddenly the icon that I should press came faster all or a sudden. But the song is still OK.  After the glitch it becames back to normal.  This happen me for 3 times on the same day. Please fix it. And Thank you.',
       'It\'s so addicting and a fabulous rhythm game. One thing I\'m really picky on is that you press the circle on the beat and this is the only game so far that has stayed true to all the notes being on the EXACT beat. Other games don\'t do that and it bothers me to no end bc I don\'t know when to press but this game is great and I love it dearly. Also cute girls.',
       'Firstly, Illegal access means you have rooted the phone. Secondly, Lovecas are supposed to be hard to collect its the game\'s premium currency so don\'t whine about why you don\'t get enough Lovecas cause that\'s what noob players do only. Thirdly, SRs and URs is also supposed to be hard to get too, because there wouldn\'t be any fun without them.' ],

       'Some of the troops are simply overwhelming, e.g. Dragon, while some spells make the troops overwhelming, e.g. Protection on Black Night, Giant Growth on Black Night / Dragon, which generally make no chance of countering (countering is an element for good strategy game). A few suggestions to balance the cards’ power and have good strategy game:   1. Giant Growth: reduce the power-up to 30%, or add time limit to the spell, or disallow the spell to cards with mana 7 and above (unfortunately Unchained Demon with only 3 mana will be spared from this).  2. Dragon: reduce the speed to 2, or reduce the power / health / attack range.   3. Protection: disallow the spell to cards with mana 7 and above, or add time limit to the spell.   4. Vempire: reduce the attack / health / speed, increase health loss %.',
       'I like it ALOT, but unless you can get lucky with good cards as a new player it wont be fun for a while. There is alot of umbalance between newer cards and stock cards, you can get screwed unless you\'re absolitely professional with default cards',
       'Game is nice,but has some problems. 1.very hard to earn gems(easy to spend) 2.need real money purchases to go for higher trophies  3.long time needed to open chests 4.I hate that piggy bank thing If you overcome these problems game would be nice.but good job😀',

It prompts me to update the game and directs me here but the update button is not available even after I cleared my cache.   Edit: I was able to update after restarting my phone 3 times.',
       'Was a fun game, with a several minor issues. ... Found out issues with logging in were due to an update. Now that the  update loaded, the lag and screen load issues are worse. It took me over an hour to do 12 pvp battles.',
       'Nice game, a little laggy but a lot of fun. The gameplay is fun but at some point becomes repetative. Unlocking everything will keep you busy for a long time. Progress is on a steep curve, especially upgrading your town. Still very well designed and a seriously cool concept, no softlocks like energy or stamina and the advertisement is very well done. Not invasive or annoying. Unlike all the clone games this one is a gem.',
       'Excellent system, graphics, story, etc. I didn\'t even mind the slight server lag when performing actions. But since the \'patch/maintenance\' yesterday I can\'t play it. Repeated attempts to update failed resulting in having to uninstall and reinstall the game. Now it won\'t go past the \'Thinking\' screen. Almost 2 hours waiting for the game to boot up and I still can\'t play it. Pleeeaaase fix this. I just want to play it again.',
       'It\'s a good management sim. The story writing is a bit sexist at times, the systems aren\'t explained very well. It has a good base game, and hopefully improves overtime.',
       'Is a good game, but sometimes the game stucks or freeze for a few seconds I don\'t know if it because of my Internet connection phone preformance or if is just the game Edit 1: I think is probably the "server lag" the problem of the game' ],

And if the game is worth it I spend money on it.',

     [ 'I know the update on The Book of Dragons came out a long time ago, but I still can\'t make sense of it. The old book of Dragons was a lot easier to understand. If you filtered it to show only searchable dragons, then it would show in order what you unlock. I\'m not sure, but from what I understand is that the dragons are now arranged in time to search. That\'s neat and all, but could you please come out with a filter for dragon unlocsks by Lvl?  Dragons unlocked at a later Lvl is usually better. With the current filter, you can find a dragon which collect 14 mill wood/hour with dragons collecting 1.05 mill wood because it is arranged by time to search. Again, please release a filter option by Lvl unlocked? Thanks for your help!',
       'I really prefer  the old version of  this game like how you\'d have a dragon and you\'d guard a wagon and collect gold and fish and some time a new egg. And if a dragon attacked you\'d battle it and have to tilt your tablet to fly aim you fire blasts.could you add a dragon racing minigame',
       'Game is a good time killer, but getting anywhere in the Jerk at Work is almost impossible. 3 waves of enemies above my level and the only way I can even the odds is if I pay for sage fruit. That is far too stupid and dumb. Thanks for being impossible to beat. UGH',
       'The new update is really great!  But there\'s one glitch when unlocking the legendary dragons. The part in collecting resources for 15 days. It stopped counting the hours since I updated. (It was already 9 days and counting...)   Please fix this.',
       'Slow loading and sometimes does not even load the villege. I already tried clearing cache and it started to re download(tried freeing up space - didn\'t work). Very frustrating and suck. But this is a good game. Please fix and update the game.',
       'The new update is nice, except for the iron storage downgrade. Why the hell would you downgrade from 45k to 10k??? Rest of iron in mail, all 30000 of it!!! Why, thank you , it\'s good to know that I will be able to keep 5000 iron AND LOSE 25K WHEN I CLAIM THE PACK IN MY MAIL. Now I have to keep the mail iron and collect more over days on end to make the next iron storage upgrade.... seriously??? At least divide the iron into packs of say 3k each so that it\'s usable. The fact that the iron storage was downgraded is bad enough, but 30k iron in email when storage is reduced to 10k sucks!!!!  Update: claimed the extra iron. It ended up split into packs of 5000 iron in mail. Little happier now' ],

So maybe admin you could take a look at it for us please as I would totally love to keep playing this game as its a great game to play especially when your winning down after such along day.. Thanks',
       'Got too allgegro madness. And got stuck with the no face cards. 14 cards is alot to get. In fairway blast the card suits stick until a new none face card comes up, or reshuffles them. I find with this game they dont stick when the next card is turned over. So your run ends. And the run cards you ave accumulated as returned back to one agan.',
       'It\'s a fun game!! can keep you very entertained only thing that sucks is if you have it on PC or iOS there are way more features and it\'s way better than the Android version!!😢 So the side note is for the developers at Big Fish Games....... So I think we\'ve all waited way too long it\'s time to step it up and come out with a greater Android version at least make it as good as the iOS version!!!!!?????',
       'People will tell you that it\'s good for your brain or that it\'s fun, but that really isn\'t true, especially since it won\'t even allow you to turn off hints. Immediately after you make a move, you can\'t even think for yourself and try it alone. It\'s annoying. Don\'t get it. Go to a different solitary game.',
       'I love solitaire games, but this game is impossible. The first rounds will be easy, and then you\'re hit with ridiculous difficulty and straight up unwinnable games, that is, unless you spend money to get power ups that shouldn\'t even be necessary. 100% pay to win game. Which I find very sketchy. I\'ll never download anything from these developers ever again.',
       'PLEASE change where the 5 extra card for 2000 bucks is! I love this game but when you\'re short on money and you accidentally press it.... aaaaarggh. I\'m pretty sure others don\'t like where it is either. Could be a perfect game. And I spend hours a day on it as I\'m bedbound. Please...' ],

     [ 'I\'m having 2 problems with the game. 1: whenever my bunnies have rolls to give me, and I tap to get them, I don\'t actually receive them. They vanish. 2: When im visiting someone else\'s board, the game crashes and I lose everything I got into that board such as money, conquered buildings and gems.  It\'s driving me crazy. Also, I would like for the rolls to recharge every 30 minutes, 1 hour is too much time. I love this game, so addictive.',
       'I really love this game and wanted to give it 5 stars but there just isn\'t enough play time. 4 rolls per hour just isn\'t enough, they should build up a bit faster since gameplay is so fast-paced. There would still be plenty of room to make money as even I would buy more rolls if it were worth it but with the way it is now I wouldn\'t want to spend money just to be able to play maybe 5 minutes at a time. Other than that, great game!',

     [ 'This game has so much potential to be an awesome game except for one factor, you require way yo much real money to move ahead. This truly is a pay to win, change that and the amount of people downloading this game will remain playing imo.',
       'Its an alright game and i advise people to play but would be better if people who walk by your clubhouse could be mugged to get more money and maybe sneak attacks would be good so you might be able to take some money without anybody knowing and when people are bringing cigarettes to california you could intercept the vans. Overall great game',
       'Didn\'t like it at first but if you can afford to buy coins a lot more fun. Seals matchups for New York are complete b.s. though',
       'Great game. Cost alot.  Definitely more fun when you have alot of coins.   But bikers do cost way to much. There needs to be an adjustment there.',
       'Really like the game and could be a great game. I would rate higher but there are a few issues. First issue I see is it shouldn\'t cost so much to train more bikers. When you take over territory most of, if not all, the money you gain has to be spent on replacing the bikers you lost. The reward should be higher or the cost of training more bikers should be lower. The other issue I see is the goals section. A lot of them have too many requirements to reach the goals. Make the goals simpler. Also they are not set up in a way to help you progress in the game, they are pretty much random or the goal can not be reached until you are much further in the game. For instance, one goal is to get some properties to level 5. Once you complete that the goal jumps to make properties level 30. That\'s a huge jump and somewhat disheartening. It\'s kinda ridiculous to jump from lvl 5 to lvl 30. It takes way too long to go from 5 to 30 and will prolly make a lot of ppl stop/not want to play the game. Improve the goals section and make the rewards better and it will help make the game more successful.',
       'Too many pop up adds.  It\'s a money grab if ya want to go anywhere in the game.  Deleted app' ],

    description: 'Terminator Genisys: Future War is a free-to-play mobile strategy game where the human Resistance is locked in a never-ending war with the machine army. Genisys is destroyed and Skynet is offline, but the future war is far from over. Engage in large-scale strategic warfare and rejoin the struggle between machine and man. Build your base, attack your enemies and pave the way to victory for your clan in tactical multiplayer.Plarium, developer of the hit titles Vikings: War of Clans and Throne: Kingdom at War, has created a deep strategy MMO in the Terminator universe. Set directly after the events of the film, Terminator Genisys: Future War offers players a chance to reset the future with addictive gameplay, constant action, and massive clan warfare.With two different playable factions, you can choose to take the role of a Resistance Commander or the leader of Skynet’s Core, and either save the last of humanity or crush it under your cybernetic heel.John Connor is MIA, and the Resistance is broken.

     [ 'I like it, but I just hate when players keep on attacking weaker players or attack my base when I\'m not with energy dome, I feel like this game is more of a competitive game than any other multiplayer games. I know its natural for players to attack other players. Its just that I don\'t want to constantly buy more domes than I needed because of my fear of loosing all the resources and troops Im building up. Its like I can\'t have one day without a player raiding my base and I have to get resources again. Overhaul good game, just needs some sort of protection, cooldown or limit to how many times you can attack a base.',
       'I m playing this game for long time and i liked this game but now this game asking too much .So many back to back events .I think the game maker must know that all playing this game have a real life to deal with.Reduce back to back events.I m sure if u guys dont do it most players will quit and this game will be longer played.',
       'Its a very good game a lot of fun I feel like there could be more action involved though.  Ot just seem like mostly construction and upgrading and ranking up but I\'ve still a while to go so I guess we will see as the game goes on and I play longer',
       'Turning into a farming game.A few glitches,such as players attacking and immediately being able to raise shields.A player should be vunerable to counterattack while attacking as in other games.Recovery time between dimension events needs to be 48 hrs instead of 24.Players also need to be more or less perma-shielded,garanteeing income to the developers;you will normally have your base resources and troop levels zeroed in a couple of hits by higher level players.Also...some upgrades take far too long unless you pay...54 weeks for core upgrades above lvl20??!  Give it a rest...Score reduced from 5 to 3 overall;also ui is a little sticky.',

    description: 'Eternium is an amazingly fun and beautifully crafted Action RPG, reminiscent of the great classics.Eternium stands out from other mobile Action RPGs by its effortless “tap to move” and innovative “swipe to cast” controls, and its player-friendly “no paywalls, never pay to win” philosophy.With the exception of a couple of online-only features, the game can also be played offline after the content download completes.Drawing signs to cast spells is easy and rewarding. The tap-to-move control is more natural and relaxing than thumbsticks, and it’s also truer to the vintage point-and-click Action RPG experience.The game can be really played for free, as more than 90% of our players do. Purchases are completely optional. Gems, the game’s main currency, can be collected from enemies and quests. There is no limiting stamina or energy. The best things in the game are obtained by playing, not paying.Eternium has been launched in 2014, and is actively being improved by the original development team. Through years of polishing, and feedback from millions of players, the quality of the game has steadily increased, making it now one of the highest rated games on all app stores.As of fall 2017, major new features are in advanced stages of development, including real-time multiplayer, town portal, and a fourth world.Enjoy the visceral satisfaction of responsive, fast-paced combat, with spectacular special effects, pleasing sounds, rewarding damage numbers, all set against immersive backdrops and atmospheric, inspiring music scores.Play as a Mage, Warrior or Bounty Hunter, wielding a sword, axe, staff or gun. Level up to learn new abilities and increase your attributes.Battle skeletons, zombies, automatons, aliens, demons, dragons and many other creatures, across three beautifully hand-crafted worlds, or in endless generated levels.Venture into dark caves and dungeons, explore forests, villages and graveyards, lay siege to demon controlled castles, brave snowy mountain peaks, travel to the moon to slay strange creatures among craters and canyons, and beyond, to the deserts, pyramids and jungles of the red planet.Open treasure chests to loot gold, gemstones and battle gear. Equip shiny breastplates, menacing helmets and hoods, spiked shoulder pads, mysterious cloaks or capes. Protect yourself with a shield, or choose to wield two weapons as a warrior.Rescue your tank, healer and ranger companions who will join you in battle. Use their abilities together with yours to create rewarding and powerful tactical combos.Experience a refreshing storyline, filled with interplanetary intrigue and seasoned with funny characters. Hunt your arch-enemy, Ragadam, across the worlds, while trying to uncover and undo his twisted plans.Progress from common to rare, epic and legendary gear. Find gemstones that fit in your armor’s sockets. Craft socketed rings and amulets, and fuse three of them into a higher quality one.Unleash awesome offensive abilities, such as Whirlwind, Shockwave, Arc Lightning or Blizzard, control the enemy crowd with Frost Nova, Vortex, Silence, or sneak and assassinate with Smokescreen, Traps and Snipe.Each hero class has access to about 20 abilities (skills or spells), and each of your three companions has four more. The game starts simple, but culminates in a flurry of tactical possibilities at high levels.Once your hero reaches level 70, your experience points go into Champion Levels, which are unlimited and yield steady stat upgrades. Champion Levels are also inherited by your new heroes, so they will have an easier time growing up.Aside from the three story acts, an endless progression of beautiful, randomly generated levels awaits in the Trials of Valor game mode.Eternium is crafted with passion by a small band of old-school RPG fans, who love making the game they always wanted to play.',

     [ 'What a great game this really is, there isn\'t many RPG\'s you\'ll find like this on the Play Store. I recall playing this 3 years ago and a lot has changed, but still a vital element is missing; multiplayer. I see within the game description that it was promised for 2017 but after downloading and playing I can\'t see any multiplayer feature. Apart from that, it\'s a really well polished game and seems to offer a lot of content and replayability and I really do hope they bring us multiplayer. I also purchased a limited time offer for £0.89 and it offered a lot that\'s for sure!   Runs well on max settings on my Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra on Android 7.0',
       'The gameplay is the best ive seen for an android RPG Diablo type game. Slick graphics, awesome sound track and effects, no slowdown and you can play offline!! Absolutely love the game. Only down side is the worry of repetitivness of the game but i guess only time will tell',
       'Incredible game. Very intuitive and unique with the swipe to cast system. The graphics are quite nice and the amount of memory the game uses is very acceptable for the quality you get. Music is very relaxing and well done. Level and NPC design are great, really feel like I\'m playing an old school medieval RPG. Absolutely 0 need to buy gems, the game gives them to you for just killing normal monsters. My only gripe would be to maybe add a fourth class? If not more in future updates. Otherwise, fantastic game, well put together, well written story, great opening scene and whoever did that voice over should be looking to do more! Thank you for making a true RPG for true RPG fans, keep it up!',
       'I love this game. It could use some improvement, but there is nothing in the current  version that would warrant less than 5 stars... particularly for an android game. If you loved Diablo; then you will definitely want to play this. And, BTW, you really don\'t need to spend money to play or win this game. But it will help you ALOT if you spend $20. Just wait for one of the special offers that come up. Otherwise, just conserve your gems and DO click the ?-Cubes. It is worth a 30 second add to get 5 gems. And I easily collect around 100 gems per day of play clicking those. Also, DO NOT, waste gems on the large golden treasure chests. You have to pay gems, a lot of gems, to get the treasure and none of them are worth the grossly exorbitant gem fee.',
       'The game is addictive. I was hoping to play it offline all the time but you need and internet connection to upgrade skills and craft its annoying because I don\'t have wifi and I use mobile data. Still it gives me the feels of Diablo all over again.',
       'Really nice graphics for a phone. Smooth frame rate with lighting, nice textures and pretty spell animation. The drawing symbols for spell casting is a really innovative feature, but the auto-attack dumbs it down a bit. Normal difficulty is a little too easy. Nice crafting system, and spell leveling.' ],

Try to say how the app is messing up and they make it look like it\'s your fault and don\'t do anything about it. So play this game at your own risk. That\'s the answer to everything is email when clearly you can see foreign language chat rooms get everything handed to them while english chat rooms lose more than they ever win.',
       '1St, there are entirely way too many bot\'s in one game, so it makes it really hard for the real people to win, so you need to get rid of them. 2nd you need to lower the waiting time for the bonuses, 5 and 11 hrs is way too long for the little bit of chips y\'all give, you should have something  in-between to win chips, while waiting like all other games do, yiu guys need to give out more chips, since to play your games cost so many.. Y\'all are way to greedy with them. 3rd quite cheating us out of our chips when we win, and then blaming us for it, it\'s not our internet, you guys owe me around 1000 chips and 60 greens',
       'I love the variety of games and unique tournaments as well as being given missions in other rooms to gain more 💰. I don\'t like their fan page where they don\'t give away extras to help you out with the gameplay  But if you enjoy stop in give all the rooms a try before giving your true opinion.',

     [ 'I think SA should do a better job than what they are doing. Including me we all be screwed not once not twice but at least five times each player that did not mod and/or hack. You change the damages on skills that should be left alone and over half my friends is in Hacker Hell so my question to u guys fix this and give us some gifts cuz we\'ve been faithful for giving you guys money and it be nice to receive some compensation.',
       'If you\'re looking for a great game, this is not it!!! It\'s a pay to win, with NOTHING to win. Unless you\'re into running in circles chasing woodland animals for months, having your money stolen, or having your stats lowered by the devs after you\'ve worked on it... I suggest finding a different game. Really look at all these reviews if you don\'t believe me.',
       'Well, the graphics are amazing! There are nice views in the game and the animals look cool aswell. There are a few things I would like SA to add and the first one is: mates and cubs. Second is: add friends. Third is: you can eat your own prey and drink water. The Last one is: to make your own separate packs (atleast 5 wolves in each.) That\'s all! If you do any of these I will rate 5 stars! Other than that this is an amazing game. I like the way you can choose your wolf. Recommended for sure!!!!',
       'ok the game is great and I love it but why can\'t you play with lower levels and higher levels? It\'s not fair when you have a friend you want to play with and help them with their levels but you can\'t if you are to high of a level it\'s really not fair and I think you should remove this part of the game everything else is amazing though! I really love this game but I also don\'t want to have to level up or wait for someone to level to play with my friends so please fix this!!',
       'This game is very nice! But I would suggest adding a single player, so that you can find your mate, make pups and bring them with you on multi player! Also add more wolf colors and designs! You could also make different landscapes if you want and if you can, you shouls also add bosses and dens for us to live at, this game is very nice and addictive, but I think that if you add all that I mentioned it would become even more popular and addictive! Please hear my plea!',
       'This game is amazing the best game I love it so much. But I wish the game look like loading screen and plz plz plz make them the wolf better like the white wolf should be fast and stronger where as the the grey wolf should be strong and have more health and the Mexican wolf should be good in defences and health and black wolf should be good in strength and health and speed and there should be multiple maps and are there holiday skins. And it will be nice If you can add friend plz add some different skin for the white wolf. Like the mighty wolf should be in the white wolf category. Edit- I would love it if you .ca  make it night with different animals. And one more thing the creates of this game can you plz plz plz plz make a Dragon game like this cause there are not a lot of nice dragon game out there. Like the white wolf have an ice dragon and plz make a lightning Dragon it is my favourite element.  If you can do all of this I would be so happy .' ],

     [ 'Invite Code: zYATah  This is the very first Otome Game (w/ VA\'s) that I have in Android (Amnesia: Memories requires payment so yeah) The graphics was quite nah for me maybe because it didn\'t fill the screen of my phone. Maybe because my device is a huge one so that\'s why. The story is quite interesting. The characters have each and different unique personalities that I loved. I hope many Otome lovers will get to see this game. A very rare catch in deed!!',
       'I absolutely loved this game. I put in a good month of work on it. I needed to purchase platinum to move on in the story, but I chose to do the free offers. After signing for one of them, and putting money into it, I never received my Platinum. I sent an e-mail to customer support asking about it, they asked for proof and I sent them a screenshot of the proof and they never replied. After 4 days still nothing. I cannot move forward or do anything, and it\'s bull. As much as I loved the game I just uninstalled.',
       'The story for each character is amazing, but the amount if money you put into this game is just ridiculous. Just to complete one story you spend about $100. Full video games or even novels don\'t cost that much. And seeing as there are multiple character storylines you cam put well over  $500 just into this game. And it\'s REQUIRED. There are certain items that are needed just to progress in the story. I really wish you could just buy a full storyline and let it be it. Rather then spending $50 then, $30 more, then another $30- $50...jusy for one storyline.',
       'I LOVE THE GAME! Though I just started the game....I was speechless! The graphics are just amazing. Not to mention the VA as well! ^-^ I cant wait till the other 3 guys to come out. Amazing game. This is newly released, is it not? For the people who are reading the reviews, try it!  P - Please try it! L - Lovely game! X - Xtra hotness added! K - Kiss your famgirl side ^-^ 4 - 4 the new guys! B - Be the absolute best!',
       'It\'s pretty awesome and amazing for a cute story about these cute guys, I like it so much that it\'s a shame that the costs of reward points is 300 and the gold 3000. It\'d be better if at least it could also give more presents during the day. But I have to wait to 4:00 am to get the tickets and presents. Whenever it\'s possible to update it I think at least the hours of getting the tickets back should be changed and DIFFERENT presents everyday at least. But the rest is awesome, and I\'d be spending all day playing with this app, please upgrade it somehow ;-;❤❤',
       'I love it!!! So amazing. I\'m addicted. Their voices are so hot, and they\'re so pretty. Also I love the storyline. I can\'t wait for other characters to come. My fav char is Toma. Right now I\'m on Chiaki he so amazing! Also if anyone wants to recieve variety of gifts input my code: jFrXHS.  P.S to input the code go to my page and scroll all the way down and you\'ll find it.' ],

     [ 'Saw in Facebook and thought I would give it a try. I am now addicted. I love how realistic they make the interaction seem. The only things that would make it better is if it would let us type our own responses and the system understood them and was able to respond and if there was actually more "proving innocence" and less tetrisy type games.. But that doesn\'t not effect my interest at all. Most addictive and fun game I have found. Will def recommend',
       'UPDATE : Changed from 5 stars to 3 because of the puzzles. As you get further into the game, it is obvious that you are supposed to spend money because you are literally not given enough of the right color blocks to complete the puzzles without purchased hacks. That really sucks. Too bad.    This is an interesting game with some unique interfaces and an engrossing plot. You interact with the other characters (in-game AI) via chat, and telephone (in-game AI) to learn the plot and your place in it. In order to access the info you need to move forward, you have to solve puzzles. Very cool, love it.',
       'It is great, nice and interesting story that makes me keep playing. What really bothers me is the fact that the puzzle takes FOREVER to solve. I know that the farther you are in a game the harder it gets, but it\'s just not logic to collect 25 pieces of each color at a puzzle and they only throw you 15-20 pieces and in such little amount of moves. The only way to solve it is spending money buying hacks or having too much patience. I would have deleted it long time ago if it wasn\'t for the story.',
       'This game is great. It\'s my favorite game of all thus far. I love this game. It\'s so addicting and the story line is perfect. I love how you can text and also receive/make calls. Great game for people who like puzzles and mystery. Passes the time quickly. Only thing I am having problems with is trying to link it to my facebook. The first time I had this game I had gotten pretty far and logged in with ease, long story short, got a new phone, installed my game, try to connect to my facebook for my saved game and.... my phone glitches and shuts me out. So I had to start over. Other than that this game is great I would recommend to anyone.',
       'I like the idea but the responses are off quite often. For example: "Please don\'t hang up!" -I\'m here "I don\'t know! Not a clue. Doesn\'t make sense and breaks the immersion.   It\'s another game similar to SIM - Sara is Missing, which I\'d recommend for now. It\'s more polished and engaging. The characters are more distinct than in I Am Innocent.  This just seems to be designed to make you spend cash eventually, not because someone actually enjoyed developing it.',
       'It\'s honestly pretty good. It\'s rare that an app game keeps my attention for more than a week, but this one has kept me going for a while now. The story is interesting enough for me to keep going with the puzzles, however, I would like a little more writing and editing to be done with the dialogue. It can be kinda regular and break immersion. But it\'s still entertaining.' ],

You can not rotate the map around to see the diffrent angles and it causes me to have a difficult time placeing things sometimes. I would love to see a rotation button added to the game.',
       'This game is great . All the features are excellent. Laboratory, patio , VIP ward every things is superb. But here is one problem that whenever I but something , it becomes more expensive than the last one . I want to expand my hospital , but it is too expensive. The cost should not be more than 1000 rupees. Please it is a request. And if it is not possible , than its OK . I will manage. And a big thank youuuuuuu for creating this game. THIS IS REALLY THE HEALTHIEST GAME IN THE WORLD. THANK YOUUUUUUU CHERRY PICK GAMES. THANK YOUUUUUUU.',
       'Love it. But I do have a suggestion. I think the game should have wereifur in need of something u should be able to ask nother player if they have a item u need and if they would sell it to u.bc searching tho the ads and waiting for what I need to come up takes to long... I always need shovels but can never get any so it would be great if I was able to ask a player if they had any they would be willing to get rid of for a price....and it dose take to long to get to the next level... Like way to long I been on level 33 for 4 months now n I play alot..ever day a good many hours and I do alot on here and it seems I never can get up to another level Other then that is great. I love ethe game...',
       'Why is getting the shovel getting harder and harder? This way it would be difficult to play the game at all. I tried finding it in stores and cant find any. I tried going and helping in the gardens of others yet i dont get shovels. Please change it back to the way it was instead where we could easily get the shovel making the game slightly easier.',
       'Got to Level 28 then it stopped fully loading. Have tried everything makers suggested in troubleshooting  nothing. Has bren like this for 2 months. Have had to find other games now used to love it give up on it now.  Spent real money on it too while playing big mistake! Would not recommend!! I have a Samsung Galaxy 7 phone and this is the only game Ive had problems with.',
       'It\'s a good game but can the developers please fix the bug where the daily quests help bubble won\'t leave the screen even when you tap on the daily quests?? Really hard to accept any gifts when the whole bottom of the screen if filled up and you literally can\'t do anything.' ],

     [ 'Great game for aviation enthusiasts who want to build their own airline empire. Probably the closest to the real thing in terms of how much you can really cram into a mobile game. Easy to get started, there\'s tycoon mode for more fast paced game play, not a constantly involved lots of attention needed game. All around very entertaining and solid game. Looking forward to more updates.',
       'Meh. Prepare it all on monday morning, and then let it run itself until next monday. To me there\'s like barely anything to come back to later in the day. You don\'t really have any objective in the game, you just send away the planes and look at them fly, until the routes and planes eventually freezes and you\'ll have to restart the whole app for it to work again.',
       'The game is good in general but there is no option as far as I can see to disable notifications. Even disabling notifications through the settings doesn\'t stop the airplane beep from sounding. Poor menu layout and lack of options in the settings',
       'Really good game, I love the fact that it puts my managerial skills at work and helps improve them in one way or another, the fact that you have so many different planes to choose from is amazing, graphics really good, perhaps a bit of work on the slots, maybe put as a prize to get am coins as well. Overall, wonderful game and captivating! Ps: when are we going to see new planes in the game such as the A350-1000 or 787-10 or the A380 neo? A lot of planes have been launched in the past months but none of them are in the game!',
       'I got the latest update,but how do you veiw your profile i have been searching for profile on the game and i cannot find it',

I\'m not gaining any gems',

You can\'t do anything without huge amounts of gems. I bought some and bought one thing and they were basically gone. I had to use 2 powerups to pass the level (and that was only 1 level). What a waste.',

     [ 'The game is great! Love the handling and graophics... But I would suggest making the drift angle wider. So instead of hitting 90° and then the counter says "combo broken" it could be something like 100°! Cause I mean... Reverse entries are awesome! And you should make the hoonicorn Mustang 4wd instead of rwd in the drift setup!!',
       'LOVE THIS GAME BUT IT NEEDS 2 MORE THINGS TO BE MY FAVORITE GAME.  Make a motorcyle update where us players can drift motorcycles. And also make more customization options where we can add body kits exhausts spoilers coilover axle extensions and more. Thank you and please look into doing what i asked so us players can enjoy this game that has a bunch of potential. Thanks',
       'One thing: (two things actually)  Please make the drift school car available to buy with at least in-game cash maybe for a limited time? And please add a feature that gives you the ability to save replays, that would be really cool.',
       'Love the game! But since the update I\'m unable to purchase cars/cash. Every time I open the game it says I need to connect to the internet to make purchases even though I\'m connected and can still play multiplayer etc. Any help would be great',
       'New update sucked. The game is really good but its really laggy now, like i get lag spikes every second when i play in a track. Please fix this cuz i really want to play this game. I wont blame my phone on this one because in the last update, it ran smoothly, no lag. Plus my phone is an ASUS, a gaming phone, there shouldnt be lag in games like these. Please, please, please fix it and I\'ll put the ratings back to 5 stars☺️☺️',

     [ 'This game is so much fun. Enjoyable, challenging and addicting. However the only problem with the game is the fact that in order to play the levels, you have to collect enough tokens to unlock them. Now this is fine, if there is something else to do in the game. But there isn\'t. You have to wait real time in order to play anything of the game. And there is no option to watch a video to gain 10 tokens. It straight up only allows you to buy tokens with actual currency. Micro transactions can be used as long as there is a way to play the game without them. But apart from that minor flaw. I cannot recommend the game enough as it\'s a challenging blast. Just a shame about the tokens.',
       'Brilliant game and the only one I have found that doesn\'t auto fill the \'x\' as you play. Perfect. However, as you progress the chance to get tokens reduces as the cost of each level goes up which means it takes days to get enough from daily bonus to play one level.  Pay wall doesn\'t pay out so waste of time. Very disappointing.',
       'This game was great untill it became unplayable. Every level or square on the puzzle needs to be unlocked with tokens. As you go through the game all levels start costing more and more tokens. At the start around 4 tokens per lv now after 234 puzzles 16 tokens. That is total b.s. so at best I can play a single game a day. So only play if your not planning on finishing or playing them a lot of money.',
       'Dealing with their customer service can be a nightmare, and if they disagree with something, they just ignore you and stop answering your emails. It\'s horrible customer service and incredibly frustrating. I like the game, but will be deleting it because they don\'t award the tokens you earn.',
       'I\'ve really enjoyed the game. But it is frustrating to not be able to unlock some of the levels. I think you should be able to buy tokens with extra coins. Can you add this feature? If so I would give it 5 stars.',
       'Not a bad game. Would be better if there was not a "paywall". After getting about 1/2 way through all puzzles, it becomes almost impossible to even open a new section. You only get 10 tokens through time and the cheapest sections cost 11 or 12. Not only that, going back through previously completed sections say they reward you with tokens and a solid 90% of the time i get gold back. While I like the game and gameplay, sadly I will be unable to complete it since it really is not worth dropping money on it. I did try some paywall offers and they did not work like most games I have tried them on.' ],

My only complaints are that I wish you would earn boosters when you matched 4 in a row or in a square or something other than 5 in a row. Also, it would be nice to be able to use the boosters together. As of right now, it only happens if they happen to set the other off if it happens to be right by it.',

I feel there should be more ways to get the emeralds one needs to play the games, other than having to use cash every time one needs energy. Makes me not want to play. It\'s not a free game if you force one to spend money to play. Just saying...',

It isn\'t winnable.  You have to buy it if you want to complete over a dozen collections.   The cost of 1 is crazy for 49 emeralds EACH.   It makes me frustrated and angry for this. The game is addictive and challenging.  You upgrade each group of games that gradually get more difficult.  It\'s fun.  The collection pieces and the resources you win are quite often the same ones, and not the ones you need  They came up with daily challenges that you win half the time.' ],

I don\'t like having to switch keyboards to use the emojis and they don\'t send little regular sized disney emojis, but big pictures, which isn\'t what I want. I also don\'t like how Mickey is the only one with more variety than the others. As for the game itself, I wish it were more than a simple match game and had levels to work through that were themed for each character, kind of a disney version of candy crush. Instead, it\'s the same board design with random emojis every single time.  My biggest issue with the game, and why I rated it 1 star, is because I hate hate hate getting multiples of the same emoji! I don\'t want to spend the coins or diamonds to get 19 versions of the same one-it\'s ridiculous. And the "lucky" gold boxes are pointless because I still don\'t get the ones that are supposed to be lucky that day. I think they should have random boxes or be able to pay for a specific emoji you want, because I honestly don\'t want all of them. And I don\'t want to keep trying to get a dozen of a single item that I\'ve gotten from previous item cards. All of the multiples are annoying-it seems like it lacks creativity and is just trying to get you to spend more.',

     [ 'I DONT LIKE THE UPDATE THAT GIVES YOU MORE TIME AFTER FORCE OF CARDS . IT ALLOWS PEOPLE WAYY!!!!! TO MUCH TIME TO COMPLETE THE BOARD. AND IT WAS MORE COMPETETIVE B4. I DONT WANT MY RANKING TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF LUCK.  +Ima a REAL RISK FAN. I have purchased everymap package available. Its fair priced and affordable.The new maps are too easy in my opinion. MAKE MORE MAPS I\'LL PAY idc jus MAKE them MORE Challenging',
       'This game is great but it could be so much better.   1. The expert AI is too easy to beat. Risk players normally gang up on an opponent, if they are dominating. There should be a legendary option.  2. It would be nice to have a match summary and timeline at the end of a game.    3. There should be an auto-save game feature when playing against the AI, in case the game drops out.  Edit: They seem to have addressed my third point.',
       'Very unfair, questionable dice rolls against computers, obviously rigged so that on single player you can never win, and then online it pits you against people who are expert when you\'re a beginner so you can clearly never win. Very rigged, fun when you get the chance to play which is once every 12 hours due to them asking you to buy the premium version. Highly unfair',
       'This is a very frustrating game. Every single time I play my turn (in a multi-player game that is) I get disconnected! .. and I\'ve to replay it again .. only to get disconnected again! and so on and so on till my time runs out. Sometimes in the middle of all this \'replaying\' I even lose my troops to other players .. VERY FRUSTRATING! And No .. I\'ve both a very good data and wifi connections.',
       'Was fine for a couple weeks.... Then it started freezing up in the middle of my games.... All of them. I\'m using a LG V30+ with 128g ram so it\'s definitely not a lack of storage issue.   I wouldn\'t recommend this app to anyone who likes uninterrupted gameplay.',
       'I joined to get the one free game per day. Be aware, that if you do not subscribe (like me), the dice are loaded...  I actually had an army of 9 or 10 roll over against an army of 1 on quite a few occasions... statistically highly improbable.' ],

     [ 'Two big parts of what I love about this game are its inclusivity in terms of skin tone and gender representation.   There are four different skin tones available to everybody in every situation. While there are many more variations in reality, it\'s refreshing to have more options than one.   Some items have gendered words in the their titles, but that doesn\'t restrict their usage at all. It\'s possible to mix and match anything and everything, regardless of each item\'s implied target gender.   I\'m not sure if these positive aspects were intended or not, but they make me feel included, which is more than I can say for most games.',
       'No trade system, Why!?! Plus the reply on boards doesn\'t notify the person you\'re replying to; you may want fix that eventually. But that aside this game is great it\'s very inclusive of plenty of different styles. They are lacking a bit on male items but they\'ve gotten better over the years! It\'s hard to get a high rank unless you slave over the game but you don\'t really need the events to get good items.',
       'This game is cute, but be prepared there will be a lot of things that require in app purchases. I myself am a free player and its just pain. Some of the events are fun, really wish that there was more. We should be able to earn coins, like short videos for a certain amount of coins daily.',
       'WHAT THE HELL?! Why the hell don\'t I never get last day bonus- you know, when you\'re supposed to get 5 premium gacha tickets? I swear to god this game sucks more each time I see it.',
       'Fun app but I wish there was more interaction with other members. Also, there is a bug that doesn\'t allow the last 48 ticket to load and skips right to day one. It\'s a bad bug, so please fix it. I log in daily and still don\'t get my items',
       'Played for years and saw how much more unfair it is becoming, little by little.  If you\'re a free player, accept the fact you\'re probably not getting anything you want and definitely won\'t be at the top and maybe you can have some fun. Yes, apparently new players now get a lot of tickets and free stuff, but don\'t get used to it - that\'s just the bait to reel you in.  You\'re not exactly guaranteed to get anything if you pay every event/gacha//week as well, so keep that in mind before installing. This is the greediest game I\'ve ever seen.' ],

Any time I try to use the joystick it would go to another place on the screen, and other times would make my blob automatically go somewhere without me even using the joystick. If it is just my device making the game buggy then is it still possible to fix somehow? Please let me know.',
       'What is this???? After every 1 or 2 game when the main menu comes I touch screen just frozes I can\'t even touch any button. Neither I can play nor I can go to shop it\'s nothing I can do but just to quit the game. My phone is Samsung S6  Pls do something it\'s really irritating',
       'This game makes me mad cause every time I get the daily quest I win and when the game ends it tells me that it\'s loading and when it\'s loads it shows that i didn\'t pass the quest.. I loved this game a the beginning it was working fine now it does this all the time. It\'s sad that you get hooked on the game then it starts to do this and can\'t even play it right.  Please fix it cause i really love this game and don\'t want to have to delete it.',
       'fix the laaags please. I have high speed internet but still facing lags. I spent a lot in this game and don\'t want to loose it. Still lagging :(. It works with only high speed internet. Can\'t play with the data packages only strong wifi.  You didn\'t fix this in the new edition of the game and the rush mode is not working. The new party is sucks big time. Fix fix fix',
       'If one of you game Creators survives more than 5 mins in that game where everyone is teaming up I will rate the game 5 stars again... Half of times i respawn  i get eaten before even the game starts. And one time i payed the X3 for 1 hour i was ever respawning on viruses . The game is nice but the performance is not nice.',
       '1. Lag is a killer. Even with high speed internet, my character jumps around and pauses. Then,  when it recovers,  i get eaten. Unplayable with the lag.  2. Ads freeze the game. When returning from an ad, i have to quit the game then restart.  3. Game is fun when controls are smooth. Maybe there are too many characters on one board and server has difficulty tracking everyone.' ],

     [ 'Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don\'t ever plan to, but here you also don\'t really need to. I\'ve won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you\'re not forced to watch them. It\'s not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.',
       'Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I\'ll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily "less than 20 coins" reward. Sooooooo cheap!',
       'It\'s just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that\'s a good question.',
       'Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don\'t even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.',
       'Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn\'t be putting people in the "club" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this "club" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they\'re INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game',
       'Would be good if someone actually thought about what they were making. This is an over computerized auto random winning when that person didnt actually win game. Many flaws need to be fixed. Start from scrat ch and make a more user friendly uno to play with my actual friends, not random people until I make it to level 5. Not cool.' ],

I had to pay each time i danced wich sucks.  Till that update this game was the best game/app ever. It was so fun and so great that I just wanted to play nonstop.  I mean before this big update u payed for a song and u could dance on it as much as you liked. Now it just ain\'t fun anymore.   Please return to the classic game or your gonna lose much much more players like me.',
       'Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren\'t enough. And one of them didn\'t work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.',
       'I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.',
       'It\'s fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I\'m bored. I love the songs and dance moves it\'s awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it\'s awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don\'t know how to dance then you should download this game it\'s perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.',
       'Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn\'t have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!',
       'I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn\'t make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun.' ],

     [ 'Amazing game if you like naval warships. UPDATE: As of Feb 17 2018, the new update has seriously increased the game content and fun level. UPDATE as of Feb 27 2018, Lowered my rating to 4 stars because there is a constant issue with the timers or something like that.  I login and collect the crate and start a module upgrading then login several hours late and is like no time elapsed in the game from the last time I logged in. This has happened several times in the past as well.',
       'Fact need a good connection to keep control of your ships Now, I have plenty of $$$ nothing to spend on it. Waiting to get the last max destroyer ship i can get on the random container spin.  Also noted... I open up the app the next day and the container count down says 2+ hours. It should read 0 zero I would think.',
       'This is a fantastic game one of the best by miles. I am not sure however, that the latest update was such a success. Prior to update the smaller torpedo boats had a good chance now that dynamic has been removed by the dominance of the larger ships firepower and slow reload times on torpedoes.  This means that the strategic component has been somewhat diminished',
       'Best battleship game on Android hands down ! Better than wargaming ship game great controls great graphics !Fun to play good selection of warships and large maps and they keep on doing updates to keep it interesting! And the most important thing is the price of ships are fair keep up the great work . I love the last update with graphics and maps and ships. the only thing the Bismarck is under powered can you make her stronger because she was the pride of Germany and everybody complains she is not a good ship.She is a powerhouse thank you!',
       'look since the update the game constantly resarts when trying to enter battle.....  now I just had my tablet lock up for a half hour....  the chat in this game has killed it.... constantly getting the game  restarted..... booting back to desktop. I have been playing for over a year with iowa and new Jersey completely maxed...  its sad to see the quality go down',
       'It\'s a good game. While I don\'t like the sinking animation, this game has the best controls of any game like this but you should add the HMS Caroline. My only problem is that it lags out to the home screen. This did not happen before one of the recent updates and I know it\'s not just me that has this issue. Please fix it. It\'s made the game unplayable.' ],

I was honestly thinking about giving this 3 stars just b/c of how annoying that is alone.',

     [ 'I really love the concept of completing puzzles, different quests and special side games. The graphics are great as well. I don\'t, however, like that you\'re almost forced to pay for tickets or you can play MAYBE one game a day. Needless to say, I\'m not spending money to boost up my tickets.',
       'I have 89 power ups and cannot use them. This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen in a bingo game, it\'s cheating. Ok so they put up power ups that I don\'t have and want me to buy them.Here\'s the kicker, if I don\'t buy them it stays up the whole game and doesn\'t let me use the ones I have!!!!! Ahhh greed! What a joke. Absolutely unfair. I\'ve never seen anything like it. So so sad. And now since the new update it takes way too long to level up!! They just more greedy with each update. Again, so, so sad.',
       'Game freezes and I always lose my tokens. Not fun. I dont play for days to save just to play 2 stupid games',
       'The game started out fun an interesting. After the update you don\'t win ever an also it takes forever now to level up. Wouldn\'t recommend now..',
       'So far I can\'t figure out what the xp points are for. This game unfortunately, like most of these games starts to get impossible to play because you have to keep paying for tokens in order to continue. I really like the concept, but I\'m probably going to uninstall it as it\'s far too expensive for what little bit of playing time you do get.',
       'It\'s more exciting in the beginning. The higher the level the harder it becomes to even have tickets or power ups to play. If u are able to get tickets your not likely to win without buying power ups. So no matter how u look at it the higher the level the more cash out of your pocket it will take to play.' ],

     [ 'Hands down one of the best card games I have ever played. The gameplay is simplistic yet emersive. The different combinations of cards and deck types you can build is vast allowing you to adapt to any challenge you may encounter. While the gameplay is phenomenal, it\'s very easy to gain an understanding of how to play and the cards themselves. Bethesda has yet again made a game that has captivated me. Well done 👍',
       'An absolutely wonderful game. Even better then Hearthstone if you ask me. It\'s so good that even I, Solaire of Astora who hails from Dark Souls, absolutely praises this game. 100% recommend. This only issue that one could run into is lag, but this is only due to the fact that I have an older phone. I\'m sure that if you have a better phone, this game would be EVEN better. Praise the Sun \\[T]/',
       'The first three turns of the game has an incredibly small amount of finite moves.  You wouldn\'t know this because the typical player will take more than 30 seconds on their first, second, and third turns.  You start to realize that on "draft" games, you will benefit more if you concede the game when your opponent is taking an agonisingly long time on the first few turns because they\'re putting so much thought into the only play in their hand.',
       'I\'m a huge card player of all kinds and really didn\'t expect much of this game, but have loved all of the console ELDER SCROLLS so I gave it a try. Immediately hooked, and the best part is how well balanced the game is in terms of card power. I have made 4 decks of separate play styles with equal win rates. 5 stars for sure',
       'The game itself is okay. But like others said this is not a free game and should not pretend to be. The introduction campaign, is useful to see what the game is about, but it is very short. I wouldn\'t even mind paying a small amount to unlock different storylines, if the price was reasonable. Surely the company would make more from having a 100 people spend £2. Than 10 people spending £15? (Yeah it really is that simple) you would also have 100 more happy customers. Also, the cost of the card packs follows the same business plan. Charge less, sell more. Otherwise you just look like all the other greedy companies out there.',
       'Fun game. Not a pay to win which is also great. Only downside is the game is unavailable at the last day of each month due to updates. Also this game tends to have really bad connection issues... Doesn\'t matter if on WiFi or cell data it will randomly disconnect' ],

       'This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you\'re willing to go broke',
       'Its the best game I have ever played. The things you can build are amazing and it\'s great that you can build your own to. The controls and graphics are unbelievably amazing. Great animal sounds to, they actually sound exactly the same as a real animal. Its also great that you can have villager\'s and your own pets. Only problem is the packs you have to use diamonds and if I don\'t have enough then I have pay for the diamonds and I\'m just a kid and my mom says no so please make the packs and the things in them cheaper. But other than that, this game is so AWESOME. 😃',
       'Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.',
       'Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses.',
       'I have a significant concern with how easy it is to accidentally spend the gems. It has happened at least once, though I\'m assuming it happened a second time while I was quickly clicking building a building, since fifteen gems are now unaccounted for. I cannot feel comfortable with this game if at any given moment, all my gems might get spent because of one misclick.' ],

It pulls so much power that my phone starts to get ridiculously hot and I can burn through a chunk of my battery within 10 minutes of play time',
       'I dont do mobile games but thats because most games are a pay to win model. This however has gripped my soul as its a game you can actually progress in without spending real money....thus making me want to spend real money anyway because i see it as a good investment. Well done guys you certainly deserve my thumbs up',
       'It\'s OK... But the reviews that say you don\'t need to spend money are lying. I have fixed every bench in town for a week and found no cement - but you can buy it for 96 gems. Yea right. Pay to play as always... Also its a bit of a grind game, doing the same things over and over which just get a bit more expensive the more times you do it. Its OK to waste 20mins on but I won\'t be keeping it that long.' ],

I Love game, but I hate the double pay out bonus game button it puts you into trouble it puts you somewhere else out of the game and it keeps you captured unless you press the exit button on your phone that double button should be took out of the game because it ruins the whole game and is making me fed up of playing making me question the game if it worth keeping it.

       'Good game, but some new characters are cheap, meaning they make the game imbalanced.  The mana troll is too powerful.  The snipers are too hard to get at.  The tentacle cannot be countered.  This goes on and on.  Not every new idea is a good one.  Leave well enough alone.  I may be quitting this soon if it keeps up.',
       'A great game...but its either pay to win which is lame, or worse half these jerks hack into the game and enable the hacks if they start losing....summoning 5 titans in less than 15 seconds, 3 of which are the same titan summoned in that short time isnt legit...its cheating. Game is fun but they def need a hack shield and stop making it a pay to win game. If it were a game that wasnt pay to win like the new monster hunter world is, and it was based on your skill alpne, it would be a top game, and man how many ppl i would wreck....but sadly its all about money',

     [ 'The leader is too hard to catch at a lot of tracks. They\'ll be half a straight away ahead in just a lap of racing, and there is no way to catch them.And it would be cool to have multiple paint schemes for each driver so we don\'t have to look at the same cars all the time, it gets a little boring. And the Daytona 500 should be 4 or 5 laps long, 3 laps is too short. Good game though, play it pretty much everyday.',
       'Good game. Greedy developers. You MUST pay to play or you cannot compete. Some of the in app purchases are astronomical. However, I\'m an English F1 fan (which is the polar opposite of NASCAR) and the game holds my interest. Developers need to make it a little easier (and cheaper) to compete and it will be a top game. The blueprint is great but needs financial tweaking',
       'Game is OK as a time killer. It has some fun components to it to make it interesting. Some of the in game purchase prices are ludicrous though. If they charged a one time fee of $4.99, I think I\'d probably buy it. But for 5 clams you get just enough of a boost in the game to get you through the first hour of game play. Then you gotta buy more gold and whatnot to get through the next part of the game at a reasonable rate. tl ; dr kind of fun, don\'t spend real money on it.',
       'Great game! But I think it could use some more additions to it like the graphics upgraded some. Maybe when you crash into a wall or another car it shows the damages and actually wrecks. Then you have to spend money to repair it. Also it would be nice if you added a area where you could design the car and customize it. But overall it\'s a great game I\'ll continue to play if it keeps improving and maybe see some of these additions',
       'Was fun until I maxed out what I can do to upgrade the car. I\'m too a point where I can\'t get enough stars to continue too the next track, can\'t upgrade the car anymore, can\'t get the 5 stars to move on. Consecutive bump drafting for 30,000+ feet is impossible. I don\'t know....maybe make it reasonable. I wouldn\'t waste my time playing this game.',
       'Been looking for a game like this forever. Finally. Thanks guys. So realistic. A few issues though. Game lags & voice & engine sounds are distorted on my phone. Need more camera views, roof cam, bonnet cam etc. Best of all I love the ability to play offline.' ],

       'Doing the tournaments is a waste of time!   You don\'t earn any prizes and if you do it\'s one 1hr bottle at least that\'s what i got so useless! Why can\'t we cook food instead of stupid stuff that some of us don\'t have enough of like CL vouchers! This game has gotten boring! Think I\'m going to uninstall.',
       'i love the game i become addicted to it. but i want more CL card to enjoy and build my appliances its to hard to wait for more everytime it feels like the more il waiy the sooner ill gave up on it but anyway i love the game please improve more and also more available design for appliances and wall etc etc thanks... :)',
       'Up until the last update, all was good. But with the most recent update I keep trying to open and it claims there\'s no internet connection. I have triple checked the settings and those all check. I\'ve even uninstalled and reinstalled it. No luck. Shut my phone off and on again, still does nothing.',
       'Thus far the only downside I have found is the fact that it is so dam expensive to expand. And the quests just never seem to end. Which yes in my opinion is annoying. Getting a quest every time you complete one makes it kinda hard to know what I am supposed to be doing. Hince the reason my diner is still so cramped. I was doing them in the order I got the quests and before I realized it I had no room and a bunch of stuff I can\'t place. I just sold 4 tables and chairs to have room. So if you could resolve these issues that\'d be great',
       'I think you guys should introduce Marketland on Android platform. I use to play that game few years back on Facebook.Bringing Marketland would a great attraction for Android users as we all have played that game in Facebook. Plz bring that on Playstore and also make some necessary updates in Cafeland, it takes time to load the game or to visit any friend\'s Cafe, and at last the game needs some graphic update on environment and other details as its looks like a same old game. So plz make some necessary changes.' ],

     [ 'It\'s a good cover-based shooter, with some pretty creative characters and a good pace for quick battles. The unlock system is more than fair, with the ability to save currencies for that one big purchase. I enjoy the ability to play at my own pace without sacrificing my life to the game (cough*Kabam*cough) and I\'m having a lot of fun. I\'ve noticed that PVP tends to favor Savage, when he activates Spray and Pray once, half the opposing team dies. Twice, and the round is over. Otherwise a very well done and enjoyable game.',
       'Fun game, good time killer, great graphics. Unfortunately,  like with many other games, they sucker you in with rewards at the start only for you to soon hit a paywall. It\'s  either grind and hope you get lucky or give into the many game ads promoting cash purchases. Anything involving actually online play (co-op, PvP etc) seems to freeze or have crazy lag. Good game, definitely has room for improvement.',
       'I really enjoy the action this game brings along with good looks and simple controls. Too many times development teams get caught up in the visuals or complex control schemes and forget about what gamers really love and that\'s not having a complex control panel with nice smooth transition from level to level. Thank you for making this game a joy to play every time I turn it on.',
       'Good concept. Good game. Many glitches. For a game that\'s touted for and based on pvp it makes no sense that %80 of the time the game freezes going into a pvp battle. It\'s okay though, you can close it and then immediately reopen it to a message that tells you that you died. Fix your freezing problems and I\'d give you 4 stars.',
       'Really solid graphics and game play for mobile. Doesn\'t want to work with my Bluetooth controller. As a free game they have really doubled down on the shards and multiple currencies to try to get you to spend. You really need to grind if you want to unlock anything without paying.',
       'Update: they fix the graphics issue. Great game. If you can , would be nice to see the graphics get polished, hopefully they look better in the future...  Old : Graphics terrible, needs fixing asap,gameplay looks fun. Device: Nvidia Shield Tablet' ],

       'Awesome but... Feature suggestion.. I really enjoy this game. it\'s addicting and fun to play. I never cared about Pokemon other then the original wizards of the coast 150 but this has opened me up to newer generations of Pokemon. But one thing I really would like to suggest.. if you can make changes to the game where as you can invite friends or family or even have friends list to battle friends that are also playing. If you guys could add that feature that would be amazing. Other then that this game rocks! Awesome job team.',
       'I really didn\'t like this one. Its extremely slow and laggy. Buttons take multiple taps to respond. All rewards won in the league take hours to open so whats the point of playing if it takes me 24 hours to claim my prize? The only way to get good pokemon is with money.   Worst game made by pokemon.',
       'This game is the best way to get my mind thinking with its amazing graphics awesome story and amazing gameplay 5 stars for me!! And combining this with pokemon is just YESHHH!! But there are some downsides considering after getting farther into the game you have to pay and the game is straight up rigged as well.',
       'Love the game and it\'s very addictive. The few things that could be made better is make it possible to get shiny pokemon figures in time, locked, and shop boosters. Also I hope that more hotels after elysium are available soon. If these things are added to the game, I\'d give five stars all around.',
       'It\'s a unique game, but that can\'t save it from it\'s problems. The system is based so much on luck it can be impossible to win and then then game says you specifically have to win, you can\'t just play a match. This game has caused so much stress and frustration for my brother that I really do hate it. Plus, it seems like the support staff never listen to any suggestions or comments players make.' ],

     [ 'Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.',
       'Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don\'t get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a "Create a Player" option under \'My Club\' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It\'d be so nice if you add that.',
       'It is a brilliant game absolutely loved it. But it cud add something first can it have every player\'s data like if i bought neymar then can it in records give his number of goals, assists, appearances and second after every player\'s stats that his pitch map how many interception he did and etc not just motm bur every player',
       'I will love it if i can send players on loan and be paid some coins instead of directly selling them off. Also switching players for a few or no coins will be great. Since players like pogba likes changing his hairstyles, it will also be great to effect some changes in some players hairstyle. More leagues are needed, if possible, German,  Chinese, Nigerian and south African league. Lastly, commentators find it difficult to call the name of a created player, work on these and this game will be perfect.  Thanks',
       'Very good game. There are lots of players but Manuel Neuer is missing. Some extra things need to be done for this game to become the top football game. German Clubs and many clubs of other countries like those of Poland, Denmark, etc. are missing. If these clubs are added, then the game becomes complete. Hope this changes are done by the "First Touch" as fast as possible.',
       'Great game. Controls could seize to work at times (not very often though) but as a whole, it is a fantastic game. Quality graphics and game play. It would be nice if the game could auto-update(with internet connection) so teams could be updated and players could be at their current clubs e.g Coutinho (Barca), Alexis (Man utd ), Mkhritaryan(Arsenal)etc. Love this game' ],

It\'s a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that\'s it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame',
       'Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn\'t came in two years it probably isn\'t. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don\'t pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges.',
       'Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.',
       'I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.',

       'It takes way too long for the levels to reload and I\'m not sinking thousands of dollars into a game just so I can play it. It  is ridiculous the a put of money you need to pay to even play this games. There should be more drones for a cheaper price (if not free.) Although the game is fun you don\'t get to play it much unless you are willing to shell out thousands in the long run' ],

     [ 'Best version ever this season!!! Very addictive been playing for the last 3 years or so, great game and soo many great changes!! One thing that I see as a issue is that they make u spend actual money to get your team to the next level. It would be impossible to play in any league and be good if you don\'t put some actual money in the game and upgrade your team to elite.',
       'Amazing! Only minor detail. Has to be easier at least by a little to get more elites. I know during the Superbowl you give out players but then you guys do an update and we have to start over. Was furious at this. It is great though like gameplay and set up. Season mode is really good. Just make odds easier to get ELITES',
       'I love the app and all. But if you put out a special halftime show event for the superbowl make sure that it isn\'t crashing every 5 seconds. I\'m pretty sure you guys make more than enough money for servers that can have a lot of people on it. I\'m just mad because I had 12 seconds left in the event and it kicked me off.',
       'Great game lots of fun !! I have a suggestion.. we should be allowed to have interleague Player trading. Have options for trade like coins, Madden Cash or trade ( x ) amount of gold players to someone for 1 elite or several lower rating elites for one higher rating elites. Set a timer on the trade, counter trade options & accept, decline or withdraw trade..',
       'This game is great. Really. The only problem that I have with it is that in the new update maybe last year, I lost my 90 some overall team. I had Brady, Gronkowski, Beckham, and a great defense. All of this was gone after that update, when the training came into play. If this was intentional, please notify me, I\'d not, I\'d like my old account back. It was Slyclone89 and it remains so now, under a 65 overall.',
       'SERIOUSLY!? I am ONE trial badge away from getting a 92 ovr, so I need to open one more SB giveaway pack,and THAT is when you decide to crash repeatedly every time i try to open the pack. Typical. Every time I do something realy good or am about to get something really good, you act up. Typical.' ],

       'The game is good. The devs are not. They punished me for getting mad when another player broke into my account. I was banned from chat and mail... permanently. I wasn\'t even left the option of appealing - they blocked me from sending mails to them as well. Play at your own risk. I\'m not disgruntled. I was a very happy and enthusiastic player for several years. If you had asked me my opinion about the devs before this, I would have had nothing but good thing to say. Now? Talk about being stabbed in the back. If you\'re going to spend, beware. They like to ban people and not give refunds.  EDIT FROM SEVERAL MONTHS LATER: I decided to come back to the game and downloaded the app again. I try to make a new account and guess what? They\'ve blocked my device from playing. XD What a bunch of petty people. Think before you act, Nut Game. I am going to be looking into what I can do with Google Play to report you for predatory business practices.',

     [ 'Awesome Game!  I love everything about it. From "Zelda" look to it to the strategies needed to succeed. At first I thought it would be boring cause it doesn\'t look like the latest technology but that\'s what\'s awesome about it. Totally old school baby! Big two thumbs up from me. You have to try it. Don\'t judge the book by its cover. Easy play, great graphics, affordable if one chooses to pay which is not required. I got an 8 star card without paying a dime. Just participate in the events and you\'ll be fine. Thx for the fun guys ( and girls 😆)!',
       'I don\'t understand why this game isn\'t under the strategy section, for plenty of it is involved for all players! For example, you have to strategize how much money you\'re going to take out of your paycheck each week to play this game and actually keep up with it. I\'ve been playing this game ever since the highest rarity was 6 stars, but the 11 stars are absolutely amazing! I just can\'t wait until they announce 12 stars! Or 18 stars! Or 27 stars! I\'ll definitely be paying $100 - $300 for a single card then!',
       'Fun, sometimes It\'s a fun game,developed to encourage you to spend money. "I\'m done with this game! After $300 I still didn\'t get that 10 star!" Is a common phrase I hear from my allies.. My reply is "you spend money on this game???" Anyway, I\'ve been playing for years and I have plenty of 9 star cards and one 10 star. So year it\'s definitely a pay-to-win kind of thing. But luckily the Events can be fun, and it\'s a distraction at least.',
       'Been having a problem starting 26/12/2016 where i try to enter the game and it says i need a working internet connection. My internet is fine, uninstalled, reinstalled. Same issue. Please help me out!! Brilliant game, super addictive play it all day every day. You don\'t NEED to pay to be effective, just patient and smart. But paying could help you I guess if you have the favour of the RNG gods.',
       'This is an update to my original review in 2013. Fantasica is light, fun and intuitive. The mechanics for the tower defense are well set out. Constant events and new cards are always being added to keep things from feeling stale. There are cooldowns, like all free games nowadays, but fantasica doesn\'t force hours of downtime.',

     [ 'The new interface is very confusing.  There are a lot of pay walls in this game, but the added feature of videos for currency made it much better.   However, they modified the result of the videos to randomly give other rewards which have little value. I will consider giving stars back if they change this functionality back or make the game less expensive.',
       'They\'ve taken what was a good game and ruined it, in a cash grab which is as unfair as it is blatant. Hugely diminished progression through tedious, grinding battles. Event battles which are so heavily stacked against the player  that even if you win, you\'re not guaranteed the resources to obtain new characters. An ever changing rnd system which is designed to frustrate you into spending cash. The ultimate kicker being, even when you spend the cash, you\'re still not guaranteed a win. All in all, a greedy, self-serving exploitation of the Marvel brand and an unplayable game.',
       'Can\'t play it anymore. Game will stay on main loading screen and just load or it will load the game then just quit to my phone home screen after a few seconds on being on the game. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but that didn\'t work at all. Loved being able to play before when there wasn\'t an issue with it.',
       'I don\'t like the new update. For the characters to appear as their upgraded selves, you have to change them every time you load the game. Also it is very laggy, although I\'m not sure if that\'s just my internet. Either way, it\'s very annoying. Also the game is super laggy.',
       'I upgraded my rating to a two star, because it will finally load.  It is still slow and lagging.  Wish you guys would have left it alone.  You took a nice relaxing game and made it confusing and difficult.  There wasn\'t anything wrong with it they way you had it.',

     [ 'The match making system could be improved. Match making is based on your level but does not take into account the level of the ship. To test this I took a Heavy Fighter At level 11 and was being matched up with Frigates. No chance in heck to win for me. Even at higher levels it\'s hard to win if your opponent has a ship 3-4 steps above you. A limit of 2 levels above and below for ships would be a good fix.',
       'I also liked the game more at lower levels. Maybe you could make it like a loss drops your rating by so many points. I hit lvl 130 and barely win a fight with either of the three of my ships. If we could drop points, maybe we could get 3 straight wins or 5 a day. The higher the rank, obviously means harder opponents. But my ships are only so strong while saving up money to by better upgrades or a better ship. Please fix this',
       'This game if fun....but after trying a couple of the free offers to gain in game currency and never receiving the funds I will be uninstalling. I contacted fyber(the ad company that gives out the currency) and they say they gave the compensation. I cannot support a game that blatantly states that funds may not be awarded and still uses the fraud company. It is a great disservice to the player base and I will not stand for it',
       'I really liked this game.  Its fun and addicting if you like constantly building tweaking and testeing your ship against other peoples.  Unfortunately when you log on one day and randomly all of your progress and all of the ships youve worked on have disappeared and you have to start from scratch again i could not recommend playing this.  I could see no way to ask for help so there is no recourse if this happens.  Funny that all my achievements and battle stats stayed just no ships, levels, or in game credits and paid for crystals.  Stayed logged in to google play so that should have saved my progress.',
       'I really like this game. The variety of ships and focus on building is fun and imaginative. A warning to new gamers, Unfortunately I (level 30) have been struggling to progress since coming across the Destroyer Vega (limit time in game purchase) the majority of match ups, as it\'s overpowered at the level you can get it, means constantly loosing.',
       'This game is awesome! I want more ships and stuff I would  love to play this game alot!  The only thing I don\'t like is that there is no name change and sometimes that game will just crash and you have to restart. If you can fix this I will rate five. Thanks.' ],

     [ 'Very good! The graphics are reminiscent of scribblenauts, which is a great look, controls are simple yet very good. But, I do have two problems: One, the pricing of the sets are too much for what they are. 6.99? More like 4.99. The currency i can understand, maybe bump up the quantity of the 50.00 dollar currency pack, otherwise, the currency pricing is fair. The other one is that there are many framerate bugs! Please attempt to fix them! Besides my problems, the game gets a score, in my book, of a 4.0, great game!',
       'It was a fantastic time eating, addictive, fun game;  The developer became greedy with too many ads.  Also, at the same time, it started using too many resources, frequently pausing for up to two seconds during gameplay, rendering it unplayable.  I really enjoyed this game. Nice, challenging physics and strategy through design and problem solving.',
       'Only reason I\'ve won\'t give 5 stars is that they use to give holidays special mission this year they\'ve skipped it. Seen a few improvements other last year an half but nothing major. But all in all fun game build crafts and hope u make it.',
       'Recent update filled the game with adds. Used to play and only see adds when finishing a mission and selecting the option for extra coins or gems. Now they auto play adds between runs forcing you to have to watch two for the benefit. Good game but they got greedy.',
       'I really like the game however when i was playing i finally got the bigfoot and played for awhile. Then i left the game to play my Xbox but when i got back on i didnt have the bigfoot anymore which really got me mad. So please fix that bug',
       'Game used to be good. Started playing again recently and the amount of ads is just abysmal. They also seriously lowered gold rewards for completing levels. The game play is fun, but if I were starting now and didn\'t have decent parts and upgrades from before, I would have dropped it immediately. Shame it ended up like it\'s current state. No longer recommend.' ],

     [ 'Infinite flight is one of the best aircraft simluation games out there on the market. Although, it costs around $5 USD it provides free aircrafts and, maps with the game. What im slightly disappointed in is, the amount of in-app purchases needed to aquire the various maps and aircrafts. There just a inconsistents over free aircrafts and maps, and the in-app purchased items. If you developers could add more free aircrafts and, maps it could add more value to the consumer buying this game, and thus getting more than they expected. Despite from my concern this is a great simulation game and, please continue on with your work.',
       'Awesome game. Especially now, that they have added global. I can finally travel the world on my phone with stunning realistic graphics. Although it doesn\'t have complete terminals and the complete airports you can still communicate with ATC and other aircraft around. Love the controls and also the autopilot. I hope they keep adding more upgrades like terminals or gates and at least have background noises to hear the passengers boarding. Finally I would like, for whenever I switch to wing view to not be loud.',
       'Hello, I\'m really impressed of this app. Flying the world is amazing from a country to another. My personal favourite is the London to Hong Kong route. One thing to mention about aircrafts. The A380 needs a full rework on its Cockpit, external cameras on everything and wing flex and actions. It also needs the liveries that the a380 currently dosen\'t have in the fleet. It would be great if you guys are working on this programme. Secondly, I hope that Infinite flight will release the A350. Its one of my favourite aircraft.',
       'This flight simulator is so amazing you can be airtraffic controller or pilot there\'s multiplayer too. In the new update the online is really expensive now... i loved the older version becouse it was way cheaper like around 3.84 pounds now its around 10pounds a month? Also you have to membership to fly outside of region in single player i already payed for other regions... if you expect us to pay around 9 or 10 pounds make servers better',
       'I\'m really apprehensive about what the future holds for fellow flyers with this app. I feel that the people who have supported you from the beginning have been forgotten about and this can be seen from the latest update. I appreciate that development needs to be made and this costs money, however, to bring out an aircraft and the only way for this to be flown is by subscribing for global. Poor move infinite flight, you\'ve had just about enough of my money. Supported you and purchased on both IOS and Android devices but this is the final straw. Good luck. Not wasting anymore money.',
       'I was in love with this simulator for quite sometime. Up until the last updates which now do not allow you to even play without having access to a network. I use to be able to play offline. Is there anyway we can go back to having offline gameplay? I play this while inflight at times and do not want to purchase wifi just to play it. Please fix. Thank you' ],

Make a new map for interserver , you can manage that new map , how many server a week can be macth , maybe 3 or 4 server , once in a week you create a quest in that interserver for players (solo quest) and team quest, and even the phanteon interserver war ! .  With this interserver map , you don\'t have to merge server so often.   2. Make a new map , make the world bigger , and add more details individuals activity , such as swimming , fishing (maybe for pet feed)   or even farming !   This game are beautiful , this game are the best ! . But if you improve it to be greater , that\'s will be more awesome !   I don\'t care about the game size , just make it happen , please!',

I had saved 270+ hourglasses so I could do the secret endings but well. That went down the toilet. I won\'t be trying again until I get interested (and over this) in this game again.

But now, after I updated the game I get notifications about the chat, and not just once but twice! I got double notifications lol I\'m so happy, thank you! And thanks for the 20 hourglasses after the update. Now I give you full 5 stars! I LOVE this game! 😘  I\'d love to give 5 stars, I mean this game is amazing and almost perfect! Just sad that sometimes I missed the chat because I didn\'t get the notification. So, I have to check the game often. But I really enjoy playing this game, which doesn\'t feel like game at all.

     [ 'Ive been playing this and the 1st. one out for 5-10 years and it never gets old. Best tower defense game out! Very addictive and you do not have to buy to play.  If you choose to its not expensive.  $1.00 here and there helps but, not needed. The older game you got more for your buck. Now, they have gotten a little greedy but, still not as bad as some games.',
       'Great game, but you can only play so far before you hit a major paywall - there\'s no way to get a worthwhile amount of stars (currency) without paying - really disappointing from what would otherwise be an amazing game.',
       'Hard to get stars after about level 11  and no real way to farm them. Replaying levels doesn\'t provide them and tournaments are so lopsided that its not even funny. Log in daily for stars or prepare to drop money.',
       'I would rate 5 stars but my only issue is the small rewards, it takes so much to upgrade and after a while you hit a wall due to the huge difficulty of some levels and the amount of coins it takes to upgrade a unit.',
       'I brought two different bundles and they diddnt work. I have emails as proof. There was no help page on the game. Bad set up. Wheres the help from the people who made the game??????',
       'I do love this game. But then my phone needs to update then my application needs to be deleted. I reinstall this game then I went back to the first level.please help me how can I sync my level with this game :(' ],

       'I like the game. I was in love with it when I first got it, but coming back to it I remember why I Uninstalled it. It\'s because it coats so much to expand. It\'s honestly ridiculous. This also means it\'s difficult to keep the butterfly you have and get the event ones. It\'s just a upsetting. If it wasn\'t for that literally making progress in the game stupid I would give it a 5 star.',

For people who question energy levels...put out as many hens and cows possible, they turn into energy when they cash out. Do the tasks from the board to get energy, experience and money. Do shipments on the ship. For those who run out of materials, build the research facility then you can order your materials. Before moving onto new lands try to clear as many resources as possible or they will be lost to you. Enjoy!!!!',

Please add this feature. 2. Zombies are too hard to beat . Please decrease some of their capabilities. 3. There must be an increase in chest slots . 4. Please decrease the quantity of wood logs to cook. Otherwise all of our hardworking to gather logs while be replaced by only a few meats and others. 6. Please add another source of getting seeds. They are too hard to get.',
       'The game is ok.. i love the idea.. but in all RPG and similar games you can accuire your items from when you died from your body in that zone.. also its good when you enter the inventory to pause the game.. when entering a zone the game should give some time before reseting the material and monsters if the player re-enters the same zone.. These are the most critical points so far i have encountered.. please take these in consideration.. thank you',
       '16 energy to move to the nearest forest!! Don\'t expect to build your house or collect resources in a day. This game has potential, but the energy spent to move to a forest is just too much that after an hour you would have to spend money to get energy just to collect resources. It\'s a shame that the gameplay is really smooth but the game is focused on making you pay to win/build in the first hour.',
       'As I have not heard of this game (it showed up in my recommendations), I would like to say that this game is beautiful! I do recommend other people to play it. The graphics are highly amazing and basic control is outstanding! I love the idea on how you can pick up items that you put down and rearrange your base the way you want it. Although, I did have several connection issues, but overall everything is in tiptop condition. Keep up the good work!',
       'Quite the gem. Kinda surprising to find a ftp title with actual depth on mobile but so far it\'s great. Looking forward to more updates on the future. Also, to those complaining about energy costs to move to other zones, that\'s only to run there as you can travel (albeit slower) for free of you choose. Not to mention you can speed up this process through crafting later on.',
       'This game\'s great, I loved it until I saw the ammount of energy it costs to travel to the nearest forest. Could you try and fix this and anything else that the reviewer asked? The game\'s even better than Last Day on Earth, it\'s like a zombie survival in the middle ages, just make some improvements and this\'ll be the best survival game in Play Store' ],

     [ 'The game is good,very good, some lags but nothing is 100% perfect anywhere. Support is nice and they respond fast. Perfect game for serious and long term players. People should stop complaining, this game is really worth above a 4 star atleast.   No complaints, a well planned strategic game. Have being playing for near 2 years now.',
       'Keeps saying error wen trying to collect alliance gift. Don\'t like how I put a message on world chat or alliance chat and it still has my same message at the bottom after the fact I had sent it already. This game is way to laggy and needs to be fixed. The graphics can use a bit more work to. The shield ok but would be better if they where a bit more see through and a bit of a sparkle kind of color or something the way it is is kind of funny. There should be a dragon we can use to would be awesome to be able to use hero n a dragon but the armor should actually show on the creator to kind of pointless to use it it\'s not gonna show on them. Other than that the game is awesome n fun to play.',

       'False advertising! This has nothing to do with the OBVIOUS rip off of starcraft. It Is set in a medieval period. Absolutely hate it just because of that.',

And suddenly now there have pop up add that soo loud. It disturbing. I hope you add some time for early bird event n the pop up add can you make it stop.',
       'I loved it , it is so addicting and the characters are gorgeous, but it is way too short. I find myself paying fake money from the game to buy tickets just to know what happens next! You might actually fall in love with the characters! That\'s how amazing it is!',
       'This used to be my favorite Solmare game, but the pop-up ads have ruined it. They can pop open at anytime, playing loud music and ruining the experience. When they pop up, I usually just end up closing the app, no matter what I was in the middle of because they are so annoying. I will probably end up uninstalling this app because of them.  If this was not an issue, it would be a 5 STAR game.',
       'This game is good and the story was interesting. The reason why i give three stars is because the magic challenges sometimes need to consume lots coins or lunes. And everytime there is new event which need to collect bonbon... It is teally hard to collect it and instead we need to buy... i know this game is free for both pay to play and free to play... but all i see is pay to play since the bonbons need to buy and sometimes events that come back by popular demand also consume lots of money.... I actually liked this game but since you made this game really.... i had to give only 3 stars since the game had to use mk ey A LOT....',
       'It\'s one of the best \'Shall We Date?\' series. There\'s a lot of stuff that even free players can get and the missions are pretty easy to pass if you take part in lessons regularly. Also Zeus ♥. Super great game!',
       'The stories in this game are well written and well edited. There are no confusing grammatical errors to try to work past to understand the story, which is lovely. The artwork is very pretty as well, even the backgrounds. All the guy characters I have read so far are interesting and different from each other. Most of the stories differ from each other enough to keep a player interested. My only complaint about the stories is that the MC is whiney and childish. Annoyingly so.  One thing: I had to stop playing Blood in Roses because of the massively annoying popup ad where this guy just bashes a pigs brains in with a club. Every. Single. Ad. And now, this game has that same pop up ad. Why? My rating will go down quite a bit more if this continues.' ],

     [ 'I\'m really enjoying this game - it\'s surprisingly advanced for an app. Plays very smoothly and looks pretty. One annoying thing is I get network connection bugs from time to time flashing up. They don\'t stop me from playing tho, so meh. Also, the way they match players together is sometimes pretty suss, ships that wipe you out in two seconds flat...or less... just shouldn\'t be matched with you. But, overall pretty great.',
       'It\'s a good game.  Three things I may add.  Every so often when you improve a ship , the app goes "improvement failed" yet but takes your coins. Bit frustrating. Secondly, the matchmaking can be at times frustrating too, you\'re getting wrecked in seconds by other very powerful ones.. And last thing , hey , the music of the game becomes straight boring and dull after a while. Add something , anything , Frank Sinatra  ffs , you got about 15 seconds of soundtrack in all this game..',
       'I really love this game, i made a donation to help the devs... i was expecting no more ads (unless i chose to watch videos for double rewards) I STLL GET ADS. i will leave rating at 2 stars until this stupid issue is fixed. Why force a paying member to watch ads. STUPID DO NOT SPEND MONEY',
       'Plays great, but I can\'t put my super heavy weapons in the super heavy slot. And all the players who two days ago were fighting two tier under me have ships now a tier above. I don\'t think this is real live gameplay.',
       'After a while playing I feel a new ship is needed. A ship that is used to support and repair team. I also think an actual alliance base would be nice to use. Assault another\'s base to gain upgrades for alliance base could be rewards. I just feel there needs to be something else to do besides a match vs other\'s. Maybe even have tactical station\'s where player\'s occupy turrets so dual pilots can occupy a ship, each with roles to fulfill.',
       'I love this game, i have been looking for a capital ship vs capital ship game for a while and this is s a great game. Its diffiuclt to level up but it is always fun. Although i am experiencing a glitch where my super heavy cruise cannon has been placed in one of my gun slots, and i cant place it back in my super heavy slot. Otherwise great game' ],

     [ 'The issue I have is when opening the game it does not load. The page is stuck on the loading page. Im playing on an android phone that is upto date with upgrades. I have uninstalled the game and reinstalled it. There are no options to upgrade so therefore i can no longer play it. Shame really as have missed it this past fortnight.',
       'Love this games . Don\'t lock up on you at all . Great game. Just started to have problems just say loading and don\'t. Please fix. Why does it say Sync loading but the game will not load now why???? As of today 2/22/18 i am having trouble with the loading again was fine now will not hold. Please fix love this game',
       'STILL SAME ISSUE!!   UNABLE TO WIN FOX GAME.  Since Feb 2018 update, when shooting the fox in a bubble (last game before new level) one of foxes cannot be eliminated.  Clear all bubbles and hit fox with same or different colour bubble and they just add on to fox bubble.  Very frustrating as cannot win and use up all lives futilely.   UPDATE:  Seemed to be fixed but happening again today.  Appreciate the support CookApps!  Was on game 735 this time.',
       'Stuck on loading page, uninstalled, reinstalled many times, lost everything I originally won. Seems others here have same problems since update. Playing on Samsung tab A10, never had probs before update, have had to finally uninstall it for good',
       'SAME PROBLEM JUST NEW DAY: Here we go again, not loading. I was on stage 3, which i finished, now it just says "loading". Now i have to start over from stage 1. This pisses me off after several tries trying to pass stage 3. Im on an Android mobile device. Please credit me some diamonds or something. This is frustrating!! UPDATE: The developer emailed me and they fixed the issue I was having. Back to my level 1175 & I rate it a 5 star. Thnx Bubble Coco!!!!',
       'I have been playing this game for a long time. It seems like the higher the level the more the game freezes. I love the game but now you can\'t control whe re the bubble will land.' ],

     [ 'Ive been in love with MtG for over 20 years and upon seeing this app its fair to say I was extatic. However I have to agree with Andre Deen, The game does not follow its own rules. I had a battle in chapter 1 where I got to take 3 moves in total, from 64 health with a lvl 25 Nissa to death in 3 moves.... Dafuq. Never would this happen.',
       'The game itself is fun. However unless I\'m doing something wrong the only way to get better cards is to purchase them. I seem to struggle most battles now with all the cards I was given I cant seem to win. If your find with pay to win/ lots of micro transactions this is a good game.',
       'Do the trainings, they are very helpful. Strategy, once you figure it out the game, is tops. Free exclusive rare if you enter referral code 19h56 - I\'ve been playing a lot so if you want a really great card, enter my code when you\'re in the activity hub!',
       'I won\'t pay another cent of real money on this app until they fix the unequal AI balance for gem matching. Bunch of scivers. Why do we have to play against AI in the first place. Aren\'t they talented enough to go for REAL Player one on one mode. So disappointed.',
       'I\'ve spent  quite a bit of time and money on this game in the past when it was challenging but fair. The game has become predictable and one sided. On average I \'ll match three the ai  matches twelve and does whatever it wants .for example the ai matches gems, cascades, it\'s ability appears and uses it in the middle of the same play? what\'s the point of getting good cards if the AI will not follow rules and do whatever it wants? I\'ve lost motivation, and others will also stop playing this game  if  changes in this area are not  carried out.',
       'I like the concept of making Magic: the Gathering into a turn based strategy game, but in turning it into a tile matching game, there are a lot of balancing issues between the pieces, or cards for the mobile game, and what they do inside of the card game made by Wizard\'s of the Coast. Mechanics are wonky, and my biggest complaint is that the game is free to play, BUT it is definitely pay to win. I get that this has been attempted to be flushed out through the ranking/tier system, but it still shows who pays to win and who casually plays. Especially when it comes to planeswalkers.' ],

     [ 'Bad physics are bad. The trucks always roll. You have to grind the first stage over and over and over and over to upgrade your truck. Even after you unlock stage 2 you can\'t get any points from it because your truck is so bad. It makes this game frustrating rather than challenging. The only way to go faster is to upgrade truck.  Not a huge fan.',
       'Great game, but one level seriously needs to be looked at. Snow: Mayhem Marathon 1 is nearly impossible to beat. It\'s 99 percent luck on that level. Fix that and I\'ll give the game 5 stars all day.',

It was in FS 16 but missing in this one. Please also add Case IH magnum CVX and quadratrac & Challenger MT900 & Big Bud 747 & 450 and MF 4790. I desperately want big bud tractors and quadratrac. I would love big bud equipment in the game.',
       'Great game. I\'d like to be able to put attachments on the front on my tractors. It would also be great to be able to make my fields bigger. There is a lot of wasted ground in the game. Over all love this app. Or if there is a way to expand my fields please someone let me know. Thanks',
       'I think that u should be able to sell the bales that u collect. Their is a lot of bales that are just being erased from the game because their is no limit to stop and no where to put them when the animals are full other then that the game is fun and time consuming. Plus it is a easy to kill some time',
       'I have purchased all the fields. And have reached a limit to purchase more vehicles. I have more than 20 lac in my accout. What do I do now? Please add some more challenges. This game has become boring for me.',
       'I love this game. I bought all the fields. What now? No more challenge. The spreaders run on the whole farm. When can we have un upgrade where we can make the fields bigger, buy additional fields, have some rain, more places to wash the farming equipment, build bridges to reduce traveling time between fields. We really need a proper upgrade on this game. Really. Why is there only 2 opsion of fertilizer spreaders. One is getting lost on the farm after filling. The other one is so big it get stuck against the equipment or trees. Please we need an update urgently',
       'Great game, more realistic tractors, harvesters and equipment than on other farming simulators. The only nuisence I find is that the ground glitches a small amount in the distance. Its easy to get used to though.' ],

     [ 'I love this game so much. The English is terrible and some of the instructions aren\'t clear but it\'s still easy enough to work out. It\'s easy enough to get good costumes (and even permanent ones) without spending any real money which is a real bonus. And it\'s a lot of fun and very addictive  I hope they do more with the couple system and maybe introduce couple dancing. And I\'d love to see more songs introduced - maybe some by Perfume.   I\'m looking forward to seeing all this game has to offer in future  But please fix the meteor boxes - they don\'t work!',
       'Great game! I started a few days ago and loved it! However, after the recent update, the flowy hair and clothes aren\'t moving anymore. I\'m bummed out about it because I love it. It\'s such a nice touch and the reason I kept the game. Aside from that issue, icons for the events are missing. I\'d still play the game but please fix it!!',
       'The best game ever!! I loved dance ♡♡ btw I would like to review something .. if can "Dance On Mode" there is also option on the left / right .. maybe there is a left-handed dancers, SAME WITH ME !! I\'M LEFT-HANDED TOO !! Because what ? You guys don\'t know feel player left-handed want to play that mode .. what else is "Master".. I just say.. if playing in the room we can set the mode, you want Amatur, Professional or Master.. but,  in Dance Festival? We can\'t set it, right?  That all review from me .. thanks :) last, I like this game very muchh !! Loved it!  Sorry english hancur.. �  Nick:  Aw ~ Kiky • UID: 20246',
       'I\'d say I love it but I despise the chat system in this game. It is intrusive and annoying. Any time that I\'m not in a dance sequence it floods my screen with blah blah blah bs.  At least offer us a chance to opt out of viewing chat. As it is I\'m close to uninstalling on these grounds alone.',
       'Honestly,  Dance On Mobile is amazing.  Controls are easy(and can also be adjusted to liking),  the graphics are delightful,  and the fashion is just gorgeous.  Rubies are fairly easy to obtain,  and the music won\'t fail to make your day.  All in all,   I believe this deserves five stars.  Oh,  and if there is any bug/problem, they are quick to respond,  as well as fix it.',
       'I LOVE this game! The character animation is amazing! The graphics are just unbelievable! ❤ Even without Vip, you get a ton of free outfits, rewards, etc! Thank you so much so giving us a chance to finally enjoy a game, even without having to buy anything!!!!! (Any Thought about Adding Couple Mode in the future?)' ],

     [ 'One of the best wwe games.. even better than immortals.. the difficulty level is always fair when competing with online rivals... gaining loot boxes is also perfect and  not very difficult... I obviously made some In app purchases so I could compete well... just wish to open a loot box and get 1 four star wrestler... things would get awesome I don\'t mind paying for it as well..',
       'So honestly i love most of this game. However, you can notice that when gathering loot chests, there is a normal wheel of fortune scenario, with a decipherable pattern. However, if you look closely the game changes the options on the wheel if you come close to getting one of the better options. So instead of getting a 4 star superstar in big bundles you will get the crappiest 2 star superstar and in others you will get 150 cash insteadof a superstar. Ita ridiculous because that means that how much ever money you spend on the game, they rig it so you cannot win the bigger items.',
       'reliance I bought a real money loot bundle which was for 76 dhs (UAE currency)but I did not get the loot cases. Also checked my loot place but nothing was there and also restarted the game but nothing was there.. Simply wasted money.so after that I deleted the game forever.also the game is having a lot of bugs like game freeze,network issue,sometime showing black screen,etc.',
       'I like the new update.the graphics of the chamber is very nice. My suggestion is that you can improve its value by adding entrance to the players or at least play their theme song after the game. I\'m tired of listening to the same music again and again. Plz do these changes as fast as possible. Thank you.',
       'Definitely a good game. Not into always writing reviews but this game calls for it. The only thing which irritates me again and again is the opening of loot cases because no matter when I click I would never get the desired character or thing as it changes the order once I click it so that I end up getting something worthless. The order doesn\'t change otherwise. So is this just in order to avoid players to gain good characters so that we have to make in app purchases ? Have given it a good rating just because of the actual excellence of the game.',

     [ 'Lost another These constant updates caused me to uninstall this. Fun game - very good game!But if it ain\'t broke don\'t fix it. I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.',
       'It\'s a fun game. If you\'re a COD player you\'ll love it. In general It does good on it\'s own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It\'s good that there\'s a grind to get them but I think it\'s a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.',
       'I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to "rent" which is an option in the game.',
       'Awesome graphics, and for what you get on a phone, it really is an amazing game. The only complaint (if you can even call it that) I have is the controls can be a little tricky as sometimes when you\'re trying to swing left or right you can accidentally change your weapon instead of swing to either side. Aside from that, tremendous gameplay, multiple modes to play, amazing graphics, really just an awesome game. Make sure you have a really good internet connection.',
       'Great game play, Great graphic, but after 1 month, I think this is another pay to win game ; the great Gun need to buy,  the Armor need to buy, almost every wining key things need to buy. But some people really like it because they have money to buy all those and "WIN" other pool guy. it is not about skill, it is about money.',
       '8/10 good game. Granted,some things can be improved like some bugs like random crashing. But overall,Good game. Nothing feels too overpowered and the vehicles feel good. The only thing I can suggest is bigger maps and the opportunity to use aircraft or maybe adding the British or Italian. But even without that this game is good.' ],

     [ 'Amazing and a unique type of game. The currency is all obtainable even as a free to play. Cool looking dragons and the movement in the game more lively than just pictures. I\'ve played many app before this and I would say that this is top 1 so far. The only problem is the game will stop and crash. I don\'t know the reason but I\'ve tried in another device and also stops working. Overall the game is magnificent and I definitely recommend it to everyone!',
       'Awesome! I really like the game. Top 5 game? Worth it! I\'ve played some similar game but this one is the best. The graphic is great and the dragons are cute. The resources are not too hard to get. The best part is the drag-skill! It\'s really different. Each dragon have their skill effect with different area form. You have to drag it right. A long way to be a master tamer. So enjoy the process!',
       'Pretty well made game afterall, all currency ingame can be obtained in fairly free and quick way. The game also offers really big help/supply for newbies. Spend a few (for me 3)days and you can already get 3 times of 11 advanced draw. Can get a little bit of grindy but not pay to win either. The flaws being some English translation error and extreme flashy visual effects, and the lack of (limited even) variety of the dragons and campaign plot.',
       'Great game.. I\'ve played all the others, but one huge problem. I keep randomly having an issue that my app acts as if there is a pop up (that never actually pops up) in the middle of battles, lagging out my game. Every 10 or so minutes the app crashes as well. It would be a great game to keep on my phone.. if it would actually stay open.',
       'It\'s a good game. I absolutely love the art style and the animation, and the dragons looks awesome. However the app keeps crashing when I look through the book of dragons, and whenever it does that it sets my home screen wallpaper back to default. It\'s getting pretty annoying :/',
       'Good games guys but the summon rate for a 5 star is too low. Im one of the top players on the server. When i do get a 5 star its one that i already have. Also the log in event is not working for the American server. Even if you pay. Its a waste cuz rates are too low. So don\'t' ],

       'Want to love this game, but it just constantly cheats!! It would be more enjoyable if you could have so many free plays per log in to just enjoy some play, like other games do. Instead you run out of gems right away after being cheated out of one or two games, which really stinks!!  I\'m not paying through the nose just to enjoy playing a game. You are too greedy and a big fat CHEAT King and it has really disappointed me, because the game would be great fun if I could actually play it!!!',

And when I had the right cards, my opponent would create a four card meld which made me loose. If that isn\'t cheating then I don\'t know what it is cause it\'s annoying how many games I play and loose because I never get the cards I need. Not to mention when I give up a card and then receive a sequence based on that card. Seriously? And how about a way to get free golden bars? No? Okay... then it\'s a no for me from now on.',

     [ 'Great time killer! Simple to play, though a few information/help would be nice for a few items, the auto sell option and the bailer so you know exactly what they do.  The developer does listen to the players and fixes things! Only true issues that I have are 1)the materials needed to build the buildings in incredibly high, not really obtainable for game play, even for someone who would play constantly',
       'So far, not bad.  Update:  gathered enough parts to repair the university and it won\'t unlock.  I emailed the developer and haven\'t heard back.  It is such a cool concept with little to no support or point.  Why gather the materials if we can\'t use them?  Plus, it took weeks to get the stuff.  Like most cool games, nothing more than a good concept.',
       'You had my attention, and now you have my money. Yes, this is a good game. However, it costs too much real money to advance this game. There are many missing pieces and too much to acquire to be able to progress. Maybe instead of making it so in depth, take it down a notch. Let people use junked cars to fix cars and sell them, if this is already an option make it easier to do so. I think this is a good game just too in depth and not enough give to make it entertaining and fun at this time.',
       'Great time killer... Love it so far and only been playing since yesterday... Already level 11 and got quite a few things however I gave 4 stars because I spent 10 diamonds on the bank which showed the stock market but didn\'t tell me it was coming soon until I paid for it... I like that this game doesn\'t make you pay real cash and gives you tokens just to win more cash, diamonds, energy etc so please don\'t ruin the game in the future and make us pay 2 play =)',
       'The game is over good. It\'s definitely fun for your car enthusiasts but I am now level 11 and I can\'t obtain "glass" to build any buildings... The game is getting boring because I can\'t move up, it\'s pretty much scrap cars and sell parts... I don\'t want to rate this game too high because I believe it still is a work in progress, but yes it\'s a good game and I would recommend it',
       'It\'s a decent concept. Good time killer for a little while. I don\'t know why all these games take energy. Just let me play the damn game. And the constantly fluctuating prices to sell the parts got old REAL QUICK! Apparently the creators of this game have never been to a salvage yard in their life.' ],

     [ 'This is a very well put together battle strategy game. Good graphics, character setup, team building and even the balance is better than average, but the whole feel of the game is pay to win. Which is a bummer because it is such a good game. If you don\'t spend cash it will take years to catch up, but you never will. I don\'t think the developers should give everything away or stop giving an edge to individuals that want to put money into the game, but the progression is painstakingly slow. It\'s fun to play, but loses that feeling of success from a good win when the next 5 opponents just destroy you, Vader emoji, because they can afford it. I will continue to play, because it is fun, but it\'s no longer a daily go to.',
       'This Game is great on every level. all of our favourite heroes and Villains are here. The Gamelay is fun and strategic. The Graphics are great. But Some Leaders come across as a little Overpowered. For the next Update I would suggest adding Kit Fisto ( unique Nadar Vebb ) and Asajj Ventress ( Unique 2 nightsister archers.)',
       'The gameplay is good and the graphics are amazing.  The biggest problem I have with this game is the matchmaking.  It\'s based off a tier  system, which makes some sense, but other players somehow in the same tier as you can have Much more powerful cards to the point where 2 foot units can take out your tank.  Balance system should take card levels into account to create a deck strength rating instead.   Makes WAY more sense.',
       'Initially this game is very fun. The issue is after you\'ve played it a bunch you realize one faction is objectively better than the other. I have downloaded this game twice after I read they changed some balancing issues. This is my second time uninstalling. The first time and Empire was just way too strong because I had the better seige weapon. Now Rebels have the better seige weapon and they\'re entirely too strong. The gameplay is well done, the balancing is frustrating.  With only two factions it\'s a little hard to balance and you can tell with the game like this.',
       'This is the best Star Wars mobile experience so far. The mix of action graphics and strategy are a real treat, and the so far the developers seem focused on making a balanced game with lots of viable characters to choose from. Even as a free-to-play player without a guild, the game is still very engaging.',
       'Game was great up til the last update, no idea what they did but it\'s unbalanced now. It\'s become a blob game (just toss as much on the map and push)  Update to response: it\'s a blob game, fun but still a blob game. Certain units are op and unbalanced. AT RT walker anyone? 3 seconds and a turret is down. Still fun, just needs balancing.' ],

     [ 'So far so good. I\'m about halfway through, and it\'s an enjoyable ride.Yes, feels inspired by The Room series, but that\'s not a bad thing. Great to play so far. However, the controls can be fiddly, where sometimes the attempt to make a found piece or tool work doesn\'t take or a tapped on clue won\'t function at certain angles. But I chalk this up to teething pains and I\'m sure the next Blue Brain game will be even more beautifully made and imaginative.',
       'Wow! At first I thought this was just a knockoff of The Room trilogy, and while it was clearly inspired by those games, it is every bit their equal. (Do I blaspheme?) Which is quite honestly a shocking achievement. Those games are classics, but this game belongs right there with them. The puzzles are challenging but logical enough that you can work through them. The graphics are top notch. Every detail has been meticulously thought out. Is it the most original concept? No. But who cares! If you love The Room, you\'ll love this too. If you don\'t love The Room, well clearly you\'ve never played it. Either way, you\'ll love this game.',
       'I finally finished the game.  Loved it.  Its the best game, best graphics, best everything I\'ve played yet. And so worth the $5. I could not put it down often.  Only a couple of small hints for the sequel...nothing big... The game is a bit dark...at times I could not see objects or places to put objects.  And when I try to roll or turn or pull a lever, or ball, whatever, the entire screen moves.  The boiler on both sides was a good example of that...try to flip those levers to fire the boiler and the whole room flips up.   But even with those issues I couldn\'t give it any less than a five.  Surely we don\'t have to wait A YEAR for the sequel!  What WILL I do in the meantime??',
       'I had this game in my wish list for the longest time because I don\'t normally buy games for my phone. But I finally bought it because it look so interesting, and I love puzzle escape games.  I loved it!! The way the controls and the feel of the game were done well and immersive. The puzzles were challenging, with out feeling like one would never get them solved.  I was so impressed with all the secret compartments and the complexity of finding the hidden objects. But the story behind it all helped drive the game along, I didn\'t get bored with it like I normally do with those kind of games.   Wish it was longer, I couldn\'t stop playing and blasted right through it!',
       'This is an excellent game after the Room sequels. I love it and find it a perfect mixture of renaissance instruments and Leonardo da Vinci\'s genious with a very delicate attention to details, aesthetism, and a feeling of bygone days. It is just like a story told by Umberto Eco and I thank the creators. I cant wait to buy anothger game offered by these genious and creative persons. Thank you very much. And the graphics are superb. However, the conquering part is a very difficult section. Wish you had made it easier. Especially for women, who are not prone to thinking about conquests + Mathematics... Thank you all in all.',
       'Insane! If you liked the room you are going to love this one! Excellent mechanics, stunning graphics,  the puzzles are not so straight forward as in the room and require imagination.  Gameplay is also much longer. Music, atmosphere, scenario, an immersive experience best played on tablet. A few glitches on the controls here and there, some puzzles not making much sense, some p.o.i. hidden in the shadows and a sudden non climaxing end is all the criticism  have to offer. True masterpiece. Well done Blue Brains. You guys lead! Hope you get enough funds to develop an even better sequel.' ],
