        "Wow! Great job on this mobile port. In addition it's also free. Download it! This might be the best mobile game I have ever played, with the best looking graphics. It's absolutely insane that this will run on my phone, but I'm not sure if I can run it on my computer. This is impressive and super fun. The controls are fine, but take some getting used to. If you added Bluetooth controller support, I would buy a controller just to play this. Good job guys  :)",
        "The gameplay is so great so far! There are stil a lot of bugs though, like mic doesn't work sometimes, aim and reloaded ui is gone, and I don't know if it's my phone but when I use 8x scope, the frame rate drops; like a lot. Hopefully the game will get fixed, and get optimized for low spec phones on a further update, oh and also a suggestion make the hud mini map a little bit big and also make the map itself hd. Anyway you guys still did a great job and thank you for this! :)",
        "I think this game is really good compared to the Xbox and PC versions of the game. It also adds a few other options for the game that aren't on the PC/Xbox version such as distance from your marker, dotted line to your marker, and it tells you how many poeple are in the plane. The aim assist really helps balance out the phone controls to keep gun fights running smooth and everything works really well. There is the occasional lag spike and stuff but the game works really well for my 2 year old Samsung  tablet.  10 out of 10 would recommend.",
        "Umm i loved this game on my pc but on mobile I belive there are some serious optimisation needed I am using a Samsung j7 prime and it can't run this game on low too. Means are you guys serious? You wrote that it works on Redmi 4a having a much less specs as compered to j7 I know its a samsung phone but we can expect a smooth experience at low setting I will change my rating once I get a smooth experience. Hope you fix it soon",
        "Nvrmind I'm starting to understand this game. It's not bad but could be a lot better. Still say u should get to keep wat u find. Unlocking is kool but should be only for better than basic gear. Just my opinion. Guns and melee weapons it's understandable to have to find them over again each game but the clothing I just don't understand y I gotta be naked unless I unlock crates to get clothes. Weird really.",
        "It is a super good game. Probably the best from all other battleground games, even fortnite. You guys should put a game mode where teams of 4 can conqure land on the map. And once a person dies they cant respond. Put checkpoints all across the map to be able to claim a section of the map. The only way to win is by eliminating every enemy or taking all the land. This mode will change the game play of pubg and will be another unique thing compared to fortnite. It is also something new and very interesting. Please take this into consideration."

        "Could be better. I dont like the fact that anyone can just waltz up to you and come in your house. There should be a setting that allows you to keep your house and sims private from other people. Also its a bit weird that if you tap on any sim without talking to them, they come into your house and do whatever they like without permission, even if you have a bad relationship with them. And it would also be nice if doors could be locked.",
        "It's fun so far! Can't wait to play more and see what else is in store! P.S. the sims, I wish they would not go off on their own and make doubles. Like if you want to make it a real life interaction type style, you should probably fix it to where the actions are more real and not computerized. I would like the option to do more with my kid sims, like more clothes options.  I also dont like the fact that when your sim retires, yoy no longer have control over them. Yhat jind of sucks. Alot...but Keep up the good work. Thanks!",
        "After playing for three days, this doesn't feel like a Sims game, some actions and interactions with objects are meanless, why do I need to use the toilet? One of the key factors of the Sims is to fill their needs, what are the needs of these Sims? It doesn't care at all if I decide to not pursuing one of the stories with friends, hobbies or career. And where are their feelings? Their aspirations? If I follow two romantic stories,  those Sims don't seem to be jealous even if I'm dating them in the same room! This is a game for the money,  not to play a simulation.",
        "PLEASE  HELP!!!!! So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning. And didn't really recovered my previous game. Love everything except for this.  P.S. i did the troubleshooting in the forum but nothing really helps.",
        "Edit: I just had my latest infant boy \"evolve\". My question is, why did you all give me a caucasian kid when my family is black? My other 2 kids are black too! I don't mind (since he's here lol) but this is odd.     I love this game! Already have 2 kiddos and a big house!",
        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much"

        "I think that this game is amazing and soo fun and adicting but the only problem that I would have rated it 4 stars is that this game only works with internet connection which saddens me because this game is my absolute fav. game I have played and I always want to play it. Keep up the amazing(A+) effort!",
        "The game is really addictive and fun. One of the best idles i've played. Good graphics and simple to play. The only problem is the poor performance. I don't know if the problem is my cellphone, but i think the game could use a little bit of an optimization.",
        "Sent email to devs over a week ago asking a question. No reply. Disappointing. Also the fact that there are no videos so unable to use the spinning wheel. Otherwise a mostly good game.",
        "Google keeps crashing. Even if you press stop it still pops ups every 10 seconds and the game takes ages to load and prestidge using an S7. Will increase stars if fixed as a good game otherwise.",
        "Lo      What the hell are you doing today and then I have to play a lot to do with the son I will call u in the garage for parkour now I'm a little Italy for you and I will call u after shcool you have a good night sleep oh I thought it would be fun with the kids and I will end you will be able to get a email from the other day but I didn't know if it would help me to get",
        "Fun game can you make things less expencive though i know it is ment to cost allot but it takes a while to get money i love the graphics and the controles my rating is a big fat five well done and keep updating us on new things!#LOVEGAME"

Not sure why that happen. Also don't like how you have a truck and the grass and or sand will slow you down. Also wish there were more color options for your vehicles. Other than that its a fun and addicting game.",

Not cool at all. Once or twice is whatever, but its happened at least a dozen times. Please fix this!!  Just dropped my rating again because its getting worse! Idk if its people cheating or what but this is ruining the game! The race rankings are a complete lottery, doesn't matter what place you come in because its gonna change... For the worse. Had it with this.",
        "Well it's ok but you are always underpowered I literally but the next 2!! Cars and I couldn't even get in 2nd place it's ridiculous I mean come on and I wasn't even up against real people it was bots. And the ramps using nitro on them is a deathtrap and the driving is Soo weird.",

Overall, good job.(Edit**) Great job on the addition of new content with the last update, however with this latest update the game will glitch. The glitch makes the ball not land and resets the game to the pitching of the ball.",
        "I liked the game before. I did pay to remove ads. The game was simple and fun. However the current update has the game broken. The ability to get new characters is a nice addition but the game at higher levels is unplayable. The game keeps resetting because the ball is hit so hard and high it goes out of the playable area even if you hit it \"perfect\" once this issue is fixed I will adjust my review",
        "Fun off the bat... But then it slows down to a brutal snails pace. It's a great concept, it just needs a lot more updates!  *Slow claps* great work on the \"updates\". I shouldn't have updates in parenthesis.. The characters are cool, leveling is also a cool touch, and a whopping 7 new bats? Killing it!..? But come on, way to go extreme overboard on the speed! All the other bad reviews cover it better. I just wanted to also sarcastically congratulate your update.",
        "pretty good game, glad they're updating it and adding in more bats. I play it when I'm waiting at the airport. the new update sped things up, made it really buggy. resets your hits at 44000 M and isn't really playable at this point, hopefully it's fixed soon",
        "Latest update totally destroyed the game. Even using the basic bat hitting it perfectly straight it takes the ball 2 seconds to fly 100,000 meters and then the game resets back to swing again. Without even getting to actually make any currency for upgrades",
        "UPDATE: Every time I hit, the game resets it's self. I hit the ball the meters get up above 80k and then the screen goes black and then I'm back at the plate.   Any upgrades coming soon? I have all the bats and am over 30,000 meters. Need some more upgrades."

        "I love the game and then when i saw that there was 3D projects i was so excited but they did not meet my expectations the controls were a little hard and the graphics were a little shady. Also there is a lot of adds i don't mind some adds but there's just so much so it would be nice if you cut down on the adds. Over all i really like the game i love that i don't need Wi-Fi to play this.",

        "Simply love it, if i may make a suggestion... how about providing an option to hide the finished works from the first tab? That way one would not have a lot of scrolling to do find a new piece to start. :) keep up the good work! 👍",
        "This game is AWESOME!!! and Everytime the game updates their app it adds more exciting options to playing the game such as creating your own pictures from your picture gallery folders or other of your downloaded photos from your picture galleries or saved photos. It's so much fun. I also find it to be a Great stress reliever for me. ThaNkS, pixel art app. I love this game, I find time each day to play... Very Relaxing 🤗🤗😀😀😉😉.",
        "Absolutely love this. The only issue I have is when I am working on a puzzle on my galaxy tab A 10.1 it blinks off if it's tilted a little the wrong way. It especially doesn't like it when it's laid down on a flat surface. I love that it's mostly free for Android users and the 3D puzzles are fun too.",
        "Great way to relax or calm down. Lots of choices without having to earn game coin to buy more that only disappoint. Mix of both easy and challenging. One thing would improve over all play and that would be an easy way to locate any missed cells at the end of a puzzle. Having to scroll through some of those detailed ones to find one or two blanks can be a real headache! Other than than i think this is the best color game I have tried! Keep up the great work!!"

        "I absolutely love this game. I make it a point to not spend money on mobile games cus they typically turn out to be a cash trap, but this was just like buying a regular video game. No adds, and even before buying the full game it doesn't shove \"buy our product\" notifications down your throat. Nintendo has always had good games and I have no doubts that I will keep playing this every day.",
        "Awesome update! Make the game worth again, when it seems Nintendo had abandoned Super Mario Run, they back and release more content for the half of the price. This is the kind of update I was waiting for, once I didn't paid the game yet, I think this could be a great time to purchase. Probably in the future they will release more content, but the price will back to 9.99, so the best time to purchase is now! Great job Nintendo, I love your games since my childhood.",
        "Was pretty short to begin with but Nintendo has supported this game well, adding additional content, even a new mode. The simplified game mechanics to fit Mario gaming on a phone work great and feel natural. The story with it's additional challenges to open new courses are fun, toad run is addictive, the remix 10 is somewhat redundant content wise but also good. I'd rather pay $10 up front than have in-game purchases, the reception to this game indicates that I'm very much in the minority on that. Great game, very fun for a quick session of Mario.",
        "Awesome and all, but you only get 4 levels for free. To go to world 2, WHY IN THE UNIVERSAL WORLD RIGHT HERE IN A CITY (lol😀) DO YOU HAVE TO BUY WORLD 2, 3, 4, 5, AND 6? TALK ABOUT A RIPOFF! 😞 (Warning to Nintendo: If you dont fix this soon, I'm deleting. Sorry!)",
        "Favorite game. It has a one time cost for full version and not a monthly fee or several different things you have to buy to enjoy it. I like the updates with the remix, and the star courses. I didnt like that there was so little to do before I bought it. I got bored quick. But was surprised by the cost, and love it after buying it. I do wish we could see our friends land and share things we don't need and give rally tickets to others.",
        "This is just proof Nintendo can make amazing games no matter the platform. All the bad reviews are people's mad you gotta pay for the game. Lol wut? It's a great time killer made  by the best gaming company in the world and you're mad it's not free? Funny. There's no IAP.  It's not pay to win. But it is the most fun 5$ will ever buy you."

Game play is fun, there aren't ads every 30 seconds, the app runs smooth, and the artistry that went into designing this game and the characters in it is absolutely flawless. Can't complain at all. Great game, I do recommend to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games.  10/10!",
        "Awesome game. Sadly motivated by profit grabbing providers. The cost to buy extra lives is astronomical. The only way to buy on a more viable basis was via the piggybank and guess what. They removed it. When I questioned this I got standard fob off bull. I questioned that and guess what no reply. A shame, it is a great addictive game. Just don't get tempted to get you wallet out..........",
        "Zainy!  I can understand the addictivity of it, however, just as I was getting into each level, surprise!, is was completed! This spoilt a bit of the fun for me.  The catchy music, oddly I never got tired of hearing... Great game!!!  This review is after my first experience of the game which I played upto level 20 before stopping.",
        "Sounds boring but I'm loving it! Sucks you right in. Starting to get a little complex (actually using some real brain power) but still very much doable and no charges as of yet and I'm up to level 10 atm. I am no gamer by any means but I'm really enjoying this.",
        "After my anti-matter laboratory had a slight malfunction and destroyed half the houses in my town I discovered that I had a lot of time on my hands. So I discovered Toon Blast. Been busy ever since! Thanks guys",
        "Awesome game! Thanks to the developers for not only making this fun, but doing it in a dignified way (i.e., no annoying ads). I love this game! It's fun, addictive, and challenging enough that it's still entertaining 500 levels in! Love it, can't say enough good things about it."

I therefore uninstall, only to find myself in no time at all missing the game...the challenge & reinstalling the app.  👍👍👍  Good job to the developers.",

Sudden barrage of loud commercials has ruined the experience. It has actually resulted in me playing less and therefore has had me watch less commercials. Go figure.",

I hope you make the main menu button apear immediately or allow you to click your back button to go to the menu of the game but other than that AMAZING game!",

Also, the speed of the ball is ridiculously inconsistent.  Sometimes you get games that are at a reasonable speed and other times it seems like the ball speed has increased an unreasonable amount to play.  Why even bother trying to load the game each time anymore?",

        "Poor quality game that wasn't tested before release! After your first death you can't land on the platform upon restarting and immediately die, the only way to have another go is to completely close the app first."

GET OUT NOW!",

And on all your other Playgendary games you release on android...  Many thx.. Me 😀😀😁😀😀😀",

It's a game...it's supposed to be fun not rocket science!! It should relax you but when you're played a level 6 or 7 times and you get down to needing1move to win... yet again... you get stressed!! And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun! I like a challenge but this is ridiculous!!!",

        "Getting green pieces gets extremely redundant. After 30 levels it's still the goal. Levels are near impossible unless you get lucky and things line up perfectly.",
        "Its a mind blowing game i cant help but to play this game my day seems not complete if i cant play the game specially when i cant pass the next level and the hardest part is the hard level the time are very fast when i am playing.i really love it and the freebies i can get everyday to boost my game.thank you creators and the makers the graphics and the animation is very realistic.",

When you win you get anywhere from 50 to 100 play money.  So you have to spend your real money to get your play money.  If you have money to spend then enjoy the game."

        "Just downloaded this app.  So far a very well executed app with excellent layout and controls/easy and fluid to use.  Much better than other Sodoku b/c no ads during actual game play!  The only \"con\" is that I cant put graphics behind gameboard. Only suggestion: Would like to see options for backgrounds like in Solitaire. This would truely make it a 5 star game!   Ps. I was not paid/reimbursed or otherwise incentivised for this review in any way.",
        "I'm addicted to this game especially the daily challenge boards. Pros: pencil feature, all instances of the number Are highlighted when you fill in a cell. Con: the timer starts when board opens, would like it to start after filling in 1st cell. As others have said the ads are right below the numbers, too easy to tap when your on a roll.",
        "I like this app, but it feels like it could be more educational. I get stuck on the expert puzzles and often have to use the hints, the way the hints just tell you the number in a selected square doesn't help me work out what I'm missing. If the hint could show me how I could reveal another number would be more helpful to me. Otherwise top notch app",
        "It's a pretty decent sudoku implementation, far better than a lot of the other ones out there I should say. The only issues I have are firstly I do find the \"penciled\" numbers to be a little on the small side (on a 5.5\" screen). I'd also say that for those of us that don't find the \"expert\" setting particularly difficult (without meaning to sound arrogant), it would be good to have a step above that. And finally a Google Play leaderboard would be a nice addition. None of these are massive problems, it's a good app as I said.",
        "Great app. I can do Sudoku on the app with the 'write' facility for numerical notes and I like how it removes them automatically as you fill in other areas. But I still find it very difficult to do paper Sudokus because I can't fill in the right answers without loads of workings out on the more challenging puzzles. The app makes this aspect easy.",
        "I would greatly prefer to start by touching a number rather than touching a cell.  I have to hunt for a cell with the number I am working with, touch that to show where all instances of that number are, then touch each cell and the number to place either the number or a note that this might be the number.  If I could select the number first, I would only have to touch each cell to place that number, then turn on \"note mode\" and touch each cell for a note.  Only half the taps per game, saving both time and the muscles in my arthritic hands!"

Can't that be possible at least for a week if one on it to her their records it shud be like that for the rest of the week. Most importantly  subway surfers consume too much data. But wen updating every month and for that reason I humbly demand that this game company provide physical cash reward for those who are consistent for us to tell others who are asking us who subway surfers help. If we tell them benefits we derive I bet u more people who are lover of games will wanna be part of subway. Trust  me....  Tnx in anticipation",

        "Great fun game. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because you go through your money pretty quick buying boosts to win levels to then upgrade your garden. I like the game a lot. Also I think that at the end of your board if you have undetonated items they should detonate at the end of that level. I've lost too many levels because of not getting one item that was next to something that was undetonated.",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "Much has improved since my original review (see below). There are special events going on quite often to help with earning coins and powerups, and the levels don't seem to be as tedious. Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

Anyway the game's good everything is cool but.. if u think u have seen an app with more adds then you know nothing download any voodoo game.. Literally after every single game over u get ads so it doesnt really matter if u tap the revive button (yeah u should u get ads regardless)",
        "Honestly, it's a really good game that mangages to pass as challenging, entertaining, addictive, and time-consuming (in my opintion) all at the same time. But, there are WAY to many ads. The game itself is great but all the ads and interuptions completely takes away from the main purpose of the game; having fun. That's pretty much the only aspect of the game that I highly suggest improving at the moment.",
        "I think the ads are fine. It acts as a breather whenever i lost a run. The gameplay is addictive and all. but.... BUGS! i hate it when i pass through 3 or more layers. And still died by stepping on dangerous tile instead of breaking it. Just had a 11k run today and died because of a stupid bug",
        "Honestly i love this game its a great way to kill time. And there's a lot of reviews on here saying how theres too many ads. Heres the simple solution to that. Don't like ads? Turn off your wifi. Ads can't play without internet.",
        "Reformat your ads. If you're gonna have one play after you lose do it exactly when you lose, not after yu've had a chance to start the next wave. Otherwise watching an ad to revive seems really dumb",
        "It's a good game that is challenging to start,  but adds nothing to keep it challenging. It just changes colors. It would be nice to have a timer,  or a high score, or something to aim to beat. Or maybe even that once you hit a section of a tear it falls away and you have to keep moving (challenge mode). I still play it,  I like it. Just wish there was something to keep it challenging."

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Love this game. My mom and I play it 24/7. It's addicting. Annnd it's a great time killer. Just like everyone else there are things that I would suggest to improve the game. Like for example the time frame for waiting on items. Crazyyyy long. Like the fish nets are like 14hrs! Could drop all the high times to half. That would be cool. But of course if you guys did that then it would be super easy to level up. And you guys would loose out on money cause there are some impatience people out there that just go ahead and buy diamonds and such. Anywho. Love the game. Please consider some of these people's suggestions. Thank you. #HayDayFan",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "Good game. I initially wrote a one star review because this game was very dependant on microtransactions but it's actually pretty fun if you have the patience. Right off the bat you have to wait upwards to 30 minutes or an hour for basic production and warming but as you grow your farm it gets easier to deal with. This definitely isn't a game you can play for, like, an hour, consecutively, which kinda sucks but it's great for the 10-20 minites you pop in now and then."

        "Something has happened.. I am currently playing the attack master event. I have attacked 20 times at least. But the metre only indicates 6 attacks. Everytime I attack I see hammers going to the metre but the number there remains the same. I would have gotten 12 million and evemln more but due to this issue I haven't. It's definitely the fault of game. Please fix it as soon as possible.",
        "Very frustrating to have to work for weeks to earn enough to build in the higher levels and have it constantly being destroyed because in three days worth of spins you only receive 2 shields... not to mention the rarity of free spins (maybe once a week) Game is an exercise in frustration and not worth the download.",
        "I am playing this game in a long time. but i have found some issue.. many time i am not get shield & someone attacked my village. How to upgrade my village. Pls tell me Moon active team & also upgrade spin 50 to 60 & also redused village manufacturar cost... Thank You.",
        "Game was running successfully but now game has stopped working in my phone all of a sudden, I have uninstalled the game and again installed but not working. My mobile handset is Motorola g5 plus and android version 7. Please help me out to resolve the issue asap.",
        "I actually liked this game but recently very glitchy/buggy. I get attacked by the same person twice within less than a min of each, same with raids. I earn for attack/raid master and the counter doesn't update. Freezes in the middle of spins. Don't earn coins for watching videos sometimes. This is even after the most recent update"

        "The game is simply awesome in a word. The mesmerizing music combined with excellent commentary makes me nostalgic to the time when FT first released Score World Goals. Playing the game is a very smooth experience, in addition to the pleasure from the quality of the graphics. There are some minor problems in gameplay, but these don't matter that much as the game excels with the idea, execution and result. And of course, it is a game where losing creates no frustration. Thanks to FT for providing us this masterpiece.",
        "Love the reduced tackling. It feels more like a high pressing Premier league match now and actually gives you a chance to stop the better teams. With the slower tackling, one missed time tackle deep in your opponents half can result in  them getting the ball all the way to your penalty box and scoring. All the while your players just hover around doing nothing. Keep the reduced tackle time!",
        "I do not like the new update where tackling recharge has been reduced. I think what it was on before was a lot better and made the game a lot more strategic as you had to time your tackles perfectly. I think reduced recharge should be something you can win in the boxes or buy with the money or gems. Another good idea could be to give the team that's just scored 20 seconds of quicker tackling on the back of the goal they have just scored. Please put it back to the normal tackling rate! I am addicted 😂😁",
        "Honestly so angry, you go on a small losing streak and end up not being able to play a game due to not having enough nomey, so I spend £10 of in app purchases thinking it will sort me out, lose once and again I can't afford to play. Don't download money snatching pile of tosh",
        "Pathetic gameplay, it has so many issues that haven't been solved with the updates. First the game lags so much, then you cant even string 2 passes together when the opponent team tackles you off the ball. Ths happens in all difficulties. Can't attack, can't defend. Player updates cost too much. Fix all of this in the next update.",
        "The fast rechargeable tackles should be removed.  The game is no fun now. Earlier I had to time my tackle perfectly so that I don't give away second balls. And same with the attack. I tried to get tackled in an area where I can win second ball. But now this fast tackle recharge has just ruined the game."

Big advantage.. And you dont HAVE to go platinum to enjoy this game, but I am considering it ! GREAT JOB !!",
        "It has a good game play as well as millions of adds which eventually ruines the game. You have to watch an add after every single mission and before starting a new mission to gain energy. So basically the energy bar is just a little trick played on us for watching advertisement. I will not recommend this game only because of the adds, otherwise it's really a good game.",
        "Do not buy Premium. You see all the locked features saying exclusive to Premium. You drop $70 for Premium only to find out the best features are still locked because now there is Premium Plus for ANOTHER $150. You are not told other than here by me that what you get when you buy Premium is a Premium-lite. You hear about Premium Plus for the first time after you have bought Premium (lite)",
        "I do liken the game. Here are my pros and cons. Great graphics, wide variety of levels, and ease of controls.  Weapons are too expensive, the game stays one step ahead of you as far as when it offers you deals on weapons. You will either not have the points or coins to purchase and then when you do it offers one level too high at your point in the game to purchase.",
        "Nice game. So far I've noticed only critical hits count. Taking out a knee or a shot to the gonads usually fails. Upgrades are like any other game, spend money to get the good stuff. Hopefully it doesn't get to the point I can't unlock the items to keep playing.",
        "Sinse last update when playing when get killed it will show score screen but spawning back to game locks up and won't play just have to watch myself lose or stop and start over losing my life??????? Please fix...... Would like to know when you are going to fix can't win for losing life and diamonds and not even getting to play!!!!!!!!!! Don't know what you have done to the game getting where it is no fun getting killed before you even get respawned"

Boosters must be given more often.",

        "The game is fun and addictive, and it also has a lot of content but unfortunately there's a bug that hasn't been fixed which is the time. Sometimes on many occasions, the level starts with the time passed like 1-3 minutes. Say I want to get 3 stars in a level by finishing it under 2 minutes and 30 seconds. When I start it, immediately one minute and a half are past without me doing anything and I have to restart the level to get it to zero. Sometimes I forget and end up finishing the level with 2 stars because of that bug and having to restart the level once again. I appreciate your support and offering the game for free but don't forget to get a fix for this bug, please. Thanks 🌹",
        "I enjoyed that it is challenging but still easy enough to feel like it's not impossible. However, there is at least one ad before every level, and sometimes 2-3 ads will come up for each level and this will probably be the reason I end up deleting it.",
        "Fun addictive love it the music the side effects all of it even my six year old daughter likes this game it's fun it's challenging for her it's not your typical solitaire and she's only 6 years old and already she loves it the higher the level the more she said Love's to figure it out great game wonderful brain game for small children teaching strategies great job guys two thumbs way up",
        "Impossible to enjoy game play due to excessively intrusive advertising.  One can't even shuffle without being forced to watch another ad. Banner ads, long boring ads between each level, jammed into players brains (so the developers wish).  I am immune to advertising and simply tune it all out. My only reaction being to UNINSTALL this otherwise enjoyable game and warn others about it's predatory intent.",

If you can please add the feature of talking to enemies when they get near. Or maybe let us chose our squad members (as many of them don't use voice chat)",
        "i was very addictated to this game until the last update. i can't even log in to the game, it said \"network error\", but my network is fine tho. i tried deleting data and reinstalling the game but nothing happened. once i can log in to the game, i can't even play normal matches. and my friendlist is gone wheter it's in game friends or platform friends. hope these problems will be fixed, i really love this game tho, i wanna play it soon :(",

It's designed very well, the map is great, everything about it is great. However, i was talking in discord with some people and they said that they couldn't play ranked. I launched the app, and i saw that i could not play it either. I hope this gets fixed soon, good luck! Edit: I can now play ranked mode, 5 stars",
        "I like the game graphic after update BUT please fix the ranked mode  . It says\"invalid season\"  and cant open it. I will give 5 stars after its fixed.   Also it would be  great if you add chat and in-game commands with next updates.  I still like this gamee so much",
        "I rated this game five stars and then  I got region locked in an European server.

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",
        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money.",
        "The game is great but customer service is non- existent. I bought the 30 day gem special that was supposed to come with an egg and fountain. Got the gems (so far)but not the extra items. Tried contacting customer support several times but following their M.O., they never respond."

Make an option to use those gems for shots instead of real cash would be nice but still earned 5 stars. Samsung galaxy note 8",
        "I think everything is fantastic about the game, but after this last update. The loading time is 20x slower if it loads at all. Galaxy phone. I can't leave message with development so this is the best I can do about that. But I love the game and this wouldn't change my activity amount at all. Keep up the great work development and look forward to new games in the future.",
        "Best game i played ever. But new update have some bugs like if we going to play with friends it take too much time for loading nd mostly notification pop up that there is an error your coins refunded in your account. Kindly resolve this issue. Except this best game 👍",
        "So I have no idea why I am always at a club disadvantage. My driver is level 5 and always vs a person with level 7 or 8. Why do I never go against level 3 drivers. Always vs higher clubs! ALL THE TIME! you might as well give them the win. Losing me as a customer because there is something very lopsided.",
        "Game sucks donkey *****. You play maybe 10 beginner holes and get chests that open in 12 seconds. THEN you play a normal hole and get a chest that doesn't open for 4hrs. You only get four chest slots so that means you can only win four holes then you have to wait 4hrs (or 8 or 12hrs depending on the chest you choose to open) before you can get anything for winning a hole. In two days, I haven't even played 18 holes. Guess you gotta have money if you wanna play. Thought I trusted the \"Editors Choice\" games, guess not.",
        "Love the game, but its not perfect. You could make the textures better and add more detail in each level bc right now they look empty. Also matchmaking is garbadge, and I get matched against people with much higher trophy counts and far better clubs... Fix this bs please."

        "I actually like the game, but I got all the guys in 3 days.... Now what? There are no upgrades or any other options to use the money on. Also the same thing is happening as others said, where the browser keeps popping up saying there is a virus. Pretty annoying",
        "Fun game, very entertaining. Ads pop up too often, it opens my browser saying i have a virus. I cant avoid it and it happens very often. Im only keeping the app bc i hope the next update fixes this issue. Other than the stupid pop up its a great game and i enjoy it. Please fix it so i dont have to uninstall.",
        "I wanted to enjoy this game. The advertisements randomly open chrome browser windows with a fake virus scan saying \"your device is infected.\" Its ironic in that the software that you're prompted to download is terrible adware that an actual scanner might flag.  It's quite persistent too, happening only after I installed this. 30 second video ads midgsme and adbars that just so happen to pop up and hover where you have to click in-game.",
        "I love the game as a whole, and I just barely redownloaded it and it saved my progress, but I can't even get through one whole throw without it opening up chrome with a fake survey or whatever. I'm not joking, it's really bad. That's why I can't give this a good rating. I understand the need for ads in a free game, but for whatever reason, mine is nothing but ads.",
        "I did not play this game for a long time. I download it and I only played it for maybe 2 hours. I tried to play, but when I  was in the middle of the game and it froze and sent me back to my home screen. The controls I like. This is not the greatest game I have seen, but It's ok😐😐😞😞"

The game uses a lot of memory, and I had to uninstall it from my tablet because it kept making it crash.  Works on my phone, but it's still a lot of memory.",
        "Love this game!! I love the challenge with completing levels. There's days I can't get enough of this game. I play every day. I love decorating my tanks. I love when I get infinite time, but It would be nice if we had control over when to use it or the time would stop and be saved for when we return. Sometimes 6 hours is impossible to sit there and just play. One thing that would be nice is if we didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life to renew and could have more friends to  receive more lives and got to use the diamonds we earned amd not be stored in a bank to buy. Other than that I cant complain😉 best game out there and I highly recommend it to all ages.",
        "It's a great game. I play it with my daughter on our freetime it's quite addictive. Its great that you get rewards if you have to watch the movies. The only thing i would change is the reloding of the lives. Half an hour for one life is too long. Every so often you get a few free hours, but you need to have free time to play.I love the fact that we can play using my phone sideways (landscape ) as I have a problem with my wrist. I highly recommend it!",
        "Fishdom is a fun game.  The puzzles are challenging. I would love to see a change to the gifts we can give our neighbors . Such as, the lightening, or fireworks, or an ornament for their aquarium. I would also like to see the diamonds we earn to be available, not stuck in a bank, to be paid for.  Limits could be put on it, of course, but the free one here and there only help once in any puzzle sequence.   Overall, though, its a nice game.",
        "I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one's tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don't earn anything for more decorations and it doesn't get dirty and the fish don't get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.",
        "Got a new tablet for Xmas.   Had game on sd card. Wouldn't transfer to new tablet.  Was on level 105.  Have to start all over again! TORTURE lol. Other games I would just stop but not this one.  I love It!  EDIT...STILL LOVE THIS GAME.  Highly reccommend it!  Some levels are SO difficult but still loving this game Oct 9/17.  DEC 2017.  Still adore this game.  Now my husband plays too.  Best game EVER!"

What is a difference if I buy better worker or he evolve? Maybe to include waiting for raw material after order? Include different sizes of workshops? I have some other ideas as well",
        "This game is really well done. The tutorial teaches you everything you need to know. Its an amazing game and its very fun for killing time. As a machinist my self I like the aspects it puts into play. So good job to the developers its a great game.",
        "What you see is it. Very simple game. Very simple practice. Just s classic build up your base, buy more expensive stuff to make you more money. I don't recommend to download it because of gameplay but because of it's amazing sound track. I LOVE LOVE the techno one that has a very short guitar rift in there. It's music is probably the best for a mobile game and definitely worthy of being a big mainstream soundtrack.  I read some of the reviews. A lot of these people probably aren't smart enough to pour piss out of a boot let alone operate their phone. There is a simple tutorial and even then it's easy to operate. It's not hard to make money like some people it is. Don't spend all your money at once, dumbass.",
        "Irony, factory efficiency game with no automation, zero, none. If you want automation pay $$$. If you want more in game coins pay $$$ so if you cant afford automation and you cant afford currency games done for you. Cant make your own premium currency without paying either. Just a free demo app at this point.",
        "I like the game just wish it was not over priced  There is a machine that will cost me 4000 gold and if i was to buy it cost me 80 bucks real cash to get it with only 1000 left over thats crazy high it be nice to have flash sales that would make more money for the game but also would be nice to have a cash or gold option when buying  The new machines and it be nice if some  Machines you buy will produce gold without spending cash  On the machines that will. lowering the price would be a big plus and a lot more people would be willing to buy cuz my saying is a fast dime is better then a slow Dollar so if they was to lower price they would make a lot more money faster just my opinion and it would be cool if you could do customization to work uniform and do a little bit of customization in the game just my thought on it",

The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn't make it better at controlling. I don't know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌",
        "this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It's so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It's just so addicting and I can't get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the 'play online' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊",
        "This is better than the browser version for multiple reasons. 1) It doesn't lag as much. I played a few rounds a noticed a little bit of lag, but it's better than the browser version.  2) You can play against AI if you don't want to play against people. I like this because I actually had a chance to win and was able to kill some. 3) You can create your own custom skin, which is awesome. All of this is free as well. I love this version of Slither.io.",
        "So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I'll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It's in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I've ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍",
        "Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃",
        "The controlls are pretty bad considering how simple they are.  The lag is unbearable. Fix those and you've got a 5star game all day. Simple fun pick up and put down time killer. In fact the lag is such an issue however, the game is getting uninstalled. You can't play a reaction based game when the lag has you 6 seconds behind whats going on."

First adds would take forever to play then they wouldn't play at all and it would freeze up till you closed it out then my whole phone froze up has NEVER happend before. I UNINSTALLED this game and my phone is back to normal. Not worth screwing up your phone. It's a bit fun but there are other games out there.",
        "Game is fun, but it crashed (Samsung Galaxy S7) and lost all progress. Now had to start again (which is not such a big problem), but then the game glitches and I don't get anything for leveling. Meaning I can't get past car level 4 anymore, because there are simply not enough parking spaces. Will give 5 stars if this gets fixed.",

And now it's take me to spam pop ups. Ugh. Gave it  another try anf This one still has potential...but for now it's getting deleted again.",

        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",
        "I loved this game very much, I had a lot of really nice things and invested nearly $60 dollars into making my guys 5 stars and diamonds and other level up promos... I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine..",
        "This game is all pay to play. You can't compete without dumping a bunch of money into it. So like an idiot I put some money into the game and sure enough. It matched me with guys 10 times stronger then me. There's no winning unless you plan to put a lot of money into it. Which I will not be doing. Uninstalling"

Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn't get a key.",
        "Good little time waster, simple classic gameplay but puts its own unique twist on it.   Side note: I clearly played this game more than they thought anyone would as I have started getting repeated designs when I upgrade my spells xD",
        "It stopped working on my One plus! Help! I was excited about the side games! *********************************** Excellent, addictive fun. I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn't level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can't progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.",
        "All in all it is a really great game there are very few ads, its fun, the graphics are crisp. Its amazing except for one thing. On one of the levels all of the monsters have exactly 666 health and im not religious or anything but I'm pretty sure that if some one who is religious see's that, well lets just say that it might not be good for the company, so I suggest you fix this.  Thanks.",
        "Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion.",
        "Fun game but takes forever to get gold to upgrade. The cost to pay for the gems to buy so you can buy gold is really expensive. Not much dynamic to the game. Same stuff on each level just takes longer to bet enemies cause of higher HP."

        "Awesome Game!! Really I like this game. I dont even have words to describe it. Totally Fantastic... Whatever you say, this is totally cool. But I have a request...please add a column of legendary bikes. Like there is Common, Rares, Epics, and Specials , there should be a column of legendary. Waiting eagerly for the next update. Thanks a lot of making this fabulous game. And I would also like to appreciate the colours and graphics of this game. Thanks to the team for making this game. I advice this game to those who are looking for cool new games. Please install it and have FUN!!!! Dont just look at the pics, install and you'll be amazed.",
        "Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death",
        "Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won't register your flips. These aren't huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.",
        "Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I'll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.",
        "Way much room to improve                                 So first you could get more bikes in there and add more levels and make the resolution better like 1080 or something add more achievements and more of those levels that you get when you are just playing that game outside of the levels. But other wise great stuff great stuff keep it up. Also some missions are impossible, unless as someone else's comment said you play 16 hours a day",
        "This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can't seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn't be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it's not something you have to add, it's just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven't seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it's an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘"

        "A great app to download. Great format and graphics. Lots of fun and challenging. Rated everything 5 star other than gameplay. It's good but not great due to the water hazard or out of bounds shots.  Players can hit into the water yet still finish on par. Water hazard should automatically be 2 shots. If this gets changed it would be 5 star no doubt and best golf app.  Single mode would be fantastic to practise",
        "OK I really love this game but all if a sudden I can't play it anymore. I try to set up a match and it just hangs in the loading screen then boots me to the main menu. I have sent 2 emails to support within almost a week and more than 48 hours apart. I have not received any responses. Other than that it is a great game and for the time I was able to play I enjoyed it very much and hope to receive assistance in this matter soon so I can continue to play this wonderful game.",
        "I had to change my rating for this game because I seriously believe it is rigged for me to stop advancing. Everything was great until I made it to pro level and now I'm noticing that whenever I am tied with another player with gems, an extra gem magically appears in the hole making me lose that round. How is it possible that I made it to pro level winning a good percentage of games and now I have played at least 50 rounds on level 3 and can't win a single one?",
        "To many play just to attack your ball after you hit. Regardless if they don't play well they win. A bit eh. The way it's done barely allows you to win. I agree with many others reviews. Something fishy about the scoring system and who you are placed against. Won't keep long if it continues. Could be awesome if it wasn't unfair. O.o",
        "This game is ok at best. More about luck then skill. Fun and addictive, yes at times. Ive collected all the trophies from 3 of the maps and was on a roll. Then out of nowhere a 15 game lose streak. You will get to the point past anger. There are a lot of pretty good/lucky players from around the world.",
        "Overall, game quality is pretty solid. Few graphic glitches here and there but can be expected. It would be nice to rotate to see a better perspective and easier to hit.   One must improvement needed is that when you play a bot, it's way too noticable. You need to improve the bot intelligence! I understand why bots would be needed time to time.  Coins could be cheaper too.  EDIT: Game froze on a Pixel XL, cost me lots of coins! Not happy."

        "I don't write reviews on games , but this one is impressive. Once I tweaked the settings the graphics became amazing, love that there is NO wait time for upgrades ! You buy it, you own it . Big advantage.. And you dont HAVE to go platinum to enjoy this game, but I am considering it ! GREAT JOB !!",
        "It has a good game play as well as millions of adds which eventually ruines the game. You have to watch an add after every single mission and before starting a new mission to gain energy. So basically the energy bar is just a little trick played on us for watching advertisement. I will not recommend this game only because of the adds, otherwise it's really a good game.",
        "Do not buy Premium. You see all the locked features saying exclusive to Premium. You drop $70 for Premium only to find out the best features are still locked because now there is Premium Plus for ANOTHER $150. You are not told other than here by me that what you get when you buy Premium is a Premium-lite. You hear about Premium Plus for the first time after you have bought Premium (lite)",
        "I do liken the game. Here are my pros and cons. Great graphics, wide variety of levels, and ease of controls.  Weapons are too expensive, the game stays one step ahead of you as far as when it offers you deals on weapons. You will either not have the points or coins to purchase and then when you do it offers one level too high at your point in the game to purchase.",
        "Nice game. So far I've noticed only critical hits count. Taking out a knee or a shot to the gonads usually fails. Upgrades are like any other game, spend money to get the good stuff. Hopefully it doesn't get to the point I can't unlock the items to keep playing.",
        "Sinse last update when playing when get killed it will show score screen but spawning back to game locks up and won't play just have to watch myself lose or stop and start over losing my life??????? Please fix...... Would like to know when you are going to fix can't win for losing life and diamonds and not even getting to play!!!!!!!!!! Don't know what you have done to the game getting where it is no fun getting killed before you even get respawned"

I got 1 dojo and 3 blades from daily challenge after that I played 15 days continueosly but I got only 5000 star fruit but no blades or dojos. Please solve this problem I really want to give 5 stars for this awesome game. 😞😞😢😢😩😩",

        "Would have given 5 stars but ads are so annoying and far to frequent. I'd accept ads maybe every 5 games but theres an ad after every game and it's a good 30 second ad everytime."

        "Its a really good game but they should make it a bit easier. They should have a thing where they ask your age so that they can determine the hardness of the level. But good game I would try it. One question for RobTop games, though, what is with the \"buy full version\" how is there a full version. Reply to me robtop. I need to know. Not sure about it but worth a try and see if you like it. # Amsam production review.",
        "This game is fun and great but there are too many advertisements and always make me feel annoyed by that. Please fix this and I will rate 4 or if it is better,5.  it was 2015 when i said this. now it is 2018. NO CHANGE. all the ads were still there!!!!! so everytime i want to try again, AN AD WILL POP UP AND BRING ME TO THE PLAY STORE AGAIN.",
        "Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it's fun because it's challenging and there's super fun things in GD except hacking because that's no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I'm super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂",
        "Well, I admit, I'm addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn't be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can't Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍",
        "The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won't annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie",
        "It's a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it's super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star."

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pokémon and I intend to play Pokémon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "Pokemon Go is a pioneer into the world of AR. This game was a hit despite its incomplete composition, and this is why many people left. However, the game now is more complete with features such as raiding with others and dynamic weather. If you are looking for something new on the move, give it a try! Or if you left after launch, give the game another try and see how the game has updated over time. This game is recommended for suburban/urban players, as in-game features such as pokestops are not abundant. This game is still very buggy so patience is required. Thanks for reading!",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "It runs quite smooth and gives me an extra reason to get out and exercise. My only beaf now is that it is impossible to acquire any of the legendaries. If you live in a small rural town you will never have the numbers to take on anything beyond 3 star in raids. Everything else is awesome though."

        "Someone needs to be fired or at least schooled on currency exchange rates. They offer 2 packs for 5 and 20 then except for rare sales which offer 49 and 79 dollar packs everything is 100 dollars google should step in and pull this game off the google play market for a square enix licensed product they have enough backing to have actual microtransactions not be a game exclusive to rich people who use 100 dollar bills as toilet paper...",
        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15",
        "I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my \"family\"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we're like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I'm from Michigan,we're both married ,but there's nothing I wouldn't do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!! Lifelong friends/family!!! 💜"

Make everyone happy that way. :,( Will be uninstalling this now.",

        "Simple (which I like) puzzle game, yet gets really challenging in strategy thinking as it progresses, which is good if you want a challenge and aren't already mentally tired from work, etc. Easy on the eyes and has really pleasant nature theme on the edges with a bird song loop. Hardly noticed any ads, which was also really nice. One of the BEST free games to take your mind off things!"

        "This game has been great to me forever, and I never had a complaint but this recent update has driven me here. The trophy cap is a real kick in the nuts and ruins the game for casual gamers like me. You now HAVE to advance through the games prestige system and keep resetting all your work just to help out a gang. And if you are in a strict gang like I am, they require 100 trophies a day. If I keep advancing, I won't be able to keep up with that. This is all a money grab by zepto now. They want you to have to pay to keep your machines strong so you can compete.",
        "I love this game. I have been playing it for a very long time. I play it every single day. I like the new updates however it seems you are getting away from the original game and focusing more on ultimate machines. Increasing the prestige levels was awesome but you need to also add additional upgrades with them as well. I have over 100 paw upgrades that are completely useless to me at the moment.",
        "Look this was a great game, worthy of it's previous accolades. Sadly since then it's been progressively ruined by an ever more aggressively enforced attempt to move to a pay to win model. Previously you could achieve anything in the game with a bit of hard work, then they tweaked it and you could achieve anything with a bit of hard work and team work. Sadly though what's happened is soft paywalls have been introduced, things you can't outright buy, but will only manage with financial outlay and change after change is being introduced with new soft paywalls and new ways to try and cash grab. The game is on a steady but rapid downward decline and to any new players I would avoid picking it up and investing your time in it now.",
        "Great game, easy to play and a good time waster. One thing I would like to see in a future update  is a scroll bar for the parts in your garage. It would make it a lot easier than swiping through them, especially for those who have a lot of spare parts like myself. Other than that, awesome game.",
        "This game sucks. First it is really hard to get good equipment. Then it is also very laggy. Everytime im playing the game it freezes right when im doing something. (Mainly when im customizing my car). Think about it when you are getting ths game to take up storage. If you'll excuse me now I've got a game to delete.",
        "I had a bad day but this game fixed it,... Well enough. I've bin looking for a good game to play for a couple months now but until, like 2 days ago nothing had shown its self to me or caught my interest! This game is 11/10 to me! For probably about the next two month!"

        "I will consider rating the game five stars if you can add new levels and lines, but the \"hearts\" feature forces me to watch ads, even though I paid to remove ads. I will give the game five stars if you gracefully remove the \"hearts\" feature. I'm asking CM a question: \"Will you please change the game back to the original way we played it? And add new levels? 'The Easter' would be creative, and the diamonds can be eggs. How about an Easter Bunny line? I like all the new levels, and the new lines we can unlock. Can you add more remixes to the levels? There are only 3 existing remixes, if CM had forgotten.\"",
        "I originally had it as 5 stars, but I noticed the longer that I've had the game, the more bugs I'm starting to see. Sometimes the music won't line up with the levels, which is the point of the game, and other times the game won't register my touch and will screw up my progress. If this gets fixed that would be great, and I'd move the rating back to 5 stars!",
        "I really wish you guys didn't update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can't listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!",
        "Amazing game... Loved it...😍 The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it'll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it's okay 😊",
        "The game starts off really strongly and the concept is unique and the music is fabulous.. but later on things get so progressively difficult it makes flappy bird look like a piece of cake... And in the later on levels there's not much sync between the music and the cube it's really hard to play... I enjoyed it initially but now I'm just going to uninstall it...",
        "This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn't as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn't there but now it's forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads."

        "This game is awesome and I love playing it. Im trying to build a massive farm in the village. Great time killer and addictive.You can build anything. The down side is though, that if youre building an enclosed area, the villagers get in and you have to wait for them to get out so you   can close it.",
        "You shouldn't have a certain amount of blocks. Also you shouldent have to unlock everything except for the basic packs. The way you have to jump I am not a fan of I wish it was on the other side. Lastly is it would be nice to have doors,so the viligers couldn't get into your house. One more thing is I wish you didn't have all of these assignments to do to get money and diamonds.",
        "It's a okay game. Dumb thing though is you cannot craft blocks... you will need 10,000's stone brick and only get 150 every few hours. Developers and support staff are useless. You will have to spend money.",
        "This game is amazing. It wastes your spare time which is great. Just one problem. The blocks go down too quickly can you make it so the blocks dont go down?  Thank you!",
        "I love this game. When my sister downloaded it on her iPad i was sooo addicted to it and now i am downloading it on my own phone!!!! I really recommend to try it at least for once. If you will do so you will not be able to delete it easily beacuse you will be addicted!!!!!",
        "Remove the villagers plz i hate that they keep coming into the house i build and dont leave i have built 10 houses for me and they just keep coming in and its really inoying"

        "Like so many other games like this out there it is\"pay to win\". This is nearly every \"free\" mobile game it there now. So why the 5 stars? A few reasons. A big one being that they do make the super currency accessible without paying via offers. Many of which rewards higher amount than what someone would come to expect just for making it a fair ways into other games.  Second is that the levelling system is fair and no content is truly locked for those who don't pay. It will just take you a little longer to get what you want if you don't but it won't be excluding you from the best content.   As for the game itself is alright. You collect heroes and you can engage in a variety of activities. From a campaign mode and it's associated elite version to random dungeons to guild wars, pvp, and a gauntlet. Overall you can kill however much time you want on this game. Once you start attaining higher levels you will find it easier to spend more and more time on content.  Finally as always I strongly recommend doing a Google search too learn best strategies.",

        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget.",
        "I wish rating took into account the design assignment. People design completely different styles than the description and as long as they design in black and white or a neutral palette it will win votes over a design that is actually following the instructions. Contemporary design beats Mediterranean or Eclectic every time. There's no point in even entering those contests because people who do a contemporary design will cancel your design out."

        "This is the best of its kind for mobile, and one of the best overall. The graphics and UI are nice and stylish, the controls are great, the gameplay is solid and it's generally just very fun to play. However, the game has some optimization issues. When you minimize it, it disconnects, and if you wait long enough it shuts down the entire game. I get that it was made like this to reduce background data, but come on, not everybody stays in the game all the time. It also takes longer than most games to connect. These are minor issues, but it would be great to see them fixed.",
        "This game works good but the reason I gave it 2 stars is whenever I click on ranked games it shows leaver penalty and the time to wait is shown 00:00:00:00. After waiting for so many days,it is always showing like this and not allowing me to play ranked games.Hope you would look into this.",
        "developer, i used to keep on playing cuz its very very fun but idk why recently when i click on connect via google play it shows connecting after that nth changes. i DONT want the ops acc i WANT my usual account back. the name of my usual account is   -FiReRY-  and the clan name is DeNY. pls pls pls pls pls help me get that account of mine back. i worked v hard for it n i have almost all the skins n i seriously like all of them v much. Many thanks.",
        "This is the best First Person Shooter available on Android. The only game that's not pay-to-win. Ok I give you that this game is great, but damned login issues are the reason for 3 stars. I just can't LOGIN with google play. It's like the game decides when I can login and play coz sometimes I am able to login. REST OF THE TIME IT SAYS PLAYING AS GUEST. FU!CKING FIX THIS LOGIN ISSUE!!!!",
        "Well they still have to grow but I think it's op. As I play a lot of CS:Go (not sponsoring)  then I thought this could help me because my PC stopped working.. Anyways graphics aren't great but good.. They aren't clean. Oh and last before I end this comment- when you complete offer for credits it doesn't give you the credits.. That's sad..  So yeah.. Just keep it up!! 👍👍"

        "Just downloaded this app.  So far a very well executed app with excellent layout and controls/easy and fluid to use.  Much better than other Sodoku b/c no ads during actual game play!  The only \"con\" is that I cant put graphics behind gameboard. Only suggestion: Would like to see options for backgrounds like in Solitaire. This would truely make it a 5 star game!   Ps. I was not paid/reimbursed or otherwise incentivised for this review in any way.",
        "I'm addicted to this game especially the daily challenge boards. Pros: pencil feature, all instances of the number Are highlighted when you fill in a cell. Con: the timer starts when board opens, would like it to start after filling in 1st cell. As others have said the ads are right below the numbers, too easy to tap when your on a roll.",
        "I like this app, but it feels like it could be more educational. I get stuck on the expert puzzles and often have to use the hints, the way the hints just tell you the number in a selected square doesn't help me work out what I'm missing. If the hint could show me how I could reveal another number would be more helpful to me. Otherwise top notch app",
        "It's a pretty decent sudoku implementation, far better than a lot of the other ones out there I should say. The only issues I have are firstly I do find the \"penciled\" numbers to be a little on the small side (on a 5.5\" screen). I'd also say that for those of us that don't find the \"expert\" setting particularly difficult (without meaning to sound arrogant), it would be good to have a step above that. And finally a Google Play leaderboard would be a nice addition. None of these are massive problems, it's a good app as I said.",
        "Great app. I can do Sudoku on the app with the 'write' facility for numerical notes and I like how it removes them automatically as you fill in other areas. But I still find it very difficult to do paper Sudokus because I can't fill in the right answers without loads of workings out on the more challenging puzzles. The app makes this aspect easy.",
        "I would greatly prefer to start by touching a number rather than touching a cell.  I have to hunt for a cell with the number I am working with, touch that to show where all instances of that number are, then touch each cell and the number to place either the number or a note that this might be the number.  If I could select the number first, I would only have to touch each cell to place that number, then turn on \"note mode\" and touch each cell for a note.  Only half the taps per game, saving both time and the muscles in my arthritic hands!"

        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",
        "I loved this game very much, I had a lot of really nice things and invested nearly $60 dollars into making my guys 5 stars and diamonds and other level up promos... I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine..",
        "This game is all pay to play. You can't compete without dumping a bunch of money into it. So like an idiot I put some money into the game and sure enough. It matched me with guys 10 times stronger then me. There's no winning unless you plan to put a lot of money into it. Which I will not be doing. Uninstalling"

        "Oh my gosh. This game is one of the best. It literally like a normal school. You jave schedules. You can do ballet class, hip hop class, latina class and finally jazz class. You can go to diffrent places to get outfit,makeup and hair done. They actually give you a report card with all your classsess and grade. You can peform in front of an audience and you can battle people at the battle arena. Finally my favorite part of this game BOY DRAMA AND GIRL DRAMA it's amazing. DOWNLOAD THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!",
        "I love the quality of the game. Great time killer.Brings out my inner Ballerina lol. Easy, Fun.Game The only thing so far i dont like is wadrobe. For example If your swiching btwn classess its hard to complety take off i.e jacket, tights or pants from previous classes. If u pick certain outfits there stuck on you. Please fix. Other then that good game.",
        "I'm not much of a dance gamer but I love simulation games. This one in particular is very innovative with their design and gameplay. I was skeptical of how I was going to like it at first but it proved me wrong and I immediately took to it. The controls are easy to learn and I don't even mind all of the ads. Honestly, a really great game.",
        "I love this game! It is really fun and if you like dancing then this is the one for you! Personally I like gymnastics more but that's because I've come a long way in it. The only thing that you could change is the amount of ads are! There are so many of them! But over all this game is great! 😉😉",
        "Honestly, one of the best games that I ever played. Dont care much for the ads. Just turn off your data and none of the ads will come out😉 But just like what the other reviewers are saying, the option to choose and take off certain clothes are limited. But other than that, great game.",
        "This game is actually good. The biggest downside is that there's A LOT OF ADVERTISEMENT to watch during playing. I know this is a free game, but c'mon! Waiting and watching minutes of the advertisement is longer than playing the game itself. Not to mention the conversation between characters in the game also took too long to wait and there's some things need to use real money before it can be explored.  This kind of game supposed to be fun and gives the cha cha feeling, but instead I get frustrated of waiting for the advertisement to finish before I can continue playing.  Out of all that, this game is great."

VEARN App is Iegit one which allows earning points just by doing simple tasks like watch advertises,videos and so on. Then you can exchange your points for PYAPAL/PATYM/Gift Cards and there're various options to choose from. Also \"VADZ\" App is perfect for anyone in anywhere who has free time and doesn't wana waste it, you can use it while working,travelling.. simply earning by watching advertisements,videos..",
        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "This game needs balance. Seems like all one does is hide behind shields and gather resources and hope higher might players harvest you for your resources. There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players",
        "1 l. no more free heroes added,always add paid heroes. 2. no more free castle skin,need topup to upgrade castle skin 3. all latest event just for them who buy something in the shop , no free spin like 1 years ago",
        "The game is good but very expensive.  There is not much scope for a free to play players.  Paid players will keep burning you all the time unless you spend money to be able to survive.   However,  the most annoying thing is that the game has become too crowded. IGG needs to make new servers and there should be limit for the maximum number of players in any particular server.  It is really difficult to survive even for paid players with so many castles everywhere in the map.  You don't get enough tiles to farm and nowhere to hide.  I give a 5 star rating if IGG works toward this problem. Thanks.",
        "I Don't normally play war games or any pvp games, but this has so much more than just pvp and war, or those build it and wait games! There's basically games within your castle that you can play while you're waiting  to build stuff and so much more!"

        "The ads in this game made it unplayable. I used to love this game and I downloaded it to try playing again and I would get minute and a half ads after every third attempt at a level. It felt like nearly every time I failed a level it would ask me if the level was too hard and I needed a hint. This game is incredibly obnoxious to play with ads on",
        "Well i would give this five stars but you cant watch an add to get a power up! And you should lower the ad mount of adds i cant go in for 10 seconds without an add popping up!! Overall good great game",
        "Way too many ads after every time I lose or go onto another level an advert pops up. Verry annoying. But the gameplay is decent.",
        "Look, I understand that you have to make money somehow, and ads are how you make money on a free game. But these ads are way too frequent and obnoxious. I listen to podcasts while playing games and every minute or so my sound cuts out completely to prioritize the ad. Earn the ad by giving me a decent amount of playtime before it and stop overriding my audio.",
        "I like the game itself but when you have 3 adds coming up after one game you hardly can enjoy the game. Super annoying, so if you download it for free be prepared to buy it otherwise it will drive you crazy!"

Why have a cloud save or play the game or spend moo pney when it's erased. I still love the game but now frustrated I will think about uninstalling.",
        "The puzzles are interesting, the animations are generally enjoyable. It quickly becomes a grind, though, where you aren't enjoying the gameplay, you're just trying to get past the timewasters of the daily challenge, or fighting the arbitrary points of the arena. The clan battles and Mighty Eagle challenge are the best parts, but you can't play them all the time. You have to grind away in the Arena.",
        "I just purchased a new phone. And being I'm using the same e-mail address i would have thought it would have started me at the same level I had been on prior to the new phone. Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "GAH! They've over complicated this game with unnecessary graphics and gifts and prizes etc. I couldn't even figure out how to get into the levels for a while haha. I'm sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn't want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn't change it. Uninstalled after 1 day.",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download."

Other than that its all good and gives plenty of chances to keep trying for your current objectives. Which is by all means what anyone would love to have with this kind of hit and miss game.",
        "I had it installed on my iPad years ago when it first came out. Enjoyed it then and I'm enjoying my return to it. You can see the refinements made and all the neat little additions. Great free game to kill some time!",
        "Hey, this is great. But it is really hard to get red rings and you can almost never get new characters. So, for example, to make it better u can do like 3000 regular rings instead of 30 red rings. That would really help",
        "I like the game but it's way too hard to get rings and you can't ever get the carachter in the daily spin wheel, make it so there are a lot more red rings to collect and I WILL rate five 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟s",
        "I'm back in the game once more, as I'm still ripping my friends apart on this game, bet no one else can my NEW high score now! Although I have a lot to catch up on this game."

        "Awesome Game!! Really I like this game. I dont even have words to describe it. Totally Fantastic... Whatever you say, this is totally cool. But I have a request...please add a column of legendary bikes. Like there is Common, Rares, Epics, and Specials , there should be a column of legendary. Waiting eagerly for the next update. Thanks a lot of making this fabulous game. And I would also like to appreciate the colours and graphics of this game. Thanks to the team for making this game. I advice this game to those who are looking for cool new games. Please install it and have FUN!!!! Dont just look at the pics, install and you'll be amazed.",
        "Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death",
        "Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won't register your flips. These aren't huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.",
        "Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I'll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.",
        "Way much room to improve                                 So first you could get more bikes in there and add more levels and make the resolution better like 1080 or something add more achievements and more of those levels that you get when you are just playing that game outside of the levels. But other wise great stuff great stuff keep it up. Also some missions are impossible, unless as someone else's comment said you play 16 hours a day",
        "This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can't seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn't be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it's not something you have to add, it's just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven't seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it's an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘"

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. 😁 It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖",
        "This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.",
        "What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I'm in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can't push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something"

Not only is this game  challenging and exciting,  but NO ADS.  5 stars from me",

        "I really like this game because 1, it is funny, a sausage running through a kitchen dodging all these obstacles, you have to admit that is kinda funny, 2nd I like how you can unlock so many different sausage skins, who would have thought that there would be so many different kinds of sausage, and finally, 3rd, I also like how you can play with other people, you can play with other people because you can take turns, when one person dies in the game it's the next persons turn. This game is awesome and all about tactics, and I love it. This game deserves a five star!🖒",

What matters is that there's a constant redirect ever 30 seconds! It sends you to a website and it's often and very stupid... And if a redirect isn't bad enough it no joke happens to me in the middle of game play. You can be playing and all the sudden here comes a redirect... !",

        "Was pretty good, liked the levels and the graphics were cool. The combonation of the colours on the black and white were quite nice. The only problem i had was when it came to the controls. Its a bit hard to naviagte back and forth. It can be easy to make a turn you didnt really want to do but harder to correct it cause it does not stop until it is too late or very far down the path. It would be great if you were able to stop mid run. But other than that I enjoyed playing this game.",
        "If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It's by far the best maze game app I've come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I've tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It's the only maze puzzle app I've found worth playing! 😀💜",
        "Sublime controls, varying but very original and fun game modes, and an online leaderboard for the ones interested..!  I'd easily rate this 5 stars if the white-on-grey theme didn't give me a headache! For the love of whatever God is out there, at least give the choice between a light and dark theme, PLEASE?!",
        "I'm not far into it, but it's fun so far. My eyesight could be why it's not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It's still a very good game though.",
        "I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven't played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I'll have to download a separate kid version for her.",
        "5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes"

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",
        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money.",
        "The game is great but customer service is non- existent. I bought the 30 day gem special that was supposed to come with an egg and fountain. Got the gems (so far)but not the extra items. Tried contacting customer support several times but following their M.O., they never respond."

When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",
        "Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "LOVE! Please DO NOT end the game! This app is perfect all the way around. Best card game app ever. SOOO many people are gonna be upset if you take it down, so leave it up! These uno players are ready to rock this app! You will never not have people playing. It would be kind of cool if you could create your own avatar though.. & pick outfits and such. Not necessary, but a fun little quirk (:",
        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it."

        "Great game most fun I've had on a mobile phone in years. Need to add wider turning radius so drifts are better and longer. Cars slide to much or maybe the cars are heavy? Idk but hepatic feed back would help so much. Ad these thing's and I'll rate 5 stars and fully purchase the game.also multiplayer with like 3 to 5 other people just messing around  would be awesome. Keep supporting this game and has a lot of potential unlike other mobile games that are very linear and closed off. This feels like a console quality game please keep it that way.   PLEASE ADD HEPATIC FEEDBACK SUPPORT",
        "This is legit the best car simulator type I had ever played. It can easily succeed Extreme Car Racing 3D, which was one of the original simulators back in 2014. Smooth gameplay and realistic sounds. I would suggest to add the 350z, RX7 FD and a touge map for late night uphill driving, that would be insane",
        "This game could be even better if you could: - Add the settings to the menu to control the music and SFX volumes.  - Add a map.  - Add a cockpit mode!  - Add an online or multiplayer mode!  - Add weather conditions like rain and snow.  - Add the brands to the cars!!!!.  Fix the speed of the cars and add the actual speed of each car. For example, the speed of the Lamborghini Aventador is supposed to be at 217 mph and it's supposed to have 7 gears but it's only using 5. Please fix that. - Make the city as BIG as you can please!!!!.   - Please add more shadow effects!!!. - ADD UPGRADES PLEASE!!!. - Add car stats. - Add more cars like:   • Chevrolet Corvette Z06  • Chevrolet Camaro SS  • Mosler Land Shark • SRT Viper GTS • Mosler Super GT  • Marussia B2  • McLaren P1 GTR  • Pagani Huayra  • Pagani Zonda R  • McLaren F1 GTR  • Ford GT  • 2017 Ford GT  • W Motors Lykan Hypersport  • W Motors Fenyr Supersport  • Lamborghini Huracan  • Lamborghini Veneno  • Lamborghini Reventon • Lamborghini Centenario  • Trion Nemesis RR  • Ferrari F50 GT  • Ferrari LaFerrari  • Ferrari FXX-K  • Ferrari FXX Evoluzione  • Ferrari F80  • Hennessey Venom GT  • Henessey Venom F5, and the   • Devel Sixteen. Please!!!!!. It is totally fine if you can't add any of this, but it would be better if you could do so!. This could be an official car driving simulator game. WHO WANTS MORE CARS!!!???!?!?!.",
        "Wow. Great game. I wanted a good car customizer just for fun and this app takes it one step further. Open world game where u can drift and wreck into everything. Soooooo fun. Download now. No names on cars but u can still tell what they r. Soo fun.",
        "Hang it up yet info it yet info username and yet I've used back but isn't it is it is to see the in person but I don't have a Instagram account and follow me on Instagram account and I have a lot going I look forward to hearing back from you close by and I will be there for you close the door and it going to be thankful I look forward to seeing the new Star is it possible that I look cute and he is it is to be done by the time I look forward to seeing the new one and I can you know what time you are available",
        "This is a fun game. I'm still personally waiting on that police chase mode. Also, can there be engine mods and body mods, and some more low end cars?😀"

        "When I first saw it in the app store I remembered when I played Dr.panda Chinese restaurant and I thought it was going to be very fun.once it finished installing when the characters ordered they was only 2 foods they could eat since the rest of them were locked😕. I REALLY miss the Chinese restaurant when I played that one I loved the doctor panda games and I really miss it.if you could can you PLEASE bring back the Chinese resturant.then I will love your games again😀😀😀",
        "Its a fun game but im very disapointes that you barely have anything to do they want you too buy so many things but it is a fun game but you can only make 2 dishes inthink maybe 1 but i was exspecting more from dr panda i love his apps i play them when i wanna play something but not harcore so if your fine with small content get this but if your looking for more i do not recommend this game but it has some good content you can season it however you want overall it was an ok game but i was expecting to be able to do more buts itis fun but if you want full content go to amazon underground or i think its free on this download toca kitchen 2 its great u make drinks as well thx for reading",
        "I'm sorry, but you guys are basically obsessed with money.I know, people need money for their needs, but why make a game free when we can hardly do anything?I miss the Dr. Panda Chinese Resturaunt, the whole game was free!Look, i'm not a cheapskate and the other people who disagree with the prices aren't, but y'know most kids play these games, and their parents aren't wealthy.Just please think about my comment for a while.",
        "The cow made me laugh out loud! She's so cute.",
        "I love it so much it's so fun who ever needs a game there's this one but u should also let the rest of the games be free 😁👍",
        "I love it because good Graffics scents I'm only 7 soo spelling might be wonky"

Makes you forget about the game sometimes as you can't do anything else untill it's complete. I refuse micro-transactions so this game now only gets visited once every couple of days. It's a shame really as it's great fun to start with.",

Edit: I have already provided screen shots to you via the Help & Support board, you haven't yet taken action. Please do so immediately.",
        "If you've seen this game advertised and thought hey that looks fun you'd be wrong. The ads make this look like a fun army survival type game like epic battle simulator. Its not, its just another money sink 'build a fortress' collect resources. Avoid for the sake of your saniy",
        "This game is not made for people who do not spend money. The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",

Similarly maxed th11 players are raiding my base sucking all my loots with all maxed troops , lvl 50 king/queen and lvl 20 warden...This is because i dont invest money in this game.",

Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "HI SUPERCELL . some players ruined the clan because of Clan Games. Why? They will join ur clan and check if we already achieve the reward like book. They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",
        "Super game my favourite game really nice guys download it .I have A small request if we have got any bonus in war or Multiple battles it automatically goes in Clan Castle ,and when we want withdraw it give whole treasure comes out. So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.",
        "A nice game. I will always be in search of games. My Friend recommend that this is nice game. I installed it. He said that join in my clan. I joined in his clan. Now I am playing this game wonderfully. Thank you super cell and coc. But only the problem is maintainance of server.  It says try again later.  That's why I have rated it 4★. Other wise iwll give 5★. But any way game is wonderful.        PLEASE INSTALL THIS GAME IT'S WONDERFUL GAME"

I have all this money and run through gems quick and it takes too long to obtain so I end up not playing for a while. A good way of doing this is through earnings that you collect from your restaurant. You can receive 1 gem",
        "Game is very fun and addictive. But you shouldn't have to spend few hundred dollars to play through the game and play all of the restaurants. Yes you can earn gems for free but would take an insane amount of time with each restaurant requiring more and more for each upgrade as you go on.",
        "There's no way to contact customer service for this game. I just bought the new restaurant with the noodles and duck and my sauce cooker doesn't work. I swipe it and swipe it and nothing. I'm doing it the way the tutorial showed but mine doesn't work. I might get lucky and it will come on but I'm losing all of my customers. I think they need to change it so we just have to tap it. I hoping they'll see this so they can work out the glitches for this new restaurant."

        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",

Which is smart I think. Gameplay is pretty fun and responsive. Upgrades don't feel unattainable. Definitely one of the better games on the play store",
        "There is a sudden difficulty spike in this game around level 20. Even if u have the best ship and weapons ur no match for the hordes of enemies. This is not right. Even after spending money the developers dont want you to win in my opinion. Dont know whats the logic.",
        "It's almost nothing without buying coins, u cant even win normal difficulty without ads and purchasing coins, how r we supposed to upgrade our weapons when every map gives u only around 200 and u need 20000 after a while for only one upgrade????!!!!!! Its graphic and gameplay is really good but like I said no progress in winning after a few maps",
        "It's simply too difficult to see when your finger is in the way.   Is there a fix? No.  Fun game. Too hard for my taste.  My $0.02",

        "Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.",
        "Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you're given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.",
        "Must be the shortest time I have had a game installed. Pace of gameplay is SLOW and I hate the voice of the game. So annoying! If I could skip the animation before and after a level it would be much better.",
        "Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.",
        "Liked it but sometimes it just wouldn't give me the right bubbles to win at the end when I absolutely could've. If there's 4 bubbles left and none of them are yellow why do you give me a yellow one? I felt cheated",
        "The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item."

        "This game activitly makes me angry. I want to keep playing it but the longer I play the less accurate my ship becomes, eventually missing EVERY SHOT, EVERY TIME. It feels likes the longer you play the game the less effect your ship becomes. It's a fun game but seems like a pretty intense cash grab.",
        "Decent, not good. Enemy flags might as well not exist as they don't fight eachother. You'll end up getting swarmed by every ship that always go faster than you, no matter how much you upgrade speed. They ram You constantly dealing damage but then take no damage from when you ram them. They also aren't affected by friendly fire. You can't actually aim and the constant ads are very annoying.",
        "Easy to play game. Good graphics. Controls can be a bit fiddly, but not that hard to deal with. If playing solidly for a while (30+ minutes), the cannon firing timing stops working properly and all shots miss (except for the enemies!) - restart the game and problem resolves, but a frustrating little bug.",
        "This game is amazing. Hands down one of the best games I've ever played on mobile. Also, you don't need to spend any money! I got to a fully maxed out ships without spending a cent. One thing you guys should add is multiplayer and different style ships, maybe Viking or something. Otherwise great game.",
        "Well I get the concept, but it's just not intriguing enough yes there's fishing, battling, etc. to top it off you get to sail in a really small map & after just 10-15 min I found it quite boring! Nonetheless just create a bigger more diverse map & fix those controls & this game could potentially be a 3 star game."

        "Love, love, love this game. Paid to remove ads, turned off music and sound fx but it still drains my battery faster than any other game. Around 1-2% per min. That is my only downfall so far. I thought paying to remove ads would help but it does not. Please fix so I can play MORE!",
        "Loved it at first. Even paid to remove ads. But the land only expands so far and after that it just gets boring. There should be more \"daily jobs\" to make it more interesting. I find that I've got over 5 max level plots for everything and must delete and start over just to have fun.",
        "Interesting at first, but easily defeatable. After only a few days of playing there is no more room to expand or buy \"plots\". I really enjoyed playing when I was able to expand and balance the growing and creating higher level cow pens bakery etc. I didn't expect to \"complete\" the game so quickly. I now have over $1 billion and there is no real challenges left.",
        "You couldn't stuff more ads into this game if u wanted to. I'm okay with ads to do double seeds or speed up harvesting. But there shouldn't be random ads that pop up while your playing normally so you accidently click on it and it takes you to the play store. STOP being so greedy.",
        "I love the game but now the ads aren't working to double harvest or seeds or add extra orders. It's the first time I have ever asked to make the ads work lol but I will happily watch them if I can. I'm clicking to watch and nothing happens. Restarting the app doesn't help.",
        "I really like this game. That being said I've encountered an impassable, constant issue. Whenever I merge crops, the image of the previous one remains and covers up my screen. I will re-review once this is fixed. It only started once I hit level 31, so I've been playing for a while with no issues."

I thought it was my bad driving but it seems I'm not the only one who disliked this game.so  please make some improvements. I could drag you through all the bad things but I won't make you suffer. So I will give it sadly a 👎.",
        "The game is ok at least when I get a chance to play it -there are way too many ads every time i click on a level to play an ad shows up even sometimes during when i play an ad shows up. I strongly recommend that you do not install this app",
        "WAY too many ads.  play 30 seconds, then watch a one minute ad.  Dont really know if i would like the game or not, i never got to play much of it, spent most of my time watching and trying to closeout ads.",
        "First if all... Its down right BORING! Also there is adds after every single level! Sometimes the adds are weird and innaproprete! I do NOT reccomend this game, download at your own risk😕",
        "I liked the game and all but there were way to many ads. Every level there was a thirty second video playing and some of them were extremely inappropriate. I got a bit impatient waiting for all the ads to end but I liked the game set-up. I think that was a neat idea. I just think it would be better without all the interruptions",
        "I think it should be a bit more realistic and by that I mean more people on the streets; if you crash into someone, that person would come out of their car angry and cars get damaged when you crash into them. Maybe, to add a bit more reality to the game, you could add the money that they pay you to the levels. Apart from that it is an excellent game. However, some people, when they get in a taxi, chat away to the taxi driver."

        "The art style is amazing. The Zen mode and overall atmosphere is relaxing and entertaining. My big issue is after resetting my progress once I completed everything. You loose the coin doubling upgrade that you pay real money for. Why must I re purchase some I have already bought. Why does resetting my progress reset something I purchased with real money. I feel that is a little unfair and even from a premium purchaser is pretty jading, I really enjoy the game and will change to a 5 star once an answer is provided or it is fixed.",
        "Alright, so the game is pretty good. All I ask for is more tricks, and the ability to upgrade some bonuses (coin magnet, feather hover thing, and the third one that I haven't grabbed yet.) All in all, if you could do that, it'd make the game so much greater. Apart from skipping missions and revives there's no use for coins.",
        "The thing that makes this game great is the visuals and the audio. It is absulutley beautiful and the art style works so well with the type of game. Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I'd very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there's a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style",
        "Echoing what many others are saying, the ads completely break this game. I understand I'm not paying for the game, so I don't mind being shown ads.  However the button to close the apps rarely function properly.  Instead of closing the ad it takes you to the download page of the ad being advertised. Update: I just had to sit through a round of a final fantasy game.  I wish you could rate below the 1 star.",
        "The game itself is fun and minimally challenging.  The graphics are lovely.  I felt compelled to give such a low rating due to the ads not clearing out upon completion.  I had to close the app and restart just to play the game again.  I would have purchased the ad-free version but if it's this buggy prior to purchase, I didn't want to get stuck with a pay version that I'm unable to clear out certain functions.  Maybe next time.",
        "I remember back when this game would cost money on iOS. I would literally try to download every single third party helper app just to look for this game. Now that i actually have a phone, its free. I think this game is great for both relaxing and competitive play. And I am so hyped for the Odyssey. I check often to see if it is there. 10/10 would recommend this game."

Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.",
        "The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don't get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new \"enemies\". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you've lost some lives. But that's not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.",
        "I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It's more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.",
        "Remember the old days when platformers taught you through trial and error how to interact with new game mechanics? If you don't like that, you'll hate this game. So much fun, so creative, and once you start to get down one of the new features, it ramps it up and keeps you learning creatively how to beat the level. I love this game, it's a fantastic platformer that will challenge you to learn as you go instead of giving you a tutorial every time something new comes up.",
        "Completed all but just couldn't get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I've ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.",
        "I love this game 😍😍 it is my favourite but.... I don't like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it's a great idea😋😋 btw i loved it 😍😍😍 ill give it 5 stars then😊😊"

        "New Review because of update: ° I really love this game. I'm hooked. Relaxing yet stimulating. Some levels are easy as cutting through soft butter with lots of delightful bombs and others take several tries to master and need that one devise a strategy and some others are much up to luck. I love that variation: relaxing and stimulating and sometimes a bit frustrating. ° I had finished all the levels of version 2 and then waited for an update which came with new levels and I finished them also about 4 weeks ago. I've opened the game every day since to see if yet an other update came, and yes, yesterday it did and have already finished all levels (that says more about my fanaticism than it says about the difficulty of the game). ° I appreciate the tournament (I topped the monthly yesterday but had dropped 3 steps while I was sleeping and have clawed my way back to the top this evening, but I guess I'll be back down tomorrow. But it's fun! And I got generous daily prizes. ° And I love the new version that even though I again have finished all levels, I can just go on playing thanks to the Level Tower (even if it at 46 repeated a previous level). ° Lovely graphics, good game sound.",
        "Annoying and boring. Got headaches playing this. You can spend 5 sets of 5 lives each without passing the task. It's rather a \"Push to pay or wait forever\" game. Uninstalled. Sorry.",

        "Hi team this game is nice and some more boosters and free  lucky spin wheel  with extra life and to get boosters for us. This tournament game is nice I like it and how many days it will be there",

        "Very fun game. Multiplayer is awsome! Please add private matches so i can play with friends.   Physics still need work to hold up to real world standard. Rocks dont follow thru on take outs in real life as they do in this game. Also (rules), a rock needs to make it all the way over the hogline in order to stay in play.  Thank you for making this game!",
        "Best curling game I've seen Enjoy the graphics, controls, love the 1 on 1 against international players and career game options. Seems consistent and easy to learn. Needs a few tweaks like... throws that don't make hog line or touch hogline must be taken out of play. Have seen the bug that others reported, sometimes rock after thrown disappears , some kind of glitch that happens occasionally.  Sometimes the sweepers don't react to my movement to sweep. Would love to see 8 stones instead of 6. If you love curling, this should satisfy",
        "Great game except for hackers. There is a hack that allows some to bump or change finish of a throw. Yoy can go from having 2 scoring to opponent having the score, changing after the rocks stopped. Developers have not replied ti report. Fine for some fun but don't waste your money in upgrades",
        "Good fun. Physics seem good, sometimes my sweepers don't sweep at all but I don't think that makes too much difference. I'd like to play alternate ends rather than winner goes first and the rocks don't spin which would add a bit of something to the graphics. I've yet to play online, just practicing against the CPU.",
        "Decent. The game is close to curling. Issues are that the only real way to earn coins it to play online mode. If you do career mode you actually have to SPEND coins to play, and there's no payout for winning. The rocks don't behave like real curling stones, but it's the best curling game you'll find on your phone.",
        "Physics are not like real curling, rocks are dead in the house when hit, physically impossible doubles and triples, improper use of the free guard zone rules (if a rock is in the house, it is free to be removed...not in this game).  Connecting people across the globe is a cool idea but you frequently lose people and you win without finishing a game.  I've played for 35 years so I speak from experience."

        "This has been my fav gameeee I swear this game you will love, and fun with.Its so easy to play, in the first time I play, i got of a score of, 131 how cool is thattt!!!. I cant even image what the new score would be in the future. I swear DOWNLOAD this game u wont regrett!!!!💕",
        "Its a really great game and I really recommend it! The only problems I had was the controls are a little weird and there a little bit of too much ads but I dont mind it but I'd rather you fix it! Thanks for making me happy! ♡",
        "Downloaded this game just to kill some time. It was fun at first but then once I started to play the challenge mode it would not let me see the whole screen during some challenges. So there is no way to win at the challenges that require you finish in a limited number of moves.",
        "Should be an option to lock targeting  and then fire, many shots were messed up from lifting my fingure at a very slight angle.  Also check points should last longer than once. Making one mistake at lvl 190+ and then having to go back to zero was so frustrating it was the main reason i uninstalled.  Terrible shame honestly, the game could have been really fun and is an original idea",
        "Its a great game i love it. The only problem would be that the speed X2 sign covers how many balls i have left and i hate that maybe try placing that top right hand corner instead of bottom right. I also hate that it only speed up X2 and not anymore but i can live without it"

        "I've been playing this game for over 4 years. It's still fun and challenging. Maybe even a  little therapeutic too. What better way to relax than running through the world eating people, falling off cliffs and occasionally getting blown up.",
        "Love this game!  I can't make out what is said when the helicopter flies past. I have an issue with the birds however. I saved up enough diamonds for a new bird but got one I already have. Not fair at all.",
        "Ads which supposedly should give diamonds, are not available almost all the time. I barely can get 1-2 ad per day.",
        "This game is good, however there isn't 1 game that you will play without going 'what the hell?' the game is very unfair in places.",
        "Can you add more to the game pls its very addictive add like new vehicles,zombirds and ways to get more gems so more people will offer the game to their friends.",
        "WONDERFUL game such cute little charictors and awesome graphics you should play this game I'm sure you'll like it!"

But since my tv can't download apps so I opened d website on d browser on d tv but the room no or the QR code doesn't appear no matter how long I wait. I don't know what d problem is please tell me a solution",
        "It would be a really good game if it stops letting me use my coins then when I'm in the game for not even 5 seconds. It would shut down on me and when I login back in my coins are gone. I will like you to fix that",
        "Yeah. This game it is very cool and all but, there's this really messed up update and I kinda... Hate it. I only have 200 coins daily, thus it isn't for buying songs, it's for just playing them. This update is a money-baiter. I got to say, this game really took a lot of work to Ubisoft and who am I to critize it. But I think that they should let us buy the songs. This game is really cool btw",
        "Its good but the update mess me up because i have so many song that ived by but now i dont have any of it and there s a limit by purchasing a song 2 songs per day? And what happen to the connecting with fb? What the heck",
        "The new update STILL didn't fix the coin limit. And when I tried to buy something with my coins that I didn't have enough coin for it. I lost all my money and it told me I didn't have enough money to buy it! But it's still a good game. Also please put love ward in the game thanks",
        "Rubbish update. Takes my coins but  phone gets stuck on loading screen, even though the tablet starts the dance."

        "I kind of miss the old version because isn't that why they came out with a 2nd game so if we eant more we got it.  Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.",
        "This game is both funny as serious it's a great way to make kids understand the danger of some things around them. Like trains and wires and different things. As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.",
        "I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I'm playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can't complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍",
        "I love the game, it's so addictive! Some of the levels are confusing, but most are super simple and super fun! One thing that is a little bit of a downer is how every time you want to play a new round you have to watch a 30 second add , which gets old when you want to play a lot, but don't want to pay for add free. But I would highly recomend this to anyone",
        "This game is so good but please get rid of some adverts. Whenever I click on somthing it always comes up with a long advert. Also, can you add a toutorial at the start, showing how to do each thing.",
        "I think that there could be less ads. When I'm trying to replay he game an ad pops up which is really annoying. What I would say is that this is an excellent game but just less of the ads"

There are many missing pieces and too much to acquire to be able to progress. Maybe instead of making it so in depth, take it down a notch. Let people use junked cars to fix cars and sell them, if this is already an option make it easier to do so. I think this is a good game just too in depth and not enough give to make it entertaining and fun at this time.",
        "Great game with good potential. I love it. But there are still some minor bugs the car baler somtimes acts weird. And the dismantling process sometimes goes reverse. And then there is the part of collecting building materials. It is too hard and we need to be able to get building materials from elsewhere than the scrap cars. All of them including wood, bricks, and concrete. I am looking forward to the car repair function.",
        "The game is over good. It's definitely fun for your car enthusiasts but I am now level 11 and I can't obtain \"glass\" to build any buildings... The game is getting boring because I can't move up, it's pretty much scrap cars and sell parts... I don't want to rate this game too high because I believe it still is a work in progress, but yes it's a good game and I would recommend it",
        "It's a decent concept. Good time killer for a little while. I don't know why all these games take energy. Just let me play the damn game. And the constantly fluctuating prices to sell the parts got old REAL QUICK! Apparently the creators of this game have never been to a salvage yard in their life.",
        "Great time killer! Simple to play, though a few information/help would be nice for a few items, the auto sell option and the bailer so you know exactly what they do.  The developer does listen to the players and fixes things! Only true issues that I have are 1)the materials needed to build the buildings in incredibly high, not really obtainable for game play, even for someone who would play constantly"

        "I really enjoy playing this game. It helps me to relax while I am watching TV, or even using in split mode while watching a video or something. It's a bit different then the way I originally used to play Klondike, but still a great game and easy to get used to quickly! I don't mind the 5 second or so ads between games. It's the price you pay to get a good, free game. It's not like they play constantly and during a game there is usually an ad on the bottom screen but it will quickly move if you go to start a new game or need to access the other options.",
        "It's a fun relaxing game. Its so addictive that every device I have, must have this game. I have it on my phone, ipad and tablet. Except my laptop cuz then I would get no work done. About the ads, one pops out each time you finish a game, so I'm not to bothered by it. Also, theres no videos too watch in order to earn coins or diamonds because none are needed. I just love it. Its stress free.",
        "I would have scored higher except there is suddenly super annoying music being played that there is no option to turn off. The ads also now autoplay loud music. I agree with another poster who said it starting to seem like you lose more so you see more ads. I liked this because it was good for a quick game while getting ready to sleep. The music ruins this. I'm going to try another app now.",
        "I love the game solitaire played it on many different computers over the years. Downloaded three other version on my phone. All of which I deleted almost straight away because they were finicky and I didn't like the format. This one is easy to use and no glitches. So far so good.",
        "Addicting to play. The amount of ads is annoying and gets in the way of some of the controls sometimes, but otherwise it's a nice little game! I also like that it keeps track of stats and that you can deal just one card or 3 cards at a time!",
        "Terrible ads. So bad they hid the menu bar behind an ad banner so you click the ads just to access settings. Pretty sure they recently increased losing deal rate to make more ad videos play. So many other solitaire aps available so skip this one."

And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.",
        "Good, but has some bugs I'm sorry if I'm being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall",
        "It's good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn't too much skill involved but it's a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I've lost countless games because it doesn't stop or doesn't back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!",
        "Awesome It's a very good game, great graphics even for a bunch of cubes, but I also have an idea. You guys should make a game called smashy water, where we can choose from a wide variety of different boats that run away from boat police. Hopefully I helped you with my idea and I will download if made;-). You can work on the title if needed. Please reply:-)",
        "Excellent could use weapon pickup like smoke machine gun or oil slick.... A health bar which is unique to each vehicle depending on if it is made for speed or for just ramming stuff and an add health pickup... a bouncing red or blue stack of cash equal to a hundred dollars once action picks up and a 1000 dollar pickup after a ten minute counter for those who have gotten very good and lastly an arrest count down when stopped.... Sometimes you get only a breif second to get away other times you get like ten seconds???",
        "Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it's a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can't go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I'm out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!"

        "I wrote a review already for my game on my laptop,and as I said I love this game but for some addicting reason I now have a new game on my new tablet I just got hehe. I am not here to complain and I'm not saying anyone else is in just wanted to let you know that some of the ads don't show up on the tablets you can hear them play but can't see them and as I said (some). I have managed my way around it through memorizing where the close (x) is just from trying to tap every corner but I would like not to have to do that hehe. But like I said I can manage, it's just that I know someone who would like to play but can't really stand that lol my mom hehe anyway I just thought about it would be nice if she could play too and it might help as well. Thanks for reading and listening and have yourselves  a nice day and night. Plus thanks for this game!",
        "I love this game! So much,very addictive and very unique!  I would rate 100 stars if I could!You can battle, feed dragons, do clans...ECT ! Every update it gets new things!  Best dragon game ever!You would love this game, just get it! And it's free!There are so many islands too! You can connect it on Google play to save the game or Facebook! The dragons are so cute!!! Please get this game! There are so many activities  And tournaments!",
        "I love this game so much but... I used to play this game a year ago then I got tired of it then I returned yesterday  I had a Facebook account that even has a legendary called Ice cream , so I signed in back half of my dragons are gone , my farms , my island everything that's why I rated 1 if I could get my account back I would rate 5 Thanks. Sincerely,  A Google Player ( Facebook too ).",
        "I love this game because is it active! I can play it all day and not get board! Keep up the great work everyone!😛😛 ( there a lot of ads every 5 minutes though. I don't know why. Pls fix that and the game will be even better! Respond to me as soon as you can! Thanks you for your time to listen to my opinion!",
        "There is an unnecessary amount of ads. I understand representing your sponsors, but at what cost to your customers? General game play is also very challenging for new players  as far as leveling up dragons, collecting coins/food, and even breeding times are ridiculous.",
        "Addicted to this game since I downloaded it, even got my other half playing it! The main issue of this game is that, you always shut down the serves to do maintenance or updates whilst there are events and clan events on! Many people use alot of gems etc during these events but you're putting players off from doing that by messing around with something that's working perfectly! Aside from that issue, it is very enjoyable to play.  UPDATE: Why do you bother making updates for the game, for the game to then stop working! I was told i had to update if I wanted to continue playing this game, so I downloaded the update and now the game won't start at all! I'll add my other star back to the review once this is sorted!"

It is a big deal to me since I enjoy playing games with a purpose to achieve something haha btw GREAT GAME!",

I have j3 6 which is pretty bad and still runs well. Very optimized, sleek game. Also alot of updated to keep the game fresh and the microtransactions are very fair.",
        "Very fun game, wish it wasn't energy based, would definitely enjoy it more. The fishing is 'new' right now and i have to say the percentages are garbage. 75 percent is more like 50, 50 percent is like 10 percent,  25 percent is closer to 50. This is just my personal experience. The games is really fun though, expect to get annoyed with the fishing percentages however. Also energy gets spent super fast in this game, very fun yet very limited.",
        "It's good and alot of fun but it's a bit of a tedious grindfest. 150% item find and I found nothing after going through ten dungeons. I want to keep playing but it's just another pay to win type. I understand you need to make money but I can buy a full loadout of epic equipment and run through a great portion of the game in no time. It's definetly worth giving a try but unfortunetly it's not for me.",

It kicks me out of the game every 5 minutes and that way I can't get any progress done. I absolutely enjoyed the little playtime I got and I want to play it more but it won't let me. Great job otherwise devs!",

        "Been playing this for about a week.  It's a lot of fun with a variety of different things to do.  Running out of energy for doing dungeons doesn't matter a lot as there are three or four other things to do in game that don't require energy.  Will be making a purchase to support the devs.  Good game!"

This game has some potential but it's getting wasted here.",

I really do like this game but like I said I might not have it that long because there is not much to do on it I need the premium stuff! Thank you for the hard work on this game but it is not enough to satisfy me fully, anyway let me know what's up!...",

Me and my sister love to play find the phone but I turnt the application off (thinking that it would work in the background and you wouldn't have to keep turning it off) and put down my phone and my sister came in and scared me and I knocked my phone off its stand and lost it (exactly what this application is trying to prevent). I did manage to find it in the end but it took a while. This is an amazing app and would definitely recommend it but it would be ideal If it worked In the back ground and you wouldn't have to keep turning the system on and off but otherwise app great app :)",

        "I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.",
        "I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn't work.  So I pressed the 'X' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I'm pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE 'X'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I'm triggered.  Please fix that.",
        "If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.",
        "It's good at first but you'll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.",
        "Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I'm not spoiling it, but I will tell you it's a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don't know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.",
        "Both my husband and I have this game.  I opted to pay for the no ads though, he did not.  DO NOT do this!  He is able to get \"continues\" for watching adds and can keep climbing up the levels.  I cannot since I purchased no adds.  I get to continue once and that's all since I have stopped ads from allowing me to get the extra chances.  I wish I would have known this beforehand. Otherwise, this game is seriously fun and addicting."

        "Quick fire is the best but theres only one down fall, the seconds. When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..",
        "Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven't gotten very far yet. Thing I DON'T like is you don't get an average..... IF you do, I've yet to find where it is in the game. That's in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯",
        "The Game is good. Some things to improve it:  save your profile using your Google Account. Play with Friends in Tournaments (ie. Teams, Challenges), ability to givie Hearts to friends without using Facebook Also can you PLEASE improve the notification! My friend sends me Requests to Bowl & most of the time I don't get notified. Thank U",
        "Not sure how the currency works or how to upgrade my levels. Played 10 times and still can't upgrade the ball. Do they expect real cash to upgrade 1 ball? Also the controls are touchy, I've inadvertently chucked a few balls into the gutter while trying to align it before my release. Some tutorials would be nice.",
        "I did like this fame but my lane keeps turning pink along with the ball so I can't actually see anything like where the ball is going.... and on quick fire again turns everything pink and don't let me take any shoots what do ever.. think it's a glitch in the game I'm not sure but tried restarting the game and the same thing is happening again and again... on all the different lanes and extra games in bowling king...",
        "Great graphics and realistic feel to the lanes. Controls are a bit wonky, however, and purists won't like being being able to steer the ball after it leaves your \"hand.\" LOTS of attempted upsells, but its free to play features ain't too bad on their own, either. All in all, a decent little bowling game."

        "I like the game its fun and engaging but the premium choices cost a lot of diamonds and you don't get a lot opportunity to earn them. 12- 18 diamonds for more then a couple  choices in a story to make interesting choices that wouldmake the storys better but you only earn 1 diamond a chapter witch you have to wait an hour or more to unlock or buy keys.  So you pretty much have to spend real money for this game to really enjoy it. Ill be deleting this app not worth my time.",
        "While the game is enjoyable and the stories are intriguing, it is way too expensive to make certain choices. There is absolutely no need for choices to cost 20 or 25 diamonds when you only get 1 diamond for each chapter completed.  This game is in no way good enough to warrant spending real money on it, especially considering the ridiculously high prices of making certain choices which would require making a purchase in every single chapter.",
        "The game is great. Great graphics, nice music, perfectly cued entrees  for new characters, amazing story line.... But they don't give you enough keys or diamonds. I mean, y s its understandable that the chapters are long but 2hrs for a recharge on keys? Really? Either make the waiting time shorter, give us more, or both. Now as for the diamonds, they give you 25 of them. But each special choices is always way to much. And you never really know when your going to need them for something serious. With that said either give us more keys, lower the cost of the choice, or give us more diamonds per chapter. Not like 2 but 5 or more.",
        "It's a brilliant app, though sometimes I wish there wasn't as many gem choices. I fully considered buying gems until I realised how quickly they'd be used.   My favourite story was It Lives In The Woods, though most of the choices are gem choices. The story itself is fantastic, and I love the diversity of characters.   I had a problem with a story playing up and after a chat with the team was told to restart it. I didn't mind but I didn't get any keys to compensate what I'd already spent (I don't buy them I just wait for then to recharge, but it did mean I had to respend keys on one story because of a issue out of my control)   Overall its a great app and highly playable without spending.",
        "Diamond choices come up way too often for how much they cost and how little you get. The keys have an unreasonably long cooldown to get them. Options like watching ads to get diamonds would be a great option, especially seeings how you have that option in HSS and HU:RS. All that aside its a good game. Lots of the stories are enjoyable and its visually pleasing.",
        "Great graphics and great stories. Right now they have like 30 \"books\", so there are lots of options. I've been playing since 2016 and the app just keeps getting better. Can get a little pricey for the preminum choices, but otherwise it's a fantastic app; very additive and entertaining"

        "Fun game until you get to a level where you have to pay to move on. Minimum diamonds needed to delete tough lines is 200 And you can only earn diamonds 5 or 10 at a time. Need to be able to earn diamonds faster.  Even if you purchase diamonds the pricing is exorbitant.  Way out of line with other games. Update: don't waste your money to update to a better ball. It does no good and actually makes the game harder.",
        "I wish I could say this was a great game, I love brick games like this one but unfortunately this one is still buggy. For some reason everytime I try and Shoot To the Left it releases before I take my thumb off and completely screws up my shot. Does not seem to happen as much when shooting to the right side of the screen. Especially annoying when I have one block left in the warning Zone. The aiming is also an issue. Fix these issues and I will absolutely love this game.",
        "Game was fine until level 319. It stopped being fun after that. I took over a month of building up power ups before beating it. Only to find out 320 was almost the same design. Started fun... ended tragically.   Uninstalled.",
        "Great time killer. Only thing I dislikes is wish it could save my progress if something was to happen to my phone. Unlike just recently! Had to get a new phone and had to start all over!! Other than that great game.."

        "I love Beat the Boss 4! But there are some things that I would like to be fixed. For example, when naming your custom boss, the name duplicates. The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can't go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.",
        "Game is now unplayable due to ads and KIIP rewards popups. The ads bring up my status bar so I can't X out of the ad, and the app hangs when trying to load the KIIP program. I have no interest in trying to play something that shovels ads in your face more often than you can actually play.",
        "I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i'm asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting",
        "This game needs a lot of work done. So many glitches its really weird and hard to explain the glitches that happen. One of them was the screen uncalibrated itself an it was moved to the upper left side , an the right side was just black . idek if that makes sense but it shouldn't happen.",
        "Wow, ads and more ads. Gotta love how they bombard you with so many you'd rather go and shut you phone service down. The game would be fun if you weren't interrupted every 15 seconds. That pretty much is how long you get before they come up.",
        "The game is amazing, but it is pathetic at the fact that there are ads popping up every 2 minutes and there's no way to remove them... I would be happy to pay to remove the ads, I won't be playing this game until this is fixed. I remember playing this game years ago, I understand you guys may be making more money from displaying ads than people paying to remove them."

        "Cars could look better and authentic during the race. They look like miniature toy cars. Not even look like the real car. You should patch the game after some time, after you have the revenue. Cars not even look like they \"look\" in the real life. The gameplay is alright so far, might become enjoyable for a longer gameplay.   Just started, but I wasn't suggested to invite my friends to play. Correct it also for making the community larger. Where is the option to play with my friends? Also, any crew creator option? So far , 4/5. Started yesterday",
        "I normally hate card base games, but I saw the preview as an ad on another game. So I thought it looked good enough to try it out. This game is HELL A LOT BETTER than the preview suggested. It does have pacts of cards to buy with real money, yet at the same time you earn gold coins to buy same packs. You can easily save the gold coins to buy these packs. LOVE THIS GAME",
        "Its still crashing very frequently.  When are your going to fix this😡 its has been over a month. Its starting to have server errors now it is getting too unstable can your fix this!!! its not adding my trophies. how can i have 0 trophies won for 1 week straight. pls fix this.",
        "Hi... The game keeps crashing down after the recent update.. Can't even write to the support team about it, it crashes just seconds after I start the game.. Help!",
        "I liked the game but the reason its a 4 is because on the 0 to 150 races i have a car that its high is 157 mph but it just randomly stops at 134 and says dnf my car is way faster plz fix the Chevrolet Impala 1967 and my Chevrolet Camero 1970 can make it to 145 mph on a mile drag but cant make it to 130 mph on a 0 to 150 race, thats bs plz fix these cars' top speeds plz. They r broken",
        "Great game, constantly playing, was crashing this morning but fixed now so up to 5 stars.  Would like more ways to make money once the campaign is 100% complete, maybe more, or replayable campaigns, or new game modes all together, but still great fun."

        "I really like the concept of the game I fun to play. But what I really find droubling its a pay to win type of game. Sure you get daily rewards and everything, but that still doesn't compare to the lack of coins you get. For example I recently reached lvl 11, and when I go into lobbies with people with high tier amor and weapons. I find It hard to get kills now. I really hope you guys can fix this in the further future",
        "I think it's OK, I mean like, its just a copy of pixel gun 3D but there's more action in pixel gun. And could you make the fire button a little bigger because whenever I try to fire I always miss the trigger and then get killed😬 but I still like pixel gun better (sorry alot) but I think the game needs more improvement that's why I gave it a 3 star",
        "I hate this You need to get report or find a mod. see in the chat a player keep calling me gay for 17 day I will 5 star it if you can do it",
        "I will u 5* if u increase the amount of coins every match and reduce price of weapons & armours. Amount of coins every match is so little that I can't buy a good weapon and also armor repair and also granede buying system is so pathetic.",
        "Its awesome, but the armor repair... really why? People are going to start hating that. Which happened to me and some others. Also add a friends list. Keep it up",
        "It's a good game u can meet a bunch of people around the world! Like slaughter not I met him and be careful what I say all right because I got blocked 2 times under 1 week lol bye"

        "This is a great game. It's fun, addictive, and a great time killer. The only problem I see is that I created an account on the game thinking it would save. WRONG! I had to do a factory reset on my phone and now I have to start over. I was so far with some really good cards, but alas I know more about the game now, so maybe I'll get there quicker this time.",
        "Don't bother downloading this game.  The customer service in this game is terrible.  I submitted a ticket because several combinations i researched in game disappeared.  I got a response that the game would fix itself and my ticket was being closed.  The problem didn't fix itself and i can't remember every combo lost. I submitted another ticket and I'm waiting for a response but after how my first ticket was handled I'm not confident they'll fix it. I've only been playing a few days but if the game is this buggy already then i don't recommend downloading it.",
        "It's actually surprisingly fun. The card mechanics are simple to grasp but with a enough depth to keep you trying new decks and combos. I chuckled a few times at some of the dialouge between the characters. 10/10 would recommend",
        "The game is addictive, but in short it's a gamble for cards. The prices are a lot for what you are getting. Lots of repetitive challenges. Unfortunately the quest for cards is really a quest for your wallet. I played since 9/16 and decided to walk away. Unfortunately you get to a point where the only way to move up is to spend, spend, spend. The gambling pulls for cards on real money game currency got old.",
        "The main problem with the game in my opinion is being able to attack your opponent while they have other cards in play. Perhaps if you could choose to block rather than be forced to take it the game would be a bit better aa youd have to manage your resources a bit better rather than beat hard until its over. Aside from that it is a very fun game to play",
        "Waste of money. No matter what you spend you never get decent cards. They stack the odds so no matter how you buy cards you'll always get ripped off. Mom's box is supposedly random yet I've bought hundreds of boxes I've never got anything worth a damn. I've played over a year and wasted a hundred bucks on this game w no reward. I strongly recommend you don't spend a dollar on this game. It won't help. The game will still screw you. Money will not help on this game."

        "I love playing this game. It is now my favorite phone game of all times. I have seen other reviews about waiting for energy takes too long. It does take a long time but to me that is part of it. It makes you slow down and enjoy simple fun. Too be honest all of us need to slow down and enjoy life around us. I play it on my breaks at work. The way you play this game allows for  short or long periods of play . Also it's quite fun seeing the little guy demolish tiles. It truly is an awesome game. I have recommended it to family and friends.",
        "I deleted all of my games except for Diggy's Adventure. This is my favorite game. I am going to play this game until me and Diggy win, and then I'm going to play it again from scratch. Google should make a whole lot of games like this. They are way better than match 3 puzzle games. I love cats I wish they could make a kitty's Adventures game like Diggy's Adventure.",
        "I've played this game for almost 2 years and have not once had a problem and have spent a lot of money. For some reason it's now crashing every few mins. I don't lose progress or anything but it's getting frustrating to have to keep restarting. I've even updated the app on my Android. Please help? It's my favorite app and I just want to dig!",
        "Very addictive game but you spend more time waiting for energy than playing. When you have unavoidable tiles of over 400 points it doesn't take long to lose all your stored energy. I thought games were for playing, not waiting around. It's play for 5 minutes wait for an hour. It's a shame because some of the puzzles are quite good.",
        "Would be better of the android app version had the same features as the full site.  I've been wondering how i can get friends logged onto a laptop and saw so many different features",
        "Loved playing but now that I am in China, to much energy to play. 450 energy each hit and cannot produce enough energy to play.  Hate this game now. I do replenish in camp.  Thanks for the nasty remark by making me feel stupid."

        "Its nice but theres one problem for me.When i logout and login again the game loading glitches and it wont let me play.Pls cix this glitch but anyway thankyou and its still really fun to play",
        "This game is for people who love to be stuck in time, since this game came out there hasn't been any proper updates except from adding new unnecessary stuffs to the game so kids can waste their money on, the time limit in the game is 4mins for either team battle or free for all; this has been the way thia game has been for years since i started play the game anything new in the game is all about spending more money, what tyoe of developers are you guys? Do you even play the game? It gets more boring every second, the are no proper changes no organization of your weapon and other stuffs in the game... It takes like 2+ minutes to change to another outfit because the list is too long, YOU DEVELOPERS NEED TO FOCUS ON THE GAMEPLAY AND NOT NEW ITEMS... Add in squad battles so it can be more competitive and allow people to be able to see their stats and then players will care more just look at what other games are doing in 2018 and don't get stuck in time...GOODLUCK"

        "Great distraction Top job over Xmas, TV was lacking this wasn't! Be great to see some more features, perhaps making races longer and qualifying a little more technical. Introduction of suspension set up and track condition could be cool. The amount of stuff to start off with as a new person is just right though. May put others off being too complex. Hope this helps!",
        "Really good game. It is a really great game. If you don't buy money it takes a lot of thinking and good strategy to get your car to the front. The only thing that could make it better is if they added a practice to the game before qualifying to give it a more realistic feel and more track time to work on settings over the races would make it better. As well as adding prize money for where you finish in the races and titles.",
        "Great game, been playing for just two days and I already love it. Tutorial at the beginning could be better though and maybe some more instructions as you progress through the game? It's fun, realistic and fairly addictive. Doesn't need WiFi, so you can play it anywhere. Would be fun if you could actually see the cars during races rather that just coloured dots. But all in all, I'd really recommend this. It's not good enough that I'd pay money for it, but then again I have yet to find a mobile game that (in my opinion) is.",
        "I love everything about this game, entertaining, addictive and I can lose hours playing!   I have a question for the developer though - I have just changed phones, and I have been trying to transfer my profile to my new phone by playing and then uploading my progress from Google Play Games. However I can't  manually save my game progress on the old device and transfer the progress to the new one. Could you tell me how I can do this, as otherwise I will need to start all over again on my new device (and I'm nearing the end of the game!)  Thanks, and keep up the great work!",
        "The best app ive ever played What else can I say, being a racing fanatic this game is perfect to me. As long you understand the game and strategize perfectly, you wont be dissappointed. I even deleted my sim city app because of this addictive game. Btw as of this review Im on the continental super cup winning like hell, saving up some money for upgrading my HQ and wages for my 2 drivers with 99 overall. Thanks you Christian West for this game. Cheers from the Philippines!",
        "The best Motorsport manager game on the playstore. But it needs some sort of tutorial, like how do you improve your drivers, young drivers and engineers? They are always ranked nearly the exact same so its not really an improvement it just costs more money to replace them for someone of equal ability. And I won 5 out of 6 races in my 1st season and no matter what i do, my monthly earnings are always and I mine always on minus. Won 4,000,000 prize money and my money balance doesn't increase by that much and my monthly earnings do not increase at all. So where is my money going? My monthly costs are a fraction of the prize money I won."

        "Awesome game. Good graphics, great sound and music, intricate leveling up system and character build, easy controls, variety in enemies, lots of replay value, lots of gear to find, and doesn't take much data space. Reminds me of a Diablo type game. The developer's really do deserve a lot of praise for creating such a quality game and not making it a p2w. This is an example of doing it right. I can tell that a lot of thought and care was put into it. Absolutely brilliant. I can't praise enough. A rare gem on the play store, and completely free. Just awesome. 6 out of 5 rating. Thank you so much for such a great game.:) Edit: Thanks for the update. You guys rock.",
        "Good looking game plays very smoothly. Fun to play and not too hard or too easy. Nice little details like the way your hero talks and has other party members. These things help make the single player game seem less lonely. I don't know if I am going to hit a pay wall or loose interest. The story is engaging enough. I just don't give out 5 star reviews.",
        "Greetings Making Fun,  Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love this game. It's entertaining, challenging and addictive. The storyline is engrossing and the graphics are spectacular as well. You can easily tell how addictive a game is by the amount of time you spend playing it at a stretch. Let me just say that I've been playing this game ever since I installed it. Whenever I sit down with my device, I start playing it and I keep on playing for at least two hours before I divert my attention to other matters. It's a really lovely and delightful game. Making Fun seems like the most suitable title of the developers because they've made something that is really a lot of fun. Well done. I highly recommend this game. DOWNLOAD IT TODAY.",
        "Good game. Defintely like that you can play offline. Most of my issues with it are really minor except for the fact that the background especially things like walls, trees and hills can sonetimes block your view. There have been a bunch of tines where I couldn't see enemies that were right next to me because a wall was there.",
        "Great game so far! Love the old school feel to the game! Resembles Diablo a lot! But I love the Diablo series so being able to play a game like that from the palm of my hand...GOLD! Tons of customization from characters, skills and equipment upgrades. Most of the better items are obtained just by playing! No need to buy items, save those gems for more skills to adding more companions to fight along side you! Running low on gems...just keep playing! Love a game that rewards you just for playing! Keep up the good work guys! I don't post reviews unless it's worth it so......see you out there!",
        "The gameplay is the best ive seen for an android RPG Diablo type game. Slick graphics, awesome sound track and effects, no slowdown and you can play offline!! Absolutely love the game. Only down side is the worry of repetitivness of the game but i guess only time will tell"

    "description" : "Eternium is an amazingly fun and beautifully crafted Action RPG, reminiscent of the great classics.Eternium stands out from other mobile Action RPGs by its effortless “tap to move” and innovative “swipe to cast” controls, and its player-friendly “no paywalls, never pay to win” philosophy.With the exception of a couple of online-only features, the game can also be played offline after the content download completes.Drawing signs to cast spells is easy and rewarding. The tap-to-move control is more natural and relaxing than thumbsticks, and it’s also truer to the vintage point-and-click Action RPG experience.The game can be really played for free, as more than 90% of our players do. Purchases are completely optional. Gems, the game’s main currency, can be collected from enemies and quests. There is no limiting stamina or energy. The best things in the game are obtained by playing, not paying.Eternium has been launched in 2014, and is actively being improved by the original development team. Through years of polishing, and feedback from millions of players, the quality of the game has steadily increased, making it now one of the highest rated games on all app stores.As of fall 2017, major new features are in advanced stages of development, including real-time multiplayer, town portal, and a fourth world.Enjoy the visceral satisfaction of responsive, fast-paced combat, with spectacular special effects, pleasing sounds, rewarding damage numbers, all set against immersive backdrops and atmospheric, inspiring music scores.Play as a Mage, Warrior or Bounty Hunter, wielding a sword, axe, staff or gun. Level up to learn new abilities and increase your attributes.Battle skeletons, zombies, automatons, aliens, demons, dragons and many other creatures, across three beautifully hand-crafted worlds, or in endless generated levels.Venture into dark caves and dungeons, explore forests, villages and graveyards, lay siege to demon controlled castles, brave snowy mountain peaks, travel to the moon to slay strange creatures among craters and canyons, and beyond, to the deserts, pyramids and jungles of the red planet.Open treasure chests to loot gold, gemstones and battle gear.

I DONT WANT MY RANKING TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF LUCK.  +Ima a REAL RISK FAN. I have purchased everymap package available. Its fair priced and affordable.The new maps are too easy in my opinion. MAKE MORE MAPS I'LL PAY idc jus MAKE them MORE Challenging",
        "Time and time again a attacking army with 22 troops defeats a defending army of 22 troops and only losses 4 when the defending army is ment to have the upper hand . Also the game is full of cheaters with two profiles in one game so you cant win. Don't waste your money and time this game is dead there are less and less real players left. They dont care about cheaters just money.",
        "The algorithm used to determine rolls / battles is horrible.  After less than 200 games, I have lost over 20k troops, while destroying only 16k.  That amounts to nothing more than a piss poor design.  Unfortunately I paid for this app, so I am stuck with it.   Game definitely isnt worth the price paid.  Don't make the same mistake I made.",
        "This game is great but it could be so much better.   1. The expert AI is too easy to beat. Risk players normally gang up on an opponent, if they are dominating. There should be a legendary option.  2. It would be nice to have a match summary and timeline at the end of a game.    3. There should be an auto-save game feature when playing against the AI, in case the game drops out.  Edit: They seem to have addressed my third point.",
        "Very unfair, questionable dice rolls against computers, obviously rigged so that on single player you can never win, and then online it pits you against people who are expert when you're a beginner so you can clearly never win. Very rigged, fun when you get the chance to play which is once every 12 hours due to them asking you to buy the premium version. Highly unfair",
        "This is a very frustrating game. Every single time I play my turn (in a multi-player game that is) I get disconnected! .. and I've to replay it again .. only to get disconnected again! and so on and so on till my time runs out. Sometimes in the middle of all this 'replaying' I even lose my troops to other players .. VERY FRUSTRATING! And No .. I've both a very good data and wifi connections."

And then there is that glitch that happens a lot of times when you try to start a race and it uses your fuel but never starts, and that happens consistently. Please consider fixing the problems.",
        "I first got this game because it seemed interesting and whatnot, but I then completed the tutorial and went on to race other people but when I pressed the race button, I lost 20 energy but I didn't go on to race anyone or do anything else really. I then pressed to race button again and again and nothing happened other than me losing all of my energy. I don't know why this happened but I'd like compensation, thank you.",

It makes me think that you're not receiving enough money from your offers. Oh, and by the way, your offers are terrible. Nobody is going to buy things fairly priced. We want bargains, and less advertising."

        "Really fun game. My 2 year old adores Hank. The only thing that I feel is missing is a way to save your progress to the cloud. My phone needed to be reset a couple times and we had to start over. Didn't mind so much because hank as a puppy is much cuter.",
        "I like this new update. Hanks now have His own happy meter like Tom and Angela. Nice. Also this is just my suggestion. Can you guys also make My Talking Ben and My Talking Ginger. Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that's it. You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It's not fair. Lastly good job guys.",
        "Great game, probably best talking animal game out for adults n kids... but sometimes u watch a video so u can spin the wheel n win gems or coins but the wheel not always comes up... ive had approx. 20x it has not happened in last 4 hrs... would like it redeemed n fixed plz...",
        "I like my talking tom and I download this one thinking that it will have some fun stuff like play mini games I know this one have a picture feature but man only eat, pet, sleep , and pics? Sorry I am re-downloading my talking Tom and start from scratch that only take pics feed and sleep on this game",
        "My three year old grand daughter got around my password and charged $40 of in app purchases and did a monthly subscription, too. I have gone through everything to try to remedy this, with no help from the customer service from the this apps developer.",
        "I'm only on level 1 wrong so correct me if im wrong but I thought the game was a bit boring at first and the game doesn't seem to give you much choice andyou have to folow what it says but if you enjoy the game thats great! I also did like that u got stickers for taking pics. I did end up having to uninstall the game as it took up to much storage space D: Overall I did really enjoy the game yay =D"

        "Nice game but not enough moves, get blocked out every few minutes. Tried to charge my card without my authorization. Takes forever to get enough points to decorate. Too bad as it as the potential of being a very good. Not designed to let you play for free but wants $$$ to get very far. Uninstalling even tho I really enjoy playing.",
        "This game is awesome! Can't stop playing it! It is easy and fun to play. Downloaded it last night and couldn't put it down. And I am back on it again this morning. I love! just absolutely love it. The graphics on it are totally amazing to. Great game u have got here. So when r u coming out with more like this.",
        "There seems to be some bugs and balance issues. Example: level 4 you collect yellow things but none were dropping. Also when placing plants on pool the box for the choices disappeared and I had to exit the game and go back in then I could chose my plants. I have to tap the \"do it\" button several times before it registers. All in all though, pretty good game with great graphics. Looking forward to future updates.",
        "Damn, I cant stop playing this game. Its too addictive. You should put a warning sign upfront or at least write on the description. Now I have lost my youth, I demand a time refund!",
        "Oh it's frustrating. ..In 46 lvl when playing, no match 4 times in 1 time, again playing that lvl again no match 3 time oh!!!..seriously😡..sequence just going wrong way ..really disappointed",
        "I decided to download this game based on the user reviews, but there was one thing that players did not mention and it's driving me crazy. English is obviously not the language of these game developers and it shows. It is absolutely abysmal, both in grammar and vocabulary. Some of the statements don't even make any sense and since a storyline is important to me this makes Royal Garden Tales more than annoying. Please have someone edit the language!  The graphics are fine and the music is pleasant and I do like the creation of the little booster characters within gameplay. I don't believe I have ever seen this before and it's very cute. I love any game with a fairy in it, but Lulu is pretty annoying and there is some sort of glitch that causes her to constantly repeat herself. Time will tell, but I suspect this game is going to be uninstalled soon. I don't expect companies to automatically create games for English-speaking players. However, if a game has been created in English it should at least be somewhat accurate. If this was fixed I would be much happier with the game."

        "It s a good game , by a good company,many options (that many options that I have not tried each and every one!) But I have rated it 3 stars as:- no 1:- there comes an ad after each and every nail you design , sometimes even after every step you do! Due to that one star Gone and no 2 :-When you are making designs on the nail , you cannot make strips , hearts , umbrellas and stiff you can design with shiny nail polish , I wish we could do that also and now because of these two things , two WHOLE stars gone , only three stars left.",
        "Buyer beware, I purchased the \"unlock all manicures\" option less than a year ago, not only to unlock options but also to remove Ads for my kids. It's less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed.",
        "I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn't get me board everytime i have different desins to do.",
        "A really nice game which also got me hooked up! Nevertheles, it frequently and automatically shuts down, deleting what was there.....this really broke my litlle sister's heart, even mine. For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....",
        "Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!",
        "I  am finally at the final last level! Before I thought it was boring but after I reached some levels farther I thought it was awesome! And it is the best game ever! YEAH!!!!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💙💙💚💚💛💛💜💜💗💗❤❤ AND when I was playing my 1st game all things were opened but when I played in my small sister's tab all, things were closed! I got everything for free!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"

        "I really think that this game is perfect. I gave it 3 stars only previously because an account rating sync issue. But the feedback of the developer and the fact that he ask to help customer even the free users just let me speechless. Good work guys. Forget the issue i restarted a new account it is a pleasure to play it again and kudos for the feedback. Hat off from algeria",
        "One of the best games I have ever played. Trust me I play a lot of bad and cheap games that only look good on the photos. But this game is unique and very interesting. the graphics are very nice and the gameplay is good. If I could. I would give the game 6 ;) But I have a proposition to make, can you reduce the cost of blueprints for the ships? Thank you, keep up with the amazing work. Keep updating!!!",
        "Initially it was really good... some of the buttons are a bit clunky and need to be pressed more than once before you get a response.   However, the multiplayer feature with friends seems to have stopped working. This is the main reason I play it. We can see each other are online but when we challenge and accept it says the game doesn't exist. So rather disappointed! Shame...  Still doesn't work!!!",
        "I love classic battleship so I love this game and the online multi-player option.  Also love the fact you can use air planes or space ships  .. only thing I wish they'd add is,  after you get so far into the game start slowly getting all types of upgraded turns,  like after beating 50 people online get missels that attack 6 places at once but only get to use every so often,  and more upgrades like that ... like extra bad ass turns .. but only get so many per game, An upgrade l but I'd pay money for",
        "I see that you have added a new anti-cheat software update..hope very much it works..hopefully it can put a stop to certain players adding 30-40 thousands overnight and moving up the tables drastically..I play a lot of games..a lot..so I know its practically impossible...once maybe..but not all the time..thank you..",
        "I'd like to make a suggestion. So far you have the traditional battleship, an air force version and a spaceship version. I just thought it would be cool to have ancient warships next, like the Chinese junk or the Greek trireme. Even better if you could choose your nation (personally I'd like to use the Chinese junks). Just my two cents. :)"

        "I absolutely love love LOVE this game. Im no bot i swear. This game is so addictive. Gameplay is great. A few suggestions however. Sometimes i find my \"sword\" just going right through some fish, and it doesnt kill them. Also, maybe switch up some ways to get Stars. I find myself saving so much to get the 99k sword fish and never buy any other fishes. I feel like the players should work their way up slowly and not have to play with only the \"daily reward\" fishes. Just my suggestion  Thank you guys!",
        "Great game! I really doubt the online mode is actually online though. All the players play the same way, no variety. Usernames look like they're from some random username generator, you never see ppl interacting like spinning and goofing around. I named myself spin if ur real, and nobody spun. Not cool if you guys are false advertising. Also fix ur leaderboard, it doesn't work. Also the game doesn't count a lot of my kills.",
        "This game is very glitchy and the controls are unresponsive and the gameplay is very bad when it's glitching. When it's not glitching it's very fun. (Also to many spawn killing problems) and the online mode does not seem online. The leaderboard does not work and you die in the most stupid of ways, your sword thong toys them doesn't kill them but then they don't touch you and you  die",
        "Smash was a bit too hard since its such a small area with way too many people, the boost reload time should be decreased by about 0.2s, and you should make the stars more easier to get. But overall the game is pretty good",
        "Great game, good servers, rarely any lag, and addicting. However, the price for characters is pretty steep, their not even worth buying since you'll get better daily characters by the time you have enough stars to buy a good character. Save up for the end game characters. Also, the left joystick is fairly close to the edge of the screen and makes it a little hard to stay on the screen. You get use to it after a while but it would be nice to have other control setups or custom controls.",
        "THIS APP DOES ACTIVITIES BEHIND YOU BACK AND SLOWS YOUR PHONE DOWN. Even with the app killed from processes it still occasionally gives a toast 'pixel swordfish stopped working'. No other app I've ever installed behaves this way and I'm a power user. I have no time or energy to investigate this further. I'm happy just to get rid this piece o' crappa.."

Really fun to play, this is the longest time I've ever played such a game in my phone. Absolutely love it!",
        "this game is good till about 8 hours in where your waiting days to build anything. Gems are really hard to come by so you have to be wary about how much stock u have. And there's no way to dispose of unwanted items in your warehouse (that I know of) but yeah, it's a catchy game",
        "Pretty much a money pit. It's designed to frustrate you into spending money. Everything takes stupid amounts of resources to build or expand. The expansions are tiny. It becomes impossible to fill orders because they all want items you can't make because you cant build anything. Caravans usually ask for ridiculous amount of things and you have no storage room. Everything takes too long to make or regrow so even if you have room, the caravan times out. And the rewards for filling them is measly. It'll still take weeks to get enough to defeat monsters that block expansions. Don't download if youre looking for a fun game.",
        "I liked this game, and have played it for months, until a few days ago when I noticed the \"price\" of buildings required to progress take a huge jump up!! I will gladly support a game I like by making purchases but I'm not about to spend my house payment just to progress IN A GAME!! Not cool, and makes me regret the money Ive spent so far. On to the next!!",
        "Question why do I have to give 30 diamonds for one shield? And Everytime I expand my barn it on expand from 5-10 I need more room then that over then that.. I wake up out my sleep just to play this game. I need more space please and Thank u.",

The game is the best dude the only thing for an update you might be working on is putting new songs, like undertale songs, check those out, FNAF 6 songs are already out, also check out those! I like the cool sounds but just make them a bit more of a smooth sound to make it calm and nice not loud and ugly, thank you Opala Studios! If i were you, i would love this kind of an update!!!",

This can be done by a special doctor - dentist. We present to your attention an exciting game for children - a dentist (vet clinic). In this entertaining game, your child is a real dentist, under the guidance of which there is a hospital for animals. The kid is entrusted with a very important and responsible task - the treatment of teeth of his four-footed pups, whose teeth began to ache heavily because of their love for sweets. You have to treat them in a real dental office, use various medical instruments, such as tongs, scalpels, Burmashin and many others, to clean your four-legged friends of teeth from plaque, align them, do operations, remove cavities and fill them.

Too much a pain in the ass when you get stuck on a floor cause you can't beat the boss with current gear but you need to advance to get better gear.",
        "Wow.. I though it an RPG game.. Well ur role is to create an account and that's it... All auto, game play (if any) is rushed..no time to savor the game.. what so ever.. U keep getting full bags.. When u try organizing, it full again in before u finish...and much more.. In my opinion.. It's not a really a game..  well just money sucker maybe.. (Just my opinion).",
        "Picked this game up because it looked kind of like Nonstop Knight, and I liked Nonstop Knight. Unfortunately, it's not LIKE Nonstop Knight, it IS Nonstop Knight. It's a lazy reskin of the same game with more micro transactions bolted on.  Don't waste your time. Nonstop Knight is more fun and it won't do everything in its power to drain your bank account.",
        "Stay away from this game all it does is rollback after you do stuff in game it's so great to get to lvl50 3 days in row to just be knocked back to lvl47 3 plus times a day.  They steal items gained, don't bother to reset attempts, just waste of time.",
        "The gms in this game care nothing for their players. There was a \"rollback\" bug that liked to remember everything you spent, but not any of the rewards or achievements you recieved. After losing over 4k gems, multiple pieces of advanced gear, a very rare talent, countless forge points, and even a rare pet, they decide to give everyone 1000 gems as a \"shut up, take this even though we know you lost so much, but we aren't doing anything else to keep our players\" as a reply pretty much.  The game it's way to buggy and full of support that just doesn't care about their players are all. I would never suggest playing this game to anyone.",
        "As promised here's my edit. The latest update seemed to resolve the issue, at least for me. Although I see in chat others are still having the issue so hopefully this will get resolved for good. Thank you for your speedy service."

        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info.",
        "The game is a lot of fun if you are willing to put A LOT of time into grinding things out. They have made huge changes for just quality of life things, but they have kept the core game the same. Grind, grind, grind, grind, and grind some more. You can get everything in the game just by playing it. No need to pay anything. However it would be a lot easier if you could spend 1000$ on the game every couple weeks lol."

It's really disappointing how much that one thing has made me abandon the game and uninstall.",

I think it happend when the anniversary update hit and I put them in a time challenges during the time.  When I prestige and go to the time challenges it goes straight back to the main menu. And when i do have hero's  in the adventure mode it cuts to them when I pick the time challenges.  Please fix this.  And also happy anniversary 😀   Problem was fixed thank you very much!😊",

That being said even tho this game uses ads for it's reward system it's actually quite pleasant, at no point did it become ridiculous or over the top. I really do appreciate how much of a back seat it it feels like the adds are taking to gameplay.",

I find myself loading up the game multiple times a day to grab the free chest as well as to push through another couple waves before my next prestige. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in this genre!",
        "Update: Ads are broken. I watched almost any that were presented to me in order to get farther faster but now they literally always load up a few seconds, then the game like restarts and I get jack from it. Dudes! Please fix, I am so very rarely addicted to a game like I am/was with this!!  Literally the best clicker/idle game I've ever played. I was glued to my phone for all of my free time five days straight because new and awesome stuff kept getting unlocked.",

When crossing finish line game keeps playing and doesn't finish, time runs out and you've lost. Please fix",
        "The car will control itself... If you hold left it will turn left for a period but will start to try and straighten up... To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed",

        "Good game, really fun. On season 7 the 6th drift game you cant pass it. When you cross the finish line it says wrong way and doesnt let you finish the gane to get the last star. You end up doing 4 laps, even with 20 secnonds still on the clock. Please fix the issue so I can complete the season",
        "Kinda hate the drift feature, like the car just auto drifts in the direction u turn. This gets annoying too since u can't turn normally when needed and the car just starts drifting, making u hit more obstacles. Graphics are good, my phone can handle the very high settings so I haven't played on the lower settings.",
        "Love the game. However, after finishing the race, an ad pops up and after closing it, the screen is all black and it stays that way. It happened to me a number of times. The stage is complete but I didn't get any of the cash rewards or the cards. Please fix this or at least give me the rewards I didn't get. Will give it a 5 stars then."

        "Enjoyed it at first, and short adverts were expected, but recently adverts have become longer, and now last longer than the game. The latest video advert lasted inbetween games lasted 8 mins....ridiculous!!!. I understand the need for adverts, but if you can't play the game, the adverts are pointless, espeacially if it makes players quit.",
        "I just wanted to play Tetris. Happy to pay for it, was hoping I could pay a $5-10 purchase price and then have the game and play it to my liking. No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It's TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred",
        "Great game, but there's an annoying window that pops up everytime I try and start a new marathon. The window is pretty much useless and wastes my time. Would give this 5 stars if it gets patched",
        "Great game and builds on. The original. The only thing stopping it getting the 5* rating is that the ads on it are sometimes several minutes long and at times when they have finished you can't return to the game. I don't mind watching them as I know that's what funds it, but they are putting me off playing now.",
        "Trying to play Tetris with these abysmal touch and swipe controls is an absolute abject mess. Just add some virtual buttons in, since your loot-boxing asses are supposedly so focussed on 'player choice' lately."

        "This is an extremely fun game. O have a few suggestions on how to fix things on the game. I noticed three things while playing this game. 1. There is not a continue playing option. This can easily be fixed and with all of the great work from Dvloper I think that this is not too far away. 2. I noticed you can uncrouch in the tunnel in the basement even though you are not all the way through. 3. Everything is in a certain place. If one object is in a certain place then if you are familiar with the game enough you will know where the other objects are. To be honest this is not a minor concern but still could be fixed. Other than that I can't stop playing! Thank you so much!!",
        "I love this game, especially when you hide just in time and there's that tense moment wondering if she saw you. I get chills down my spine when I'm hiding and I hear her saying \"I see you\". If I could, I would give this game 100 stars. I would suggest having a mode after you beat Granny to become Granny because I think it would be cool to chase the player around the house. Also, I think the game would benefit from a much bigger house, more drawers and of course, more locks. Love the game, keep up the good work.",
        "It's really really really fun game.  But I think if you guys do some more improvements so it will be much fun.  Here's what I think:  1. I think you should make the house much bigger.  2. You should add more enemies for example:  child o' slenderina,  slenderman and the spiders.  3. You should add an Adventure mode.  Where you need to find some books or something like an emblem like that stuff to make them uncursed like that.  4. Last but not least, you should add more weapons for example:  Pistol,  sword,  injection etc.    If you do that,  it will be super cool and fun.   ThanQ 😃👍",
        "It's definatly one of the better (more fun) horror games on the store, but I feel like there could be some more improvements. Firstly I think that if you've completed hard than there should be an (almost) impossible mode. Also minor details such as different textures and Easter eggs would be good. Last, I think that when you escape there should be an outside section where it's still got puzzles but it's more about the atmosphere. (Maybe that could just be for the \"impossible mode\") but it would make the game a lot more enjoyable. Also maybe a reward for escaping. (For incentive). Thank you and maybe you could take this into consideration :) also new app icon plz",
        "Who doesn't love this game? It's bone chilling and exciting for the whole family (Litterally my whole fam plays this game) it would be cool to have a mode where there was no granny just to explore the house and get a feel for how to escape. Also some weapons to attack granny. Lastly a map of where granny is would be super cool. Good luck!",
        "It's a vary good game so hood i can't believe it's on mobile game! Also the game mechanics are so amazing as well. Then there's series of things you have to do that keeps you in the game for a long time; the theme and music fit the atmosphere, and there's not much of a problem with the game either. \"This game gives me goosebumps!\" (From Dashigames aka Dachi) he loves it as well too. #goodgamemakemore"

        "I love to play hold em, but it's just to hard to round up the posse for poker night due to simply getting older. Life takes everyone n different directions. Not too mention, having kids and getting married, doing the family thing. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love living the family life with my wife and kids but I will always miss poker night with the fellas. Now that I have stumbled upon WSOP I have been able to invite all of the fellas to join and we can all play together still once again. THANK U!!!!",
        "Seen to many players leave because of this. Players with over a billion in chips. Goes to a small table with players having 30k or 40k. Goes all in every hand and kills the table. Players ask him why he does it and not play bigger tables. His answer because game allows me to and I can knock out player after player. Regulate players if they have X amount of chips play on bigger tables. Let the smaller players gain chips and enjoy the game.",
        "It appears that I have reached a certain point where my free play is being met with bot resistance. I've gained over ten million in one day and lost it all and more in suck outs. This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you'd have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun",
        "Win a bit and loose everything in a few hands...  Once you win a good hand, leave the table.  Dealer will not give a a chance.  After this review, I received an e-mail from the designer assuring me, that game is fair.  I have been losing several hands with pocket KK, QQ, JJ, and so for.  So I stand with my original review.   Win on a good hand and leave game.  Or else you will lose it ALL!",
        "This is a good game , only prob I have is there seems to some hackers/botting which makes it a little hard to play. Now as far as some people's comments even if the  people with a billion chips come to smaller tables , if you all knew how to play you wouldn't have to worry about them taking your chips. Trust me the majority of them started out at low tables also having to have to fight the ones with more money. I have been playing this game for a few years and love it.  Like I said only problem I have is to many bots/hackers.",
        "I really enjoy this game .At first I just added it for one of the games on app like to gain points for gift cards.And of course to learn how to play poker. Now if their no points given for this game I would still play it. I totally enjoy this game , and the people that play it. Its truly an enjoyable game. This game is a keeper know matter what.tthe only thing I wish is that their was more coins given ."

        "So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn't find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren't extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don't know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I'm not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.",
        "I loved the original. I've gotta say though, the part with the wizard dying and the endless mode game over scene is kinda sad. Also i found a glitch, if you go to tournament mode and select an icon you haven't unlocked yet and then go to the main menu. You can go back into tournament mode and you'll have the icon even though you didn't unlock it.",
        "Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it's not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I've survived 24 nights but I don't even have the achievements for\"survive 5 nights\". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don't because some of the zombie achievements I'm not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I'm currently at 59. GG!",
        "Addicting game. At start It's easy but It becomes Quick impossible, unless indeed you buy some gems. So It gave me some frustrations but too quickly. Sorry for my notation, Because really It's good work dudes!",
        "Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh",
        "Brilliant game kept me occupied for hours I loved it! I think what seperates this from the test of the stick man games is that you are able to control one of the warriors or miners and you can move them around or fight when them. Absolutely love it! Wish it was longer as I completed canoeing on hard in 67 minutes, please make more and more upgrades and skill points!! Fantastic game!"

        "Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it's just my phone. Also I'm not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)",
        "I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the \"mine\" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it's nicely done!",
        "I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.",
        "Overall the app is really great. It's the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you're not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.",
        "Input delays keep getting me killed. Instead of marking a bomb my input sets it off. I'd prefer two different inputs for marking or removing tiles.  I'm using a stylus too so I know it's not an issue of accidentally hitting the wrong tile.",
        "Great game. Love it! Sometimes the flag wouldn't place when you pressed a square, and once it selected a square instead of placing a flag, but I still really liked it. Wish there was a zoom because the mini square field is a ton of fun, but a bit small for my fingers. I still love the game though!"

        "Perty good Edit: We're in the middle of an event and the game won't load. Finally says down for maintenance. It would be nice to get a heads up on when that happens. Gonna put a hindrance on the event that's over on Friday. Do hope it's resolved soon. Still like the game tho, but would like it better if I can play.",
        "Well a very basic game, as any other idle game. Has no real extra things that would wow you. Notifications less than a minute after closing the app (or simply pressing home) can get very annoying. As if I need a notification to tell me I closed the game.",
        "Right.  First off, If you are not a fan of Idle games, then don't play. This is the epitome of an Idle game.   The Early game is pretty simple. Click, Collect, Make your way to Level 80. You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn't bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn't been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event's are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events'  All in, pretty good.",
        "Well guess they deleted my last post cause I complained that the game took up 1.8 gig till I uninstalled it and reinstalled it then lost my saves because of bad programming.   Don't waste your time or money on this company.",
        "One of the best \"tap\" games. Love the satirical theme. Who would have thought that politics and money were SO interconnected😁. Just to be clear to some, I AM being sarcastic!!!! Great time waster. And that's NOT fake news.",
        "They put so many buttons to purchase things ion the main screen. When tapping as is the nature of the game, it brings up confirmation for your purchases. If you're trying to play fast, you could easily spend $20 in mere seconds without noticing. Put all the purchases in one place instead of cheating players."

Until i close the app and restart it Tried making a fresh Charecter and goes straight into other characters but just not my main.. This started happening an hour ago",
        "I can't get certain menus to work. In shop its the purchase for mount gear, all i see is random text and it freezes the game. Some of the event menus do the same. Ive been playing for a little over a year and never had this problem. Please help.  Also the merit shop menu is broken. I can't buy anything and the event ends today. Ill update as I see other menus broken.",
        "This game sucks.. I always get thee same armament with only one star!  and some items are soo expensive that the money you pay is not worthy for the br you get and in return you'll get low br and also low money not worthy.. If they make this game less expensive maybe I'll give it a four stars... But no! not this time",
        "Makes you pay good money to be strong then merges you with much older servers that allows a no pay player to be much stronger ... horrible customer service also! Edit 3\\18 I see Gatorcade replied to this saying contact them for help. I did 8 days ago with no reply... So yeah like I said horrible customer service",
        "I paid money on This game only for it to stop working once I did...plunder doesn't open for me, mounts won't open for me...assassins creed play won't open...if I do open them....game immediately freezes and I have to shut down. Funny how I pay money and now I have Chinese characters all over the damn game...  THIS is absolutely a pay to play game...except when you pay...the game apparently stops working....",
        "Hey guys.. So when I try to level up my mount I click on the icon and when it comes up most of it is blank except a few words in another language. It freezes the screen so I have to close out and sign back in. Also I can't get anything on plunder either. Some help would be greatly appreciated, thank you."

        "Was an awesome game Very addictive game! Was well done.. until the update. Needs more pens and new themes as I have thousands of coins but nothing left to unlock. Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don't register as pineapple hits for the counters. There's a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it",
        "Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.",
        "Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.",
        "Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.",
        "BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn't have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What's bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I'm not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game.",
        "How can I say this? I can not stop playing this!! Everytime I set a new and higher record I want to achieve and I only stop until I get there xD atm with 6400 coins and everything unlocked 😁😁 please release new content for months and months!! It will make me so happy! Thank you for this game."

        "Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.",
        "There's always a bug when there's about to be substitution of players causing the players in possession of the ball to run like headless chicken. Pls fix that. Add SULLEY MUNTARI of Deportivo La Coruna to the game pls. 'Need FTS18 with embedded dream league soccer ffs! Seems many players who have their current teams in the game are missing. Lawrence Ati of Sochaux in Ligue 1, Joe Dodoo, and many more. A quick update with massive changes will be great 'cause the game currently sucks!!!",
        "Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don't get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a \"Create a Player\" option under 'My Club' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It'd be so nice if you add that.",
        "Look what I experienced. Dls needs development. The commentry needs more reasonableness and intelligence. The behaviour of each player, at least the famous ones should be unique. Controls need more improvement. Add real team logos for the opponent teams. Update players team data according to the recent transfers. And one more issue, while playing local multiplayer we need an extra device to connect two phones. This is a bad experience. If we can connect with each other simply by connecting wifi and hotspot of the two phones respectively, it would be great and simple.",
        "This game is awesome overall. But some changes could be made like adding German league players (especially AUBAMEYANG though he's moved to England) and when you face them leagues top players( in the game) you could add the legends like Pele, Maradona, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and others. Hoping to see these changes in the next update. Thank You!",
        "I will love it if i can send players on loan and be paid some coins instead of directly selling them off. Also switching players for a few or no coins will be great. Since players like pogba likes changing his hairstyles, it will also be great to effect some changes in some players hairstyle. More leagues are needed, if possible, German,  Chinese, Nigerian and south African league. Lastly, commentators find it difficult to call the name of a created player, work on these and this game will be perfect.  Thanks"

When GSN does well I rate it well, when it doesn't, I have to report that too. If you look at the trend of reviews, many see a drop in payouts.",

        "Its nice but theres one problem for me.When i logout and login again the game loading glitches and it wont let me play.Pls cix this glitch but anyway thankyou and its still really fun to play",
        "This game is for people who love to be stuck in time, since this game came out there hasn't been any proper updates except from adding new unnecessary stuffs to the game so kids can waste their money on, the time limit in the game is 4mins for either team battle or free for all; this has been the way thia game has been for years since i started play the game anything new in the game is all about spending more money, what tyoe of developers are you guys? Do you even play the game? It gets more boring every second, the are no proper changes no organization of your weapon and other stuffs in the game... It takes like 2+ minutes to change to another outfit because the list is too long, YOU DEVELOPERS NEED TO FOCUS ON THE GAMEPLAY AND NOT NEW ITEMS... Add in squad battles so it can be more competitive and allow people to be able to see their stats and then players will care more just look at what other games are doing in 2018 and don't get stuck in time...GOODLUCK"

I would much rather pay a one time license fee that this crabby implementation of user annoyance  / advertising. The other problem is that on the high end phones (read pixel 2) the board are so big that the tiles as a consequence are made very small so they fit with a final result that makes it very difficult to see/read",
        "The ads are very annoying and I have lost interest in playing  the game anymore. I have to start over for each play. Ad won't let me continue. Someone has Really messed this game up. Just fire their butts and send them down to the river swamp. No need for them to be in the public when they can't leave well enough alone.",
        "I think the game is great. I love Mahjong. I'm unhappy that I paid 1.99 to stop the ads but when I collect my 2,000 coin bonus I still have to watch an ad to receive the bonus. I will not be paying 1.99 next month just to still have to watch ads.",

        "Loved this game!!! It is my new favorite game I love all the powerful weapons and armor. I wish there was chestplates instead of amulets and leggings instead of bracelets and an easier way to find out what your hero level, But else then that it was perfect. I loved how you can choose the controls to your own preference. Chame on anyone who gave it a less then 5 Star review. I still dont know ho to tell what your hero level was but still my favorite game.",
        "I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there's only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can't beat them! Keep making more awesome games!",
        "I can't help but love a mobile game that doesn't constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it's tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.",
        "I'm really loving this game it's simple but still a ton of fun. My one complaint would be the sometimes the grind is too long and I almost gave up... I wish the developers would throw in some kind of experience boost in the store instead of just being able to buy coins. I would pay real money for an exp boost and would love to support the Developers! just give me the chance!",
        "I understand that people want their games to be entartaining. But i dont understand why there is a thing that downgrades your item upon trying to upgrade it. I have soent the last 3 hours trying to upgrade my helm to lvl 15. Guess where it is now, On goddamn lvl 11. I have spent less time grinding mounts in wow than getting my gear to lvl 15. Stupidest thing ever. One tip. Play the campagin lvls to lvl 40. Then dont do campagin at all and run hell for gold and xp. Repeqt to lvl 80 and then get rekt by the stupid item upgrade system."

The reason I gave it only 1 star is just to seek your attention because I wanted u all to add an effect of sound of engine as the car speeds up which will make the game really more realistic.

        "03-23-18: HOLY SHEET THE SCI-FI UPDATE IS CRAZY AMAZING! Outerminds has done it again! I wish they made more unique celebrations (like SciFi) other than Christmas or Valentine's in the future, such as Easter or even a Video Game Mashup update. It is time to rewrite my review!  So far, it's my favorite time-waster in my device. Never utilizes the Pay2Win paywalls for the most of the time (It's one of the best non-Pay2Win apps in the era of Pay2Win), and never crashes at all! Bugs aren't frequent! There are easy ways to save Bux and Brains in the game, which gives almost every player the opportunity to customize without any problem.  The game is hugely customizable. It's like being a home designer and a Tuber at the same time. There's lots of different customization options for your room, Tuber, and stuff. I also love to switch to a certain theme during events like SciFi or Valentine's Event.  And next, the videos. You can name your videos whatever you want, and you can select a combination of genres. You could make hilarious titles like \"PewDiePie Plays His Game\" or \"Edgar The Rapper\". And then you can pretend to act them out.  One of the best parts of the game is that there are almost no annoying popup video/banner ads, unlike in most games I've played like Vlogger Go Viral. The only way to view them is to simply go for a free shipping boost by watching an ad (which does not interrupt gameplay. Watching ads is also in Quests too, and it's fine as well.)  I like the Puggle minigame as well. It doesn't make the game feel boring as it can help boost shipping time while being a playable Pachinko with Edgar and Maya.  The game's community is also very cool. No cancerous fights or something, many players of this Tuber Simulator mostly focus on hatching Pixelings, participate in room contests, and get tips on how to grind Bux! Check out the Google+ semiofficial community as well.  Probably the greatest Tuber game on the web, Outerminds. I'll send you a Sponsor Eagle filled with \"Good Job\" messages. Keep your game as good as possible, there's no time to lose in beating PewDiePie to his #1 spot!",

This would fail state regulations on gambling games. Fun but a sucker game for rolling anything that counts as statistically random",
        "This is fun, IF you can figure it out. I like playing yahtzee but this is complicated. Every time I get extra dice, the ???? spends them or takes them away from me so I don't get to spend them the way I want to. That sucks.",
        "Love the game! But recently did an update for the app now my game glitches out. Takes forever to roll the dice. Only updated the app cuz it said they fixed bugs & made faster well it did the opposite for my app.",

It's too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.",

Second, the controls don't suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.",

        "Very realistic and nice game. Missions and descriptions are entertaining. Controls are also great.   Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!",
        "Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!",
        "Great game but more issues to address.  The longer flight durations are a real waste of time,  make them more challenging rather than waiting for the destination. Also add more controls as the ones we have are not effective. How do you tell me to slow down yet i don't have the option for that?",
        "Its quite good but a little bit of fixing will do. The part \"Slow Down thing\" can you please please place that where it can not block the view of the player. It is very difficult to see whats behind it so it causes us players to crash. T.Y",
        "Why the hell they add brake when we cannot see the brake option even after landing which forces us to crash. Total stupidity do not waste time in downloading. Previously was better when there were no brakes just reverse it and stop or keep brake button always active.",
        "Its really boring... You have to do missions you cant just fly around and do whatever you have to fly through the squares and make it to the end... And who wants stripes?! Why are they so important?! Plus its really hard to control!!"

        "Candy crush is an Awesome addicting Game, Same with soda. Jelly is fun, BUT!, It is the most cheating game I have ever played. The AI will always take advantage of beating you with moves that will take what you need 98% of the time. Moves that no one can see but magically the AI knows what to choose to beat you. I love strategy games, but cheating is not a fun for anyone. The AI compition is not a compition. It's a slaghter waste of time until you get lucky or they give it too you. No strategy there. Just piss you off cheating AI. Being the top of Candy Crush and Candy crush soda. And yes also Jelly. It is ridiculous sometimes to waste my time with this one. If the AI opponents played at the highest level of what to use, then I wouldn't mind getting beaten. But when you watch the AI make the dumbest move to get what it needed, tells you that the AI sees the whole board. Even what is hidden. Give up or beat yourself up on this one. I seem to love the Gluten of punishment, lol.",

Watch the number counter not the monklings going under the rope & u will see the counter not go pass a certain number! THE SAME NUMBER continues like 6 will stay 6 4x's! That way u don't beat the level & u have to buy a booster, KING Co are CHEATS!",

I can't even play with guys on my own squad now.  I used to love this game but until they fix this issue this game is weak.",

Would like to see a different method for switching guns. If i swipe on android i accidently swipe and my notification bar comes down instead. Need some better  algorithms for matches. It's tough to get into a match with some super over powered weapons...or are they modding? Would like to see an in game reporting/tagging system for obvious hackers.  There are several who frequently hack and don't get booted from the game permanently.",
