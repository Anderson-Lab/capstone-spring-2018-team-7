     [ 'I love the game and the vast amount of playable characters, however the sound effects overall aren\'t great but the gameplay is very good. One problem I do have however is that there are in models (such as thanos and Kang) but you can\'t play as them. Personally thanos is easily my favorite marvel character and the fact that I can\'t use him is a little upsetting. But overall its a great game with monthly updates and great new characters! Can\'t wait for more!',
       'Hi. Instead of writing a review, I\'d like to suggest a few things. I\'d love to see these changes in game: Please add these characters-  Fantastic Four, MCU Captain America, MCU Winter Soldier, Scarlet Spiderman, Spider woman, Lizard, Apocalypse,x force wolverine, Wasp, Penance, Nova, Quicksilver, Nick Fury, Silver surfer, Doctor Doom, Galactus .            Edit:  1.Change the type of Juggernaut from Mystic to Mutant. Because he is a mutant 2. Add a range mechanics like you did in Transformers Forged to Fight 3. Please buff Superior Iron man and the regular one too. They shouldn\'t be this weak',
       'Love marvel and this is the most descent game ever been created in the history of mobile games plus I got 5 star scarlet witch and she is OP as hell bruh she is amazing. But however I love black panther the best and hulk is lame as hell.😁😁😁',
       'I was doing trial of infinite when maintainance popped up and now 6 daily boosts and 1 lesser hero boost is wasted. Also i wnt be able to finisH quest without em. Thanks kabam',
       'In short I am a 415K+ rated player and this latest "update."  I use the term "update" sparingly, is total trash. If I could only rate this game and company lower than zero I absolutely would!!!!',

     [ 'I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I\'d end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!',
       'Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It\'s reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series\' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis\'s and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I\'m offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,',
       'I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It\'s fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn\'t want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.',
       'Game it self is great and a ton of fun.   But, the system for showing ads is so annoying.  It\'s not just your normal video ad no, they make you watch 3 different ads and a min of 16 or 11 sec each.  After you have watched the minimum time, you have to hit next and repeat again',
       'Quite addicting. But does have partial microtransaction walls where it\'s extremely difficult to get past certain parts without forking over real money. Other than that it\'s nice. I only have two things that I think could make this game better: 1) boss battles and 2) ability to sort through parts by specific type, rather than just their standard class.',
       'I want to report a glitch. I betted 3 parts, titan, drill, and a repulse. I lost on thd bet, and guess what? The titan car still had that tick on on it, then i got those stickers on the car unlimited. It took me 5 minutes to get back to normal. Please dont use this peopole.' ],

But when I\'m connected to Wi-Fi there\'s too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you\'ll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I\'m playing the game??!! It\'s too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.',
       'Well before I say my review, I would like to clear out a few of the negative reviews. There are not very many ads at all, in fact I barely ever even get any. Second, the controls don\'t suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.',
       'I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don\'t you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?',
       'It\'s stupid. It\'s really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn\'t turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked.',
       'I dont know why people are rating Ketchapp games below 4 stars... I agree games are difficult but one of the unique one\'s in every launch. Their creativity is awesome... Love to play each of their games. Kind of more chanlenging and unique ones',
       'This is an amazing game! But there\'s a tiny problem with the controls: they are hard to be used. In addition, there are so many advertisments and that\'s the only reason I gave 4/5 Stars' ],

     [ 'Enjoyable game, lots of freebies.  I now need to change up my review.i had made a purchase in the game during a "Spin and Win" promotion, that purchase stated that I would receive 10m chips for every 2k league points, at end of promotion, I did not receive any of my chips as promised per promotion advertising. I followed the process of getting in touch with Huuuge Casino and was told once that someone would be in touch with me, as of this listing I still have not heard back from anyone.',
       'I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won\'t give up.. And I\'m not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won\'t put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I\'ll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.',
       'So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em\' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.',
       'DO NOT BOTHER  playing this game. IT IS PAY TO PLAY. It used to be a really great game. Have met some really great people. Huge makes constant updates and each time they do, they pay less. People are leaving in droves to go to other games. YOU BLEW IT HUUGE!!',
       'I really enjoyed playing early on , payouts were nice and I really like the club I\'m in. Lately I\'ve noticed I don\'t get paid for all my winning spins, sometimes they would have been big payouts. Hit the same exact thing a few spins later and it will pay so I have to wind up buying more chips. Just like a real casino I don\'t expect to always win, but if I do hit something even a real casino pays so that needs t o be addressed.',
       'HORRIBLE. The graphics and slots are cool. But what fun is a game that is almost impossible to win at. I say that because I play 5 different accounts and 3 I haven\'t won anything nice in almost 6 months and 2 it\'s been about 3. Bad luck you keep telling me, I say it\'s all the updates you have done. You guys ruined what was once a fun game. If you looking to have fun and win, look some place else. I\'ve been trying for months to establish a descent chip count, not happening on this game' ],

This game could be a good practice for people that just like to play these games, you know?',

U shouldn\'t offer free coins to run other apps if u aren\'t going to give the coins for it. Will probably give up and delete bc of it.  Tried to give it a 2nd chance and did the flash light purchase to get 2268 coins and never got my coins. Why offer free coins if u won\'t give the free coins?',

     [ 'Really liked this when I first started playing. Honestly,there is no point me keeping it now. Can\'t perform my operations,as don\'t have bought staff and ward not on the appropriate level. I can\'t get any new staff,as I don\'t have enough hearts,and once you are at a standstill like this it take FOREVER to earn hearts back. Have loads of cash but nothing to do with it!! Game seems to be designed around getting people hooked initially (as performing operations etc is really fun), but then can\'t continue or progress without purchasing hearts!! Not wasting my time with it any longer.',
       'Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I\'ll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx',
       'Your new update will not let me, or several people it looks like,  get into the game. I am currently doing the 12 day event and am on level 17 please fix it ASAP! I refuse to lose all my progress. This is the best game I\'ve had on my phone in a very long time.',
       'I\'ve played this game a few days now, all of a sudden it freezes and crashes. This file has corrupted my new SD card, has uninstalled it\'s self along with any memory on my sd card.... I even downloaded it again as I expected everything is gone... Gone! Great game just not worth the bugs!',
       'Awesome game but fix recruitment. I keep doing gold recruitment and i have almost all the characters but I only have 5 doctors. I keep getting duplucates. It is like it will not give me a new doctor. You should be able to choose whether you are purchasing a doctor, nurse, surgeon, etc. It is not fair always getting nurses. Thanks. Oh, p.s. I have spent a bunch of money. This game is addictive and hearts should be more readily available.',
       'I will give 4 stars to the game out of 5. It\'s a pretty good game among the others. But the main problem is that I can\'t unlock more departments even if I have money or hearts. I am on 29th level and have a good amount of cash but the departments are locked. So a bit disappointed. Please fix this...' ],

There is a bug that needs to be fixed it is on the gold game mode and it\'s the game that asks you to select which colours are more prominent out of all the squares but the coloured squares don\'t appear. Please fix this as soon as possible because I really enjoy this game.',

       'I really lived thus game because it isn\'t just tapping something but it\'s actually training your brand and improving your attention, memory, logic and your mind in general. If you need help in any of those subjects (or you just like a bit of fun ) I would dwfinately say this is the game for you.',
       'Simple but fun. These games are challenging and do make you use your brain without taking much time. You can play a few levels in just a few minutes easily. Ads are not too bad either, not too obtrusive and are sporadic enough.',
       'This brain definitely makes me feel like the front of my head is working. But the constant advertisements between every few levels is very annoying. Especially when a level takes 15 seconds and the ad runs the same length.  Would suggest the paid version if you like it.',

     [ 'I really like this game, kind of wish the progression system was a bit quicker though, other than that, the tight controls, open world and variety of creatures you can eat make it a solid game. The special sharks look really cool, and I even considered buying one until I saw the 50$ price tag.   On a side note, what\'s the difference between this app and the Hungry Shark World?',
       'i would rate 5 stars... but.. something with the cloud save broke, i used to have the megalodon, without any cheats.. but now i have the mako. could you fix this somehow? And do i email the support team? Im not good with all the emailing stuff.',
       'I thought it was SUPER DUPER AMAZING. Keep that game like this and don\'t change it. But whenever I would eat like a lot, then I don\'t get bigger and it said the more you eat the more bigger you get. So I think you should make that better. If u wouldn\'t have done that then I would be impressed by the game.',
       'Amazing game. I completed this game in 48 minutes Hahaha! Because I used luckypatcher :) I downloaded the luckypatcher in Googlechrome But it can harm your Device..... And the last shark is Moby dick His baby is as big as Megalodon.',
       'The is the most intense game ever.When you think you\'ve got it ,it\'s gone. Can\'t figure out how to boost. Controls aren\'t the best.Rhis game could improve. Oth er than that it\'s fine I guess.Too many pop up ads. Really frustrating. I want to play the game not look at ads. Sometimes  you can\'t back out of the ad.',
       'My apologies for the negative review lately. But to be honest, I have to use VPN just to log-in in Google Play and enable cloud sync or else, I wouldn\'t be able to sync my progress. Just a little request, can you make the gameplay smoother for lower end devices, such as devices with 1GB RAM? It lags frequently during gameplay. Thanks a lot!' ],

     [ 'Two updates in the last two weeks and STILL no new content. I don\'t know quite what your development team is doing, but it\'s evidently bugger all.   And it\'s a shame, because the game is pretty fun. There\'s some interesting level mechanics that I haven\'t seen before, which is always good. The game is colourful and fun, there just isn\'t much of it.',
       'I\'ve been waiting along time for new levels. I love the game but this is getting ridiculous with how long it\'s taking you graphics team to push out the new levels. I\'m no game developer but you guys should be able to give your players an estimated time frame as to when they will be released.',
       'It\'s a great game to play lots off fun. But the only downfall is that you say update to the latest version  np it\'s updated but no new levels what\'s going on waiting at level 60 to play more. What\'s up',
       'It\'s so cute and I\'m stuck on level 60 and I have to wait for new levels... I hope they can be released fast because this game is so fun and cute... Edit: you guys say coming soon and it\'s been 2 updates... When are these levels coming?!?!',
       'Installed the game two weeks ago & breezed through the levels. It was addictive & love the animals! I would love to give it a 5 star rating but the fact that I completed all levels in less than a week & have been waiting patiently for a week for new levels is unacceptable! I play a lot of these games & have never experienced anything like this! It appears that the game developers did not put any thought into how quickly a player can beat 60 levels or how quickly a player will lose interest when new levels are advertised as "Coming Soon"  & it takes weeks or months! It\'s too bad because it really was a fun game! 😐',
       'This is just unreal. The devopers make a game, release it but don\'t finish it. Stops at level 60 which you can get to in a couple of days easily. Game play was good until I got to the end a couple of weeks ago. Been 1 or 2 updates since but no rest of the game' ],

Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can\'t join my sister and were only five levels apart.',
       'Ok It said Hey wanna play? Update your game..... Then when I come to update it it said it\'s updated AND IT IS..Pg2d u r bassically restricting me from playing the multiplayer battles. re u serious rn? Icant play cause i have to update the game when i already did.... Bassically waist of my money to buy new weopons when i cant use them.',
       'This game is the best I have ever played on a phone tons of maps, game modes, hundreds of guns, different tools, gear, and lots of skins. There is just so many things you can do. I also like it because it is a challenge something I would play. That\'s why I rated this game 5 stars.',
       'It\'s fun because I  git to play with school friends, and the gaming is amazing so keep up the good work! But I hate the new update with levels to upgrade you wepons! On upgrade costs more than the gun! Not   every one in the game is rich you know!',
       'This game is great! Even though you have to constantly farm for wins, but it does pay off. I\'m a level 12 in Ruby rank with 👌 guns. I used to have a candy cane baton that killed instantly upon impact, but it\'s not as effective against gold armor. R. I. P. Strategy',
       'I really like it. It\'s fun and entertaining, a highly suggested game in my opinion. Although i would like it if the sandbox mini game had more maps, and more freedom to choose those maps as well. It would also be very appreciated if we could play games with lower leveled players because i really wanna play co-op games with my friend, but she just started the game and it says insufficient levels. It would also be nice if the options of private servers were back in sandbox and you could choose what teams you wanna join in team fight. But otherwise, it\'s really great and easy to play 😄' ],

       'Slotomania is not a game any more...it is a money making scheme for someone....It is just no more fun to play....if you want you can dish out so manny big wins but if you want to be nasty if you don\'t get rated when you get asked for it you can forget to win anything.....The Quest is one big joke because you will not allow us to complete it. The hole game is one big joke you controle everything...I am not going to let you upset me any more like this by making me lose all my coins for not giving you 5 stars....Like i said Slotomania is not a game any more it is a money making bussnis!!!!!!!!! If you want me to win then i win but if you want me to lose then i lose......I sepose i am going to lose very big now!!!!!!',

This will prob be deleted, since they only post the "rosy" reviews, get a different game =this one has LOST any glory it used to have!!!',

I mean when I first downloaded it there was only 6 levels XD  I know that should be a good thing but I can\'t seem to finish them all lol. GREAT GAME!!! DOWNLOAD RIGHT NOW!!! LIKE... RIGHT NOW!!! IT\'S AMAZING AND I BET YOU\'LL HAVE IT FOR AT LEAST 4 MONTHS!!!',
       'Awesome game controls are just great but the only thing I didn\'t like was that the balls other than the normal one was for real money u guys could make the others balls for diamonds that we get during the gameplay  so we could also actually make use of the diamonds  otherwise the game is awesome👍👍👍',
       'This game is fun but one problem.  My ball keeps randomly rolling off the edge for no reason. Plz fix this then u will get 5 stars.',
       'Its definitely no rip off definitely you should try it its amazing and easy to play and I\'ve only had one problem and that the unlimited balls arnt free 😭😭😭😭😭😭 but still love the game ❤😋😋',
       'This game is great. The levels are challenging and fun but personally I think this game could be a lot better if you added a level editor so you could make levels and post them online for others to try. This would totally make your game a lot more exciting and fun.',
       'It\'s a great game, but after about 5 or 6 months it doesn\'t load probably get it but be aware that sometimes it won\'t load I have it and it is terrible that after a short time it won\'t load the game!Please fix this!' ],

IGG is still unbelievably money hungry for their newest released things - but I guess it\'s better to wait for everything or pay for it upfront. I chose option 1. Thank you IGG for making rolling a little more fair.',

It\'s enjoyable to see people have the ability to buy what I worked so hard during the last 3 years for a mere $10. I haven\'t enjoyed this game in months, it\'s a chore to still play. Download only if you\'re willing to drop a fortune.',

Don\'t give me the it\'s random thing. I have never had anything like this until after an update a couple months back. You have obviously changed the system and it is apparently to screw the long timers in favor of generating more $$ but it\'s only making long timers like me BORED and frustrated!! I\'m not spending any more money until it\'s fixed. Tired of wasting cash!',

But other then them 2 changes I think it\'s a great game and I\'ve had lots of fun with it.',
       'The heroes should be for all players from the lower level. They can make their own choice to choose the hero or switch them. If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy? It\'s the strategy game, not for only the big or strong players. Thanks!!...',

It does not take lots of money to complete they game it only takes skill and dedication.

Because it is not much easy to use. I recommend using the normal GOOGLE PLAY sign in method because it is much more appropriate for me. Overall COC have become my life. I also recoomend to have a time limit for coc, like coc automatically switch off if the user plays coc more than 1 hour. Long Live COC!',
       'Its an awesome game. The new concept of supercell id is cool but switching is little time taking. I Would request you guys to make it easier or add some shortcut to switch accounts. Because it is really difficult to change if you are in poor network zone. Plz consider this. Otherwise the concept is really good it saves RAM of phone as u dnt need play games and services updated. 😀' ],

First, if you could upgrade the cars more and you didn\'t have to use the cards. Like us money to upgrade engine parts, buy body kits, etc. And there\'s some kind of a sound glitch.

     [ 'This game was great until about 5 days ago, that is when it started to take 4 to 5 minutes loading time for each game mode to start. Now my attention span prevents me from waiting that long to play one game. What happened game developers?.... !!UPDATE!! Okay it must have just been the servers. Because they\'re back up and running at 32 seconds loading time for a war. This game is great. I can dig it can you dig it',
       'They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It\'s definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you\'ll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.',
       'Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don\'t be fooled. This is a pay to win game.',
       'A great game that brings back the old Mech warrior days. One of the few good theme fps shooters on this platform that is "FREE". You can pay to win but it will cost you alot. Investing afew tens to smoother the growth? But you can still have plenty of fun without spending a dime.  Until it slowly draws you in deeper.....',
       'I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that\'s cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!',
       'Game plays fine. No ability to choose mode is a major letdown. I did the $20 test to see if you can actually buy anything valuable. The answer is no. The game is geared towards the have money people. Update 2/23/2018  The queing is under 10 seconds. After Lunar New Year update you can earn upgrades better.  Discounts on purchase items is better.' ],

BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it\'s not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It\'s just not fair.',

These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.',

       'I loved flow free from a young age. I\'ve played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I\'ve tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs',
       'Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.',
       'Fantastic game. Real addiction game I\'d say. It\'s an awesome time killer. Different types of levels never make the game boring. Graphics is okay. Number of ads for a free to play game is less compared to other games out in the market which is a relief.Overall I would give 4.5/5' ],

     [ 'Nice game. I like the concept of rebuilding but this game was meant to kill time, I hope so. Keep adding characters and what we require is a hell lot of mini games so that they may keep coming and coming and coming. I do not intend to harass you but try to add more and more mini games after each update. I\'m sure that in the course of  time you may be able to compete with the best games ever created but do not make the game larger than DWTD 2. Add more new locations too otherwise we will not be able to consume the tokens. The game is nice because you do not have to consume money for characters and get them through gifts instead. It is also nice because tokens can be collected easily. Please think about my opinions. I❤ this game.',
       'The character models are cute and all, but the games are getting a bit repetitive. WAY too many ads. Like, ridiculously too many. The app forces a couple right after you finish some of the minigames. You have enough to offer us - forcing even more ads on top of that is tiresome. Get rid of them.',
       'Dumb ways to die 3 gets 3 stars. No, seriously, I loved the first 2, but this one is not good. Only 4 minigames, not really different each from another. Remember FASTER FASTER FASTER ? It disappeared (I miss it), and is now ADS ADS ADS. The goal here is just to use money and play as often as you can for ADS ADS ADS. The main thing here ? Minigames ? Nooooo, just getting (or buying) tokens and use them to repair houses (no impact on gameplay). Why would this game be nice ? The graphics are still good. Yes, that\'s all. Have a nice day. ADS ADS ADS',
       'Best game of all time I mean you have to try this or else your life could be boring and lonely the 1st and 2nd are also really good check em out and you can\'t live with out this game. My point is best game ever',
       'To be honest, I don\'t think this game updated at ALL. Dumb ways to die 1 and 2 were GREAT but this one... not so GREAT.  First of all,  there are only for games that you could play.  Second,  it\'s not as creative as the other ones. And third,  the only good thing about it is that for ME there are no ads.  The list goes on but that\'s for you to find out and for me to uninstall. 😐😐😐😐😟😟😟😟😢😭   Im VERY disappointed',

     [ 'Big fan of Beyblade since I was a kid, from the first generation. So this is cool to play this game and see how far its came. Though there are many glitches in the game, this is the second time I\'m gonna have to download because it won\'t open. Overall, it\'s a fun game when it\'s not glitching',
       'Garbage game,is now infinitely looping on a challenge tournament. Once I defeat the first opponent the screen goes black and the game freezes. Reopening the game puts me back in the same match and ends in the same endless loop.   Dev team needs to fired and a patrol of lemurs hired instead because they\'d at least be entertaining.',
       'The game is really good but they should put way more beys and make like when you battle they can knock your bey out of the stadium and get a point from it and add in old version beys and give us a chance to make are own beys if we won\'t to',
       'You really don\'t do anything but press orbs and press to buttons. Plus, just to get cool stuff, you need to go out and buy only beyblade bursts. The game is boring and confusing.',
       'It\'s a really fun game to play and quite addicting too it\'s just I wish it wasn\'t such a large app and in your next update can you make it so that when you have a forge disk with a frame scanned with your beyblade are separate so you can interchange the frame with compatible forge disks like you can in real life',
       'Thanks sooo much Hasbro u added dragoon and everything awesome app love it, but could you add a ring out finish. I know u can don\'t keep it up' ],

Given a legendary atrandom at start a,nd a random rare in chest would be cool was expecting that..but no just normal cards.hope I get  cool legendary one day.like. the chest idea hope you bring in armour card add on.like spear guy could have ice spear or flames.plus that\'s cool extract cards to collect to make your cards even better and unique. Thank you my supercell friend.this game oh almost,st forgot.bbbbbbbeest 2 v 2 game on mobile,!!!!!',
       'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'Well after playing it for so many months. It now has not let me play for about a  week out of no where, it loads to 50% and then it asks to try again later I have uninstalled it many times and retried time after time. All of my other games work just not this one. Don\'t really know what to do. It sucks because this is my favorite game too.',
       'This is  the best game ever. And supercell, can u add google + sign in so that people who don\'t use facebook can also have friends.. Also I have like 8 leggie right now and I am so happy. And the new clan battle is awesome, it is the best. I wish it is permanent. Anyways clan battle is so fun to play and who ever created it.. U r awesome. Keep up the good work Supercell. Love you so much and ur games.😙😙😙❤❤❤❤😀😁😁😊😊😊',
       'Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn\'t one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you\'re better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖' ],

Definitely download this, just one tip. Don\'t delete when you have progress. I\'ve downloaded, played, got bored, and deleted 3 times. Now I\'m never deleting it. I have so much progress, if I never deleted it the first time I would have everything in the game',
       'Finally! For the the longest time I\'ve been waited, the gaming performance has been improved! No more annoying lag and the gameplay feel a lot smoother now and I am so happy about it. But the graphics still needs to be improved because it doesn\'t look too good and some minor bug needs to be fixed.',

The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I\'ve had to start all over again... but the fun continues!',
       'This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don\'t play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don\'t make us wait foreverrrr!',
       'It\'s a fun game and I\'m enjoying it. However, I\'ve come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.',
       'Everything is lagging. From exploring the sea to chomping down the humans and fishes. It was great before but it is getting very very lagging. For example, Swimming towards a school of fish but instead of eating them, shark just swam through them. All sharks are lagging. Glitching here and there. Please fix this!' ],

And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.',

Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!',

My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I\'m not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr',
       'Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I\'m paying £9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn\'t make it worth the price being asked.',
       'I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',
       'This would have got 5 stars had I been able to share it with my 2 kids via family share. I refuse to pay £30 for all 3 of us to have access to all the levels.  Great game though. Fun, quick and easy to play. Many hours spent between us. So many levels too.',
       'Super Mario run is a great smartphone game it has the very addicting toad rally and remix ten and the simple, but very rewarding controls. The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars',
       'I beat world 1, and I have to pay for the rest of the game? Really? This is stupid.. If you\'re going to have a game you need to pay for, market it as such, not the ol bait and switch. Very deceitful.. At least make a trial game or demo game not lure someone in and then tell them they need to pay to finish the game' ],

Definitely suitable for the majority of players and even young ones. There\'s no gore or unsuitable scenes and no constant push to buy ingame content. I wish more game developers thought like this. Properly enjoyable',
       'Great game, incredible customer service. You will never get bored with this game. Play daily as much or as little as you want. There are seasonal (timed) events to play and ongoing daily (no time limit)searches. We have all been there, missed an achievement because we logged on 10 minutes late. NO MONEY has to be spent to truely enjoy this game. Your progress or fun level isn\'t held hostage if you don\'t want to pay to play. Customer service is incredible. I was stuck and the response was quick and helpful. Even when I still didn\'t get it, think if it was a snake, it would have bitten me, they helped and never made me feel stupid. Install NOW and start having fun.',
       'Energy is spent too quickly, kind of their way of trying to make you to buy gems. I get it, and I would buy them if they weren\'t so expensive! I can barely make it through a single task, it does get quite annoying.   Maybe give us the option of watching ads for gems or extra energy, and an ad free option with minimal cost so those who would rather not have the ads get to benefit too?',
       'Love the challenge,  the mini puzzles.  The only draw back I would say.  As a new player having enough energy to complete some of the old challenges example (Valentine\'s 2017) is almost impossible.  Would love to figure out how to gain more energy. Fan page as far as I can see does not help on this.  Other then  that very enjoyable game.',
       'Hi, really like the game, but I\'ve just done the new jungle story and on completion of the story received a lot of gummy worms for energy, carried on playing, closed and came back to the app 30 mins later and they have all disappeared?? Could you please put these back in my rucksack so I can use them, was over 60, 000 energy that I have just lost, please sort this out as I love this game and I can then give it 5 stars, many thanks, Louise Anderson',

Give you enough lives to rate it good then the lives end and you have to watch a min advert or 30 mins for one life Regen. OR PAY. They just want your money at that point. So sad.',

It\'s a nice app but I might uninstall it because I can\'t play it all the time!',

The game was fun to play until that the tasks had been getting ridiculous that even I was playing with the highest speed I still won\'t make it on time or I won\'t even get as many costumers as the tasks said so, and not only that I\'ve been playing extra job levels and guess what? I\'m not gaining any gems',

You can\'t do anything without huge amounts of gems. I bought some and bought one thing and they were basically gone. I had to use 2 powerups to pass the level (and that was only 1 level). What a waste.',

Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance',
       'Great simple game with AMAZING colours❤ I love this...dead simple and fun. It took me ages to work out how to unlock the new skins...click on the banner that has the amount of diamonds you\'ve collected and what looks like 3 sheets on top of one another  (it comes up before you press the start key...)',
       'A Great Game For When You\'re Dumpin\'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin\' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I\'m in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren\'t too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I\'m happy to say that. I don\'t like to stay too long. Great game!',
       'So,  basically it\'s a pretty fun app to play when you\'re bored. It\'s a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It\'s a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don\'t really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!',
       'Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn\'t have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic.',
       'Good, with a major flaw I\'ve ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I\'ll tap, and the game won\'t register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I\'m on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I\'ve closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It\'s an issue I\'d like to see fixed.' ],

     [ 'I\'ve been waiting for this, really anything from the three kingdoms is my jam. Something I\'d like is to have the dialogue be tap instead of auto run, it\'s easy to miss some stuff and the story is one of the greatest aspects of the three kingdoms. Over all really fun and interesting, love it. Haven\'t got to far into it yet so maybe I\'ll edit this after a while. As of today, this 5*',
       'Everything was great except the open world pvp of holding and defending castle.. every castle i hardly won lost in secs.. and the amount of silver to use is so much for everything.. when you only can generate so little in the beginning. The big pocket hardly need any skill if they just use money max everything. Not recommended for non payers unless you only plays story mode.',
       'Great game (!!!) but (why ask me to do a review if you dont want constructive feedback?) isnt this game made by like the Chinese telecomm company? Reason asking is because first impression the main screen has way to many Pay buttons. And what is with these daily \'special deals\'? Only 99.99 USD, wow. Beyond this, battery heavy, tutorial is unending. Great looking turn based game. Great story, obviously.  (Guys, if we are the engine and you are the car, then you need to make the ride comfortable)',
       'Really good game. The "stamina" used is provision for you army which are abundantly avail so you can play for long times. Solid turn based strategy battle system with good use of unit types and strategies. Well thought out such as having water tactics be stronger in rain and fire not available. Levelling generals can be slow and any new generals you recruit start at lower level. Plenty of daily quests to level them and you can use jade seals to speed it up too. This is the ROTK game I\'ve been waiting for on mobile.',
       'Like the concept...i still have a love for the original nitendo version  but this is great. I wish the dialogue was able to be skipped. The game is ultra-deep in its customizations. Different units, leaders, skills for units and for leaders, special weapons and artifacts. ..and so on.  Very well though through design. If i had one small thing it would be to lower the silver cost a little for upgrades  (NON real money )....the gold (real money) is surprisingly reasonable',
       'Amazing game. Enjoy a terrific nowaday mobile adaptation of a classic game from the DOS days. 100s of heroes from the Han Dynasty to collect and level up. The campaign\'s story is immense and immersive yet not overdone. Battles and navigation of the interface is flawless. I have yet to experience crashes or latency issues whatsoever. I highly recommend this game. Just too little room to write a proper review. 5/5' ],

     [ 'It\'s a pretty amazing game, like league of legends but what makes it amazing is that you can play it on your phone. The only problem is the prices of the heroes and skins. Most of the heroes are 32k battle points.. So it would be fair if it was at least 5k cheaper than that. Also the game lags sometimes which interups gameplay which can cause you to unexpectedly die.  For anyone who is reading this, I highly recommend this game to anyone.  It\'s amazing and extremely addictive!!',
       'I think this game is great! I play It Almost Everyday And My Mum Always Has To Scold Me For Playing Too Much! Its Addictive And Fun To Play! Just A Few Things You Guys Could Work On. 1)I Hope That You Guys Will Let Us BE ABLE To Sell Hereos And I Bet Others Agree. 2)I Also Hope You Guys MAKE IT EASIER For Us To Get BP\'S I Really Really Hope You Guys Get To Fulfill My Request! Its a good game!',
       'Not enough with unskippable tutorials now you want us to level up till lvl 8 to be able to change account? Here\'s some suggestion, make a button just before the tutorial, for login purposes for those who have old accounts. I mean, people sometimes reset their phone and you want us to play till level 8 again just so we can play old account? Be realistic developers.',
       'Quite simply a super fun game. This game does exactly what it is supposed to, which is provide a fun portable moba experience condensed into short bursts of fun. This is one of the few games where even losing is a fun experience for me. Pros - wide range of heroes, fun over the top cartoon graphics, multiple game modes, great community and incredible speed of matchmaking that still some how retains quality of matchups. Cons - I am personally not a fan of the joystick based control system, the heroes require quite a bit of time playing before you can get enough in game currency to unlock them. So if you haven\'t already started playing this game then you are definitely missing out',
       'Being Honest this game hasnt really been up to date with others competitors. One thing I think would be lovely is a training camp/single player bot practices to do with new heros. Maybe a small revamp to the art style like 5% realism. And to decrease the amount of gold heros cost, really turns down the tone to play more for new heros',
       'Edit from my earlier review.  I re-downloaded this game after giving yall some time to work through some issues Id been having.  Lo and behold... All of my progress is gone. I was a high level with numerous heroes and skins I cant get anymore. Yet when I relog in from my google account and my FB account, it still has me at this new level with none of my stuff. What the heck yall.' ],

     [ 'Think about playing all day Ridiculously good graphics for a mobile game, excellent soundtrack that matches the intensity of each level, and never gets boring. The free version makes you restart from the beginning instead of checkpoints, but I don\'t even mind because it\'s still challenging and fun with each replay. I do wish I could play in a different mode for free though. This would be an awesome Zen game.',
       'The gameplay is unique and challenging and fun but this game feels like a demo as all the other game modes (PvP , co-op etc) are locked for free users. And you can\'t even use checkpoints without paying them( like SERIOUSLY?!) So once the game is over you have to start all over again if you are a free user. Apart from that this game definitely deserves a try from people looking for casual , relaxing yet challenging gameplay.',
       'Great game This is a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing aesthetics and highly addictive. Totally worth the $2 for the premium version. I do have one problem though: even though I am pretty decent at the game, Google Play won\'t give me any achievements even though I\'m sure I have earned some. It won\'t even let me open achievements or leaderboard pages. Is anybody else having this issue?',
       'So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn\'t save where I\'m at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won\'t be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!',
       'I am going crazy for this game. Great time killer and stress reliever. Graphics, music, and everything else is completely superb. I am totally enthusiastic about purchasing the premium version, however, I could not buy it because I do not have any credit or debit card. Can someone please tell me if there is other ways to purchase, like deducting the fee directly from my SIM balance, perhaps?',
       'BEST GAME EVER... Love this game,  a must have on every phone.. Well worth the price, amazing graphics.. Also bought the VR version truly unbelievable. Just 1 wee problem... When you reach infinity there is not a lot of glass to smash for extra balls which is a must have especially when it goes super fast.  Thankyou and keep up the great work..' ],

Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can\'t beat them! Keep making more awesome games!',

No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it\'s tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.',

     [ 'This is one of the best strategy RPG I\'ve played in recent years. This is exactly what a mobile RPG should be like.   There are a lot of twists and turns, funny and interesting interactions and I like how the creator is also involved in the game. What I love most about it is that there\'s a story being told. Even after you lose (and you will lose a lot) the story keeps going forward.  The thing I\'m not that big of a fan of is the micro transactions in this game, there are quite a lot of em, I understand why the creator does this but if all of the money he gets from micro transactions goes directly to this game in order to improve the game I\'m all in.  Good job on the game, creator!',
       'Your actions have consequences, sometimes applying the F-it adjustment is great for rewards. Also really captures the idea that even though you are being corrupt it\'s for the greater good, an interesting perspective. Absolutely love this game',
       'Very interesting concept, there are a lot of mysteries to solve and the game really challenges you to manage what few resources you have carefully. There are few outright good options, most of them force you to expend a resource in order to obtain another (eg let corporations dump nuclear waste for some extra cash), and sometimes despite your best efforts you get killed by radiation or overthrown by your military.',

     [ 'This is an updated comment. I already loved the game just thought it needed better controls. Have to say after the update I gave it a perfect score. It\'s sleek smooth and just all around fun. It\'s very clear they took consumer complaints into consideration and it\'s good to see. Highly recommend if you love GOT and these style of games. Only negative is the farther you advance into the game the more I get the feel of a page of wind kind of situation which is sad but it\'s still worth it.',
       'The game is super sluggish gets very annoying. The rss are way to low and not able to be gotten and when you do farm you get almost nothing total waste of time. There needs to be a system to see where\'re you and your guild ranks in your world.and the basic rss your own keep gives you are way to low for a game of this type 12 hours should not produce only 6k wood at lvl 20',
       'Had issues as of 22/02/18 again. World and War room access constantly loading. Before then, the tool bar on the right flashing and lagging. Since update at 18:00 on 22/02/18 have not been able to log back on. I have submitted tickets about this issue before and the reply via email is that the ticket has been closed. Go to support via website and forum and tired every step and more. No help.',
       'I finally decided to uninstall it after realising that if you don\'t spend, you don\'t win. Eventually you just become a Farm for the high-spenders they come attack you and there you go, back to square one and back to more spending.',

       'Game glitches constantly. People in k63 are using bots to cheat. WB won\'t do anything about the cheating! Forces people to spend huge sums of real money to be able to gain power to play the game. Features are placed in the game but not active; some are no longer listed as "under development" but still don\'t work. Game should have undergone a lot more work before being released. Upgrade requirements for resources are impossible to meet without buying them. Resource nodes only go up to 130k and requirements for upgrades are in the millions. Poor to little planning went into this game.' ],

     [ 'This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!',
       'This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you\'re willing to go broke',
       'Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.',
       'Its the best game I have ever played. The things you can build are amazing and it\'s great that you can build your own to. The controls and graphics are unbelievably amazing. Great animal sounds to, they actually sound exactly the same as a real animal. Its also great that you can have villager\'s and your own pets. Only problem is the packs you have to use diamonds and if I don\'t have enough then I have pay for the diamonds and I\'m just a kid and my mom says no so please make the packs and the things in them cheaper. But other than that, this game is so AWESOME. 😃',
       'Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses.',
       'I have a significant concern with how easy it is to accidentally spend the gems. It has happened at least once, though I\'m assuming it happened a second time while I was quickly clicking building a building, since fifteen gems are now unaccounted for. I cannot feel comfortable with this game if at any given moment, all my gems might get spent because of one misclick.' ],

     [ 'Very simple. Gives me a lot of nostalgia. Two things though, it seriously needs music maybe some Celtic tunes or shanties. And secondly it needs more stuff to do. When I first saw a whale I was excited about doing some whaling but nope. The whales do absolutely nothing. Maybe even some treasure hunting puzzles or something. Good game just needs a little more content.',
       'Good game however, once you\'ve taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world\'s and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.',
       'Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.',
       'Great game in all honesty I can actually see myself playing this game for weeks to months. Everything about it is perfect and I  love how it is not based on a story.   Note devs: for some reason after playing for 10 min strait my boat gets to the point where it can\'t hit a single shot so I have to restart the game.',
       'This game is great overall and you have a great sense of progression as your ship gets bigger and faster. The problem is the controls themselves. I found it very hard( I noticed this when I reached HP or ship level 6 ) and sometimes close to impossible to fire at other ship even at point blank range. The game has a very hard time trying to focus on one ship and would often shoot at where the enemy was 3 seconds ago especially when there is more than 3 ships at once which often happens. I would recommend a fire button option to compliment the controls and the gameplay experience. As I said before, it is indeed a very amusing game and would be even more enjoyable with this added feature.',
       'please, please, please. update more maps or make it more challenging, ive already conquered all the islands and there\'s not much i can do anymore. so please, either more maps, or let others conquer my islands and let me reclaim it. i know you guys can still add up to this already amazing game. also, improve the controls, really cant see much when im steering. but over all, its a really fun, relaxing game. ;) thank you.' ],

     [ 'Not enough levels. The developers keep adding new features but if you\'ve already played the available levels, you can\'t obtain the additional objectives. Every once in a while, they\'ll add one new packet of 15 levels but that\'s easy to beat in a matter of minutes. They need to add LOTS more levels.  2/22/2018 The developer responded and said they added more levels. All they added was the Brandy and Berry Sauce packages, which I\'ve already completed. They are very easy levels so they consume very little time to complete. Now I\'m back where I was with the first review . . .',
       'American English. Very heavy censorship, to the point of being ridiculous. The trend towards Orwellian Newspeak very obvious here. Gameplay and graphics, both good. Levels need to be much harder, with longer, more obscure words, to be really challenging. Constantly typing \'lye\', \'con\', \'bio\' gets boring. Would stretch an intelligent twelve year old at the current level. The original word cookies game is much harder.',
       'Really great app. Just an idea... Why not introduce a system where players can submit levels of their own. It would be quite easy to set up a development app if you haven\'t done so already and would mean you\'d never have a shortage of levels.',
       'There are a lot of times I try to make a word but it doesn\'t take. It\'s also extremely difficult and time consuming to get the 10 stars a day for all those days. The way it\'s set up, you have to play ALOT of rounds every day. Other than that, I really enjoy the game.',
       'The levels are fun and challenging. I can lose hours playing. My biggest complaint is the new star cookie challenge. Finding enough levels to get 50 star cookies on five days is just taxing and not fun.',

I seriously and kindly request to the developer to restore those sounds which were there in old versions because I seriously loved it. I wish those sounds can come back which makes the game more amazing.   And ofcourse I still continue to play this and have hope for those sounds to be back.',

(before update) now upon opening the game, i get the same download error & cannot start the game at all.  the game is really fun & addictive. iam on level 20 I believe & really the only thing I would change would be the dialog boxes. it needs to have an "okay" button or some type of confirmation. they just disappear whenever you click on something.  they pop up in your face & as I\'m trying to out burgers in my pan, I didn\'t get to see what the instructions said because the boxes get so easily dismissed. I had to guess my way thru a few things as well ( i accidentally put mustard on all of my hotdogs because I didn\'t know how it worked)',

     [ 'I used to love this game, very addictive but recent updates have made the game have too many elements (clubs - who cares???) Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels "fixed" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.',
       'This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.',
       'I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn\'t really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don\'t know how many more points you need.',
       'This game has many issues! It continually freezes and shuts me down. I can no longer play on my tablet, which I purchased just for games, and have to use my phone. I don\'t like using my phone because it drains my battery. I am so ready to quit this game and return to candy crush instead. Latest updates have rendered JP and other perks useless.',
       'Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the "boards" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it\'s addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It\'s becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.',
       'I really liked playing as mindless entertainment despite what I consider to be unreasonable costs of the games as you advance in levels  and even tolerated the forced ads when they began. Unfortunately 2 days ago   it refused to load and continues to ask to retry or restart.  My connections are optimal and no updates pending.   Have tried to contact support to no avail. Disappointing.' ],

     [ 'Simply wonderful app!! My daughter\'s speech is delayed and I introduced this to her at 17months. By 20months, we were hearing her sounding out the letters after it\'s repeated in the app and she has learnt to choose the correct letter when asked by the app. She couldn\'t get enough of it! Now we\'ve moved on to shapes and colours that she\'s working through now at 22months. It\'s truly amazing. Thank u for no ads. Beautiful graphics. No issues with touch or connecting. Would love British English version tho where \'Z\' sounds out as \'Zed.\'',
       'I absolutely love this app! My child has learnt so much from this along with all the other apps similar as well. There are no adds which is very much appreciated with a 3 year old that will click on anything. I would recommend to anyone!!',

       'Amazing app for toddlers. My 2 girls LOVE it. I like how after they say each letter they sound out the letters. And for the other section where the "a is for apple" i think it should be the whole alphabet instead of just a few selection of letters. Because some times the letters repeat.. Like they\'re learning on just letters j or a.. Etc. Idk if you understand me or not. Oh well just my opinion but THANK YOU Also, for those of you saying it has bugs or its very glitched. CHECK YOUR CONNECTION. most of the time when that happens its because either your phone is sh** or you have bad service. Get on that WI-FI',

     [ 'Kind of reminds me of skulls of the Shogun (although I don\'t know which was developed first). Haven\'t played multi player yet bc I\'m going to get schooled! Great game. I love all the different tribes and take no issue with shelling out a few $ to check the all out. Of course playing the free tribes leaves little to be desired if u can\'t afford the extras. Best game I\'ve come across in a WHILE.',
       'Fantastic mobile game. It\'s a great pocket sized Civilization-style game. Quick games with the depth and variation to keep you immersed.  Unfortunately, the multiplayer update doesn\'t seem to be functioning very stably at the moment. My friend (Verizon iPhone) and myself (Sprint Android) have been trying to play some matches, but we keep getting turns where we can\'t move our units, or gain resource points to spend. As it\'s an indie-developed game, I understand it\'s tough to test every permutation of devices and connections. I\'m hopeful and looking forward to subsequent updates and bugfixes. Keep up the great work!',
       'I really like it, turn based strategy, probably one of the best games I had on this phone yet. There are a few fun tribes you can buy (or rather should buy) and I think spending a few bucks for a game like this is absolutely fine. Just keep an eye on the time, half an hour flies away if you don\'t pay attention ^^',
       'balanced and very deep. You have fulfilled everything I ask for in the last review whether you read it or not. The \'modes\' list is a little sparse, however, and it would be great if you would plan some modes as a side project or something. Not that it is easy making a new mode. Well nonetheless, god job',
       'Love game, but why the auto start, in my opinion, no app should auto start, app should only be turned on when in use, fix this or I uninstall. GEEZ, all you developers think your app is only one used, get a clue! Then why do I keep getting a "Poytopia has stopped" message every time I start a session on my tablet, even though I did not play Polytopia during last session.',
       'I love this game hence the 5 star. But the multiplayer needs some work, if I wanna play a game with a friend in 1 sitting I have to reload the map each turn. If the turns could progress without reloading the game that would be awesome. Also, I had a bug that made me replay a turn a few times in multiplayer for some reason after I returned to the game.' ],

On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.',

     [ 'Good game but be warned to really get any good characters you\'re either going to have to pay lots of real money or you\'ll find yourself grinding forever the same nodes to upgrade the characters that you have. With that said this game is a big improvement over heroes of dragon age of which in many ways this game is modeled after . It seems very clear that some of the devs from that game migrated to this game to start it up. The last update at 02-26-18 freezes at loading screen and then force closes come on devs get on this!',
       'I love this game but an issue im having since the newest update os why im giving 2 stars at the moment. Ever since the update the game will not load. Says "loading cantina" then closes the app completely. Im gonna end up getting kicked out of my guild...please fix this! Soon as its fixed it will return it to 5 stars bc the overall game is badass!',
       'I played this on and off since it started but now I am back full-time and it has always been improving and growing. Big star wars fan and can\'t get enough of it? This is the next best thing. The game is very complex so I suggest if you are only starting out, check out starter guides on youtube on how to have the best head start  and enjoy! 🎉',
       'My game had been freezing after last update. I ended up turning wifi off and using mobile data once it got to the update it asjed if i wanted to switch back to wifi. I did this turned off mobile data and it has worked now. On android hope this helps some other people out',
       'Some aspects of the game are very balanced and competitive, other areas (CLS, Jedi Rey) are just for the pay2play. The best way to enjoy this game is with a great guild. There are now a fair amount of ways to do that. It would be nice if the gear bottlenecks were fixed and also add another way to help support lower level players,they just get overwhelmed...Maybe donations that increase drop rates, splicing gear or smuggler runs. Bounty Hunts, that award credits or gear. There are endless ways to improve this game and it does happen, little by little, over years. The only way to play this game is with patients, even if you are will to drop tons of money on this game you will not be competitive in a day, week or month.',
       'Graphics are good, turn based matches are decent to play.  Not a casual game, you have to be pretty devoted, takes a lot of time to play with so many daily events.  Character packs can be pretty expensive if you want to buy them rather than grind (think £80 for a couple of characters, then the cost to level them, talking hundreds).  All the best characters coming out now are behind a pretty steep pay wall.  If you go on holiday or mover over time zones, the payout times remain the same meaning you either have to play at strange local times or dump your account.  Lots of people have complained but it is just ignored.  Lose a * for that region bug and another for ignoring it.' ],

       'I love the game so far. I\'m not too far in it yet, but I\'m gonna be playing for a while. The one big issue I have with it, is that it is such a battery hog. It pulls so much power that my phone starts to get ridiculously hot and I can burn through a chunk of my battery within 10 minutes of play time',
       'I dont do mobile games but thats because most games are a pay to win model. This however has gripped my soul as its a game you can actually progress in without spending real money....thus making me want to spend real money anyway because i see it as a good investment. Well done guys you certainly deserve my thumbs up',
       'It\'s OK... But the reviews that say you don\'t need to spend money are lying. I have fixed every bench in town for a week and found no cement - but you can buy it for 96 gems. Yea right. Pay to play as always... Also its a bit of a grind game, doing the same things over and over which just get a bit more expensive the more times you do it. Its OK to waste 20mins on but I won\'t be keeping it that long.',
       'Loved the game until level about level 10 when I needed to open the bakery to make more sales, need cement to complete opening, I\'ve fixed every park bench in town 5x looking for this material, I\'ve found everything but cement. Unless I purchase Jems I can\'t move on, getting annoyed.',
       'I love this game and the updates. But now that you have to have certain blueprints to upgrade the factories and bakery it\'s taking up way too much room in my shed especially since I need alot of items for the upgrade. Including the shed. I think it\'s a great addition makes it more challenging just irritated at the lack of space.' ],

     [ 'Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?',
       'This game is pretty good, for the most part. The only problem is the bots you go upagainst are  way to hard. I can never win. I would have gave them 5 stars but I gave them 4 stars because of the bots. And the game is kinda hard to control. When I move backwords on a veichel it goes up.',
       'This Game is really fun but the Spicky car is really stupid because it\'s so easy to die... really stupid... but other than that, the games awesome and I got the fist car thing but when I want to use it I can\'t find it 😑... the games the b💣mb. But the update I don\'t have so you should probably not get the update because people are complaining about it. AND ALSO ...CARS KEEP SPAWNING ON TOP OF MY CAR KILLING ME!!',
       'Ok. I admit this game is pretty fun. But the missions, especially the hardcore ones, are ridiculously hard. So if you want a challenge, I recommend this game. But if you rage over really dumb things like me, then I definitely do not recommend it.',
       'I hate this game it makes me so stressed and the AI is rigged also the David and Goliath mission i try to win they win 5 out of 5 of the first 5 matches and I\'m afk they win 4 out of the first 5 matches this is f@#$ing stupid P.S impossible to get new cars the machines just gobble up your coins like the game where you try to grab a plush toy but it always fails because it\'s rigged',
       'The physics is very hard to grasp leading to many fails and the bots often drive backwards and forwards until they can drive up onto my head. There\'s also no start timer, leading to the bot ramming into me before I can figure out what\'s happening. Great with human opponents, however single player makes me want to throw my phone out of my window. Great concept, horrible execution.' ],

     [ 'I used to be so excited about this game. Best slots out there with fun games, great graphics, and variety, but the game is too greedy now. I do not mind throwing some money at a well developed game that deserves it, but you never win anything in return. Just want you to keep spending. Such a shame, love several of the slot games.',
       'Best casino slot games, choices and addictive! I have tried others but I always come back to Club Vegas. I can\'t wait to see what "coming soon" is all about. Thank you!',
       'Small payout compared to size spent, not enough action. Not fun when all you do is get rolled. Nice slots though if your willing to pay up.',
       'Edit 3 update: I have reported the developer to Google, it\'s been over a week without a reply after being ripped off during the " minimum x3 wheel event" good luck getting support after you have purchased and something goes wrong, these leeches won\'t be getting another cent from me.  Edit 2 Bought $19.99 coin pack during "guaranteed 3x wheel event" only received 2x on wheel, currently have a ticket open with support, if not rectified will be reporting to google.  Edit 1 And the raking over the coals continues, since last update most of my lucky spin levels have been downgraded to silver, such great value for sapphire vip tier. Buy coins watch them get sucked away, rinse and repeat. You\'ll be lucky to get 2 spins from your bonus at sapphire level.',

       'Mixed feelings on the changes since early access closed. Mostly good changes, but it is so heavy Pay-To-Win now I am a bit disgusted. It is an overall decent attempt at a PVP TD game, but some basic stuff was left out to balance the pvp. Basic stuff like a partial refund when destroying towers during an active match, no refund at all means a very limited tower deployment or upgrade strategy. The style of PVP is a bit forced and is suffering already from P2W. The graphics and mechanics are very good but the limitations are not balancing it out.' ],

     [ 'The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I\'d like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.',
       'Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It\'s very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again',
       'Thanks for new upgrade . Even when the game was slow i didn\'t stop playing. I love this game. It\'s not only a game for me...i am a President of my club and i have to lead my members... in less than one year i reached level 50 and almost all land expanded...just  you have to understand how to play... be smart... some advice for beginners  start participate in mayor competition...this way you will grow faster',
       'I absolutely love this game. I play it all throughout the day. I\'ve made really good friends with the people in my club, and we are all over the somewhat new "club wars" feature. There was a lag, but it was recently fixed. There\'s always something to do in this game, and you can play at your own pace. You don\'t have to spend real money to play the game, but I\'ll admit that I spend a dollar every now and then for the 30 days of green buck income. I love this game so much that I\'ve even started a second city on another device with my other email.',
       'The more stuff is added the lagier it gets. Game freezes when buying items, when going over your city, with the chat, loading the flobsl trade, travelling to other cities and basicly everything nowadays. Requires multiple restarts of the game and reboots of my phone regularly to keep jt playable nowadays. It used to be really good and smooth, but it only gets worse each update and no improvement in sight. I only play now because I made some good friends in my club, but the actual fun is long gone. :(',
       'Game is basic in its features. The worst part of the game is the trade hq. Rather than letting you buy directly off the hq menue you have to load the other players city. If your phone doesnt load it as fast as someone else they can snipe the goods you need to buy.' ],

But once you have been playing it for bit you get board or at least I do.and to the creators of this game to make it less boring you could put levels or different modes in it or add more  shapes. Please reply or just update. Thank you.',
       'Great game to pass time. Adverts are frustrating but necessary unless you want to pay to stop, BUT very annoying when they pop up as you just lifted a puzzle piece and because of advert it just drops randomly. Also being able to rotate pieces would be handy, granted not as challenging however.',
       'Your English is so bad it is insulting.    You need to hire someone to proof read before you post requests for ratings.  A definite turn off to the game which is actually quite fun and challenging.    Requires strategic planning.',
       'The app is fun but it needs a no ads option for purchase. Also if the game is muted the ads should be auto muted as well. Currently the play at full volume whether the game is muted or not. It\'s very frustrating.',
       'My absolute all time favorite game! I used to have the woodblock version and would play that one ALL the time. The only thing I didn\'t like about it was that I couldn\'t get anything higher than 300 most of the time for the score, no matter what I did. The only time I did was the first time I installed it and played, I easily reached 1,500 points, but anytime I played after I could never come anywhere close, so I decided to look for a different game with the same concept and found this one. Instantly loved it! It\'s got more block room (so easier to get more points), love the sound effects, I don\'t feel cheated or set up like the other one, and it\'s a good way to get your mind working if you\'re someone like me who likes to think it through and plans for future possible block pieces c: plus the colors and looks is a bonus!^-^',
       'My four year old likes it and I feel like it helps him on making decisions. I can actually see him thinking what going to be him next move. I like this game and I love playing with my son. Only thing I hate is that it does have to many ads 😒' ],

     [ 'I had this game a long time ago and it is one of the best games out there. It hasent changed since when I usted to have it it would be nice to get some new maps or bikes and maybe change the layout of the menu. And maybe even a multipler more where u play with other people/friends and just free ride or challenge to see who can get more points. Other then that it is a crazy fun and addictive game.',
       'LMAO, how pathetic. Not even possible to control this garbage.  It is nice to see that your level of dedication matches the skateboard version of the game though, along with the PC version, and that you continue to abandon your paid software, you thieves.',
       'I liked the game a lot. The graphics are great and the tricks are to I loved every thing about. But the one thing I do not like is that ther is no free ride. I think it would be better if ther were skate parks and stuff like that to ride on.     😀💚GREAT GAME💚😀',
       'Awesome!!!! It\'s an awesome  game.......But(there\'s always a \'but\' coming from me ;-) )......You should work on the reality glitches. Like when you start, in the first levels(the docks)...You move and the bike rolls down but when you move up the next slope it doesnt....You should work on that. One more thing......You should not keep all levels payed. You should keep it like, if you beat a certain record or you finish the course faster than the time given already. Otherwise, HATS OFF TO YOU ILLUSION LABS...GREAT WORK!!!',
       'I really enjoyed this game till now... I completed all the challenges on docks and have 200 adrenaline but haven\'t unlocked next map!?! I went online and researched it and you apparently need 210 adrenaline but there is no way to get it so you have to burly full game!!! This is a money scam',
       'Good game, but tell me why I have to pay 5 dollars just to get more than one map! Deleting solely for this, because ive already done all the challenges and medals.' ],

     [ 'If you\'ve liked the first game you\'re probably gonna enjoy this one. It\'s more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it\'s built around microtransactions so if you\'re feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don\'t understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it\'s likely you\'re going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren\'t aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don\'t expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!',
       'I love this game! One thing though, I believe that there are too many plants that cost real money to get. Could you please make some more plants that you can get them by being able to unlock them by playing the game, instead of ones where you have to use real money. Besides that, this is a really great game!',
       'Free to play games are always the same formula: Starts off addictive, gets more challenging, starts encouraging you to buy gem equivalent, forces you to buy gem equivalent. At least most other games are fair with it though, giving you a chance. PVZ 2 does not. Levels go quickly from fun to I\'m done, and become impossible. I\'d love to see developers or game testers try to complete later levels without gems, especially Big Wave Beach. It\'s a shame, as the first game remains a classic. Buy the first game and Garden Warfare if you like it. Leaf this game alone, it\'s a sprout at best. Oh and remember, if zombies try to break into your house, throw your money at them.',
       'Love this game so much! I am a huge PVZ fan anyway and I love playing this. You do need some boosters to get past levels, which feels a bit like cheating sometimes, but you can earn plenty of coins. There is always a new quest to play so even when I\'m stuck on the other levels I can still play. This is a great game, well done devs!',
       'BEST EVER GAME I HAD PLAYED IN MY LIFE!!!!!  Great game! Too addictive and it is the best favourite game ever and the hardest edition you will ever find in it. Even challenging.

     [ 'So I\'m changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it\'s a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I\'d rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!',
       'GAME CODE reveals ROLLS ARE NOT RANDOM - they\'re pulled from a table of predertirmined outcomes, designed to MILK YOU FOR MONEY at a set rate, based on PvP, reg. Game, Event, Boss, etc.  Just like slot machines & video poker (which i programme).  You must \'assemble\' high scoring games, like a puzzle, with majority of yahtzees sitting after 4 or 8 rolls (1 or 7 bonus \'dice\'(money) spent)... Like a choose your own adventure book that can cost Hundreds of Dollars.',
       'Scopely is the most greedy, disgusting company I have ever seen. The ads they have littered into the game play literally crash the game at least 4 times during a match. You will see about 10 ads on top of the crashing per game; you could be in mid roll and the ad will ruin it. So desperate for money.. Don\'t support scopelys terrible practices.',
       'This game cheats! Don\'t get me wrong, I love it and am going to keep playing. But WAY more often than it should, it tallies up your opponents score wrong to make you lose. I count and take screen shots. If you get upset at things like that, it isn\'t for you. But if you don\'t care that much, like me, it\'s absolute fun! Adorable names given! Awesome dice to win! Very entertaining! Battle real people or the game! Just don\'t be a sore loser even when mathematically your a winner!',
       'I\'ll give this game more than one star once the showdowns are less about the computer clearing and more about real challenge.  Once you start a showdown the computer conveniently never gets a bad roll.  Which wouldn\'t be a big deal except you have to wait to challenge them again unless you want to pay for extra dice which is used to unlock everything else.  Kinda cheap.',
       'Horrible game, stupid graphics looks like a preschooler did it, games are definitely rigged you hardly ever beat the house. To much stuff going on on this board you have no clue where to go to get to anything. The old game was easier to navigate. You should give people the option to keep the old game.' ],

     [ 'I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I\'m a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events.',
       'I love the game. From its cute and addictive style to its unique and original dress up gameplay, it turned me from a dress up hater to lover. But I feel like there\'s a Paywall especially during events, and diamonds are forced to be bought, but they can be earned, which is good. But so far, you seem to have listened to feedback, from the skin tones to the bug fixes. But I love it still.',
       'In depth in both gameplay and attention to details of awarded items. Continuous hours not required but with once a day of incentive activities. Controls are  sometimes unstable. If a glitch does happen, its fixed fast and your also awarded for time spent. Very happy customer. Enjoyed the best dress up game I\'ve played so far. Thank you makers!',
       'Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted',
       'I never write reviews, but this game really deserves a high one. I got this game because my friend Emily adores it, and I have been playing NON STOP. It\'s so beautiful and high quality for just a dress up game. It\'s absolutely wonderful. My favorite thing is that you can really enjoy the game without having to use real money on in app purchases. Yeah, you can if you want to, but your experience isn\'t less if you don\'t. A high quality and fun game. I adore it',
       'I had seen many ads for it and was kind of interested, but I didn\'t think a dress-up game could be that fun. One day I couldn\'t find any games I wanted to play, so I decided to give it a shot. To my surprise, I am really enjoying it! So if you\'ve had any inkling of interest in this game, give it a shot. You might enjoying as much as I have.' ],

     [ 'What a good little game. Nothing special in the graphics department but it delivers on everything it says and shows. After playing for a little while I couldn\'t help but feel like I was waiting for a little bald guy to want to eat me if I got an answer wrong, "cans we eats it precious". Jokes and riddles. Very good game. Well done.',
       'Game is really good specially for kids . Makes them think. Only bad part of this game is the list in answers.. they are already displayed. This makes the game very easy. It would make an awesome game if user had to enter the answers.. hope the developers fix this!',
       'I found "500 Riddles" to be somewhat misleading.  After the first few levels the riddles started to repeat. (Either the exact same riddle or the same riddle worded differently) Also grammar and punctuation errors in the riddles started to get annoying. But overall I did enjoy the program.',
       'The game could use a few fixes. Sometimes when you touch a level it is unresponsive. The stage count is weird. When you completed all stages of a level it says 9/10. Please fix this the overall game isn\'t bad but these are very easy no brainer fixes.',
       'I think instead of giving me an A+ on everything including the one I PURPOSELY did wrong is dumb. If we get 1 right make a 10% if we get 5 right male It a 50% if we get 7 right make it a 70% and so on. So instead of giving an A++ when I got 4 right give a D or F.',
       '1 star for a puzzle game that has incorrect answers. There is a question in Level 3 that is wrong. It basically reads Dog is a ruler while God is a servant instead of the reverse. Job good did you.' ],

     [ 'I can\'t say I love it,maybe I can. But any way, this would have to be in one of top hundred games😀. There are a few things I would like added though. Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed this😀😁😀😁😀😁.',
       'I think you guys have messed up your game in the past few updates. Seems like there is some memory leak or something. After a while the steering wheel lags so much. Only the input. Graphics don\'t lag at all. Please fix. Also would be great if you could add some button to start and stop a timer in free mode so we can set time challenges for ourselves. I like the game but it is unplayable after a few minutes after the recent updates',
       'What you should improve is that YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ADD\'s I MEAN SERIOUSLY I WATCH MORE ADDS THAN THE GAMEPLAY. I ONLY PLAY FOR A LITTLE THEN MOST OF ADDS SHOW UP. I WQ5CH ADDS THAN PLAY8NG THE GAME FOR CRYING OT LOUD!!',
       'This has to be like, my 5th or 6th reinstallment of this game since there\'s no ingame reset, but darn well worth the data(little bytes). I usually like more realistic car games, but even the "extreme" warp in physics in the gameplay doesn\'t distract from the fun. These are the cars you\'d want if you\'re trying to beat the traffic, run from the cops, or solve a parking dillemma. Great fun time killer! One thing though, the other reviewers are correct in their complaints about how often and when ads pop up. That shouldn\'t happen smack dab in the middle of a maneuver.',
       'This game was just really really good! But please please make the exact same game but instead, if you do something illegal like crash into another car, the cops start chasing you. If you do do this I will comment on every single game that comes up on the adds. But, there is a tiny bit to much adds. Anyways, AMAZING fame!!!😊',
       'The cars are totally good and pls add some more. The traffic is really bad. Because they are inconsiderate and doesn\'t care about other cars. How come some of your games has the traffic considerate, Axesinmotion?🤔🤔 In other words, I hope u will do the things above that is mentioned.' ],

It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven\'t bothered to update this in years.',
       'After only playing a few short but addicting levels, I am already having a blast! The game may not look spectacular on a technical level. But the gameplay is so freaking fun! And the controls aren\'t too complicated either. Recommended for everyone!',
       'It\'s a fun little game at first, but has many, many flaws. You have to link it to your Facebook account if you wanna play all maps. There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can\'t play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That\'s just ridiculous. Not to mention it\'s very buggy. Sometimes you\'re racing someone who\'s in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it\'s just stupid.',
       'Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you\'re racing friends.',
       'Bugs and Glitches... Multiplayer links are not being sent back and forth properly. Some games keep giving me desert level 1 and not showing any replays or ghost bikes are doing a different levels then the one I am suppose to be racing against. Please Fix!!!',
       'Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can\'t stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn\'t happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can\'t buy any of the bikes.' ],

It\'s not a game a advertising app, isn\'t this too much hance i know you developers make money on the game but just because of this much ennoying adds when people uninstall this app you won\'t be able to make anything out of your effort can you???',
       'Graphics are awesome, but the game itself is very monotonous. You can fall asleep waiting for something to change and make it more exciting. When a change such as an added bonus does come (bomb or a rainbow bubble) you realize that it wasn\'t worth the 20 or 30 levels you just wasted your time on. Progressive enticing events need to happen more quickly.',
       'On level 19 I scored three stars bit it shows only two. Aside from that, no other complaints... YET. I will say thank you, though, for not aggressively pushing ads, pushing to pay to extend the aim line. So far, its amusing😁',
       'This is a really fun game but my  my concerns are that when I have no balls left, for me it doesn\'t have the option to play a video to earn more but for my brother it does therefore it makes me start all over again. The other concern is that when I use a bomb for the chest it takes away a ball for example I have 12 balls when I use the bomb from the chest, I get 11 balls left which it doesn\'t do that for my brother. I hope you can fix this.',
       'I thought the levels would be more difficult by now I\'m on 143 at the moment. I enjoy the game but I\'m getting a bit bored with the easiest of challenges and without having to use the help button . I hope the game will  get more challenging soon.   Grandson aged 5 will like playing this game.',

Every so often, you’ll be gifted a new gem - and the faster you tap on box at the bottom of the screen, the faster the gems will appear. Each gem that appears on the board can be merged with other gems of the same kind to form a greater gem - the bigger, the shinier the gem, the more currency you will earn. And the more currency you earn, the more gems you can purchase in the game store! Use your winnings to discover all sorts of new gems, and expand into new areas. All you have to do is make your gem collection the best it can be. The bar at the top of the screen measures the quality of your collection - merge gems to earn XP and level up. Higher levels will unlock more space to grow your collection - the more space you have, the more impressive your collection can become.

     [ 'Would be better if you could Manuel between tricks  and if the tricks were in combo with other instead of individually named. Also can\'t seem to feeble, or smith grind:/ Fakie seems to not be working for me, it just registers at regular even though I\'m clearly riding fakie! Also I\'ve paid for this game and haven\'t seen a new park in the past year and the map The Docks sucks!!',
       'Controls are terrible. Doesn\'t feel natural at all. Have to pay for every park/spot other than the starter park which sucks. Just pay the $1.99 for True Skate. Way better game with more natural feel for the controls and bigger parks/bettter spots. It\'s like going from Tony Hawk Pro Skater to EA\'s Skate series. Give us at least better controls to make this feel better. Fluck it. Not pick up finger to ollie which doesnt even work %80 of the time.',
       'Spent literally hundreds of hours playing this when I had an iPhone, it was the best mobile game of all time.. Then I switched to android, and waited forever for it to be ported to android. I was so happy when I found out it had eventually made it\'s way to the play store, downloaded it immediately and bought all of the parks. Then I realised it didn\'t have the option to replay clips or edit them like the iPhone version does. This has ruined the game.. One of the best features was the ability to watch back a line you have spent hours perfecting, edit the clip and share it. PLEASE judt add the ability to replay and edit clips on android like you can do on iPhone and make it the greatest game of all time again.',
       'Needs some fixes. It\'s EXTREMELY annoying when I go to do a nose or tail slide, the game does a boardalide. Even if I\'m blatantly placing my fingers in the right spots on the screen. How do I unlock "Skate". Needs more designs. Better customization.  Also needs to recognize more tricks.  Along with already existing ones to be better portrayed. Should add a mode where the board is essentially floating. So that one may be able to flip the board without wipe out to see how to do a specific trick. Game is fun though.',
       'Awesome game it\'s so fun and like real life skating I use to play this game along time ago when It had the horrible camera angle and it has improved a lot. It\'s not hard to control either. The one thing I didn\'t like was that there is no replay! If you could replay truck it would be perfect',
       'It\'s an amazing game! I also have a suggestion. For tricks, like the ollie and kickflip, it should matter where your feet (Fingers) are, so if your going for a kickflip, you should have your foot higher up on the board and for doubles and triples, your foot should be farther down. I know it\'s quite large and some people may not like it, but it would add more realistic gameplay.  Edit: Also some different trucks would be nice, and also if it had grind marks.  Also you should add user challenges and maps, I know this would be a huge update to make but I know it would make the game so much better.' ],

       'This game is AMAZING! With that said, heres the problem. Stop with the obnoxious freaking monkey!!!! Im sick of him popping up every 30 secs with no skip button. Ill be getting up a good tapping speed and it will jist ruin it by popping up with no option to click off. If i want to explore the game further, i will, at my own pace. I dont need you to hold my hand. Its really spammy and ruining the game play. Tutorial based gaming is a waste and a headache. Also its laggy. Please fix this. I LOVE this game and i want to play but the spammy monkey is a deal breaker.  Rant over',
       'One of the most obnoxiously money grabbing games i played. Commercials popping out constantly, and the rewards for watching them are more often than not just worthless. It\'s a shame because the game is quite fun to play otherwise',
       'I like the game very much. I bought the starter pack for a dollar 99 and removed ads. After the update came out, the one that and the ability to watch a video to double your rewards, your offline rewards, I click to watch the video and then the game sends me to the store to buy a gem pack. I click off of that and then it says the video is not available. I assume it wants me to buy another gem pack in order to enable that feature. I will not be doing that as that is ridiculous. I already bought the starter pack. Please fix this as the game is very fun and addictive.',
       'It was fun, but im slowly starting to hate it. One moment youre just looking at youre businesses and the next they are shoving ads down your throat. I shouldnt have to look at ads unless i get something in return.',
       'The tutorial will not let me play the game, it continues to interrupt me and forces me to do what it wants. Graphics are also cheap and ugly looking. It also feels janky, and buggy to control. I wish I could enjoy this otherwise decent idle game.' ],

There are only two places to colonize and once you\'ve done them and reached level 10 on both, there\'s really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.',

Also be cool to spend the coins on boosts',

     [ 'can you please put a pin on the settings? my daughter keeps wiping her progress by accident... also tap controls need work, if the correct word appears infront of a frying pan you have to hope the frying pan falls quick because the tap taps both. the rest of the game is 5 ☆',
       'Too long per word I agree with the other reviewers. My kids were giggling as they picked out each sight word the first 15 times, but by 20 they were asking if it was done yet. Is there a way to shorten the levels if the kids are getting 100% accuracy? They got through the first couple words, but now they never want to play.',
       'Kids lose interest very fast Had high hopes for this game from what I\'ve heard about it but my son\'s lost interest very quickly because it takes way too long for the right words to come on the screen. I would have paid for the full version if this one was good.',
       'Rubbish I\'m an adult and I found this massively infuriating let alone my kids!!! Its poor! Constantly closing for no good reason and having to progress full through the level just completed to unlock the new level. Not a good app!!!!',
       'Love it, but..... I don\'t understand why it doesn\'t save the levels. So every day he opens that up he has to redo everything. He loves it but comes to me and says that he\'s tired of doing level\'s 1-8 all the time.                Can you please make it so it can save??',
       'Kids aren\'t going to learn it by seeing or hearing it once, I like that it repeats. I think people lack patience these days. My only concern is some words fly across the screen too fast even I missed some and you lose a life. If that can be fixed I\'d rate 5*' ],

     [ 'Best burnout game ever. I\'ve looked everywhere for a burnout game like this and I\'ve finally found it! Some things I suggest to put in could be a tow truck ( like Mater) and maybe a country farm burnout pit and, for a real life burnout pit, Perth Motorplex. Also if tire marks stayed on the track each time that would be heaps better. These things would make this game over the top amazing. GREAT GAME!!!',
       'I\'ve made it heaps far in the game. The more you unlock the more you win in challenges. Nearly unlocked everything. When I do ill have to buy the remaining cars, only on small problem I\'m having is that I can\'t seem to score any more than 14000pts in a run I\'m lucky to get 11000pts a run. It would be alot better if the scores all round were larger (including opponents) to make you feel like you\'re doing better at the game by scoring more',
       'FRICKIN AWESOME!!! This game is AWESOME! The controls are simple amd adaptable, and the graphics are amazing! It runs amazing for me, even on highest graphics.  Honestly theres not much for me to complain about, only that loading is a bit long. I like how if you spend just a bit more money you can skip wait times, and when you start it gives an actual tutorial. To me, if you have a problem with the game... You better hate the player, not the game.  Somethings I wish to see in the game is more customization, like body kits, hoods, spoilers, etc., more painting options, like custom colours w/ decals, and an option for how tires/tyres is spelled (tyres kinda bugs me). I would also LOVE to see a Hellcat Dodge Challenger in the game, its got plenty of power and even more weight! 😆 100/10 would blow tires again.',
       'My only problem is that I can\'t get more than 11,000 points. I\'ve tried different cars & tricks etc but nothing.',
       'The game worked fine, since I downloaded it.... But for the last 2 days, it crashes when I open it.... I emailed you guys, used the feedback option on my phone, and have gotten no response from either avenue...   So???',
       'Need 2 things PERTH MOTORPLEX and MATT JAMES IN COMPACT AND UNWANTED. Come on guys 1st and 2nd and summer nats 2nd that mitorvation Now 1st and 2nd again at gazzanatz. He is the best burnout king' ],

    description: 'Children\'s doctor - we all love when people around us smile. We become well and happy when someone on the street gives us a smile. But for a smile to be beautiful, you need to take good care of your teeth. This applies to your pets, because in childhood they were for every kid. Like people, they also sometimes need to treat their teeth. This can be done by a special doctor - dentist. We present to your attention an exciting game for children - a dentist (vet clinic). In this entertaining game, your child is a real dentist, under the guidance of which there is a hospital for animals. The kid is entrusted with a very important and responsible task - the treatment of teeth of his four-footed pups, whose teeth began to ache heavily because of their love for sweets. You have to treat them in a real dental office, use various medical instruments, such as tongs, scalpels, Burmashin and many others, to clean your four-legged friends of teeth from plaque, align them, do operations, remove cavities and fill them. After all, they all just need your help. For her, the animals will be grateful to you and very grateful. Developing games for children, such as a veterinarian, contribute to the overall development of your child. They help to develop fine motor skills, coordination of movements, visual perception, attentiveness and observation, will show the baby how to treat animals, take care of them. Our games for kids, such as a dentist, will teach them not only to treat their pets with love and care, but also to protect their own teeth, do not forget to clean them several times a day, because going to the dentist is not the most pleasant pastime. For the purpose of comprehensive development of the child, we create applications and educational games for children that are aimed to help boys and girls develop basic motor and other skills, and also have fun, fun and useful to spend their free time. All you need is to download games, install and start playing, and in the future your child can choose one of the most needed professions in the world - the dentist Be sure to visit our http://yovogames.com and also we are at:Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZruadkJJTuD4Bgb1F6pa3ATwitter: https://twitter.com/YOVOstudioFacebook: https://facebook.com/yovogames',

       'I wish there were more commands. Like maybe you could command the miners to garrison while the rest of the troops guard. Also, redesign the swordwrath helmet. It looks like someone spray painted their hair gold and then glued jewels on it. I also wish there could be more types of zombies. The idea of endless is cool but please add the zombies to the campaign.',
       'I think that this game brings back memories of the times that we all played on the first one and seeing this new one with more actions and abilitys and many more things to do is just what I would expect from something from the old stick war 1 game and I just would love to see more stick war games like these overall I love this game and I think it was the best',
       'This is one of the most awesome game of all time and thanks to the creators you can play it on mobile too. But it still lack some awesome components, 1. Add Chaos Empire, 2. Add multiplayer!!! Overall still AWESOME!!!',
       'It\'s nice how you\'ve mashed together Stick War and Stick Empires together to make this masterpiece. I know its only meant to be a remake of the original Stick War, so I shouldn\'t expect too much updates, but it would be cool if there was multiplayer on Legacy. Keep the games coming!!!',
       'You know,  its a shame because this is a fantastic game. There is ZERO balancing. The entire game is designed to force you into using gems and micro transactions to get past abnormally difficult gameplay walls.' ],

Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors.

The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone\'s or tablets I find it hard to control I don\'t know if anyone else thinks so but that\'s my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company',

The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don\'t have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn\'t play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀',

Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface',

     [ 'If you\'re looking for an app to improve your vocabulary,then definitely you would love this app. It\'s a sort of game. They give you a word and out of four options you choose the meaning of the word. If wrong, that word will be shown repeatedly. So gradually,you learn it\'s meaning. It has different collections of words depending to your needs. Like you can use it as an aid for your SAT exam or just improving your vocabulary without any special motive. I\'ve used it for two weeks and I\'m loving it.',
       'This app is the best to improve your vocabulary and learn new words. Not like other apps where u read the word and the meaning or watch a gif and scroll on to the next one. This app is exception. Here u get to learn new words by selecting the right word. If u select the wrong one it tells u the correct answer and the a sentence in which it is used. Even if u get it correct next time you\'ll have to answer the question again later and other questions which u answered correctly first time will be asked again 2-3 times and it actually works n help u to remember it',
       'Tried 3 installs of this app. It would not work when I tapped the correct answer.

Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco\'s in my silo then tell me they can\'t refund it because I\'m a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!',
       'One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.',

So many things to do with so many elements to level up with  gem (requiring money to purchase) consuming always at the for front of every mini game. saturating every nook and cranny of the game which unfortunately diverts attention away from an otherwise graphically impressive game.

     [ 'I love Beat the Boss 4! But there are some things that I would like to be fixed. For example, when naming your custom boss, the name duplicates. The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can\'t go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.',
       'Game is now unplayable due to ads and KIIP rewards popups. The ads bring up my status bar so I can\'t X out of the ad, and the app hangs when trying to load the KIIP program. I have no interest in trying to play something that shovels ads in your face more often than you can actually play.',
       'I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i\'m asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting',
       'I really love this app it is so fun to play but there is a glitch that happened to me and my brother when we were playing, the friend thing didn\'t work and we were logged into our accounts and the loading screen was just black outlines and Joe\'s face. I\'m pretty sure it didn\'t load like that before but over all, 5 stars! Have a good day/Night!',
       'I\'d happily purchase this game but that doesn\'t seem like an option. Tge ads, especially the LOUD BLOW UP EXPLOSIONS game that go on for 30 seconds are especially annoying. I\'ll gladly buy it, if only to not deal with Fing ads all the Fing time!!',
       'Seems to be quite a few issues with many of the weapons causing either major lag or strange bugs, like two bosses or a second mini-boss. I miss being able to ragdoll the boss around the room and throw them against walls, in this version it seems to do little damage if any at all. Playing an ad after everytime the boss dies quickly becomes irritating.' ],

What makes things worse is that there really isn\'t much of an actual game to be played here, just spin once, wait for the ad, spin again, wait for an ad, repeat until you uninstall the game permanently. I\'d only recommend this game to someone looking for an actively painful experience.',

     [ 'It would be a great game if ALL words were allowed! And I don\'t mean slang words either.  The game does not allow proper nouns. Even though a proper now is a WORD! For instance, country iis allowed but Sweden is not. Why??? Sweden is a word just like country is a word. I think it sucks!',
       'Fun but won\'t let me access game without forcing me to open w.w.f. 2 in play store. Constant McDonald\'s ads pop up where next game button is that trick you into clicking the McDonald\'s app in play store. If it wasn\'t for that I would love it but I foresee myself deleting because with time because of that.',
       'I agree with everyone else, if I wanted Words with Friends 2, I would have downloaded. But it doesn\'t appear the developers of this game care about the players. Since it\'s apparent Words with Friends doesn\'t care for it\'s players. Hasbo should make a Scrabble app, with a REAL dictionary of words, NOT proper names, but real words we use everyday, that Words weird friends doesn\'t know. Then we could get rid of this upgrade to a novice version and play the real thing.',
       'App used to be 3.5 MB\'s now it\'s 100+MB\'s. Optimization based on my apps setting should never have been defaulted to on. That was/is real sneaky.  Your video ads are out of control. I will only play one game at a time and exit immediately after move to evade ads. You show update messages when none exist. Notification icon always shows 2+ when I only play one game at a time.',
       'I love your Game! There are glitches at times!  Otherwise, well-designed!   1. Please, Fix the Solo Game Glitch: It doesn\'t return the play and Times itself Out! Happened several times now! It simply is Not working reliably!   2. Also, please Return the Safety measure of Asking whether I want to make the Play of a Word I\'ve marked! Sometimes, I\'ve accidentally pushed \'Play\' while meaning to return or move the letters! Too easy to do with the Touch Phone!! Or, allow to Undo the Play turn within the few minutes of making it!   A wonderful game on the whole!',
       'Ads are REALLY annoying. Not only I see one after every move but some of them you can\'t hit the back button, you have to wait to skip the ad. I mean it\'s free and ads maintain that but come on.. every move. You\'ll eventually lose players.' ],

But pls do more like the balance beam and vault because this game is just right for me the cool thing about this is pretty much everything but pls do the balance beam and the vault becuase im liking this! All the features are really working well but when you spin the gymnast to get a little look it is like lagging😣 but i love this game totally 5 stars! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟! Who ever made this app its so great keep on the updates! And pls pls PLS tell me if theres an update of the balance beam and the vault!',
       'It was reqlly fun to play but it really repetitive doing the same thing! I wish the  vault and beam comes out and maybe a freeplay side of the game then a stroy and aslo bigger events!',
       'It\'s a cool game, it just could be better and maybe there could be some other things in the update. Don\'t take it seriously! I\'m not trying to be mean but maybe there could be some other leotards and the update and some more hair dues because all of those buns and people may not like that\'s just buns people may want the braids that you always have in your other games. I mean the French braids and they keep going down into a braid, all those things would be nice!',

Some of the controls are a little difficult like the one where you have to tap 1 or tap 2 when she\'s practicing. And its fun. Some of it I like a lot."   This is from me, "the app is annoying until you buy it. It downloaded a ton of icons (ads for other games) to my picture gallery without informing me. My daughter likes the game a lot and it\'s fun, but a bit intrusive with the free version. The gameplay is good overall."',
       'It is the best game i ever had!!!...the reviews says ut has so many ads..i had just a simple solution: just turn off your wifi or mobile data..and then u can play this without an ad...the problem i am interfering was just the purchasing item..u have to buy ut first...welp...this is the best!!!',
       'I downloaded this game for my little sister and the first thing she said was that there are way too many adverts and I agree because whenever she clicked on say the dress up or nail salon or gym and adverts would always come up. The game also lags too much even though she has a brand new IPad. However at this time I would not recommend this game. My sister said that she would play the game again if you reduce and have a limited amount of adverts. As well as the advert problems the game keeps telling me to buy everything and it pops up every time I think when you press the \'X\' button it shouldn\'t show again. Please fix this now. As much as my sister loves this game the adverts really annoy her. Would not recommend this game!!' ],

     [ 'Great time killer! Simple to play, though a few information/help would be nice for a few items, the auto sell option and the bailer so you know exactly what they do.  The developer does listen to the players and fixes things! Only true issues that I have are 1)the materials needed to build the buildings in incredibly high, not really obtainable for game play, even for someone who would play constantly',
       'You had my attention, and now you have my money. Yes, this is a good game. However, it costs too much real money to advance this game. There are many missing pieces and too much to acquire to be able to progress. Maybe instead of making it so in depth, take it down a notch. Let people use junked cars to fix cars and sell them, if this is already an option make it easier to do so. I think this is a good game just too in depth and not enough give to make it entertaining and fun at this time.',
       'Great time killer... Love it so far and only been playing since yesterday... Already level 11 and got quite a few things however I gave 4 stars because I spent 10 diamonds on the bank which showed the stock market but didn\'t tell me it was coming soon until I paid for it... I like that this game doesn\'t make you pay real cash and gives you tokens just to win more cash, diamonds, energy etc so please don\'t ruin the game in the future and make us pay 2 play =)',
       'The game is over good. It\'s definitely fun for your car enthusiasts but I am now level 11 and I can\'t obtain "glass" to build any buildings... The game is getting boring because I can\'t move up, it\'s pretty much scrap cars and sell parts... I don\'t want to rate this game too high because I believe it still is a work in progress, but yes it\'s a good game and I would recommend it',
       'It\'s a decent concept. Good time killer for a little while. I don\'t know why all these games take energy. Just let me play the damn game. And the constantly fluctuating prices to sell the parts got old REAL QUICK! Apparently the creators of this game have never been to a salvage yard in their life.',
       'Game is simple and easy to play but the materials are hard to get and even when have enough to repair a building it\'s not working. Also the rewards to leveling up are very low for the amount of work needed to get there. After about level 11 or 12 is just more experience but the same $100 and 10 energy cap increase. No diamonds and no material for leveling up. Fix these few issues and I\'m sure this game will keep it\'s fun factor a little longer' ],

       'Love the game, BUT there\'s a glitch in chest bow where it locks up for 1 shot, multiple times a day. After you shoot without being able to aim, the bow works normal until the next jam. Looked for a place to submit info for possible fix, BUT game doesn\'t provide a place for feedback. This is only place to air complaints :(',
       'Ok game, but bingo mode is a huge pain.  My shots filled out the opponent\'s card better than mine.  Stupid way to lose a lot of progress/coins.',
       'I really like this game but it is quite frustrating that I played many times to get a new gear and spent 200 000 on one which has a red cross in it and makes it nearly impossible to shoot promptly. What a stupid idea to have a cross with the same colour as the board itself. They shouldn\'t be red, blue or yellow.',
       'Game was fine. Lately, keeps freezing and somehow opponents are getting 10\'s when I CLEARLY see them hitting nowhere near the middle. Matches are freezing while i\'m ahead, then match ends and says I lost. Somehow i\'ve lost 20 million coins, and not from legit losing either. I also just played a match for 1 million coins, i had over 1 million in the bank. I know sonehow have 0 after I clearly won the match but it said I lost. Either people are using cheats or the game is not functioning properly',
       'It\'s really pathetic that apps like this only allow Facebook login... At least provide Google login too.... Not everyone uses Facebook.... Google should make it mandatory on Google play store apps to provide Google login....' ],

That cant get in even we need them somtimes we play it and we need a ninja and its not in the box to pick a ninja you will jut restart the game. Anyways but i still love it Ninjago is my  favorite have you guys watch the ninjago movie even there episodes. Thank you for creating this game.👍👍👍👍👍👍',
       'I\'m a big fan of lego ninjago♥. Its just hands of time I fight serpentine and when master Wu spoke I saw a timeblade. When I was chilling looking at my mission\'s then Lloyd hacked into Zane\'s computer he said something I just have a bad memory.',
       'It\'s amazing I love it I like how you can make your own ninja and have any weapons it\'s one of the best games I\'ve ever played I have it on all my devices it always puts my in a good mood a job well done plus I\'ve saw every episode and the movie I\'m a huge fan got lots of the sets (5) stars keep it up',
       'I think if you could add a few extra spaces for more ninja then everybody would be happy .the reason I\'m giving this app a 4 star rating is because you can only have up to five ninja on a mission including your own .if anybody would like that to happen then give this review a thumbs up.',

Maybe make some exchange rate for silver to gold without changing the silver availability or price. Someway that gold can be acquired beside the little in the ground. I understand the game has to make a profit and so you should but more people would continue to play instead of giving up Anyway just a couple of thoughts. Got plenty more on just general gameplay  that I think would be useful. Again, not hating as I like and play the game.',

The actual content is fine, but the business practices are deplorable.',

     [ 'I got to level 7 on big fish casino to get 60 gold. yet when I went back to reap my rewards I was startled! then my feeling of "startled-ness" changed to one of despair. For when I went back I realized I wasted all that time going to level 7 on big fish games and instead of having 60 gems I have 60 minutes of wasted time. Great game. Horrible reward system. I will rate the game 5 like it should be when I receive 60 gold. Unfortunately I like the game so I will continue to playing. I am level 27 after all.',
       'prices in the game are not well distributed. you can unlock new players only with gold but gold is obtained so hard. on the other hand, money is useless after some point. you can only use upgrading players but it also requires gold. you can obtain golds with watching ads and playing every tournament over and over again to level up and gain gold but after some point you cannot unlock new players (therefore cannot unlock new tournaments) because it requires so much gold. the game forces you to buy golds. fun game but only a short period of time',
       'Addicting ha. But you should be able to edit stuff like amount of points needed. Or more team names, I face the same lame teams  all the time.',
       'It is the best game I have played so far but I wish the creator adds that you can fight people online in this game because it doesn\'t make sense that in  basketball PVP you can go against people online . Why not add online in this game and creator if you are reading this comment can you please add more bags add like a legendary you buy the legendary bag it has like 1,00000000000000 gold .bag for 1,00000 cash and in the legendary bag add like 1,00000000000gold like this game so much',
       'Great time killer! Only bad thing is sometimes the ads don\'t play all the way through to give you extra experience and money.',

     [ 'Definitely a game for car buffs. It requires using your "mind" to win. I\'m not to sure about my rating yet. But, will definitely change if needed. It\'s unlike any game I\'ve played & I like it! Someone wrote a review that this is a lazy person\'s game... LMAØ, I wish they would show me the games they play while they are running, swimming & mountain climbing "while" they play, smh HAHA!',
       'Incredible game. Awesome concept. Two complaints to developers. High speed loop-when you win, it starts detracting points. And also certain mph based drag races,I run out of road but the challenging car gets like 60 miles of road. Besides these, fantastic game.',
       'I think this game is amazing! And is perfectly good in every way!! I can\'t stop playing and look forward to getting new cars. There is just one tiny error that bugs me a bit but I can cope with it. The error is the color of the Ford fiesta xr2. When you race someone else and they have this vehicle on the card the car is black with a tiny red trim on the side but when it\'s on the track it is completely red. I do hope you can will fix this small mistake but apart from that this game is great!!! Thanks for reading :)',
       'I love the concept and it\'s been great to see how far this game has come, but I\'ve been playing since beta and nearly every update wipes my save data and forces me to restart. Luckily, I don\'t get too far into the game each time, but it is frustrating and enough of a buzz kill for me to drop two stars. If there was a cloud system implemented for saves this game would be a five star in my book',
       'Multiplayer is not fair. Have the same car with lower 0-60 time better traction, and higher mph but still lose. Match play is getting worse. I either have to spend a boatload of money or always come in last place.',
       'This is an amazing game and I think Hutch Games did an amazing job putting the collecting and racing features of the game together. Buying packs is very expensive, but in some ways it is a nice challenge to work hard to get the thrill of opening a pack. I love being able to collect and race so many real cars. For a suggestion however, I think it would add a lot to the game if Hutch Games made it so there was a section where you could put the cars that your keeping only for collecting. It would just be easier to get them away from the cards that your using to race.' ],

     [ 'I love this game. It\'s the closest thing to tap tap revenge I\'ve ever found. A few notes though:  There is so much lag that it seriously impedes gameplay I really like having a customizable Avatar like ttr3 I don\'t really like how the notes jump into the button and stay there, I like when it\'s smoother.  Other than that I would say this is a great game!',
       'The only issue I have with this game is as a mobile game it is flawed. Naturally since it is vertical I hold it with two hands and play with two thumbs, making the triples (one note on every part) very hard to get all perfects on. Other that truly a fun game.',
       'I like it but i much prefer tap tap revenge where you have more of a song selection. I miss tap tap revenge 4 that was my favorite. But i guess this is as close as i can get to it. Maybe try adding some older popular songs i dont know half the songs on here',
       'Game itself is definitely a good throwback to the Tap Tap days, however I\'m disappointed with how Everlong (Foo Fighters, 100 rubies) cuts off at 2:02, rather than playing the entire song. Progression of rubies is kinda slow, which becomes bothersome if you don\'t enjoy pop music.',
       'I\'d love to give this game a good review but could never get it to work. It just kept saying I needed to download the YouTube app (which I already had) and reopen the game... I tried several times. Even tried opening the YouTube app and then the game, it still just keeps asking me to download the YouTube app. 😢😢😢',
       'Liked it until some glitches came. Sometimes when i tap a note, it registers as a miss even though the key was pressed. It messes up with my combo streak. I even tested it multiple times, even with a slower song and it still happened' ],

     [ 'Overall... I\'d have to say it\'s a very basic game and I wish there was more to it. I have always loved the Simpson\'s and playing a game based on their life is surely interesting. However, I was hoping that it would be more realistic, fun and free. It turns out that it\'s a P2P game and that took my surprise because it really is unfortunate. I hope they improve the gameplay and graphics. More updates will definitely bring more players.',
       'I used to give this a 5 star rating but at level 150 I maxed out the amount of items I can have in my Springfield. Playing the game at this stage is pretty useless. I\'m not a hoarder, my Springfield is beautifully arranged so there is no way I will delete things in order to build new houses or place new items. Will come back when the cap is increased but for now I\'m sadly forced to take a break.',
       'I have been plying this game for years i love it and quite often play more than once a day. The graphics are great as are all the challenges i hopr you bring the gifts for visiting you friends towns back i hopr this game goes on for a long time most of my family play to x',
       'Since about 2 days ago the game keeps disconnecting from the server and I constantly need to \'retry\' to connect. Sometimes I am able to enter the game, but only for a short while before it crashes. Unable to stay connected.  No problem with wifi as this happens on multiple connections and it appears to be from the game\'s side.',
       'Crafted a straight trench & boom my crafty points disappeared The IRS radius shortened, clicking finished jobs doesnt redirect me to the Toon player. Train tracks cant be crafted anymore. The Claw machine gives Bowling shoes WTH. Maka Sprungfuld gret agan!',
       'Great game for Simpsons fans. But what kills the fun are constantly new side missions. Just as you finished one, two new shows up. You can never concentrate on what\'s most important and that\'s building the Springfield but rather playing with some ruffians at the time now.' ],

     [ 'It’s a battle for the ages! Wait, we mean a battle of the ages – kids and adults are at war in Springfield! But what could cause this generational divide – Unfair bedtimes? Too many vegetables? Territory rights to the town’s new playground? (That last one was so specific it has to be true). Can Bart lead the youths to victory over Homer’s aged army and claim Springfield’s new Mega Playscape?',
       'Gather your troops, fortify your structures, and see saw your seesaws. It’s time for war.' ],

     [ 'This is a pretty good app,  but when building it needs an option to replace a room with another type. You shouldn\'t have to spend all your caps to rework a floor plan, especially when you built everything not knowing you could combine rooms since the help pop ups didn\'t mention that until after you had been building a while.  Other than that it is thoroughly acceptable.',
       'I love this game so much! It\'s very addicting and challenging. I love the animation I am all for it. I think though that one thing that would help is a pregnancy bar of some sort to tell you how long your person is pregnant for. That\'s something that I would add and maybe some times you get a huge wave of people and then you lose resources and such faster I think that may make it more challenging, but overall I love this game!',
       'I love this game, it\'s really fun. The only thing I wished was that when the characters level up, it actually does something more than raise their health. Like, increase stats in the place their working, or increase production. Maybe not every level, but there should be more benefits to leveling up. When bringing wastelanders back, let\'s say they are gone for an hour and you start to bring them back, when you get to ten minutes before they get home and put them back to exploration, they shouldn\'t jump back to where they started, from an hour. Idk. But I love the game.',
       'This game is so very exciting to play. As an avid fan of nearly all Bethesda games, this is a great mobile representation of their Fallout Universe. The gameplay is enticing and there is always something new around every quest; however it should be noted every quest storyline has variance, the quest gameplay is similiar between all. Comparing your dwellers from the beginning to a week into the game and there is a sense of accomplishment. The customisation of the dwellers and vault rooms is satisfying. The only thing I would add that isn\'t already presented, would be multiplayer. A way to send dwellers or explore eachothers vaults. If this option exists, and I just don\'t see it, I apologize.  Great game. Love to play.',
       'I really enjoyed this game but upgraded phone from s5 to note 8 and can\'t get my old game save back. Tried to follow steps and load from cloud but nothing loads. Wouldn\'t really care about starting over so much if I hadn\'t spent money on the game. Hopefully developer helps me out. I can screen shot order history to verify in game purchases if need be.',
       'Fallout shelter is a fun, beautiful quick game you can keep coming back to. For me fallout shelter is one of my most favorite games on mobile and keep coming back to even after over a year of playing it. They keep updating it to. There are plenty of things to collect as well as people u might know from the other fallout games. Really really fun and love the cartoony graphics as well as the easy controls. Great to kill time' ],

Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn\'t been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event\'s are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events\'  All in, pretty good.',
       'One of the best "tap" games. Love the satirical theme. Who would have thought that politics and money were SO interconnected😁. Just to be clear to some, I AM being sarcastic!!!! Great time waster. And that\'s NOT fake news.',
       'They put so many buttons to purchase things ion the main screen. When tapping as is the nature of the game, it brings up confirmation for your purchases. If you\'re trying to play fast, you could easily spend $20 in mere seconds without noticing. Put all the purchases in one place instead of cheating players.',
       'Good game but you need to fix your ads, half the time they either crash the game or they won\'t load and freeze the game so you have to restart. Also the game will randomly just close sometimes for no reason. Enjoy the game but there are definitely some bugs that need to be worked out.' ],

     [ 'This is a fun mix of simpler games with more challenging ones on each level. Extra points for the extra words makes it more interesting because they often include less common words and words of foreign origin. There are no clues as to what those words might be, so it\'s challenging. But there\'s also no penalty if a word isn\'t accepted.',
       'This game is great. It helps out with working in my focus and concentration issues I have do to TBI. I have to ask though, whats the point of collecting coins if I can only use them to pay fot hints. Also, maybe add a feature where you can use coins to change the background like on some card games. Or maybe just add a free feature to be avle to change backgrounds to a users own pictures in the gallery. Maybe add a few bonus rounds here and there where you have to find words in a time limit. That would be an exciting way to use your brain more. Just some thoughts. This game has some great potential!!! Keep up the good work!!!',
       'This game is a scam. It gets you going then it blocks on a game asking you to create a word and not accepting any possible combinations. You have to pay for a hint and then accepts a word you already tried before paying for the hint. This game is not really free. Scam stay away!',
       'This is a wonderful way to end my day. I am addicted. When I taught school, I would give my students a word. They were to find all the words they could out of the letters in the word. They loved to compete with others (kept them from exchanging words). Now I know why I had them do that. I love it, too!',
       'I would have given the app A five star review had it not been for the greed of the developer it\'s fun and challenging BUT to have an ad after every lvl and not being able to turn off ads permanently even with a purchase? Sorry it\'s an uninstall for me there are tons of word games with less greed',
       'I like the game because it help keep your mind sharp. Also it good for memory. The words are repeated and I like that.  It helps with concentration and focus. It can be used as a teachable tool also. So many little words I didn\'t know was word\'s.  So it also educate you' ],

     [ 'The game has gorgeous graphics. Each scene is very detailed and fun to play. Some are a little difficult to get through if you like to keep your brightness low like me and some items are incredibly tiny to find. But it has a fun premise and it\'s a pretty good time waster. However, you can\'t play for long. Each play takes 20 energy and it goes by quickly. Waiting for it to refill takes a long time. Getting stars to solve cases also takes some time. It\'s basically the wait time in this game that kinda kills it.',
       'The game was fine for 4 days. Do understand that that is maybe 40 min game play as it is so restricted. However it was a nice enough game that I was prepared to work with that. Today it has a bug, it requires me to click a certain button to continue, a button which is not onscreen. No way to proceed. Contacted WB and was told to file a report. Filed a report and the reply was you will not receive and answer.....well that\'s an unusual approach to customer service. I now have no option but to uninstall.  I could install it again, but really is there any reason to believe it won\'t have more similar issues?',
       'Beautiful hidden object experience. Offers a variety of gameplay including mirrored levels, timed levels, and spot the differences. The Facebook connection is there without being thrown in your face like some other games and is a nice subtle addition. It does work off of energy however I am willing to stick it out just for the storyline.',
       'It\'s a good game but having to wait so long for the energy build up takes away the excitement of the game play. Iv noticed alot of other game users have the same outlook on this game. Even the timers for tasks take way to long.. 6 hours to complete? Really? Why so long? People will get bored and find another stimulating game. This is based on the whole wizarding world so it should be alot more magical and less time consuming.',
       'Love the game overall but it takes way too long to build up energy. Because of this you are only able to play for very short periods of time before you have to wait for the energy to build back up. Also some of the \'inspection\' actions take way too long. Waiting 6+ hours for an action to be completed is excessive. I would love to be able to play the game for more than just a couple of minutes a day. I realize it is done to encourage people to make in app purchases, however, perhaps you could provide a paid version of the app to avoid this. I love the game and would love to be able to play it more.',
       'Love this game, but it has only 14 cases!! WTH?? The last case acted like you were going on to another one, but no. Feel like it shouldn\'t have been released with only 14 cases. Very similar to Criminal Case in a lot of ways. The upgrades help a lot, but it takes a while before you notice their effect and cost is too high, IMO.' ],

It\'s pretty quick to load back so it\'s still playable but it\'s definitely frustrating to have the restart the app constantly. One Plus 3',

Only one thing is not there, once you complete a level, you can\'t play that level again. It\'s a humble request to the developers that there should be a feature of playing previously played levels.',

     [ 'Great Game This game it truley fun to play! I don\'t understand why the rating is so low for it. The graphics are amazing and I like that you can connect with friends and play together. Honestly even though its a great game I wish we didn\'t have to wait to get more tokens to play. However if you really like the original game board Monopoly, than I suggest you get this app!! Don\'t judge a game by its rating!! ((;',
       'Computers players dice rolls feel manipulated. Also needs speed play to eliminate animations and skip to result of computers turn for faster rounds. Boring waiting for computer players to end their turns. Need more explanation of chance cards and swap options. Good concept and sound.. good graphics.. Stamps collected should literally be stamps in passport book.. not chips that doesn\'t make sense. Anyways I like it but the dice rolls feel pretty fishy.',
       'Needs more coins Game definitely would be a favorite of mine but the lack of coins is a bit disappointing considering how much fun it really is. 1or2 coins just isn\'t enough and needs some of the authenticity of the old board game Incorporated into it to make for longer gameplay. Hotels, community chest, ect. Then you would have my 5 🌟\'s.',
       'Good but what\'s the point? Good gameplay. Good graphics. Quicker than actual monopoly to play... However there is no incentive to win... No leader board, no win lose stats, no rewards, no unlockables... Nothing. So who cares if you come second third or fourth (that\'s just a loss) ... It should have win 25 games and unlock a different board or background or dice... The game would be worth 5 stars if it gave you reason to play.',
       'Format is good, ability to play the game fairly is poor. Several times I\'ve had a card played against me and did not know, so I couldn\'t use the \'just say no\' card I had. Other times I\'ve tried to use a card in the 3 seconds you get to react, but despite pushing the green tick to activate it - did not work. I lost the last game with 3 cards that I tried to use but couldn\'t...   Oh yeh, I bought 2 other versions of Monopoly on my galaxy 4 that I can\'t use on my galaxy 6, so I won\'t be buying this one..',
       'Could be better I like the concept... you have to wait entirely too long for your coins to regenerate.  Also why can\'t we play with random people online?  Good game over all but not worth 4 bucks for unlimited play with what is offered.  Basically you can play once per day smh... rethink this please then maybe I will rate it better or even buy it.  Why make it a free game and you really can\'t play' ],

     [ 'Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.',
       'Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning',
       'Absolutely amazing game!!! I\'m a huge petrol head and this ticks all boxes considering it\'s a phone game. Love the controls. Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress. Literally one downfall... upgrade costs when you get higher spec cars. Apart from that... GOOD JOB!!!',
       'Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I\'m just going to name some things that I\'m sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I\'m just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!',
       'I love this game but, I download it several times! And the download process is always stop at 98.8% and not finishing. And its say Download Error please check your connection setting! But my wifi connection is fine.Please help me ASAP i want this game so much',
       'Game devs please notice me... I dont know what happened to my account... But.. It was gone... My old save game was gone.. New save game appeared.. That was my brothers save game.. But mine was gone i\'m about to buy a new phone so I was trying to save my game data but.. After a few attemps.. My game restarted from the introduction race... On the first crash the game was stable until i loaded my brothers save data.. Then it was crashing again at went back to the introduction race... Now i deleted the game.. Please help me.. I really love this game... And i got so many cars... And data... :(' ],

It looks like it connected to a Facebook account and loaded an old game but I don\'t gave the option to disconnect. So frustrated!',
       'I love the game and have played it for almost 5 years now but for some reason it will not connect to facebook. Not sure what happened in the last update. Hopefully it gets fixed soon. I would hate if my phone got messed up and my progress is not saved',

Recently my phone was stole and had to get a new phone.  Familyfarm helped me recover my farm within a couple of days.  Their services were quick and resourceful.',
       'Fun game, but...What happened?  Don\'t like the snow,  it lightened all the colors of everything, they are not as vivid as they usually are.. With cataracts,  too hard on eyes,  all print got really small and can\'t read anymore.  Will have to quit til eyes get fixed.',
       'PLEASE HELP,  my pet is somehow stuck & I can\'t get him free. Makes it harder not being able to move paths or his home whiles he\'s out or I could get him unstuck.   Please make an update where you can move these things while pets are out, or get my pet unstuck for me. Otherwise I won\'t be able to continue the game due the the inconvenience it\'s making.   (other then that the game is real fun & would like to continue it.)',

       'The responsiveness of the controls I  this game make it unplayable... it\'s slightly more responsive than the original sonic dash but it\'s still no where near good enough for such a fast paced game.  I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it\'s the same on all of them',
       'I would give it 5 stars, I made an in app purchase to remove ads, but after the game updated non Sega ads started showing again and it asked me to make another purchase in order to remove the non Sega ads AGAIN... love the game, hate the ads...',
       'The game is great but the ads are so intrusive, immersion-breaking, and so annoying that I\'m giving the game 3 stars. Please, I understand that ads are necessary to make money for a free game but make it so that they are not so persistent that an ad automatically opens after a single run. A shame really, this would be such a great game if this would be fixed.' ],

It doesn\'t take any internet and the animals in details so good and the graphics. If you\'re ever bored you should download this game and play it all the time.',
       'Problem really is that the special event levels regularly wont load. So the last 2 events ive only been able to take part for a day then whenever I try to open the app just closes.  No clue how to report this. Normal game play is okay but put off it a lot due to regular problems.',
       'Sometimes it feels like the difficulty of the levels is way off. Levels labeled "hard" or "super hard" are many times much easier than standard levels. I do enjoy the amount of unlimited lives given, and the speed at which lives are replenished, however. Overall, a good time-passer',
       'Guys, you have a glitch that needs fixed. Side game (right now the ignite game) causes app to close every time. Also... Inserting the gold in the piggy bank takes way too long. Speeding up that process or allowing a skip feature would be nice.',
       'It\'s been at least 3 or 4 weeks since I\'ve been able to accept any lives given by friends. For a game that has so many downloads, developers sure have an issue addressing mad fixing it. I\'ve list roughly 100 lives to this issue. Please fix it!!!',
       'I adore this game. However, I have had 7 gold bars for over a year and every time I win a level that awards lots of gold bars the game tells me my bank is full... even though everything costs at least 9 gold bars. According to my math I should have over 100 bars. I would settle for two at this point.' ],

     [ 'I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.',
       'I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn\'t work.  So I pressed the \'X\' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I\'m pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE \'X\'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I\'m triggered.  Please fix that.',
       'I really, really love this game, but, I keep losing my ball count and I don\'t understand why this is happening. For instance, I have 90 balls and I\'m supposed to have 92, I don\'t get the 92. I will give 5 stars until the bug is fixed. The ads I don\'t care about because that only happens at the end of each game which is ok. Please fix this so I can give you 5 stars.  Update- I figured out why I keep losing my count with my balls. Everytime I get the balls by the number blocks, it wouldn\'t count them😐 I could get a lot further if this was fixed. If this keeps on happening, I\'m going to uninstall this game. I hope it doesn\'t come to that because I really love this game. Please fix asap!!',
       'If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.',
       'It\'s good at first but you\'ll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.',
       'Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I\'m not spoiling it, but I will tell you it\'s a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don\'t know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.' ],

Before we were required to have an 89 ovr+ team with atleast 5 Brazilian players but now it has completely changed. Now we are required to have a 98 ovr+ team with atleast 6 Brazilian players. I hope you make the icons a bit more easier. Thanks☺',
       'Fut can not be developed with this building team. Football is one of the most attractive games but how this fut goes? In Vs attack mode, what the hell meaning do chances have? Players must creat chances by themselves not the game. You must let them play whole game and create the chances by themselves. EA is a big builder in football games and develop a lot but have you ever thought how your fut only stands at this place?',
       'The game is nice for every football fan.... Nice controls and good graphics...events are awesome... There r different game modes.. the only thing that I don\'t like after the recent update is that while playing campaign mode there are many stages which requires u to be in certain lvl in VS mode.... I think both the modes should be independent.. otherwise it\'s a fabulous game... The most awesome football game in play store right now.',
       'overall its an awesome game great experience. but Its hard for free to play players to complete and go through the events..... the icons are too difficult to get please make them a bit earlier to get, it will be awesome to have them in the team.... its difficult to get elite players in a pack of 500 fp totw pack n few others packs too... the vs attack mode is great.... EA please make sure that the free to play players to get a good experience of getting new and better players....',
       'Very good game , addictive..I love to play this game.. Events are fun.. But not at all happy with the team hero, if you play for 3 month also you won\'t be able to proceed further.. Very very slow process, icons are very much hard to get It will be much better if individual player stats added like goals, passes. It will be more fun if you guys fix it',
       'Fifa mobile is a soccer game that lets you be a manager and manage the best team. This game have well made graphics and gameplay. The events are fun, campaigns are exciting and attack vs attack are addicting but, no games are perfect in this case it is hard for free to player to complete the team hero event and daily microtransaction are needed. I hope EA will adress this issue.' ],

       'I can\'t see myself EVER giving EA mobile games anything but a 1 star rating, the game is geared to cheat unless you\'re spending actual $ on paccs & players. How many times can an event rob you of stamina to only rob you again by redundantly giving you the same fucc\'n collectables over & over & over again!!! By the time you actually complete the set either the seasons over, or there\'s better players @ the position that you\'ll probably never end up getting either... Unless you spend some cash.

This is so very very bad news with you EA. If you still use this rule, i think... this game can be game over forever. You should back this rule like before. if you can\'t, everymonts, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, this rating of Nbalivemobile always down, decrease, and fall, hopefully you can understand if you feel this game very important for you!

     [ 'Soul eggs are incredibly buggy. On the higher level eggs you can go from earning 10s a sec to 1 a sec just by closing the app. The extra soul eggs through epic research when you prestige isn\'t clear enough and doesn\'t match the description. Later game is very much about waiting for a counter to hit one billion which means you don\'t need to open the app all that much. Other than that, it\'s ok.',
       'Very good game overall, relaxing and good to play if you have a short period of free time. The only thing I would say is I wish opening the piggy bank didn\'t cost REAL money because I have thousands of golden eggs in it but I can\'t get them out because I don\'t want to spend money. Maybe make it that you have to spend TONS of the in-game money to open it. I would rate this 4/5 stars, as I thoroughly enjoy it.',
       'I play the game all the time, but it needs easier and faster prestige. Three days of waiting for the next egg is bs with a prestige score of almost 1,000,000. Also "silos" hardly earn anything. That\'s my main complaint. Fix it so they earn WAY more over non play or I\'m done and I\'ve actually spent money so if you still want that, fix it.',
       'Fun and simple game that lets you gradually grow your farm at your own speed. This is a game you can play from once a week where you collect the money you\'ve collected offline, buy upgrades, then leave the game for another week; to spending a few casual hours of hunting for the drones that give you extra money and gold eggs which are the games micro-transaction currency to buy permanent upgrades that help your farm grow faster. It not so much a race as it is just enjoying your farm steadily grow over time.',
       'Edit: Latest update is thoroughly average. Some great new tools and really cool upgrades mixed in with ridiculously boring time sink achievements. They breathed new life into the game and then stuffed it up and made me sit around for 20 actual real life days for each egg waiting for a chicken counter to reach a billion. Such a shame.  I like big numbers and Egg Inc. delivers in spades. Click and hold functionality, strategic planning and approachable mission targets; one of the best in the genre.',
       'My only complaint is when is that everything you tap opens a menu. So if you were to try to hit a drone and accidentally tap the housing it opens that menu and you can\'t close it fast enough to still get the drone. I think there should just be a single or couple small menu buttons that allow you to cycle through the different things you can purchase to avoid this. Other than that great game! It\'s entertaining to have 100 million chickens in your pocket.' ],

       'Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won\'t reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.',
       'The game starts off good in the first couple levels. But once you start getting to the faster cars, it becomes way harder to keep up with the cars PR points, to get to better races. Unless you spend real money to get the parts. One question I do have. Is about the blackridge rivals. Why put some one with a car at a way higher level against a person who\'s car isn\'t even close to the car at a high level, and one more thing... make the races longer. 20 seconds a race isn\'t fun at all. Thinking with the name "Need For Speed". You guys would of done a lot better. The only thing that I seem to like are the  graphics... But that\'s about it...',
       'Goog game, adddictive infact. But I don\'t understand the concept of PATANJALI adds. Whenever i choose to see adds to reduce the waiting time, you comeup with Patanjali adds of 10 and 20 seconds and the irritating part is the time doesn\'t gets reduced even after watching the whole add. Please fix this. When you say reduce wait time by watching add, you need to actually reduce the waiting time after the add instead of insisting to watch the add again and again.',
       'When I started playing this game I really enjoyed it. But now I realise that in order to progress, you MUST spend REAL money. I am a family man, with a wife and 6 children, I just wanted a game that I could play when kids are in bed and wife is in bath, I don\'t have cash to spend on games, the worst thing is the 7 Day events, you cannot beat them without spending money. Very disappointed. Good game but don\'t expect to progress very far if you don\'t want to spend money.' ],

I get a deep feeling of satisfaction every time that pigeon eats that delicious fruit. Also you have a great art style man! I\'ve never seen such good, original art in a game like this! Truly amazing! Just kidding, I know you stole that art. This game is horrible.  I hope it gets banned soon.',
       'Didnt think youd get caught stealing independent artist\'s work huh? DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. IT IS BLATENT PLAGIARISM AND IS RIPPED OFF FROM K-EKE ON TUMBLR. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS COMPANY OR THIS GAME. IT ENCORAGES BIG COMPANIES FROM STEALING FROM INDI ARTISTS. STOP THIS NOW AND REPENT.',
       'Had to see for myself if it is really plagiarism and I have to say it is so.  I had some doubt at first, but I know for sure now that the animation work is completely stolen.  Now if only you made your own animations you wouldn\'t have your game in jeopardy!  It appears the whole appeal of this inherently bland gameplay is the visuals of dancing birds.  Shame!',
       'Do not get this game, I only downloaded this to tell you that it\'s artstyle is a very obvious ripoff of a guy named Kevin who makes bird animations. He\'s on YouTube and Tumblr and this is his work made into a game without his permission. If you do get this game then I hope it\'s only to leave a bad review, that\'s all this game deserves.',
       'This is not a legitimate game. All the artwork and animation featured in the game design is plagiarised from Kevin Gemin, a freelance artist on several platforms. To take and profit from the hard work of an artist and not credit them let alone ask permission is below the scum of the earth. Don\'t download this trash and instead allow me to redirect to the proper source of "inspiration."

You would think that a small indie studio would be respectful of freelance artists and their work, but that\'s not the case with Fortafy Games. This is shameful and needs to be removed from this platform, along with apologies and compensation to the artists you stole from.' ],

     [ 'I have only had this game for a few days, so I can\'t write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it\'s up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.',
       'Man i love this game!!! So much better than wolfquest!!! I do hope tht this game soon be added new things like more animal to play as, better in performance. The ad free guys...keep it up!!! Just wondering if there\'s a add as mate system in multiplayer in the future? Anyways....this is the best wolf game tht i played!!! Do hope tht you guys one day add more animals to play as (like a snow leopard for example)',
       'Love it but pleeeeeaaaase make it possible to play as a boar or a rabbit or deer. Also I think it would be really nice to have a hunger and thirst bar because there is no real point in drinking. That way if you dont have enough food or water you start to lose health.  Also I don\'t think we really need stamina from the food we eat.  These are just suggestions but I really really love this game.  Best simulator out there.',
       'It just lags now. The new update made it to where my chat, my character, and my animations won\'t work. I run about as fast as a turtle, and I am not pregnant. Please fix!!!! I love this game. I have a few questions if you don\'t mind... Can you guys add in multi-player mode, like single player mode, that we can pick up our pups, it would be cool to add that option in the top left menu. Thank you guys so much!! Love the games!!',
       'Most realistic wolf sim I have found out there, with the ability to get a mate, have cubs and your own den in which you can invite players into. There are also multiplayer game servers and an ability to create your own public or private game. You can also play as a wolf, fox or lynx and customize eyes, pelts and add masks/hats and scars/clothing. Its just AMAZING! Also saying that you don\'t have to pay to play and in-game currency is easy to get.',
       'On one of the quest, I think 11. There ia a syrange new animal and I went to the game menu for information and there wasn\'t any. It looks like a brown rabbit, I tried killing Rabbits squirrels and deer, but It wasn\'t the right animal! Is it in the snow biome?  Anyways hope you can help me and otger quest 11 users. It\'ll be great that when you get the same animal twice it counts as duplicate. For example "Wolf Common Duplicate +(however acorns). Thanks and the update is great!' ],

     [ 'This game is very fun and addictive but should have offline mode so we don\'t have to deal with a hacker every game.  Also after new update I\'m having issues getting into the game. It says "check comnection" and my connection is fine even tried uninstalling it and all. Other games work on my phone and so does my Wi-Fi. The game just worked last night for me now it doesn\'t! PLEASE FIX!!',
       'Just good. This game is great. The controls are completely customizable so you can make it work the way you want it to. Graphics are on point, better than 2nd Gen consoles, lesser than 3rd gen. If this game came out in the age of the PS2 I would have bought it. Also, buy a box because this game couldn\'t have been cheap to make. This game should cost like $25.',
       'Could you please add an offline mode...would be nice to practice on the go. Also please please please add more guns. I have been playing this game for a year and still no new guns but glad you are keeping up with the maps. I have this HUGE problem, it says check connection when I have good connection. I tried to restart my phone and reconnect but still doesn\'t work. PLEASE FIX.',
       'I loved the game before. It was one of the best fps game I have ever seen. But after the ban in pc you guys have lost a lot of players. And I too now hate the game. It was moreover greater than counter strike go, but after the ban you guys made all of us disappointed. If you would have continued with this game on pc I am surely telling that this would be known as people\'s choice game. So please consider to it and bring back this game on pc.  Thank you,  Your great full player',

First is crouching, it\'s impossible to build bridges if I\'m always falling, Second is sound FX, for me it\'s too quiet and the fact of footsteps and moos and oinks and clucks is very good.

       'It\'s a cool name. I\'d like it if I could play it. But I run out of energy afternoon racing once. It goes it and either doesn\'t find opponents or it does then freezes and it wasted all my energy every time. Thumbs down',
       'Pros:  - addictive  - fast energy charge  - multiple ways to earn diamonds  - engaging  - almost perfect matchmaking  Cons:  - too many ads  - slight bugs, not worth mentioning here  Overall, this is an addicting game. Various races, rarely-close to never on the same track. The gameplay is close to awesome and the graphics are in tune with the game type. If not for the overwhelming ads, I would have given a 5 (IMO, the ads should have been mostly at the results page after 3 races, not after every race). Matchmaking is done so that everyone has a chance to win.  But, at the end, it\'s not about the ads and not about winning. It\'s all about the race!',

     [ 'I\'m loving these updates really bring more life to the game. The new car is really fun because it can flip over really easy. Please don\'t change that. A few suggestions: When you go to winter wonderland you can\'t go back. Would be cool if car panels would become detached like the hood or the trunk. Adding a police cruiser would be cool too. I like the breakable rear lights on some of the cars. Maybe add deflatable tires? Very good game all in all',
       'I had loved this game until it stopped saving my car purchases. Like my last  one the pick up that looks exactly like a 80s chevy with the cap off and roll cage. I put 7.0 motor in it with NOS tires and paint. Went in this morning it was gone. Please fix.Norton also says you\'re monitoring my location how obtrusive you dushbags.',
       'Kept telling me that I was going the wrong way even though I was going the right way while racing. Which then it puts you in last place. So, I\'m uninstalling this game because it\'s frustrating to be winning a race and a design flaw ruins the game for me. Also, giving more camera angles would be nice for the other players not uninstalling this game like I am right now☠☠☠☠',
       'Need a 67 Shelby mustang gt 500 fastback "Eleanor". Also needs a hand brake for sharp turns and drifting and maybe an inside view with steering wheel and stick shift. Very fun and addicting game. Great job here. Multi-player would be cool too.',
       'This game is really fun and additive I play it EVERYDAY. This game is by far the best demolition derby game I,ve  played. For my free car I would like a lykan hypersport please!!! ;-) If you do not know what it is please look it up and please try to make it they are really cool, fast, and exotic cars. If not I would like tank. Thank you for reading.',
       'With new upgrade, you took a great game and made it awsome!!!!!Thank you. My favorite car is the dodge chargers.(yes both types) This game should get 8 stars.Possibility can add 1987 chevy 4×4 pickup truck?Would be cool with big grill guard.It is my favorite truck style.Thank you for your time.I really like this game so far.It does have a little bit of glitch. Otherthen that a great game.I really like that you use the adds to benefit the play of the game.Thank you again for a great game.The new upgrades are awsome.Thank you for adding the Chevy trucks.Great game!

     [ 'Would\'ve liked to use some of my pics to make puzzles, but it seems the only way to do this is to connect with Facebook....which I don\'t use. And for safety reasons cannot use. There\'s some packet to buy for 4.99 but why when you can share for free in another section IF you use Facebook. Turns me off to some of the great features of this app. Gameplay is nice. Puzzle options reasonable. Works well on small devices.  Stock photos are attractive and make challenging puzzles, which brings me back to my main critique: what is the problem with allowing someone who doesn\'t use Facebook to use their own photos to make their own puzzle to play? Can you not write something into a privacy policy or terms of use for your app that can protect you and said person when uploading their photos. Or is it that Facebook does all that for you?   So, maybe you\'ll fix this and I could reinstall your app?',
       'Would rate higher but the ads are a massive annoyance, open the app get an ad, leave the app get an ad, rejoin and get another ad, load a puzzle get an ad, stray too far to the right when selecting a piece and BOOM yet another ad. That and the lag when trying to move pieces. Oh and the incessant pestering to upgrade and rate',

It\'s the TANKS and the SUVS   or make it a banable offence because all people do is camp in the last circle with a tank or a suv. Please fix this and I will rate 5 stars. And I know this is meant to be a minecraft version of pubg but pubg never had tanks or armoured suvs so please fix it. And is it just me but some of the players feel like bots. 😂',

     [ 'This game is brilliant!!!!!! The gameplay is magnificent and the power ups are amazing. This really really gets everyone laughing when the players fling out the cars, especially the kids. What you guys could do over there is make a button that randomises the cars that you have. Great game. I would definitely recommend it to a friend',
       'This game is just a cash grab.  Just a little thought and the dev got obviously greedy. Have to buy literally everything with real life money,  there\'s no incentive to play more than 5 minutes.',
       'A fun downhill racer with cool weapons, cars, and avatars. One of those avatars looks suspiciously like JackSepticEye, which renewed my interest.  One suggestion... instead of immediately over with the littlest hit, apply a damage or time limit for a better end wreck.',
       'Was pretty fun! Untill the rediculous amount of Ads after the first try! I don\'t not want to watch 3 videos between plays, absolutely rediculous',
       'I love the game it is soo funny when I fall the little avatars they make me feel so much better. I love it how you get new and diffrent cars. Make sure you get this game it looks boring but it is soo fun :)',
       'I think this game is for telling  that how can we manage a break failed car and in this game there are very nice car and we get a new car when we have 100 coins and when we get out sometimes there is written win a price and if we have 100 coins so we can click on that and after clicking that we get 2 option one of car and another of costume so you click any option your 100 coins get cut and there are 3 boxes click one so then you got a new car' ],

     [ 'I\'m really fond of this game and love the gameplay and quick paced matches. The new update is AMAZING!   There are a few things that would make this game extra perfect for me!   Must have character customisation. This would be of big amazing to me. Char customisation makes me bind more to certain characters. The rings we get don\'t have much value to them except for upgrading the characters.  Could have non-ranked matches. I would love the option to play/practice against rivals or my own friends.   Should have quick chat responses. Would like to communicate before and after the match with simple reactions. Like Good luck and I win, tee-hee!',
       'This is one of the best mobile games I have played I a while. I probobly have a bias sense I love Sonic so much. However, if one thing could be added I would say it should be a converter for the Red Star rings to normal rings. Unless you want them to be payed for. I don\'t really care either way I\'ll just buy the Red Star rings but I brought up that idea because I currently have 23,000 rings just kinda waiting to be spent. Maybe incorporate phone backgrounds or some customizations for the game that cost extra rings? Thankyou so much for the new update and if anyone I\'d debating on installing it just get it. You\'ll have fun, trust me.',
       'To many ads unless you make some kind of purchase. Loading screens seem to take longer than I\'d like. You can\'t at this time play with friends as Opponents are automatically chosen. There is still some characters ability noise in the game even if you have music and sound off. I\'d like to see characters abilities not to be so similar, but it isn\'t taking away from the game at the moment for me. With all that said though the graphics are great, the game is fun, and it\'s worth the $1.99 purchase I made.',
       'A fun premise ruined by a horrendous match making system,  ridiculous  unlocking time gates, and obvious pay to win incentives.  You\'ll be constantly matched with players with levels far higher than your own and the rewards are minimal for the all the effort.  The constant ads that play after every match is beyond irritating.',
       'Love the game, but there\'s something wrong.. Well... I think Cream is kinda rigged. Her items are a bit OP for the other players which makes it an easy stage into a extremely hard stage. And also, the deduction of trophies in 4th place is too much! Please make it lower (like maybe at around 5 or 8) and change the deduction of trophies in 3rd place 0 (These are all just suggestions I have). If you read this SEGA, your games are great and keep up the good work!',
       'Please add a custom character, there is one in the main game so there should be one here to. Also please add infinite, cubot, orbot, and eggman. Also some more variety of music and areas would be good. Thank you for reading and for the great game! :)  (Edit): we need a friending system and to be able to customize our characters so that we have SOMETHING to spend rings on. And Espio needs some serious buffing because right now, he is pathetic.' ],

     [ 'So I\'ve won around 100 battles so far. Enjoying the game. Ready to see where this game is taken. I feel updates could make this unto the best mobile music game on the playstore. It\'s nice to always be able to recharge your stamina through ads. I hope updates come and also limited decals. One drawback and a fix needed is losing the stuff you paid for when you change the item.',
       'Would be better if you were placed in matched based not only on your discs but also on the levels of your band. I shouldn\'t get a perfect score and STILL lose because their passive is higher than mine but they made more mistakes. Also maybe up the sensitivity? it seems like the system doesn\'t quite pick up on my tapping  which causes me to miss notes. Graphics are nice and the spin offs are good.',
       'What happens when you miss a note??? NOTHING. the song keeps playing perfectly so what then is the point of playing the game correctly if there is no penalty on the song quality? No point besides screen shaking smh. Make it like the console version where you hear a bad note.',
       'Love the game. But inform understand how I can keep getting 100 percent and losing by 3 or 4000 points.   And. Why is it. Certain times of the day I win. A lot. And some times of the day I lose slot.  She. I win its always against the same person and they get the exact same score.  And don\'t use the pedal.  Just seems weird to me.',
       'I can never watch a video for more stamina and everytime I try to collect the 2x reward money by watching the video the game just glitches out on me. I would have so much more without the flaw. I want to make in-app purchases but this deters me for sure. UPDATE!',
       'Game is really fun. The ads for other game aren\'t cool if you let your kids play the game. Especially it having an E rating. That is unacceptable. I understand ads is why it\'s free  but don\'t have 14+ rated game ads for an E game. Glad I didn\'t let my kids play this yet' ],

     [ 'Hello I\'ve been playing this game for months, so much so that I began to pay to play it. In October of 2017 I had a late payment that resulted in me loosing my VIP status. However; My bank account reflected withdrawals of 9.99 for game plays from October 2017 until January 2018. Google was able to give my money back for January but I have to now contact the Administration of this game in order to be reimbursed for previous months. I love playing this game but I will no longer pay to play anymore.  I will keep you all posted on my outcome.',
       'Decent amount of ads.  I sometimes have an issue where it suddenly stops accepting input. The game doesn\'t freeze, just can\'t do anything. I\'ve tried going to home screen and back and even turning my screen off and back on, nothing works.  Have to force close it. :(  this happens maybe 1 out of every 7 or 8 times I play.  Samsung note 8.   A "live" or else "play with a friend" type of feature would be cool.',
       'The game itself is very amazing in graphics and very creative. BUT as for the VIP membership, it\'s totally absurd that we have to pay $9.99 plus taxes monthly. I would be fine with it if it was $9.99 a year. Hope that this will change some day. I love playing this game. I play this EVERYDAY, even more than any other games. Please consider about changing the membership fee to yearly rather than monthly.',
       'the game does too many resets, all on its own. i can be in the middle of a game, and the game will stop in mid-stream, then start a new game, and causing me to lose not only what i have "won", but will set me all the way back to the bronze box, or, in the case of special games, such as the winter sports 2018, back to the red box, when i actually finished and won the silver medal. the game can be veeerrrrryyyy slooooooooow, and often is. i enjoy the show when i get a chance to watch it, but am not so sure about the game. it would also be nice if there were instructions on how to play the features that are *not* in the tv show...',
       'Game has been great for over a year! All of a sudden I\'m not able to play the "Happy Hour" "tickets in every box" bonus hours or even obtain the rewards. I contacted customer support and was advised to make sure the app was updated, clear my cache and restart my phone....didn\'t work!!!',
       'It\'s very addictive and a lot of fun to play.  There are way too many pop up ads as others have said.  I\'d like to see one change...in the real game a player can spin continuously until s/he doesn\'t get a letter or lands on an item where they lose their turn.  As it stands your turn is up after you spin or buy a vowel or vice versa.' ],

     [ 'I played it a long time ago and i stopted like 5 months ago. Then now i reinstalled it and:  1. I could not enter my acc  2. I could not connect to facebook or google play.  3. I had to pay each time i danced wich sucks.  Till that update this game was the best game/app ever. It was so fun and so great that I just wanted to play nonstop.  I mean before this big update u payed for a song and u could dance on it as much as you liked. Now it just ain\'t fun anymore.   Please return to the classic game or your gonna lose much much more players like me.',
       'Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren\'t enough. And one of them didn\'t work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.',
       'I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.',
       'It\'s fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I\'m bored. I love the songs and dance moves it\'s awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it\'s awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don\'t know how to dance then you should download this game it\'s perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.',
       'Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn\'t have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!',
       'I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn\'t make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun.' ],

     [ 'Good I hope they fixed the bug where you double buy a car and it gives you the same car but still takes your money. But its still a great game. Ohh! And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.',
       'It\'s good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn\'t too much skill involved but it\'s a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I\'ve lost countless games because it doesn\'t stop or doesn\'t back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!',
       'Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it\'s a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can\'t go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I\'m out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!',
       'Good, but has some bugs I\'m sorry if I\'m being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall',
       'Shalom there, The game is awesome. I liked it very much and hoping that in the future they will be more cars to be added. I really hope that "military helicopter" can shoot something, it is funny...so idle. Last thing, a HOVERCRAFT can go "river mode" ! Wrecked... because of...water. Hope you\'ll add the " police boats " in next update. Overall, abundant of thanks and good luck.',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME. It just need\'s some work to do. Like, you guys need to fix the glitch of the lines by the road. And you need to fix when we explode the oil truck and fall on the ground and you disapear. And can u guys please add some new prizes like to change the color of ur car. And when I have 100 dollars u can spend it on colors  theirs a button to choose what prize you want. Like say I get the color blue for a red car. And I like the red car so I go to the prize machins and choose to buy a color than I have the button to change the color of ur car. That will make the game a lot better. And I\'m sure when u do it there will be more downloads.' ],

     [ 'This now a prize example of a freemium game that needs a premium option. I would gladly pay £10 as a one off purchase to do away with the need to say for lives. In the past games worthy of a one-off fee would offer it and this issue such game that should consider it. I will never pay for any in app purchases on any game and I am sure I am not alone. This has 5* written all over it but the long wait times and exorbitant cost of energy replenishing means this doesn\'t get anything higher than average.',
       'Loved the game but if the life was free this waiting for minutes to play again is not cool. Also noticed if you have to score more than 1 goal and you make a mistake you have to start from the same goal you already scored. If we can get the requirements before each challenge that would make it much more fun otherwise I love this game a lot keep updating for more seasons. Thank you. I am on Level 560 with 1257 stars I am awaiting Season 29. If you can also create a full football game with same concept. This is a Great game!!! Thank you developers keep developing Great games like these!!!',

I have finished 390 levels. And I have a doubt what is the last level and what happens after it? All the best for ur future and I\'m a biiiiiiig fans of u guys!!  Hands off',
       'SCORE  HERO RULES This game is so sick dudes. It so cool that this gives us idea that how to play soccer or football. Gameplay is so smooth . They players show us some epic skills . It has an commentary. The worst part was the heart. I can\'t wait till it get refilled ❤❤❤❤❤ this. Graphics are great . Just reduce the time of refilling the energy . Overall this game cool. Thanks for the game FTG.',
       'Great game! I enjoyed it alot. Finished the whole game (540 matches, over 1400🌟) in 1 month without spending any $.   3 more months: got ALL 1680🌟 not spending any $.  Gameplay improvement required: after missing a shot off the woodwork or a penalty kick the player should go for the rebound , not stop!',
       'Great game. It is just like Fifa the journey!😃😃😃😁 please fix the lives because when I am on lives it goes down from 5 to 0 in 1 turn. I only lost it once and it took all my lives. Please reduce the time to get lives back as well. Its ridiculous' ],

     [ 'Well, I still liked Duel Generations better, and wish that that game would work again, but I have to admit that visually and game play wise Deul Links is pretty amazing. Especially for a free game. I haven\'t gotten very far into it yet, but so far it\'s intuitive and just really slick looking. However, there is one reason I still would prefer Generations, and that is because I loved the inclusion of ALL versions of Yu-Gi-Oh, not just the first series. I grew up with 5DS  and Zexal more than anything, and I wish that those series could be incorporated into the game somehow. I\'d love to be able to play as Kite or Astral or something.',
       'this truly an amazing game, there\'s really only a couple of things, why reduce the monster and spell/trap zones to only 3 cards? I wouldn\'t say it\'s bad, I just don\'t see why you\'d need to do it.. plus the average deck size of yugioh is between 40 and 50 cards, why limit us to only a max of 30 cards? (not including the 5 for extra  decks) but all in all its a great game! Finally got my six samurai deck!😄 also, I think it\'d be an awesome idea to put in a way for duelists to redeem the codes on the cards they\'ve purchased IRL. I bet that\'d get even more duelists to play! Just a thought though😊',
       'Never played Yugioh this is the first time in this game and it is easily accessible with this game to get into this card game. I liked Yugioh better than the other TCG game like Pokémon,Hearthstone,Magic etc and I thought they are kind of more complicated for me because of their sourcing system like mana and energy while its all about monster cards, traps and spells etc. Very good card game and newbie friendly in general both those wanting to get into Yugioh and card gaming in general :D',
       'Found Yu-Gi-Oh on Netflix last week and decided to rewatch it. A few episodes in, and my love for the show rekindled, I got eager to play the game myself. I used to play with Yu-Go-Oh cards when I was a kid but it\'s been about 12 years since then and so all my old cards are in the loft, not that I know anyone IRL anymore who would fancy a game anyway, and not accessible right now... plus I had forgotten most of the rules too. But this app is just what I was looking for: a way to relearn the rules and have a bit of fun. Perfect for whatever skill level you\'re at with the game!',
       'Just sad if only they could fix the  zone to 5 monsters spell and trap cards. Plus the starting with 5 cards and the original deck size and life points to 8000 it would be soo good. Hope you do that and fix it im sure more ppl would  play this if you do',
       'Trash, true fans would never say this game is great. Only 3 monster and spell/trap zones and the person that goes first only starts with 4 cards? Really? Not to mention the terrible camera angles and rigged matches. If you\'re a competitive player that doesn\'t like to get bs, don\'t play this.' ],

       'After I posted my recent comment, there were some angry comments pointed out at me. I apologise for that. I mean, this game in great! There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars. For someone who says "too many notifications", go to the settings and turn off that notifications button. Thank you for those hate critics you guys made. It really teached me a lesson.',
       'It\'s been more than a year that you haven\'t added any mini game in any update. You\'ve written on "What\'s New" section that "We\'re working on something big" but you .haven\'t shown that big work yet😅..At least add more mini games...And I\'ll rate 5.',
       'I was addicted to the game the first time I played it.  Still love it and have put it on every device I\'ve had since I was first introduced to the game.  Pou has been a constant source of entertainment for over three years!  Love love  love it!  Oh and I almost forgot to tell you that I am 56 years old!!  Lol. It is really that fun to play!',

Any time I try to use the joystick it would go to another place on the screen, and other times would make my blob automatically go somewhere without me even using the joystick. If it is just my device making the game buggy then is it still possible to fix somehow? Please let me know.',
       'This game makes me mad cause every time I get the daily quest I win and when the game ends it tells me that it\'s loading and when it\'s loads it shows that i didn\'t pass the quest.. I loved this game a the beginning it was working fine now it does this all the time. It\'s sad that you get hooked on the game then it starts to do this and can\'t even play it right.  Please fix it cause i really love this game and don\'t want to have to delete it.',

Can\'t play with the data packages only strong wifi.  You didn\'t fix this in the new edition of the game and the rush mode is not working. The new party is sucks big time. Fix fix fix',
       'If one of you game Creators survives more than 5 mins in that game where everyone is teaming up I will rate the game 5 stars again... Half of times i respawn  i get eaten before even the game starts. And one time i payed the X3 for 1 hour i was ever respawning on viruses . The game is nice but the performance is not nice.',
       '1. Lag is a killer. Even with high speed internet, my character jumps around and pauses. Then,  when it recovers,  i get eaten. Unplayable with the lag.  2. Ads freeze the game. When returning from an ad, i have to quit the game then restart.  3. Game is fun when controls are smooth. Maybe there are too many characters on one board and server has difficulty tracking everyone.',
       'What is this???? After every 1 or 2 game when the main menu comes I touch screen just frozes I can\'t even touch any button. Neither I can play nor I can go to shop it\'s nothing I can do but just to quit the game. My phone is Samsung S6  Pls do something it\'s really irritating' ],

     [ 'Amazing app! My sister broke my old piano 2 years ago and I gave up. When I started thinking that I need to start again in my piano career, I started looking for piano apps that I could play my own music. Unfortunately, a lot of the apps didn\'t work for me until I came across this one. Just to say thanks for making this great app. :)',
       'This, after 6 years of playing piano has narrowed all my work down to half the size.. I\'ve been a musical genius, and then tragedy struck, and I lost my ability completely half my life... wasted. But this app helped me to relearn how to play. Thank you. Thank you immensely',
       'Fun to noodle around on, but significant delay when using Bluetooth speakers or headphone (since I haven\'t this issue with other apps I can only surmise it is exclusive to this app) which isn\'t great considering wireless audio is quickly becoming the standard.',

     [ 'I love the challenging concepts. But in 2 of the levels, there was no way I could work out the clue. You cannot see a hole in the wall in level 9. Not can you figure out the code on drawers in level 11 as the colour shapes are not relevant to anything. I had to go to clue which was disappointinting and still didn\'t follow. Otherwise I would score game higher. A few tweaks would be nice please.',
       'Really impressed with this Escape room! I\'ve tried several others where I don\'t get anywhere, it makes it no fun to play! This one is just hard enough and some easy ones as well that it makes you use your brain & have fun at the same time!!! I\'m basically a beginner and got stumped quite a few times, but eventually figured it out. This is the best escape room app I\'ve played so far! Please make more!',
       'This really got me thinking, I loved the variety in the levels. The only issue is that some levels do have steps that are impossible to figure out as there\'s no connection in the clues. I had to use the videos more than I would\'ve liked. The other issue is that you can\'t save progress so have to start a level from the beginning if you move away from the app.  Overall a really fun game that\'s had a lot of thought put into it.',
       'Well thought out and masterfully crafted. Graphics r pretty cool too. Not a silly seek and find, this is more a.treasure hunt and use your noggin to problem solve. Beyond fun, it is entertaining and you actually feel pretty happy when you figure it out on your own. Stuck? You can watch a video that shows how u can escape and complete the level from start to finish.  Yo u do not have to watch worthless vids to get  any rewards. Creators deserve respect on this game in design, creation, execution with the problems and puzzles you get to solve. Gratifying. Nicely done!',
       'This game deserves my 5 stars!  and I\'m no doctor but this is a perfect brain teaser to help your mind grow. It\'s addictive and for me no matter how hard a level got I NEVER wanted to delete this wonderful app. I now mastered all the levels and now it\'s time for me to delete it.',
       'Me and my two kids loved this game! It took us about a week to beat it but we were so proud of ourselves when we did. The help button was very useful for us in a couple levels that we just couldn\'t figure out. Fun game that really makes your brain work. Can\'t wait for new rooms!!' ],

     [ 'Game flows nicely. Doesn\'t bog down my phone like some others. I love that the screens actually load. Lol. Nice layout. Tons of boards. Ads are not overwhelming and don\'t interrupt gameplay. Edit: changed phones, and while it kept my achievements, it did not save any of my completed games! Plus i feel like it\'s a little too easy to 3 star every board. I still really like it though.',
       'It\'s the best I found. Not many ads, none flashing. Has the most puzzle choices I found. Easy to see, and can enlarge tile size. Pick any tile choice. Easy to use. Ending game closed fast. Automatic goes to next game. Keep tracks of games played. Play with friends worked good. Only thing I noticed, It scuffles tiles around when no more moves possible. Scuffles 6 out of 10 games, leaving 4 games not scuttled. And didn\'t mess with my cell. Very happy with game app. Have fun!  Martha 😊',
       'It\'s simple learn controls on, you can change the tiles to different styles for easier time or a challenge (try the flags!).  5 modes of difficulty (they added Hard 1, 2 and 3 instead of one Hard recently).  I have it on a WIFI only tablet, only way to avoid ads is airplane mode. I\'d be willing to pay a dollar for my phone version to be ad-free forever.  Ads have gotten a little aggressive lately on a lot of Play Store games.',
       'I love this game. It\'s my go to when I need to do something. My only issue is when playing multiplayer. When the "you lose" comes up, you could be mid-play and end up hitting menu, thus ending the game you\'re playing. Which, is highly annoying, especially if it\'s a good opponent and you basically go back and forth winning. The likelihood of getting that player again really isn\'t that great.',
       'I use to play this on my computer. I love this game. It keeps my ADHD relaxed and keeps my mind busy from what\'s bothering me in my life. This game is great when you need to get away from what is stressing you out. It helps me with stress and anger. Thanks for making this for mobile phones',
       'Game is great! Highly appreciate that commercials are kept out of view and does not need permissions. Just a few things that could make this game greater; could have "move back " option -/ the tile selection could be more vibrant/ next move help option could ad to it. /  If additionally I could tilt the view a little or rotate the board - for sure, this game should be a five star rated.' ],

     [ 'I like it a lot but I hate how the drawings are so linked with pokemon go. I hate pokemon go!!!!! The graphics are okay but I wish they were a bit better quality. It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn\'t like how easy the drawings were and I don\'t think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn\'t recommend this game if you don\'t like colouring. It\'s ok!!!!',
       'I love this app! It\'s sooo good. And its brilliant for when your bored. But its a little hard sometimes to go over the lines with our fingers as the lines are so thin. But overall I think it\'s a fantastic app!',
       'I think there should be more cartoons to draw and color. And it should not always be right colors to trace it in. Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn\'t color the whole background, because what if you didn\'t want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!',
       'It\'s a great app however it keeps crashing and I have to start the drawing all over again. The whole app stops and my drawing starts over and it\'s really annoying. If this gets fixed I will definitely rate 5 stars',
       'I love this game but i don\'t like the characters tho .but it\'s fine . I like the way you can colour it in and then do the glow pen around it and at the end it looks amazing . You just colour and then press the pencil button ontop of the rubber in the pictures right bottom corner and then do the glow pen thing . Some people may don\'t know so that\'s why they don\'t like it . It\'s good when your travelling or when your bored . O THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!I like it',
       '(My comment is long so Tap! it) It\'s cool but I give it 3 stars because YOU need to add some Pokemon as Pikachu is my favorite but I\'m NOT CALLED "ABC marble", I\'m called "abcmarble" OR "SpiralWalk". I\'m gonna wait for you to add them. Best regards, abcmarble' ],

     [ 'Rating it 4 stars because of the spin the wheel system which is obviously rigged. I can do the math, the probability of always getting coins and hearts while spinning the wheel for hearts or 10 tickets is 1. I even went as far as reaching the 90 tickets point just to test if I was going to get anything good. Of course, I was right. Coins, some more coins, 50 hearts. I can buy a bunch of coins for that amount of tickets, why would I spin the wheel? Maybe this feature is made for people with gambling tendencies and high tolerance of losing every single time you spin it. I like the game very much tho :D I\'ll keep playing it.',
       'Won\'t lie before I make the review I do wanna let you guys know I dropped like 15 dollars on the game. With that being said I was a huge fan of roller coaster tycoon as a kid so I wanted the best experience possible. Sound and music is great, graphics are fun especially when you start having a bunch of rides and stands going off at the same time. Can\'t go wrong, give it a shot!',
       'Amazing game. Great speed and graphics. The only time I ever had an issue was with my phone being slow and it froze the game when I bought a ride and I lost the coins spent on it when reopened. I contacted atari and they reimbursed me double and had amazing customer service and care for the problem when it wasn\'t even entirely the games fault. I really am pleased with this game. And it is amazing even for a free game. Lots of fun 👍👍',
       'First the game needs permission to store files on external storage. Then once the message comes up to give permission it says grant permission to access files, photos, and media on device. So which is it my device or my external storage? Either way you are not getting access yo my files so you can modify  and delete them. NOPE..GOODBYE UNINSTALLED!!',
       'I loved this app, really addictive. I got to about level 48 but I\'ve just logged in to do the valentines event and im back at level 21!!!!! What the hell!!! This is a gamebreaking bug that needs fixing asap ive lost hours worth of my time here and until its fixed its one star.',
       'Love this game. I play it everyday. I would love if there was a Cost Menu where you can adjust the price for everything, rather than clicking on each individual building cause that takes forever when you have 100% buildings. Would also be great if the decoration percentage categories was Family, Thrill, Coaster, etc. rather than just ride. Sometimes it crashes while starting or freezes while I\'m playing, but closing the app and restarting normally fixes it.' ],

Second of all, GRAPHICS OPTIMIZATION. It can get pretty lagged up on some of my favorite levels. And it\'s the same for other people. And last of all, a VR feature.

     [ 'Good game, please add more customizations, make a custom skin is hard, please make it easier to fill in and please buff sniper rifle, please have a invisible armor button, have hats and that you can create multiple maps. Also, I hate that everybody has auto sight and auto fire on, so that people cant enjoy that much fun because you basically just would get killed instantly just because of people who let the game play for them.',
       'This game is a good game. I gave this game a 5 star rating cuz its sup awesome and also me and my brother play it at school if this had a 10 star rating you know i would give it a 10 star rating and also can you add a minigun and also i hope this game never dies and i hope to remember it when i grow up',

     [ 'I\'ve been a fan of this game for many years on the iPad, but it\'s still rather buggy on Android. Contrary to device settings, the puzzle will rotate even if device orientation is locked, making it difficult to play laying down. Rotation also resizes the viewport and controls, and lowers zoom capability when shifting from portrait to landscape and back to portrait.',

     [ 'Cross platform across Apple and Android and PC makes this game a fluid joy to play, without the feeling of a toned down mobile port - due to its 1:1 experience from the PC. It\'s the only Blizzard game u can play on Mobile. I\'m a legend (highest skill tier) ranked and totally F2P so the people who say this game is pay to win or random luck do not understand the game. Paying for is meant for helping you finish your collection fast. Overall highly recommended.',
       'I used to play the old tcg and this not  close to be a good card game. All it is is monster with power, moslty no spell, no artifact, no nothing. This game is boring and is lagging so much on the cellphone. Shadowverse is ways better for a similar formula, has a really good storyline and a waaaaay more generous. When you buy card for HS you get mostly nothing. They had the chance to do something good, everyone love the lore of warcraft, but they BS it.',
       'Lots of fun over and over again. It doesn\'t get boring because of all the expansion updates that keep coming up. You need to readjust your decks to adapt with the new cards that get released. Didn\'t give it a full 5 because of the lag and graphic issues that keep coming up for me and others of the forums.               Playing on a Note 5',
       'I\'m trying to link my account to my other one by using my blizzard account that I already have. But it just makes me do the tutorial and after I completed it, it just keeps on doing the starter stuff. Even though I already have a blizzard account with my hearthstone rank 20, but it just restarts me back to ,25. I\'m not sure its a glitche or I\'m doing something wrong but It just wont let me log in my account.',
       'What the hell? I played this game about 2-3 years ago and i really liked it (on that time). But now when i came back I just can\'t win anyone. I tried to win on rank 25 about 10 times. There always players with full deck of legendary/epic cards, 25 RANK, DAMN!',
       'The game overall is great... but this week\'s Tavern Brawl sucks.  The Shaman is extremely under powered comparatively to the other classes!  . Out of 15 games I played as a Shaman in this weeks Tavern Brawl (trying to complete quests) I have only won 1 game. And most of the games I have lost in 3 or 4 turns!! It is ridiculous how over powered the other classes are!  WORST TAVERN BRAWL EVER!!!' ],

So I tried it on my phone and it still said I missed a day so I had to restart from the first day in the current collection item. I\'m very frustrated and upset by this. So this whole \'signing on from a different device\' thing is glitchy af and my game got messed up because of it. Very upsetting. Otherwise it would be a 5star.',

       'Love testing my knowledge but I recommend a change. Upon entering the last letter you should have the option to view before the answer is submitted. My big fingers cause me to select the incorrect letter occasionally and then I get the wrong answer and my streak is reset. Please correct this.',
       'Several times now I\'ve tried to type in a logo name and the app has told me I got it wrong but I thought it was right and couldn\'t see why I was being told I was wrong. So I hit "solve" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I\'ve recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you\'ve ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?',

       'It\'s too easy to amass a huge number of hints and use them. I\'d like not to be able to complete every level without doing some online searches.',
       'This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further.' ],

     [ 'I like the game but there are a few mistakes in the game . For starters the footsteps don\'t always sound as it should , sometimes I find myself listen to footstep irrelevant to the characters walk. Secondly the combo moves for some characters are a bit broken. For example Berserk, it is very hard to distinguish his  (hit , hit , dash) combo , and when you do,it has a tendency of repeating the dash if you spam the dash button. You can also do this combo in the air if you jump before you dash . Besides those mistakes the game is pretty fun.  P.S. It would be nice if we can crouch in the game so it can make it easier to dodge bullets.',
       'Such a great concept! If you download it now, all features work and controls are nice. The recent update has changed my mind about it\'s improvements; I feel this makes it a better game in that it might not be perfect, but competitive play coming soon and a new leaderboard makes it worth it. Try it out!',
       'Actually i like this game but this game still need improvement. I found that City Hunter\'s dash skill is vurnerable while Swordman\'s dash is  not vurnetable... i mean City Hunter skills is easily damaged by rhino and  dual blade-leg enemy. His tornado is useless against them',
       'Ripped off league of legends and their project symbols, their champ alikeness, and even the name overdrive from the release of 3 of their project skins. Like come on show some originality don\'t rip off someone else',
       'Make the money auto follow you. I hate losing money to spikes. Thanks great game tho',
       'It is a good game but there are too many bugs, if you try a character then play a level at the end of the level it will act like it is in the try player mode and ask if I want to buy the character but I already bought it.' ],

     [ 'After using it for more 2 weeks here is my review;  This is a great time killer and addictive too. Nice collections of tools, items, etc. But when we tried to play using wifi this lagged like anything. Dead slow and we had no fun of playing and competing. The developer may look into this or give us any guidance for smooth 1vs1 play via wifi.',
       'I just started playing this game and I don\'t think it\'s live matches. The opponents have ai style movements. I\'d like to play against other players in the matches. I\'ve been crushing the ai and want to try real people. But all in all it is very fun. Best badminton game I\'ve played yet. And most realistic too. I\'ve played badminton for about 15 years so it\'s nice to finally find a good badminton game.',
       'Hi,  It\'s been almost one month i am using this game. But there are many problems in this game: 1. game is slow in a multi player mode. 2. Most of the time if you play one on one using wifi or personal hotspot. The game will connect you with yourself only. 3. Most of the time you\'re unable to connect with with your friends only. In a month i connected with my friend thrice only.  I have a screenshot also where you can see that the game is sending a join request to myself only not my friend.',
       'decent minimalist animation, so game is smooth since u are against ai/bot. pretty much wont lose, when u have unlock all item and stats. need an update for tournament against real player. and additional moves or trick to create a bit complexity and thrill to the game. if u like something easy and relaxing this is the game.',
       'The game is very addictive and congrats to the creater of the game  I loved it too much than any other games.................. This is the he only game I had played for a little long time........... But the prices for the equipments is too big.......... They have to reduce this....... Those who read review this about the game just download it immediately You will be addict to it..........',
       'Amazing badminton game! The game mechanics are perfectly balanced, easy to learn and harder to master. Skill becomes a huge factor when playing against unbalanced opponents. No single play works against everyone challenging you to constantly change up your play style. Just love this game!' ],

       'Would be better if it played in the background if I come out of it as lots of balls take a long time to bounce. Had a couple of incidents. Got to 365 then ball bounced so slow after 10 mins it stopped bouncing and i was left with only the block it was sat on left on the screen so would have been a check point :-( so I had no choice bit to restart and now it\'s bouncing along the bottom line of the screen at 285 so going to have to restart again. Gutted. Maybe a nudge function for if this happens would be handy. Love the game tho :-)',
       'I\'m 40 y/o man and this is my fidget spinner. Helps me zone out.  Challenging. Good for spacial reasoning and sharpening geometry skills.   Yes, it has ads. It\'s free though. You see, that\'s how business works. You provide content to the people and exchange there is an expectation of making money. Simple really. People always complain about ads but the thing is, there is no such thing as "free".  Most of the ads can be backed out of before the timer runs out.   Enjoy the game for what it is and stop complaining.',

     [ 'I love this game, it\'s simple and sweet. However, there was a middle row in the item-picking menu in which I had invested many coins into to help me level up faster. Today, when I logged in, the row simply disappeared without a trace. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the backgrounding of my app, but nothing seemed to fix it. Now I only have the Training row and the Fun stuff row. It took me quite a while to get those coins and I\'d really appreciate it if you brought the row back or gave me a solution to get it back. If it helps, you should also know that the \'I\' on every icon which used to let you see how an item was used has also vanished. Please fix this, thank you.',
       'I wish I could give this game 10 stars. It\'s amazing all around.  It\'s adorable and fun. The graphics are amazing too without any glitches so far. Haven\'t noticed any bugs either. The developer\'s done amazing. It does get repetitive after a while but so far by the time it happens something new unlocks so it\'s still fun. Can\'t wait to see what else you guys do to improve the game play since everything else has been flawless so far. Great job, keep up the great work!',
       'This game is super cute! I love my lil ninja friend! Lol. Nice story, and plenty to do to keep you busy. Will def take time to master, but it def has the potential to keep you interested in playing. Even got my wife playing it, and she usually only keeps games for a day or 2, cuz she gets bored with them. I think she\'ll play this one a little longer than most of the other games she\'s tried. I\'m really happy i found this game!!',
       'This one is probably my favourite, with minecraft and clash of clans. If you don\'t have this Virtual Friend game, then it is you who is missing out. Install and enjoy. There\'s nothing bad about this game, and if Naturalmotion do want me to suggest an add-on, then maybe enable me to link the game with a new device. I was LVL 52 once but I lost it. Now I\'m level 17. Hope you liked the suggestion. :)',
       'I really love this game, but if you don\'t put an update on Clumsy Ninja I\'m going to uninstall this awesome game. In the next update will you please fix the part when you touch the story book then it tells you the pictures are still locked? If you put this in the new update anytime, I will start to love this game like I did before. One more thing.... If this helps.... I really really really love this app!!!',
       'You should add a dog and a cat wearing ninja suit they can be like the chicken and the squirrel the dog can run around you and bark and find bones and sell them for coins and the cat can find fish and sell it for coins. It just sounds like a good idea  the dog should be a husky or a smaller dog like a beagle so it is small like the other animals and it can sleep with the ninja the cat can just be a cat please look into this *^* looking forward to this' ],

     [ 'It is fun and challenging. Had it on my last phone and it often glitched during races which basically ruins that race. Downloaded it on my new phone which is much more powerful, thinking it would be fine, but it glitches in the same way and with the same frequency. It would be really nice if they could "ditch the glitch" so to speak. Thanks',
       'So hard to beat the game. I\'m not gonna say anything except it is PAY TO WIN. No rewards, you have to spend real money to beat your NOVICE rival, yup you read it right, novice. So freaking hard to beat the actual scripted AI. And you can\'t buy anything in shop without real money.',
       'Love the game, play everyday esp the jam tracks. Controls are very inconsistent. Seems like you are limited to how fast you can go. When  it appears you about to better your time you lose control of your bike..sick of the glitches and feels like i have to pay to win',
       'I raced 500\'s out in some of the real known Desert race\'s until I went off the freeway trying to come home from the Mojave 250 and was in the hospital for a year. Fell asleep behind the wheel, I should of died but I  made it. . . . . .',
       'Good butt the other bilwr seems 2 always have a slightly better bike so very hard fin though plus plz let me buy the last bike now along with the rest thx',
       'This game is one of those that get you coming back. The learning curve is steep, yet not so steep for it to be frustrating. As you become beter you can actually feel yourself doing beter and going faster. This game is the perfect mix between difficult and entertaining. The only reason for the 4/5 is because of the grinding required to get beter bikes at a later stage. Yet it feels more like working towards something rather than grinding endlessly, thanks to the mini rewards along the way. All in all a very fun game' ],

     [ 'Fantastic game! It\'s by Gameloft so it\'s bound to be a good phone game. It\'s not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn\'t hold your hand but it\'s not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you\'re also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it\'s definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I\'m stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)',
       'It\'s a best game on playstore!!! I play it lot of.. and it\'s my favourite game.. but one problem is that when i start multiplayer match it says sercer not found or server overloaded. But it doesent matter for much. I give all 5 star for best graphics, bedt controls, and also bestest weapons. I love this game. Thank you gameloft. We expect that you will keep developing games like modern combat. I am waiting anxiously for next series. Thank you.',
       'I had previously given this game a 1 star but for this update I\'m blown away by the network rectification aspect. The game runs butter smooth even after post FUP data speeds. The game is currently saturated with lvl 140 players with all the prestige weapons, so I\'d request you to bring about a balanced match making in the PvP based on their matching levels and introduce some welcome benefits for the returning players',
       'This probably the best FPS game in the Play Store. Graphics, animations, music, voice actings everything in this game are awesome. 😊  The game runs in my phone in full 60 fps on Ultra-high settings. But sometimes it crashes without any reason and when I run the game again, it starts to verify game data. My phone is not rooted and I do believe the problem is not in my phone, it\'s a bug in the game. 😕  Overall, it\'s a great game. ☺️  Peace out. 🤘',
       'This game is awesome.  But plzzzz ban clone paragon  first plzz plzz plzz.  Every match i see 2 or three paragon...  And mc5 is best game so far... One more thing this game turn into pay to win i think so plzzz reduce  the pay to win system and in match give 40 to 50 credit 10 credit is very lowest credit  to unlock items.... So plzzzz ban paragon first and give extra free credit  resources to earn in multilayer match....',
       'This game use to be my life. I loved it. Until u ROBBED ME i had all the guns all amour, suits, badges and money. I was a very very old player and you just take my stuff.....that is not right. You need to fix something with my account!Will there be a Morden Combat 6?' ],

     [ 'This game is really fun and interesting. But i have a question. Under your character which says tap on me, there were 3 choices in it, although i\'m not sure if those are actually choices. As i try to tap on them, nothing happens. Is that really normal? Or am i suppose to do something? Especially since one of the options there was "meet the lost soul." Please help me out',
       'The game is AMAZING !! I got all three endings already and it was super fun. I just really hope there will be an offline version so I can play it without WiFi, it\'s a good time waster. Also, maybe you can put a feature where if you press the person you are in that life, you can see the stuff they have like the superhero, smart feature, timeshare, etc. , so that it\'s easier to know what our person has. Also, maybe put a description for it? Just a suggestion! Play Nirvana guys it\'s great!!',
       'I really fan of Reings the best strategy and puzzle. This game little bit confused and don\'t understand how up or lower.  Can you make update something little more easily like sign ↑ and ↓ please this game so very interested.   P.s great job',
       'Hi dev, i sometimes don\'t understand whats the icon under character\'s name means. Can you please put what it means in help sections? or maybe you could make a list about that in game that you could unlock.  That\'s just a suggestion though. I love your game, keep up the good work 👍',
       'It\'s a great and fun game. I\'ve seen some reviews that want it to have more customization or to be more like another game, but i think the randomness is what makes it so interesting. (I would mind some vague hints for the challenges though, I can\'t even begin to figure out how to become a parent)',
       'Alright, so in a response to someone else\'s review, you said that talking to Death could give a hint as to how to get the third ending; the advice that comes when you ask how to escape is pretty much useless, so I assume the advice that\'s supposed to help me beat this cursed game is the "if He eats too many years he explodes" part. However, I\'ve gotten over 800 years in, and the Creator hasn\'t exploded. At this point I don\'t even care about getting the third ending, I just want that bastard to explode.' ],

     [ 'Great game. Need to be able to get free tokens more often and wins need to be more often. I see the bigger the bet, the less times you win, but must bet max to level up quickly. Yep, you loose your tokens way to often. Improve and I will edit my review. :-) update....deleting game. Find some other idiot who will pay to play it. Seriously, impossible to really enjoy without buying chips. Good luck!you will lose. BIG TIME',
       'Since the update. Sometimes I still have to uninstall and reinstall to play. But if you are someone Like me that has been playing for a long time and really loved playing this game.... you don\'t get very many payouts or bonuses without trying to manipulate the game to get something. It still has lots of other issues as well. I think if you want people to continue playing, these things must be fixed! SOON! PLEASE!',
       'Could use a little more incentive to continue attempting this. Been at it almost 2 weeks and all I have to show for it is 250,000 pts. Very hard to get started here. Glad this isn\'t the only site I play.  Hey konomi , gotta show me better than this or I go viral against your game.         Too many real game co.\'s out there than to waste time.  Thanx.   Really want to see "WHERE"  and "HOW " my rating gets posted. Yes I will watch.       Thanx.  Tony S.',
       'Konami can be fun but collecting points kills the game.  For days the once a day wheel spin gives the same lowest number.  Even after playing over 100 spins you still don\'t get free spins.  At times free spins gives no points.  Fame is too tight.  Graphics are nice.',
       'Would enjoy more if you could actually win chips more frequently. My average win was less than what it cost to spin. Within just a few plays throughout the day I was already out of chips. There should be a better way to regenerate chips more often especially when they\'re so hard to win while playing. I shouldn\'t have to spend $50-$100 dollars on a cell phone game to be able to play for awhile and enjoy it. As much as I could like this game in it\'s current state it takes the fun and enjoyment out of the game. This game is clearly a cash grab.',
       'I came back to see if the game changed never won on one spin! 19 feb 2018, still is bad. Best games at the price of constant loosing, If you like to win once a month and lose everyday this is the game for you. Could be a great game, I would buy the tokens if I felt I had a chance at winning. I played solstice for two weeks and barley won my bet amount back. Sure once a month you could hit a big win and loose those chips because the next win like that is a month away. GOOD LUCK! Enjoy depression!' ],

     [ 'This is a very well thought out game and I love the positive comments when I finally figure out the  way I need to go first so that the next shot is easier to get. Some of these shots are really difficult, if you don\'t get the right basket first. Anyway, I love the challenge. Y\'all got my vote. BEST GAME EVER. Thanks man. I love your guys\' creativity.',
       'This game is fun, but it seems like there are tons of attempts to get you to buy stuff. Plus you can\'t get Panda as a character. But other than that this game is awesome. I don\'t know why on the Dude Perfect channel they advertise it as just for iPhone, but at the very end say it is also available for Android. I recommend this game. It is very fun',
       'This game was good  but could be better. I wish there was something other than just basketball. Like tennis, football, or something like that. Graphics were good. This game is addicting but it\'s hard to get past level 20 if you don\'t have Facebook. So I\'m stuck on trying to get enough stars to get through. Good but could be better',
       'Sometimes this game can frustrating but you just have to get good at it. I personally love this game and I recommend this game to every one who likes a fun game.A special thanks to dude perfect for the great game and I love your show to,I hope you guys continue it and I\'ll keep watching it.            THANK DUDES.                FROM REILLY.',
       'I love this game and it is awesome. Here\'s some tips characters are expensive and you should have a story mode otherwise it is awesome. Miniclip keep working. I love your your other games like 8 ball pool and basketball stars. Just keep Freakin doin great. You need some work but otherwise great.',
       'Firstly to John J - I have never paid a cent to play this game and that is why I love this game!! I have been able to complete the whole game 210 levels without paying a dime! That\'s truly awesome! It has been challenging because in order to advance I needed to get 3 stars on all levels to open up the next level for free. Then of course you have the energy bar that runs out, but that\'s ok because it replenishes in reasonable time. I would run out and instead of paying money I would go check an email, or post on Facebook and before too long I\'m back playing a few more shots on dude perfect 2!! So easy, so cheap, so challenging and so much fun and so friggin awesome when you completed level in 3 stars!! I can\'t wait till the next section opens to see what they have in store for us. Thanks.' ],

     [ 'I\'ve never played this game and don\'t really know how but have made it this far and I like it. So update, I\'m addicted to this game. Still a great game, the more I play, the more I enjoy it... Update, they did upgrades to the graphics, thank you. The tiles no longer block my view when paired. The Chinese New Year is a great addition. I think the upgrades made so much of a difference and I\'m impressed by the fact they read what I wrote and like wow, incredible graphics upgrades. Just a big thank you to the designers!!!',
       'Really like the graphics but the times r not long enough to earn anything. Most need to b 30 seconds longer. I know they r so short so people HAVE TO buy in but damn man! EDIT: Seems things are getting better! Thank you for making the game funner to play!',
       'I really like the game except the tiles are way to small and just like now I kept pushing the open tiles and it wouldn\'t work otherwise great game. Since my last date this game has improved beyond anything I thought about. Tiles and graphics, EVERYTHING is awesome now, and what makes it so good to is you guys give enough boosts you don\'t have to spend money on the game to enjoy the game! Thanks for another great game!!! Ok still love it only thing is you should make it not so hard to get 3 🌟 lol',
       'The time limit adds a fun aspect but it would be nice to have a relaxed mode where you aren\'t timed. It also seems a little silly that you don\'t actually have to clear the board all the way to earn 3 stars, but it\'s still really fun.',
       'The app glitches when trying to open sometimes and I\'m not able to play for a day or so.  I cannot transfer the game to my sd card because it will not open at all. Extremely enjoyable and addictive game.  It also helps to keep the mind sharp.  Hours of fun!!',
       'I really love your game. The tiles from Indonesia are diabolical. Also I can\'t figure out how to get  my rewards from the Christmas game and now the Chinese New Year game' ],

     [ 'This is one of the best flip games I have played in a long time. Love the way they have implemented the physics in the game. It is like flipping the real thing. Every knife has it\'s own style of flipping. The collection is also amazing. Best part you don\'t need to buy gold for knifes. You can earn it. Some of the blades are paid but won\'t mind buying them as it is worth. Amazing job people 👍',
       'Hi! The game is amazing. Simple, yet very addictive. The color scheme is amazing, and the sounds are great. But I do have one little complaint ; Sometimes the "Card" knife doesn\'t stick into the log when it lands on the tip, although it should clearly stick and count as a point. Have a wonderful rest of your day :)',
       'This is a great time-passer (if you finally have some spare time) , good graphics, and mostly good physics.    However, I recently discovered that players are punished via a lock timer for marathoning advertisements to unlock knives... Why?',
       'REALLY FUN AND INTERESTING. i like how there is a very large variety of knives available to get. A few problems : i am not willing 2 pay money for a knife in a game, it glitches and lets me watch infinite vids 4 infinite money, some of the knives are really stupid',
       'A fun and addictive game but there are some issues with the game\'s economy. It\'s all about collecting the different knives but to do that you need a large amount of money which is earned the fastest with the expensive knives (Or just watching ads). The knife you may enjoy the most may only be 1 coin per flip so you feel forced to use another one worth 2 or 3 that you don\'t enjoy as much. I would like to see a system implemented that lets you upgrade a knife to be worth more so you have an incentive to try and use new knives that aren\'t initially worth 3 coins per flip but can be upgraded to be worth 3.',
       'So simple yet so fun!! You can watch ads to earn knives which I love since I\'m not a paying player. Alot of apps limit non payers but not this one. Definitely download it if you\'re thinking about it. Super addicting!' ],

     [ 'This is a wonderful, well made, fun game!  Also highly addictive.    Really enjoy it a lot.      With that said, the biggest downside, IMO, is that rewards are few, & far between, and there is no way to get gold bars without paying for them.  These become rather needed the further you get and for certain individual, and more difficult, "puzzles".  It can become too expensive to play (if one really want to get somewhere in this game).',
       'Fun and addictive game.  I really like it.  The aim and control of the wand can be improved as it often misfires and the bubble is not where it was aimed for.  Great adventures and quests. I know longer get the daily award for some reason.  And you have to wait a long time for a new life (30 mins).',
       'Addictive but too rigged. The rules are inconsistent which spoils it a bit. Eg.  Sometimes the fairies burst one bubble of the same colour and sometimes all. There are other inconsistencies. The other irritation is noisy push notifications can\'t be turned off.',
       'Love this game. Would like some competition at some point. Also, I wish there were more challenges like the Halloween treats one. It was really fun. Not too sure about the latest updates though, the owls are almost camouflaged now. But great game!',
       'This game is fun , but I don\'t like the fact that you have to pay for things take for example I have a full piggy bank but I am certainly not going to pay to retrieve them. Also the game cheats as many a time I should have completed a level but my shot went in a totally different direction . A free to play game should be just that and all coins ,gold bars etc should be able to be retrieved to help you on your journey through the game.

It is easy too difficult to distinguish when there is or is not a ledge to bounce off of. And it really kills the game when i expect a bounce, and get open cliff...',
       'It is truly an amazing application. When I first saw it I thought it was just a game like the others but then I realized that it has a level editor which has been my dream since I played for the first time mini golf. Without a second thought I bought the additional level objects and it was 100% worth it!',
       'Amazing game I have played it a lot recently. Only problem is when trying to exit the game mid level by swiping from the top or bottom, you hit the ball as well so you lose a life unnecessarily. Also it would be nice to have randomly generated levels Edit: After the most recent update I can\'t play the game because I get an error message when I start the game',

       'It\'s a good game but I wish there was a way to disable the line being drawn showing your last shot.. It\'s helpful up until level 100 but after that it\'s annoying and gets in the way! After level 200 it\'s just a totally pointless "bonus".',
       'You only get one shot which ruins the point of mini golf. It is really hard to make levels. On the single player mode it is really easy for the first few levels then it gets really hard and you loose all your lives on the same level. I can\'t find other people\'s levels. This game is a waist of time it makes you more bored and is frustrating. I had to get rid of another game to get it I got the other game back instantly.' ],

Tapjoy offers have been completed, but never awarded. All the weapons gets worser as you level up. Nekki wants you to BUY the good weapons. Bad game. Shadow fight 3 is worser than this one.',

       'This game is fun to play and good to pass time. It has a lot of new things try and there\'s always a new challenge along the way. The major things that I absolutely hate about the game is that I have to play the same things just to level up because I play through the arenas and storyline to fast, and it takes me weeks just to level up in the game, just to start that process all over again once I\'ve completed what I could do so far. But as I said, the game overall is really fun to play and is a recommendation if you like 1v1 brutal combat. Sort of like MK',
       'Let me just say I don\'t mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high',
       'Its a good game but consuming a lot of time because every next opponent is OP and i have to  buy  every new weapons after defeating  one opponent or craft it without which i will be crush down with 2,3 critical hits  and the coins are hard to find plus the energy should be unlimited. So that the game will be more fun',

       'This game is AWFUL!! There is no tutorial and every time I fail an unimportant ad comes up. What is wrong with you making games like this? Close this game down it is terrible. Just learn. Who would want to play a game like this you stupid idiot',
       'tbh it\'s a really good app! The only problem is that it gets a little boaring after a while (obviously that\'s my opinion) And I don\'t know if it\'s just me but there or tons of over 30 second ads.',
       'I like this game  very much cause you dont know what comes in front of you which makes this game more interesting. But 1 problem is there that the second i crash to any obstacle an add popups',
       'This game is the WORST!!! The controls don\'t work and there is not even demonstration on how to play. Also every time I retried to do it a stupid add came up. I AM FURIUS!!!! Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don\'t get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don\'t mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!',
       'It\'s honestly a fun game, and I\'d love to use it as a stimulating activity (ah, who am I kidding, it\'s just a great time killer), but it makes my head hurt-- and that\'s a problem. I\'m not even the type of person that is negatively affected by fast-paced graphics or rapidly changing colors. It\'d be five stars if it didn\'t give me headaches, but, for now, it gets three; good graphics, smooth gameplay, but no matter how great the app, it isn\'t worth physical discomfort. (Note: if you are looking for something similar, try "Run". It has the same sort of concept, but without the advertisements and headaches.)' ],

     [ 'My only issue with this game is that u almost have to end up purchasing tix to continue to play. The further u move on in the game, the more tix each card costs & ur only given a certain amount thru a daily reward. App should provide ways to earn more tix, either thru a daily spin or higher rewards. *(since app developer replied to this review, I changed my review to 4 stars)',
       'Just played my first 4-5 rounds and this ROCKS! Not too fast. I love it! Fair Payouts but 1st, 2nd, etc same as others. Graphics work!  All Around impression... Awesome-ness. Update: I\'ve been here atleast  5mos... long enough to know this still ROCKS!',
       'I really like this Bingo  game.  A few upgrades and it will  be better than all the other Bingo games.  I love the amount of tickets it gives you to play.  I love the extra stuff you can earn and not have to pay for.  A couple of things that would  make this game better would be all 4 cards on one screen in tablet mode, the power ups being applied automatically  and being able to daub that last number that\'s  called cause usually that\'s the one needed for Bingo.  Otherwise its great.  I hope  you find this useful.  I understand  if you can\'t  fix all three of these but the first 2 are more important  than the last and i understand  there can only be a certain amount of bingos i guess.  Thank you.  Real close to being a 5 but those 3 issues really hold me back as I\'m  sure it does others as well.',
       'I like this game VERY much. But my tickets keep disappearing! I just earned 200 tickets for feeding the dog. My tickets got added on. Then i clicked on Candy Crush. Then i clicked on 4 cards. And it said i didn\'t have enough tickets! It cost 240 in Candy Crush. I had almost 300 tick. When i looked at the top, i only had 131. What happened to all my tickets that quick?!?!? I\'m about to uninstall now. Its not the FIRST time this happened. But it will be the last! #GoodbyeBingo',
       'This used to be my favorite bingo game and then they updated it about a month ago (give or take a few days). Before the update, I was able to level up daily or every other but, now, it takes me a GOOD week or more to level up. That was my ONLY way to gain more tickets to continue playing without purchasing. I barely have enough to play 2 (4 cards each) rounds each day! REALLY stinks! Guess I will be uninstalling and going back to playing Bingo Blitz!',

     [ 'I loved playing many of the slots. One of my favorite games was Big Red. Today the app wouldn\'t open so I uninstalled and reinstalled it. After that, although it wins enough to play a bit of time, having used $700,000 at $8100 a spin and over 600 spins I still haven\'t got the free game. Before reinstalling the app I would get the free games every 50 to 100 spins. Although it didn\'t pay out much in the free games, it was fun to pick until you matched 3 of the same. I won\'t be playing this again. You have taken all the fun out of it.',
       'I play other casino games such as double down casino and slotomania, this is my favorite one but it gets played way less often. I just wish there was a little more to make this game fun. I do not like the fact that the Bonus Wheel payouts are extremely low and the odds are even worse. I believe this game would occupy a bit more of my time if the payouts on the Bonus Wheel were a little more, or the minimum bet at all machines should be lowered. Please consider. Thank you.',
       'Do not spend your money on this game, I\'ve spent hundreds. Today I purchased a coin package and didn\'t receive my coins, emailed them and no response. This game is a scam, I\'ve read people comments on fb about buying coins and not receiving them, but I didn\'t take their advice. If you are reading this plz don\'t buy coins, they take your money and you don\'t get what you paid for. I\'m deleting the app, you\'ve lost a good customer.',
       'I LOVE the Platinum quick hit bc it makes me feel like I\'m in a real Casino. I can\'t go to the Casino often anymore since I have given up on the SCAMMING INDIAN CASINOs so it now takes 3 hrs to drive to a Real GAMING COMMISION REGULATED Casino, so this pacifies me until then. LOVE THE AUTHENTIC SOUNDS!',
       'I  love  the  games, but  it has not been  working  for over a week.  It seems like when I get a lot of points while then it goes down. Sometimes I can\'t collect my points. I don\'t know how to get help to get the game fixed. I would be rating it at five stars if it worked',
       'Pretty realistic slots. I won and LOST a billion (yes, with a B) in a day. I continue to lose about 200,000 per day, but it always offers me up to buy more. Umm, no thanks. I\'ve fallen for that a few times and nothing to show for it after about 20 spins. Pretty much like real slot machines eat up all your $$.' ],

     [ 'I really love this game but there is something bothering me so much in some reigions in the shotgun challenge hunting predators you can\'t even look at them and they jump on you and kill you...',
       'It would get a higher rating if there wasn\'t energy involved. And you pretty much have to pay real money to get weapons. I was hoping you would be able to use the money acquired in the game, but for most stuff you need "gold". Take a long time to aquire gold unless you buy it. I\'m almost done the second region and I think I\'m losing interest. I love to hunt so I was excited about this game but it definitely could be A LOT better. Hope there\'s updates to make getting weapons easier',
       'Awesome game but. It should have that animation effect which shows you the parts of guns while upgrading them. It was so cool in that previous version. In previous version Whenever we upgrade it feels like we are really purchasing the gun\'s accessories. Game is great but as a user almost all will mis this thing... If u wnt to improve ur game than this comment is worth a million for you..  so just go for the fix bro. Best wishes',
       'Awesome updates! I love this game, probably too much. The only problem is for some reason, the app crashes very frequently on my T-Mobile Galaxy S8 Plus. I\'ve cleared the cache and checked for updates to Play Services. If you could look into this further, it would be tremendously appreciated. Otherwise, excellent work, thank you kindly.',
       'I absolutely love this game. The only issue I have encountered is when I tried to play this 2018 version that says its compatible through my Chrome cast device version 2016 displayed on my tv and would not go past the play hunt screen. Please tell me if there is something I\'m not doing right.',
       'This would of got a 4 maybe even 5 stars. If I could still play it. I enjoyed myself and finished the first region on the game, closed it out and came back later and it wouldn\'t let me connect. It just said cannot connect to severs. And I haven\'t been able to get back in. Please fix this. I enjoy this game' ],

     [ 'I\'ve been playing this game for only a total of 10 minutes, but so far, it has been enjoyable. The game delivers on exactly what it presents to be. It is a crisp, clean, smooth running, first person target shooting game. It is simple in design and very easy to play. Touch your screen, drag to aim, align your sight on target, and release to fire. The sound of the rifle firing is very enjoyable, as are the "hit target" sounds, the reward/level up music, and the "successful stage" jingles. If my opinion changes after further examination, I will be certain to edit this review accordingly.',
       'First higher stakes multiplayer and it appeared that the opponent cheated. The time ran out for them to shoot but the game then froze. I was able to change guns, sent emotes, etc. and I was connected to a stable internet connection. I waited 20 minutes until finally sending the game yo the background so I could google if it was a cheat. Low behold I instantly lost all of my coins. Dont waste your time with this game, poorly made and cheaters will take all of your coins in multiplayer.',
       'Lots of fun. Simple yet difficult to master. I play everyday. I like the variety of targets. Purchasing option doesnt work. I tried to buy $4.99 of coins in the app. It took my money  but it never added the coins to my score. Google Play credited the amount back to me. Good app overall.',
       'I suppose I need a stylus for this bc using my finger makes it too hard to get the accuracy right... However, it\'s a really fun game. I\'d suggest lowering the amount of drift a little bit. Thanks mobrix for a enjoyable shooting Sim!!!',
       'Uninstalled after 10 mins. Too many pop ups for other games plus the lengthy ads that you can\'t get out of. Great game otherwise.',
       'It is about slowly balancing your gun to release and take the shot within a set time limit but not quite as easy when you actually try. This makes it a challenge to perfect hand eye coordination so that makes for a good game.' ],

    description: 'Eternium is an amazingly fun and beautifully crafted Action RPG, reminiscent of the great classics.Eternium stands out from other mobile Action RPGs by its effortless “tap to move” and innovative “swipe to cast” controls, and its player-friendly “no paywalls, never pay to win” philosophy.With the exception of a couple of online-only features, the game can also be played offline after the content download completes.Drawing signs to cast spells is easy and rewarding. The tap-to-move control is more natural and relaxing than thumbsticks, and it’s also truer to the vintage point-and-click Action RPG experience.The game can be really played for free, as more than 90% of our players do. Purchases are completely optional. Gems, the game’s main currency, can be collected from enemies and quests. There is no limiting stamina or energy. The best things in the game are obtained by playing, not paying.Eternium has been launched in 2014, and is actively being improved by the original development team. Through years of polishing, and feedback from millions of players, the quality of the game has steadily increased, making it now one of the highest rated games on all app stores.As of fall 2017, major new features are in advanced stages of development, including real-time multiplayer, town portal, and a fourth world.Enjoy the visceral satisfaction of responsive, fast-paced combat, with spectacular special effects, pleasing sounds, rewarding damage numbers, all set against immersive backdrops and atmospheric, inspiring music scores.Play as a Mage, Warrior or Bounty Hunter, wielding a sword, axe, staff or gun. Level up to learn new abilities and increase your attributes.Battle skeletons, zombies, automatons, aliens, demons, dragons and many other creatures, across three beautifully hand-crafted worlds, or in endless generated levels.Venture into dark caves and dungeons, explore forests, villages and graveyards, lay siege to demon controlled castles, brave snowy mountain peaks, travel to the moon to slay strange creatures among craters and canyons, and beyond, to the deserts, pyramids and jungles of the red planet.Open treasure chests to loot gold, gemstones and battle gear. Equip shiny breastplates, menacing helmets and hoods, spiked shoulder pads, mysterious cloaks or capes. Protect yourself with a shield, or choose to wield two weapons as a warrior.Rescue your tank, healer and ranger companions who will join you in battle. Use their abilities together with yours to create rewarding and powerful tactical combos.Experience a refreshing storyline, filled with interplanetary intrigue and seasoned with funny characters. Hunt your arch-enemy, Ragadam, across the worlds, while trying to uncover and undo his twisted plans.Progress from common to rare, epic and legendary gear. Find gemstones that fit in your armor’s sockets. Craft socketed rings and amulets, and fuse three of them into a higher quality one.Unleash awesome offensive abilities, such as Whirlwind, Shockwave, Arc Lightning or Blizzard, control the enemy crowd with Frost Nova, Vortex, Silence, or sneak and assassinate with Smokescreen, Traps and Snipe.Each hero class has access to about 20 abilities (skills or spells), and each of your three companions has four more. The game starts simple, but culminates in a flurry of tactical possibilities at high levels.Once your hero reaches level 70, your experience points go into Champion Levels, which are unlimited and yield steady stat upgrades. Champion Levels are also inherited by your new heroes, so they will have an easier time growing up.Aside from the three story acts, an endless progression of beautiful, randomly generated levels awaits in the Trials of Valor game mode.Eternium is crafted with passion by a small band of old-school RPG fans, who love making the game they always wanted to play.',

     [ 'What a great game this really is, there isn\'t many RPG\'s you\'ll find like this on the Play Store. I recall playing this 3 years ago and a lot has changed, but still a vital element is missing; multiplayer. I see within the game description that it was promised for 2017 but after downloading and playing I can\'t see any multiplayer feature. Apart from that, it\'s a really well polished game and seems to offer a lot of content and replayability and I really do hope they bring us multiplayer. I also purchased a limited time offer for £0.89 and it offered a lot that\'s for sure!   Runs well on max settings on my Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra on Android 7.0',
       'The gameplay is the best ive seen for an android RPG Diablo type game. Slick graphics, awesome sound track and effects, no slowdown and you can play offline!! Absolutely love the game. Only down side is the worry of repetitivness of the game but i guess only time will tell',
       'Incredible game. Very intuitive and unique with the swipe to cast system. The graphics are quite nice and the amount of memory the game uses is very acceptable for the quality you get. Music is very relaxing and well done. Level and NPC design are great, really feel like I\'m playing an old school medieval RPG. Absolutely 0 need to buy gems, the game gives them to you for just killing normal monsters. My only gripe would be to maybe add a fourth class? If not more in future updates. Otherwise, fantastic game, well put together, well written story, great opening scene and whoever did that voice over should be looking to do more! Thank you for making a true RPG for true RPG fans, keep it up!',
       'The game is addictive. I was hoping to play it offline all the time but you need and internet connection to upgrade skills and craft its annoying because I don\'t have wifi and I use mobile data. Still it gives me the feels of Diablo all over again.',
       'Absolutely love this game. I downloaded it 2 hours ago and havent stopped playing. I play on an S7 Edge and this game plays flawlessly.  I haven\'t been forced to watch any ads.  You can choose to watch them for bonus gems but don\'t have to. The game play is very responsive. When you touch a destination or an enemy it responds without any hitches.  I like that their are different levels of difficulty you can choose. The amount of weapons and armor you can collect or craft is endless, with rune upgrades possible. Great game guys... keep up the good work. 5* for me!',
       'I love this game. It could use some improvement, but there is nothing in the current  version that would warrant less than 5 stars... particularly for an android game. If you loved Diablo; then you will definitely want to play this. And, BTW, you really don\'t need to spend money to play or win this game. But it will help you ALOT if you spend $20. Just wait for one of the special offers that come up. Otherwise, just conserve your gems and DO click the ?-Cubes. It is worth a 30 second add to get 5 gems. And I easily collect around 100 gems per day of play clicking those. Also, DO NOT, waste gems on the large golden treasure chests. You have to pay gems, a lot of gems, to get the treasure and none of them are worth the grossly exorbitant gem fee.' ],

     [ 'This game is really fun, challenging at times & exercises and has a great variety of important brain exercises. My only qualm with this game is that everytime you level up a full screen ad gets in the way. Usually they can be closed out easily but not always. Regardless, it\'s the best free brain training app I have used and it really keeps you sharp!😀',
       'Its rlly a good game for brain training!! Idk why but i didnt find any bug, glitch, or smthing like they all saying. It works well in my device. This is the best app for training your brain. Ofc its not easy, its so challenging, in a good way. I rlly struggle in quick searching and some stages, but its just so addicting and so great!! I recommend you to download it!!!',
       'Additive and helpful. Its not an over night cure so people expecting that need help instead lol. It doesn\'t deserve a low rating. Yes theres add but it\'s to be expected with a free game. Having adult a.d.d and huge memory issues.. i can i liked this game. 100 doors is anther good one.',
       'It\'s fun. My problem is on the attention one we are suppose to click stop once the red dot is on the brain and I do. There is plenty of time to click it  but it tells me i missed it. No matter how many times I click it while the red dot is still on the brain. If I press it 10 times then the screen that tells me I\'ve failed comes up 10 times. Driving me insane.',
       'I love it!!! The games are interesting. Now I am on "memory match" game which was initially locked and it keeps on freezing and promotes me to next level without me completing the level well. Besides that, I would highly recommended it to others, it\'s worth installing.',
       'There\'s a glitch in "Quick Decision Skill" game. It is based on whether the previous and current object is same or not. When I click on the peach-moon-type object as same, it gives error, though I click on Same when two moons appear consecutively in the game. This way I\'ll not be able to clear the levels.' ],

Out of ALL the top trivia + quiz games I\'ve tried, THIS APP has THE BEST quiz questions thus far. Q\'s are well-crafted with (so far) NO REPEATS, which is awesome!  Ads do pop up here + there but u can quickly close \'em + keep going. Hey, it\'s FREE, right? So somebody\'s gotta pay the bills. Not a deal-breaker for me. Overall, app is a WINNER. Keep up the good work!',

     [ 'So far the best, mostly free, slot game yet. I think a dollar for only one scratch ticket is a bit pricey I mean come on. It\'s only a game. This day and age. More for less, brings more, than less. I\'m not paying a real $1.00 for just 1 game coins scratcher. Otherwise far as for fun. Huuuge is the casino\'s and Slot\'s you should be playing. Definitely a boredom killer.',
       'I\'ve seen some pretty bad paywalls in games, it\'s to be expected...but this game takes it to a whole new level. First 10 minutes playing you will win every other spin, enter bonus games every couple of spins, and win win win..then the paywall. The final 100 plus spins netted me about 5 wins that at least broke even and absolutely 0 bonus spins or bonus games. Definitely not going to pay real money for a game that\'s this tight. Don\'t waste your time. Lots of other slot games that are balanced',
       'Good game when it\'s not crashing. Had it crash 6 times in 15 minutes. Huge payouts during bonus spins. Sitting on 85 Billion that I can spend due to stability issues. Fix this and I will rate the game higher. Playing on Galaxy S 8+.',
       'Game crashes and loses progress when it does. Was in a bonus and had 8+billion coins and it crashed with 4 spins left and when I reloaded the game seconds later, only had the coins I had after my spin that triggered the bonus. Garbage. Don\'t buy coins in this game.',

     [ 'The game is great! Love the handling and graophics... But I would suggest making the drift angle wider. So instead of hitting 90° and then the counter says "combo broken" it could be something like 100°! Cause I mean... Reverse entries are awesome! And you should make the hoonicorn Mustang 4wd instead of rwd in the drift setup!!',
       'Love the game! But since the update I\'m unable to purchase cars/cash. Every time I open the game it says I need to connect to the internet to make purchases even though I\'m connected and can still play multiplayer etc. Any help would be great',
       'LOVE THIS GAME BUT IT NEEDS 2 MORE THINGS TO BE MY FAVORITE GAME.  Make a motorcyle update where us players can drift motorcycles. And also make more customization options where we can add body kits exhausts spoilers coilover axle extensions and more. Thank you and please look into doing what i asked so us players can enjoy this game that has a bunch of potential. Thanks',
       'One thing: (two things actually)  Please make the drift school car available to buy with at least in-game cash maybe for a limited time? And please add a feature that gives you the ability to save replays, that would be really cool.',
       'New update sucked. The game is really good but its really laggy now, like i get lag spikes every second when i play in a track. Please fix this cuz i really want to play this game. I wont blame my phone on this one because in the last update, it ran smoothly, no lag. Plus my phone is an ASUS, a gaming phone, there shouldnt be lag in games like these. Please, please, please fix it and I\'ll put the ratings back to 5 stars☺️☺️',

     [ 'Really fun.  But crashes constantly on my Galaxy S5.  Then I have to force stop the app, and restart my phone to get it working, for about 5 minutes....  All have to do to avoid ads is not restart until the respawn timer clears, so they aren\'t that bad, and it\'s really cheap to turn the ads off.  I would happily do so, it the app would run for more than 5 minutes.  If it wasn\'t for the crashing, I would rate it 4 stars at least.',
       'Love playing this game...very addictive! I would rate it 5* if there was a reason for why you level up and why you keep spinning for little lightening bolts when you do level up  as once you have bought the small amount on offer they are no longer needed. Add more things to buy and give the game a reason for levelling up 🤘🏼',
       'Smooth game. Plenty of fire ball options and endless level options but after every death you have to watch  15 second ad. EVERY DEATH. Which just spoils the experience and all. I understand ads but like after 3 deaths that\'s fine. But after every death and some are unskippable. So download of you have patience. It\'s worth it of you have time to spend',
       'A wonderful aesthetically pleasing game.  Get as far as you can, with as many points as you can while unlocking different fireballs and portals. I would love to see how this game evolves in the future and i have not seen as many ad\'s as people claim so perhaps that issue has been resolved? Working perfectly on S8+',
       'TOO MANY ADS, every time you die you get an ad and that\'s just being money hungry what ever happened to games without long ads what\'s the point if you\'re gonna make a game and 1/3 of the gameplay being ads. Perhaps every 10 or 20 games, or just have those small popup ads, but don\'t ruin the gameplay because you want money. I\'m uninstalling and I\'m sure other people are as well.',
       'Overall, the game\'s alright... except for the constant crashing and ads. Thankfully, ads only seem to happen when you press the restart button before the revival timer runs out, so that\'s a nice loophole. My only real problem is it crashing on my S5 every few minutes. Fix that and i\'ll give this a 4-star.' ],

     [ 'Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)',
       'I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn\'t have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it\'s Definitely Not a game you\'d wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!',
       'Fastest uninstall ever. 15 seconds of gameplay, then 15 seconds of timed add. Can anyone spot the fake reviews? Really developer?, ya cant wait a tad longer to stop the game and make us stare at a cat puzzle? The worst. I didnt even play it long enough to appteciate the poor controlls. Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.',
       'Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout',

     [ 'Was an awesome game Very addictive game! Was well done.. until the update. Needs more pens and new themes as I have thousands of coins but nothing left to unlock. Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don\'t register as pineapple hits for the counters. There\'s a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it',
       'Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.',
       'Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.',
       'Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.',
       'BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn\'t have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What\'s bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I\'m not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game.',
       'How can I say this? I can not stop playing this!! Everytime I set a new and higher record I want to achieve and I only stop until I get there xD atm with 6400 coins and everything unlocked 😁😁 please release new content for months and months!! It will make me so happy! Thank you for this game.' ],

If you want brain teasers to improve your IQ while you have fun, you’ve come to the right place.Chances are that you’ve heard about the ancient river crossing riddles, but do you know them all? You may have heard about the farmer who must take a wolf, a goat, and some cabbage across a river, or a version featuring a fox, a goose, and a bag of beans. Maybe you know the problem of the three missionaries and three cannibals, or the “jealous husbands” variation.Those are the classic river crossing puzzles. They are popular and well known, and they are all included in this game, along with many more new levels involving chess pieces, a farmer with cows and special levels designed only for geniuses.River crossing problems date back to at least the ninth century, may be before the chess was invented, with the earliest known examples occurring in the Latin manuscript Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes (“Problems to Sharpen the Young”). River crossing puzzles and their many variants represent ways of dressing up relatively straightforward mathematical problems. They invite attempts at a solution that range from trial and error to extensive mathematical analysis. These puzzles are frequently used in job interviews. They are also taught to children in schools along with chess to boost their IQs and improve their critical thinking, mathematical problem-solving, and strategy development.Your goal in every level is to move all of the characters across the river while observing certain rules and restrictions. Once you have completed a level, you will receive one star for level completion. You can obtain an additional star if you finish the level in the minimum number of moves, and another if you finish the level in a set time that varies from level to level.Try your best, work as quickly as you can, and keep your number of moves low to earn more stars. Your total number of stars will help you access more advanced levels.If you like playing chess and solving logic puzzles, then you are all set for new challenges.

     [ 'I recommend this app. Good for exercising logic. It has puzzles on crossing a river, with increasing difficulty. I have reached level 14. The puzzles force you to consider different options and sometimes start from scratch. Once I have figured out the solution I play it again to complete it fast enough for 2 or 3 stars. Once in a while characters do not respond to touch. Graphics are simple but the focus is on the puzzle. Overall very good.',

       'best beain adict game. but 9 grid stage doesnt fulfill. not enough grid box. the Creator cheated. i m going to lodge a complaint against you. you ve to answer my brain😀 anyway superr game excellent',
       'The game is great, but the leaderboards are seriously messed up.  The top high scores are literally orders of magnitude higher than it is physically possible to get.  I would assume that they have been "hacked" somehow to display these fake scores.  The developer should cap the high score at the number that is literally the highest possible score (based on the size of the board)',
       'I enjoy 2048 alot. I play it alot and I would consider myself pretty good, my high score is 250,000. When i was building on that high score, the screen glitched and swiped a number of times, ruining the order of the numbers. This has happened on multiple occasions only in this app. It\'s not such a big problem for people that are newer, but when you\'ve got big numbers, such as 8192, it makes the game unplayable.',
       'This game is challenging. I was so addicted I wanted to se what would happen if I got up to 4096.  Well ai did and it actually worked! I even have a screen shot. Fun!',
       'I\'ve been having issues with this app for months, where it will sometimes act as if it received multiple inputs in rapid succession. This completely ruins all the hard work I did getting my board state the way it was, and makes it impossible to recover. I\'m playing up to the 16K range, and it has these issues usually after I\'ve gotten the 4K blocks. 2/6/2018' ],

       'A really nice game which also got me hooked up! Nevertheles, it frequently and automatically shuts down, deleting what was there.....this really broke my litlle sister\'s heart, even mine. For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....',
       'Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!',

YEAH!!!!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💙💙💚💚💛💛💜💜💗💗❤❤ AND when I was playing my 1st game all things were opened but when I played in my small sister\'s tab all, things were closed! I got everything for free!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA',

It\'s less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed.',

     [ 'Really fun game. My 2 year old adores Hank. The only thing that I feel is missing is a way to save your progress to the cloud. My phone needed to be reset a couple times and we had to start over. Didn\'t mind so much because hank as a puppy is much cuter.',
       'I like this new update. Hanks now have His own happy meter like Tom and Angela. Nice. Also this is just my suggestion. Can you guys also make My Talking Ben and My Talking Ginger. Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that\'s it. You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It\'s not fair. Lastly good job guys.',
       'Great game, probably best talking animal game out for adults n kids... but sometimes u watch a video so u can spin the wheel n win gems or coins but the wheel not always comes up... ive had approx. 20x it has not happened in last 4 hrs... would like it redeemed n fixed plz...',
       'I like my talking tom and I download this one thinking that it will have some fun stuff like play mini games I know this one have a picture feature but man only eat, pet, sleep , and pics? Sorry I am re-downloading my talking Tom and start from scratch that only take pics feed and sleep on this game',
       'My three year old grand daughter got around my password and charged $40 of in app purchases and did a monthly subscription, too. I have gone through everything to try to remedy this, with no help from the customer service from the this apps developer.',
       'I\'m only on level 1 wrong so correct me if im wrong but I thought the game was a bit boring at first and the game doesn\'t seem to give you much choice andyou have to folow what it says but if you enjoy the game thats great! I also did like that u got stickers for taking pics. I did end up having to uninstall the game as it took up to much storage space D: Overall I did really enjoy the game yay =D' ],

     [ 'I like the game, but solitude is pretty much the same no matter where you get it. It\'s the little things that make it different. The card backs and faces are cool, I just wish that shuffling through the cards and reshuffling was a little faster. Overall, I love solitaire and play it A LOT, so this game is okay by me.',
       'This would be 5 stars except exiting doesn\'t exit. Using the "Back" button to leave and close down the game doesn\'t work. You\'re locked into the game end screen and are left to tap the recent apps button then kill the game using the "X" else tap the "Home" button, which leaves the game running in the background. Clearly the developers don\'t know Android as well as iOS, which doesn\'t give the option of exiting gracefully like Android...',

When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..',
       'Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven\'t gotten very far yet. Thing I DON\'T like is you don\'t get an average..... IF you do, I\'ve yet to find where it is in the game. That\'s in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯',
       'I have been playing for months and spent a fair bit of money on this app and also was enjoying playing until all of a sudden all the graphics went pink and now i cant play. Not happy!!! How do i fix it? Don\'t want to delete it really as i will loose all my chips and special balls. Someone help please !?!?',
       'I did like this fame but my lane keeps turning pink along with the ball so I can\'t actually see anything like where the ball is going.... and on quick fire again turns everything pink and don\'t let me take any shoots what do ever.. think it\'s a glitch in the game I\'m not sure but tried restarting the game and the same thing is happening again and again... on all the different lanes and extra games in bowling king...',
       'It\'s a  fun game but it\'s rigged. I think if you have a billion chips you shouldn\'t be able to play on lower lanes. I thought you were supposed to be matched up with people who are the same or close level. How is it I\'m bowling against someone who is level 171 and 8 billion chips and  I\'m level 43 .',
       'Amazing.  It\'s just fun watching the bowling hall whizz by and get a strike.  I\'ve played and uninstalled this game, but the only reason for the uninstall part is storage.  For all of you who are new, try getting the ball between the front pin and either of the pins next to it, it usually gets strikes, but by strikes I mean doubles against level 7 Russians.' ],

It\'s nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don\'t want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad.

     [ 'Purchasing the other ponies is worth it. Don\'t know why other people are complaining. It\'s only 5 dollars, you could get a DQ lunch for 5 dollars. Anyways, game is amazing. What\'s cool is that you can reset your progress so you can have fun all over again. Amazing work Budge Studios!',
       'This game is my 5 yr olds favorite thing to do during trips. She loves the music and animation, and the gameplay is entertaining enough to keep her engaged. It\'s definitely worth the few bucks to get the add free version.',
       'Installed it, launched it, after the bungie screen was presented by a full screen ad for some game involving a woman + handcuffs + panties. Not a good look for a game aimed at children, my 6 year old was standing behind me.',
       'Remove the paywall and just charge for the game, it\'s worth it and people will buy it. But the way you can\'t unlock ponies without paying is insulting. Such a shame... I\'ll be sure to avoid any games you make in the future. And, yes, that\'s a bit harsh. But if we all don\'t stop letting devs get away with this kind of thing every company will turn into EA and will ruin the fun of gaming.',
       'Ads popped up every 45 seconds. I timed it. Made the game useless for my son (4). And he really wanted to play it too.',
       'My daughter loves this game so much! Good job guys. However we need your help, i made a purchase to unlock all ponies, however, somehow they got locked again and we needed to purchase again to unlock everyone. It was kinda disappointing, please help us on this matter.' ],

     [ 'Streets of Rage is my favorite game in the world. Why because  I can remember the year of 1992 I was age 7  when this came out. One day my farther brought home a big duffle bag with the new sega genesis with about 40 - 60 games included. My brother, sister and I were so happy we played all night long. I even remember the Michael Jackson moon walker sega game and David Robinson basketball game. Sega Saturn is my all time favorite console out of all the other brands. After dream cast I stop buying game consoles there cool but Sega Forever!',
       'I just can\'t believe it.  If you were an original fan of this game and any good then you remember all the extra moves besides punch and kick.  They are all here.  Back to belly suplex, knees to the face and even Axel\'s back hand.  Haven\'t tried two player yet, but I bet the team moves are still there. Great port from Sega.  I agree that sometimes the controls don\'t respond, I would hope an external controller could fix all that.',
       'One of the best games ever with the best work from Sega regarding flow and controls. It\'s really like playing the good old Mega Drive!  Sega, you really should implement this layout and technology to all the other classic games. Sonic 2, for example, your main game, runs slow and doesn\'t have interface as clear and neat as this one (please work on it, it\'s really frustrating playing it the way it currently is). Again, congrats and thanks for SoR!',
       'I liked everything about the game, even the touch controls which are surprisingly better than a lot of emulators offer. Where they missed the mark was not allowing to load a save while offline, even after you pay to remove ads. (btw you can play the game while offline but not your save, makes no sense!)',
       'Game doesn\'t even open. I have a brand new galaxy tablet and I download the game but when I go to open the game I click the icon and the screen turns black and nothing happens.. I installed and uninstalled 3 times and still nothing.. very disappointing cause this was one of my favorite games as a child',
       'I always loved this game, and be able to play it through SEGA and not from any random Emulator it\'s even better! Beautiful the WiFi mode. I will never play this game alone. I would like thought, even the Bluetooth mode. I hope I can play to other game or to the next chapters 2 and 3. Same for golden axe, that unlucky doesn\'t have the multiplayer version at all :(' ],

     [ 'Excellent game but i would\'ve liked better rewards. Its always one coin even after I\'ve hit 100 catapults. If i hit more than one catapult with the same projectile i should get more coins. I don\'t want to start all over again if I\'m killed...want levels so i can have challenging opponents straightaway!',
       'Loved this game.  Clear a level then the next appears. And it never ends.  But then they updated the game and its run completely different.  My big negatives right now are that I had to reload the game and lost all my progress.  And that it tells you they will give you extra coins for loading their other games yet I never seen a penny. Even though I loaded all of them.',
       'Love it. Addicted. Such a simple game yet very entertaining. Would give a 5/5 if they added options in settings like "larger area" so the field/play area could be "longer" and possibly a few more upgrades to catapults. But even as is, quite good. I find myself playing this every spare minute',
       'This is a very fun game that I can play anytime. Reminds me of old stick people figuring games. There are a some bugs that kept this from 5 stars. Sometimes rocks fly right through my spoon shield, sometimes the game freezes and I lose all of my coins, and every time I close the game for the night I am missing several hundred coins when I get back on the next day. I don\'t know where to report this either. Overall I love this game. Maybe let players report bugs in game and improve descriptions of things in the store.',
       'Great time killer when you don\'t feel like using a lot of thought. Can easily put down and pick up in general where you left off without saving. I just wish it came with a manual explaining the workings of upgrades and other purchases in game. Extremely simple game however the shopping and upgrading is not as simple as you would think. I think that is the biggest reason for me withholding that fifth star.',
       'The game is fun and can be addictive. It really sucks because it takes forever to build up coins, and some times you have a few hundred saved up, but log in later you can he reset back to 0 for no reason. Additionally your catapult hair max and says level 0. It leaves me to wonder if there 8s an issue with my copy? I was level one, how am I level 0, how can I upgrade if my coins keep resetting. Great concept, but really frustrating.' ],

I guess you could pay for the game without adds, but if your like me and you don\'t really like spending money at the app store, patience my friend... the game is worth it...',

       'It\'s hard to control and there are WAY too many ads. It lags so I\'ll be doing fine but it\'ll make me crash because it paused for a brief moment. If all this was improved, I\'d love it. I love the concept of the game but everything else sucks.',
       'People... There are little mistakes that every game has. There is sucky parts of this game such as ads between every time that you die but the concept of the game is to not die so I kinda guess it gives you a goal. This is an awesome game but it won\'t work for every device. There are some BAD comments that may discourage you but trust me my friends... Try it.. It doesn\'t work, there is always the uninstall button for you.' ],

You can\'t collect the food even if you grow it. Since I did have enough gems wood or food to build the warehouse I\'m screwed with no options  but to quit the game. Sucks it could have been good. I\'m done. It\'s sad that with all the bad reviews you don\'t choose to change any of those features to improve the quality and keep more users to continue play.',
       'Really enjoy the game. Not spent a penny on it yet and managing alright to do tasks etc in a reasonable time. Though I\'ve not completed a quest yet but that could be me not getting back to the game regularly enough. That\'s my issue though.',
       'I never pay for supplies in these types of games but with this one there\'s no point in playing anymore if I don\'t. You simply can\'t earn enough coins to keep playing. Additionally their ratios for resources are all over the place. I often found it didn\'t make sense to use the "higher" option when a lower faster option was more cost effective. I will be deleting now at level 6',
       'Such a great and fun game but you can\'t do anything without buying food, money and diamonds with real money. No videos or exchange options. Would have played a lot longer if these options were available instead op purchasing with real money. Such a shame.',
       'It\'s definitely an adorable game and is one of the few games of this kind that has reasonable "waiting" times for stuff! :)  Sadly... There\'s one Major issue I have with the game and it is the constant notification to link Facebook with the game, which of course also has some great rewards locked behind it as well. :P I don\'t have a Facebook profile and it\'s incredibly unfortunate that there\'s no other alternative to choose (especially when there\'s plenty to choose from these days) Those are the reasons why I rate only three stars.',

You also can put stuff in your backk yard. And you c an change the way you look. And the best part i s you can buy really cool stuff with the diamonds and you can earn more subscribers. Thank you for reading this it took me 2 min.to type it',
       'This game is so edicting. I only just got it and ime loving it. I allredy have a rell chanel but this game makes making a vidio simple and fun. All you have to do is tap pres publish and boom you get nice coments good vuis and nice suggestions. Man oh man am i adictid to this game. Good adictid it really really is such a good game. That my freind is why i gave it 5 stars and recomend it to evry one. It is just as good if not better than peudiepies tuber simulator. So pleas get this one',
       'I get that free games have ads. That\'s fine. But you can\'t get 20 taps in or switch to a new tab before you get another 30/50 second ad. I thought this was just a fluke, but it keeps happening every 30 seconds like it\'s on a timer. This game would be fantastic other wise. Uninstalled it after the first half hour.',
       'I found that this game is so addicting till you got like 100000 views ever second... then it becomes very boring... but I do recommend it to people who want a game to play for like 2 weeks but don\'t expect any big reward for play long... I just want tapps to make something rewarding to getting higher like designing your gaming setup or actual able to make a video and upload it to the game... overall good game',
       'Surprisingly fun. I\'m iffy on idle clicker games but the reviews convinced me; there\'s lots of unique aspects to this game that other clicker games don\'t have. It\'s competitive, which is cool, and you can actually customize the upgrades. The main thing that makes me stay away from idle clickers is that there\'s no customization. In this game you can customize your room and yard, character, and even choose the videos you post. Lots of fun stuff to do, definitely worth a try.',
       'This game has to be the most fun game I have ever played. It\'s so simple yet so amazing at the same time. I guess the only thing I can say about this game is that it needs more topics for videos to make. I find myself always making the same videos over and over it really needs different topics to add. You could add topics such as more animal topics. My idea is a pig topic since there is an option to get a pig outdoor of your house or a bird topic since you could also get a bird in the game. Sorry if this short review is pretty long just have a lot of ideas. I really hope you guys read this I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much I think this game still has a lot more things to add.' ],

All of my daughter not only play they have all coloring pages of the dolls in their room 😊.',

Also when are you doing an update on the ios version please as thats still showing as version 2.0?',

       'Started playing two years ago and loved it. Does not start out with a ridiculous amount of credits, you have to work to achieve them, part of t he fun. Lost my original game and could not get it back. Love it so much just had to download it again.',
       'Fun game to play. I don\'t like new high stakes betting. You never win and lose your coins really fast. Don\'t waste your real money to buy coins because they won\'t last either. Glad they raised free coins you but now machines don\'t pay out as often. Have fun with your free coins and this is a good time.',

I will only play with the coins this game allow me thank you',

     [ 'Lost another These constant updates caused me to uninstall this. Fun game - very good game!But if it ain\'t broke don\'t fix it. I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.',
       'It\'s a fun game. If you\'re a COD player you\'ll love it. In general It does good on it\'s own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It\'s good that there\'s a grind to get them but I think it\'s a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.',
       'I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to "rent" which is an option in the game.',
       'Great game play, Great graphic, but after 1 month, I think this is another pay to win game ; the great Gun need to buy,  the Armor need to buy, almost every wining key things need to buy. But some people really like it because they have money to buy all those and "WIN" other pool guy. it is not about skill, it is about money.',
       'Awesome graphics, and for what you get on a phone, it really is an amazing game. The only complaint (if you can even call it that) I have is the controls can be a little tricky as sometimes when you\'re trying to swing left or right you can accidentally change your weapon instead of swing to either side. Aside from that, tremendous gameplay, multiple modes to play, amazing graphics, really just an awesome game. Make sure you have a really good internet connection.',
       'Be prepared the stupidity. 230 armor 120 health isnt enough to protect against the remington. So if u want to survive be prepared to pay more and more always. This game aint fun after a while. More annoying really. Otherwise would recommend it. So look elsewhere if u dont want to pay a hell of a lots of money' ],

     [ 'The game is ok.. i love the idea.. but in all RPG and similar games you can accuire your items from when you died from your body in that zone.. also its good when you enter the inventory to pause the game.. when entering a zone the game should give some time before reseting the material and monsters if the player re-enters the same zone.. These are the most critical points so far i have encountered.. please take these in consideration.. thank you',
       '16 energy to move to the nearest forest!! Don\'t expect to build your house or collect resources in a day. This game has potential, but the energy spent to move to a forest is just too much that after an hour you would have to spend money to get energy just to collect resources. It\'s a shame that the gameplay is really smooth but the game is focused on making you pay to win/build in the first hour.',
       'This game\'s great, I loved it until I saw the ammount of energy it costs to travel to the nearest forest. Could you try and fix this and anything else that the reviewer asked? The game\'s even better than Last Day on Earth, it\'s like a zombie survival in the middle ages, just make some improvements and this\'ll be the best survival game in Play Store',
       'As others have said it\'s basically LToE...and just as big a cash grab.  I have the same problems with this game as I did with LToE, I\'d rather pay for a game than have the mechanics manipulated to result in a poorly disguised attempt to get me to spend money.  At the end, too much repetitive gameplay, oh look, I\'ve chopped digital trees down for hours of my life.  No thanks.',
       'Game is alright durability seems like it could be adjusted so items last longer more then one outting at least. Where are the keys for dungeons and materials to finish stables? Lag spikes have costed me two full inventories of materials and with no chance of reclaiming body makes the game less fun.',
       'This game is really great, i mean absolutely great... it has alot of potential and its really enjoyable😉😉😉 i haven\'t even bought any purchases in this game but i still didn\'t die so far and i already made a lot of progress... keep up the good work guys, im excited about the future of this game, looking forward to it...' ],

When it finally did download the game crashed and was running very slow. Good game but just not working good. Wouldn\'t recommended it.',

     [ 'This is a wonderful cross stitch app. The picture quality is excellant. Among all apps in the store, this one lets you make  the largest pics from your own. It is  also the most generous option to gain coins. I think the adds blocking colors some reviews mention must depend on your device. I play on 8 in samsung tablet and have no problems. I  have two requests. Would like to play in landscape mode and would like the  ability to turn off the highlighting of the selected color like Cross Stitch world for a little extra challange.',
       'This is my favourite cross stitch game of them all. I love the spin the wheel feature where you can earn bonuses such as gold, protect, etc. I actually don\'t mind the ads as they offset paying actual money for the patterns if you are a bit "broke" at the time and the import feature is great! Totally addicted.',
       'I\'m using my Samsung galaxy s7 and I LOVE this app! Such a great time killer, anxiety reducer, stress reducer. You can even upload your own pics! I just wish the spin would land on things other than 60 coins, unpick and shield. There was a day where I got 5 prizes every spin! That was AWESOME!!!',
       'I love this app. It is very calming and fun BUT there are soooooo many ads. I will raise the rating when you stop having me click/watch so many ads.  Update: there seems to be MORE "+80 coins" ads that block out areas to work in so I eventually HAVE to watch them to get them to go away.',
       'Don\'t bother playing the mystery ones unless you like cartoon characters. Honestly, it\'s the last thing I want to see when I\'m relaxing after putting 3 kids to bed....more of the same characters that screeched at me all day.',
