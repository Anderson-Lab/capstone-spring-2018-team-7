      'I love this game. Every game I\'ve had, I played for a week or so, and uninstalled. But this one? Ive had for almost 6 months. Been playing every single day. Finally reached legendary 32, I\'ve unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so. Or at least a new adventure spot. Making a modded version of the rally car would be fantastic. Also, an upgrade on the formula car where it doesn\'t almost dead stop after it lands from a big air.',
       'Superb game! Too bad, the elements of hate like to hack good things and cause frustrations. For this reason, constantly run constant updates. I wouldn\'t mind paying through my rather expensive data to diffuse the damage by these bored, small prick nincompoops! Africaüòùüòùüòù',
       'Pay to win sh**.  Written by sell out morons.  Unbalanced....  Frustrating......  Physics models change almost daily or are perhaps \'randomised\'  to "re-balance" the game.   Net effect, as you maximise your vehicle, it gets slower!   Don\'t waste your time.....  Way too many adverts too, rewarding the imbeciles that created this drivel....  AVOID AVOID AVOID!',
       'Pretty good game the Ads are insane and they want a ton of money per month to get rid of them. Seems to be the way all the games are going. For the Chinese new year could have mad a tuk tuk I think it\'s called a mini taxi. Or something cool for China.',
       'Alot of fun but needs new maps and vehicles. Wayyy overdue for some new stuff.  Update: since the latest update I was very disappointed to see that they nerfed the magnet. Still waiting to see new maps and vehicles',
       'Loved this game before the updates. It now pushea ads in name of commercial break and there is no way to skip it untill its end. For chest its worth watching long ads but as a push ad this is unacceptable. Uninstalling sh**' ,

      'I hope you take the time to read.   This game is amazing, and it just keeps getting better. I do wish you would change the video knives to apples or video. Now I have nothing to spend apples on.  But here is what i really wanted to say i really like this company and the games you put out to your users. I\'m newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me. I own alot of your games and have spent alot trying to help. I wish I had more to unlock things in time. But Thank you very much.',
       'Deleted all my data with no reason. Had a bunch of Legendaries and Rares that have now been deleted. I put a lot of time into this game, and even bought the ad-free package. If you don\'t want a load of wasted time, don\'t download this app.  Edit- Updated the app and levelled up a bit. The game crashes every time I get a free revive. Still a massive waste of time.',
       'You have to expect some ads in free-to-play games but ads that cause input lag and interrupt gameplay are ridiculous, especially in a game where timing is important. The game also crashes occasionally during the xp increase.',
       'I really do like the game. There are two things that get to me however. Knives should all have individual names other than the boss ones. There are also alot of ads, I do understand they need to make üí∞. Otherwise the game is great.',
       'I bought the remove ads purchase and it screwed me. I still get adds and i still have to watch videos to remain in the same level. I want my money back since the game is the same. DONT BUY THE REMOVE ADS PURCHASE.',
       'Love the game its addicting and a great way to kill time i remember there were similar games a few years ago i think called aaa but this one is just way better with the graphics and apples and knife unlocking and also the bosses and power ups its fun to play love the idea that it will increase the chance of a power up after i unlock all of them cant wait for the challenges bought the ad remover and continue to support you guys' ,

      'Good but ¬£4 is a lot to not quite remove all the add. Some pictures are still locked behind and walls. Easy enough to unlock but for the price id expected all add to be removed. Also really would like the pictures to be sortable by category with more fantasy and space stuff in the complex pictures. Also there appears to be no way to sync pictures across devices. If I\'ve paid ¬£4 I should be able to switch between the phone and tablet at will. Both are android.',

This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it\'s just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.',
       'I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It\'s kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.‚ò∫',
       'Awesome app, its oddly satisfying and can either be really challenging ir really easy. Its constantly update with new pictures to do, and already contains probably hundreds lol, if dont 75+ and in saving the really detailed ones for last. If there even is such a thing. But, i think a counter for how many blocks of each color are left would be a really awesome alteration. There are many strategies to use when you do a color by number. So a counter for how many blocks of the selected number are left, it would be such a life save.this game has taken enough of my life already as is lmao',
       'Way to many ads, was hard to enjoy. Would have been more bearable If the ads weren\'t 30 seconds each, and played everytime I open/close a drawing. And, to prevent any ads you have to pay. I just want an easy, accessible, relaxing game. And by either making one pay, or making them suffer is not really my idea of "Relaxing". Thank you for your consideration.',
       'This game is really fun and when u play it u won\'t even know how fast the time has gone by. This game has some really challenging photos to colour which I am still working on. The thing that is not really good about this game is that there are lots of adds that pop up every time. Please improve that. Other than that this game is fantastic and I also really love all of the images we need to colour and how there are different modes u can change image after u have completely coloured it. I would definitely recommend this app.' ,

      'I do enjoy this game but certain levels don\'t give you enough moves to complete the level. The ones you have to match the cubes with the colors makes it impossible to pass when the game doesn\'t give you moves to do so. You waste your moves on areas that doesn\'t give you the opportunity to pass the level and then you don\'t have any moves left before it does give you the moves you need it does get frustrating you get stuck on that level and can\'t pass it. Which will just make you want to unistall the game cause you will never leave that level.',
       'Support don\'t want to help when you have an issue. Once they reply you don\'t have an option to reply to them, you have to start all over again and it\'s the same reply about back up to Facebook etc, which I did.... level 170 and I had to start again, don\'t ask for help, they don\'t care!!! Better of with candy crush or another competitor game',
       'I absolutely love this game. The graphics are spectacular. The characters well they\'re not characters their cartoons they\'re amazing. And the game is fun. My only complaint is that every level is a struggle to get through and it would be nice if occasionally they would make a few of them easier.',
       'You will not believe what I am about you tell you but this game picks and chooses who to charge for rewards. I have screenshots of my partner\'s game, not having to pay for his rewards and I look at my game, getting charged $2.99 everytime I want my rewards. Its messed up and I have deleted the game.',
       'This game is great. I like blasting all the cubes. It reminds me of Super Collapse From back in the day. It is a cute game, with cute graphics and characters. Although I might not play it too much because it doesn\'t require enough thought, it\'s definitely something to play when I feel like relaxing.',
       'My grandma has this game and she said, Braelyn go to your app store and get this game called toon blast. I said ok when it finished downloading, I started to play it and i loved it!!

The game always shut down either i\'m watching an ad or just upgrading my miners.... When it happens on an ad it\'s thw worst!!!! sometimesi have to redo the same boosting to 3-4 times until it works once... So instead of losing 30-45 sec of my life for a game a lose 3 minutes in all!!!!',
       'The in app purchases are a little overboard. I normally wouldn\'t pay for stuff in an app but for this game I would definitely not even consider it. Nothing should cost more than $50, but there are packages in this app costing $100... that\'s way too much and I really don\'t like it. The only thing I want to see in the game is the ability to upgrade things with a percent amount of money. (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and obviously max which already exists)',
       'This Is A Good Game But Lots Of Glitches Such As You Dont Like The Facebook Or Instagram You Go Back Boom? I Love This Game But It Needs Some Fixes So 4 Stars For Now.',
       'I saw my older son playing his game. Remind me of the old miner game I used to play. On my phone so I gave it a try I loved it. I just sit home and watch TV and play the game. So I could challenge my friends you better catch me',
       'It was a fun time waster while it lasted. I had the game for about 3 days and it just wouldn\'t load anymore. I tried uninstalling and re-instlling but the load screen gets stuck in the same spot. I\'ve uninstalled the app but again, fun while it lasted.',
       'Fun game, but the lack of useful manual, or in game help is annoying. Lots of guess work, is not how I like to spend my time.  Nice graphics.' ,

      'Its overall a great game. I like the tracks and the cars. I just wished you could re-earn money by replaying tracks, but put it at half amount that way it gives people that dont want to spend money on the game a chance on singleplayer.  FIX THE LAG because you finish in first and you end up getting second, third or fourth because of the lag.',
       'A simple game that\'s like a modern version of an old school racing game I played. It\'s cool for the most part but it is lacking in the department of how to earn money. I wish your developers could add another way to get money than just multiplayer after you complete the career mode. It\'s also incredibly hard to find parts to cars you want without gems. This is mostly a pay to win game, I know but you already have a ton of ads so why make the game less enjoyable by having only two ways to make money? One is temporary and the other is permanent but you earn so little. I still enjoy the game but consider what I had to say, thank you.',
       'Game is good. Do not even waste your time paying to get rid of ads. They will rip you off. I paid to get rid of them and you still have to watch videos to claim your money that you won. You have been warned. Would have given five stars if it were not for admin stealing money',
       'Finish race in 1st place. Waiting for rewards. Loading... Sudenly I\'m in 4th place and \'didn\'t finish the race\'. -40 trophies. Simply ridiculous  Also, fix the checkpoints. It\'s frustrating to get thrown back so much when all you did was get a little out of the track.',
       'Annoying adds. Draining my internet data i dont like it! Every challenges in multiplayer need to watch the adds so you will receive the reward nope that\'s horible. I prefer playing a free game so i don\'t like this kind of game. Its just simple thia is money game!!!',
       'This game COULD be awesome. But cannot tell you how many times Ive been in 1st or 2nd place then all of a sudden it says I was 3rd or 4th. If your gonna have a legit league, then these glitches have to be dealt with.' ,

      'I love this game and would have rated it a 5 but suddenly the pause feature isn\'t working and I lost a game that was over 8000 points because I had a phone call. After I unpaused it set me back to zero. So aggravating. Also the 30 second ad for 30 stars doesn\'t show up anymore. Not sure what happened to this game in the last 2 weeks.',
       'This used to be an awesome game. I played it every day! But after the latest update, the ads at the top cause the game to lag terribly and make the ball fall very slowly and the pieces disappear slowly.  I can\'t adjust as needed due to the lag. I\'m unable to play due to this lag. Interestingly enough, when I turn on Airplane Mode thereby disabling the ads across the top, everything runs smoothly like it used to!! I am all for ads to support the developers  but this type they currently have causes severe lag which has rendered the game useless.',
       'Sadly, it could\'ve been a fun game if I could actually tap where I wanted to. The tap is off by like a few mm or something. I have to tap above the try again button to actually try again, or else I end up hitting challenges... So during the game play the exact same thing would happen, which makes the game unplayable.',
       'There are way too many advertisements every time I start a game or lose or win a game I instantly get an 30 second ad which I have to waste my time on to skip it until I am finally done. Overall except for the advertisements it is a great game controls and game play is brilliant I recommend this game but you will get a lot of ads. Suggestion: Lower the amount of ads showen',
       'I have paid ¬£2.99 to remove ads and in still getting them. I emailed the developer two weeks ago and have still not had a response. You are forced to watch ads so often the game becomes unplayable and paying the money to remove them does not work. Save your time and do not bother even installing it. If you do install it do not pay the money to remove ads as it does not work!!!',
       'I love it but ever since I installed it ads kept popping up all over my phone. I don\'t know if it was because of this app. I want to uninstall to see if that\'s it but it\'s really addictive and fun.' ,

I\'m already making lots of gold with automating potatoes. Potatoes give away so much gold! Great update!  Keep up the good work! Thanks, Idle Farming Empire! What a good replacement for Farm Away!                  Idle Farming Empire is like the best simulation for farming. I gave the game 5 stars for a reason. I loved the game! Look under the review!

       'I LOVE THIS GAMEE!! It\'s so addicting and once u get used to it, u can\'t stop playing it! It\'s a great time killer and it auto saves (not of u connected to Facebook.) Again, I love this game and I would recommend this game to EVERYONE because it\'s for all ages (unless u are a very serious person) JK LOL! :D',
       'OK, I love Idle clickers and this is a great game in this genre. Easy to get into, ads not forced on you, nice graphics.  There is one thing that is really bugging me though. You start out with your standard 9 crops and you can then unlock more for each plot. My issue is it does not tell you when you unlock a new one if it earns more than the standard one. Do they just look different but earn the same? Apart from this... Love it. Keep up good work devs',
       'AMAZING! I love this game. It is so addicting and a great way to pass time and boredom. I think though for one small improvement you could add a thing where there are like \'mini games\' and you earn coins for that. Using those coins earend in the mini games you spend it on things like watering cans, fences for live stock and more! This was only some suggestions for a bigger game if you can have or make a new game called like farm life or something like that....LOVE IT...',
       'Like so far But, 2 issues. 1- I don\'t Facebook or do any social media so needs to be a way other than ads for those bonuses. 2- daily rewards Don\'t happen. Shows that they were collected but will not activate unless I have enough diamonds. Please fix. Play offline on tablet and hotspot to get daily reward.',
       'Great and addicting game, but with one major bug. I went to collect my idle money and I watched a video too double it (46 billion total). But when I hit the button to collect it, I never got it. All the money dissapeared and I got nothing. What\'s the point of an idle game, if you don\'t get anything for being idle?' ,

      'Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it\'s advertised too much, but it\'s definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That\'s slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.',
       'Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I\'ll be playing this for a long time! I\'m working on the living room right now, getting close to level 600. Can\'t wait to see what the new character, Jerry, has in store for us! Thank you Playrix!',
       'I really like this Game so Far. I will play for awhile to See how it Works & If I like it. Absolutely Love Your Game. Play it ALL THE TIME!!! I Must Admit that I Really Do enjoy this Game! Sometimes I find myself Having a Hard Time With Certain Levels. I Could be On that Level for Days or a Few Weeks. I think with Some Improvement that Would make People Play. This Game More. But I Must Say Hat\'s Off to The Developers',
       'Fun at first but levels become way to hard to quickly and it makes it very hard to advance in the game. U have to beat 2 levels to do one task and some levels u need to play 20 time to get past. Abd with only 5 lives at a time. Makes it kind suck. And frusterating to play. Please make 1 task per 1 level',
       'It\'s actually way better than I expected....  Obviously it\'s advertised a lot but it actually met up to my expectations.  What I once about the game is the fact that you don\'t have to pay real money to get things and that you\'re earning the stars instead of buying or waiting for them to come up.   Combining candy Crush and home decor in the best way possible.  A lovely game indeed',
       'The reason why I love the game is bc its very addictive An it helps me concentrate. The only thing that I would like to suggest that we pull our friends in the game an work at these harder levels together so we can move forward to help Austin an his family members out. We still  need to be able to use our coins when we desire to not have to go through 2 boards on a game.' ,

      'So I played it on my iPhone e and loved it. Recently o got a new phone and it\'s am android. I connected to my Nintendo account and loaded it up. My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I\'m not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr',
       'Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I\'m paying ¬£9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn\'t make it worth the price being asked.',
       'I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else.

       'Super Mario run is a great smartphone game it has the very addicting toad rally and remix ten and the simple, but very rewarding controls. The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars',
       'I could only rate this 1 star as the app does not open, it gives a message saying Unfortunately Super Mario Run has stopped working. Disappointed as I was hoping to get My Nintendo points.  Installed on both my tablet and my phone, neither installation works.  Very disappointing.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game WAY........Before 5/22/17 as my last review states in my prior comment!!.  I paid $9.99 to obtain full access to all worlds! And I\'ve emailed you all with this information,  I\'ve sent proof of purchase!! And all other things required to confirm my statements! But I continue to go ignored as if I never mentioned an issue!.. For some strange & frustrating reason I\'m unable to regain access to the entire tour which I completed not long after I paid the cover fee of $9.99 to do so!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And I\'m NOT wiling to pay for that again!!that\'s certainly an option I\'m NOT willing to apply.  Please repair this ongoing issue.. It will be appreciated beyond words' ,

      'Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death',
       'Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won\'t register your flips. These aren\'t huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.',
       'Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I\'ll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.',
       'This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can\'t seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn\'t be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it\'s not something you have to add, it\'s just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven\'t seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it\'s an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! üöòüòäüöò',
       'This game would be great if it wasn\'t so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn\'t slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.',
       'Love it. Only thing is there is a glitch when you watch an ad for 200 thingy things you get a menu that lets you get 200 more. Than again, than again. Its better on our side than yours but it would be a good fox so you have to earn them! I love all your games, wish I had all of them but I have limited storage!' ,

      'The whole concept of the game is very interesting. But the game has way too many glitches due to ads and maybe the new update. This game can literally give someone cardiac arrest because you could be about to get a goal and then the game just freezes. Lol.',
       'This game beats the whole purpose of dumb ways to die. It\'s meant to be a game with mini games after mini games. Not ads and points and avatars and money and everything complicated! Deleting and getting the original.',
       'The adverts ruin this game, so many pop ups. Also the availability to watch adverts for digital item.. need to watch 30 of the 20sec ads.. who even had this spare time to do this? The game itself is great though but I\'m uninstalling because of what I mentioned above.',
       'OK, so personally, FANTASTIC! I only have a few things I don\'t like about the app. 1. WAY to many adds. 2.Bad Controls. And 3.Kind Of Slow. Other than Those concerns, this is an great app and I suggest it to anyone who likes these kind of games. Also, this is a great time killer to. Please make those little changes and you app will be perfection. Thanks!',
       'I love the minigames! Just wish there were a couple more... and the plain one? A pain to control, i bebe it\'s the sensitivity? Idk but it very difficult to manage. And it would be nice to have more houses to fix :)',
       'The game is great. But a lot of annoying ads are ruining it. I understand the ads, where you receive coins or where you speed up things, but ads every 3 times when you die are just ruining the app. Hope to update this policy, so one can see ads only when it will give you credits or anything else!' ,

      'Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!',
       'Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm\'s Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!',
       'Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I\'m just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it\'s going to be good.  We\'ll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!',
       'This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10',
       'I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game since the last lvl was ToE. First time when i was surprised was an update with three or four new maps, also demon levels, but that was actually nothing, i felt at this moment \'\'Wow, update, ok\'\'. I got more admired by new update with this walking thing, still dunno the name, but things they have added, i still love it. Animated trails, new wallpapers that was awesome. New updates have arrived in mini-games for free, also awesome, but now i guess they have no idea what to add, because what they\'ve done this is the biggest and greatest update. I love this game so much, so i can\'t just put 4 or less. Gg RobTop, Gg.' ,

      'Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don\'t like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option',
       'Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it\'s good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can\'t take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren\'t recognised either. I\'d enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.',

       'This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!',
       'Update:  now the game won\'t let me start a new game.   Original post: Buggy to say the least. Paid to remove ads since it was only .99. And now the game randomly quits, and erases any games I\'ve started when I exit from the game for any period of time. Was find until I removed the ads. Great way to treat the people paying your bills.',

      'All the main movie characters and space ships to use. Wish u would make more farmable but over one of the best games out there. I actually prefer it compared to Xbox due to no issues with extensive network down periods. If u want us to pay then we gotta be able to play when we want right? Someone else should send that to Xbox they stopped caring long ago. Well done again for the game',
       'Amazing game. Really hits me in the childhood. Great mechanics, events, character moves/abilities, great art style, and unlike most mobile games, does not require paying a dime. It may take a while to reach a high level, but with practice and dedication, you can really go far in this game. I even recommended it to a lot of my family members. Would rate higher than 5 stars if that were an option. No problems whatsoever with the game.',
       'This update gave the players most of the things they have been asking for over a year now. The only issue i have is that EA is still pushing its pricing model with this game. 300 dollars to full star up a character + another 200 for gear. Its a bit much. The F2P is still full and while you will be hardpressed to make it to number 1 on your shard it is possible and gives great satisfaction. I would recommend atleast giving it a try.',
       'Just d/l this like a week ago. Very good game, the turn based RPG style works well, the graphics are top notch, as well as the sound is accurate and superb. The only thing is: I just updated it and now cant get past the Lucas film/Disney screen now. The update was not interrupted at all when I downloaded it, but I suspect it got corrupted, contacting support, hope they can help me I do NOT want to start over.',
       'The game looks interesting, but when you\'ve finished the tutorial you have to give permissions to Contacts (and then maybe other permissions), which is a big red flag for me. There is absolutely no reason ask for permissions like this just to sign up, with no way to proceed and gracefully opt-out!  Beware that by giving them the Contacts permission you are giving away other people\'s information, not just your own! \'Just say no\' to invasive app permissions.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a good year. It is the one game on mobile that I\'ve never put down. I love the grind and how rewarding it is. It is not pay to win, and you can max out every character without paying a cent. EA made something truly great here! Ecspically if your a die hard star wars Fan!

When I login with Facebook I have to start from the beginning. Kinda frustrating when I am at level 1183 on my kingdom account! I emailed for help and was sent to a the community site which does not have a solution to my problem anywhere. Please correct this!',
       'This game is the worst. When u get an ad, you don\'t have any way at all to get out of it, so u have to log off and then back on. Also, you can\'t even tap on the left side of the screen at all, so you cannot make any matches. UNISTALLED!! THANKS',
       'It seems like this game has come a long way since the last time I played it. Thank you for the improvements. I just might keep it for awhile until I get tired of playing it altogether. Good job.',
       'At first this game is very easy and fun to play. When you get to level like 175 you can get stuck on it for a day. And when you pass it finally it was pure luck. I like thinking games but when you play on luck its like gambling.. very anoyying.  Now I\'m at level 207 and I\'m not enyoing this game at all any more.. I will delete it. Play to 150 and delete it',
       'I don\'t like playing game but this is the first game i can play easily. It also brings me and my boyfriend (a gamer) have a common habit. We try to beat each other or play it together',
       'A very relaxing match game. Stress releaver, and makes you face challenges that can be solved and make you happy. I like how the game gets more challenging as you go throw the levels, as you go you come across new things, and it\'s just like trying something new in real life.' ,

      'Pretty, addicting and intriguing. Love the gameplay so far, and no purchases are required (they help a lot, though). Constant technical issues are a great nuisance, however. Force stop or reboot is usually needed to get the game running, and models occasionally fail to load (playing on a oneplus 5). All in all, thumbs up for a great and non-greedy game, which could use some serious bugfixing.',
       'This is a really nice game. I\'m enjoying immensely.  There is one thing I\'d like to see happen. Every time I collect wood andmstone, the big hand comes on the screen to point at the buildings. Now useful as It was in the tutorial,  I now don\'t need to remind me. Can you get rid of it?',
       'Graphics are really beautiful. Controls work 90% of the time, 10% of it requiring you to tap 2 to 3 times due to it being unresponsive. Gameplay wise, its great at first, then after a while the wait times are too long and there is very little gameplay to fill the time in between voyages.  Overall, great graphics, controls can be optimized, gameplay can be more in depth and varied? I find myself just comin on every hour or so just to collect and set stuff.',
       'Black screen on load. Will not load or go past blank screen. Tried everything and nothing works.   EDIT: After the latest update it is working fine again. Awesome game and very addicting. would be great if had an option to gain resources or something from ships enroute while waiting for them to return',
       'Shame... Won\'t load the game. It said I have no internet even though I have 4 bars and LTE. Then I forced closed and tried to open again and there was a black screen for like 3 minutes before I gave up. Looked like a great game but I wouldn\'t know.',
       'I\'m having one major issue with this game, and it\'s reoccurring. It keeps stating it Error cannot connect, even though my signal has full strength. Come on developers, my provider says that there\'s no problem my end, that leaves only one end possible, doesn\'t it!!' ,

       'You people are fooled. This is a huge rip-off of Rolling Sky, and there are a lot of glitches. Do not recommend to play.',
       'I didn\'t like it because it was a copy of rolling sky or scrolling in the sky, and the controls are weird, and I got confused cause if the trees. I\'ll give it 3 stars',

      'The game hangs rather often. It also has some notable bugs e.g. after completing a time-based challenge, I have to exit the area and reenter otherwise I cannot select another challenge. Also, I spent 60,000 coins on a box but then game hanged there, and when I restarted, the coins were gone but I had no rewards added. Disappointing in these aspects but generally action-packed fun without too much thinking.',
       'Played for a while bought a 1100 gem pack. Got some 2  and 1star fighters as well as several 3 star fragments. Then the game glitched out and i lost all my progress. I logged out and back into my google play account but it keeps insisting on starting a new session for my account.',
       'I initially gave this game a great review but after some weeks of playing the game it started to restart and take me back to the tutorial stage deleting all of my characters without allowing me to retrieve my saved data, even though there is a Google play option that assures you that your data would be retrievable if you click here. Fix this issue and I would be more than willing to change my opinion of the overall game. Until then it\'s not worth downloading',
       'This game is good but I am not able to load my account ( I have changed my phone ) whereas I have saved it( in my previous phone)I have tried the steps given by you but it is not working. Whenever I try your step a pop-up comes saying your account is linked to google. Help me i don\'t want to play this game from starting.pleaze fix this problem',
       'This game superb...bring back.old memory. the fighting style using card make the game   easy to play superb. Cant wait to see how the online pvp awsome. One thing that make me frustated is the energy sistem how to heal and revive so i cant fight all day . Its beter not to heal or revive so we can play for hours',
       'This is not tekken, it\'s something else entirely with a tekken skin. I\'d rather play tekken 3 on epsxe, why didn\'t you just stick to the original control format for fighting. May as well be playing candy crush and leave my brain to turn to mush.' ,

      'I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It\'s pricey but we\'ll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn\'t need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get',
       'Omg I have just realised that it was 1 year ago since I wrote that! So I\'m going to write a new one!. I love this game so much it has such good graphics and I recommend this game for any age I am addicted to this game and I think that you should definitely get it. It is a great game and I love it! So what are you waiting for go ahead and download it right now!',
       'Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn\'t need to have the internet on. Don\'t know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.',
       'this is a very well made game with excellent graphics and challenging play. It is however very money focused. The beginning levels are structured to encourage upgrades which at first are reasonable. Each later stage requires more diamonds to complete. The so called \'challenges\' are Impossible to complete without upgrading every implement so are essentially impossible for free play. Players beware!',
       'I love the way this game plays, and it plays like a dream. The grafics are wonderful, but there is just one flaw. The diamonds. You have to either play for a long time to earn more diamonds, and you can, or buy them with real money. And the game causes you to spend more diamonds than you can earn. From the atmosphere itself, to the food, and the appliances. Unless you have a lot of time and patience, or have the money to buy diamonds, this game might grind your nerves.',
       'Very nice graphics and addictive. The best thing is that it does not force you to pay for better progress. Ads are not noticeable. It provides a very comfortable playing environment.  It could be even better if the food can be more sensitive to touch. I always fail to grab those cooking food causing them to be burnt. Nice game overall though.' ,

      'So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I\'ll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It\'s in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I\'ve ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. üëåüëç',
       'this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It\'s so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It\'s just so addicting and I can\'t get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the \'play online\' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sin√©ad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie üòäüòä',
       'I\'ve recently upgraded from cubot to galaxy s7 and unfortunately the game is not working properly like it did on the old cubot phone. The screen gets stopping and it\'s impossible to play. I\'ve tried uninstalling and changing Wi-Fi settings but nothing worked. Other than that the game is sick! Love it,my kids love it and it\'s fun to play.',
       'Should allow us to be able to control the speed with a bar level instead of the button. Should make online controllers like offlines. Faster and more sensitive to move. And add a special rare star that floats around the screen rarely that doubles your size by eating it. No matter how big you are. That would be interesting.',
       'Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except meüò≠üòåüò∂üôÑüòìüòëüò´üôÉ',
       'I\'m highly addicted to this game. It\'s a thousand times better then agar.io in my opinion and it\'s really cool that you get to create your own skin. The only downer is that I just wish there was some music because you start to get a bit bored after a while.This game is NOT a waste of time, and everyone needs to download it to experience the awesomeness!' ,

No pause which is understandable but kinda sucks. Once you get the hang of the controls it becomes  addicting. Would like to see more land and background options... maybe on the next update??',
       'I gannruntee this won\'t make it on the review list but oh well. I just uninstalled this game because I paid the $2.49 for no ads and it doesn\'t work. Don\'t waste your time or money. I really like the game bit there are way TOO MANY ads and when you try to hit home to bypass the ads the game freezes up. So until they fix the problem I WILL NOT download this game. I\'ll find another one similar.',

But the ads are way too common, it\'s always a 30 second or 15 second ad after every death; It\'s like our motivation to keep the ball going is just so we don\'t have to watch an ad. Plus, sound would be good to add for Dune.',

It goes to the voodoo screen and exits out the app. I already tried downloading it some times and from different sources. Not good...',
       'Cool game but the ads are irritating. I paid for the ad free but I\'m still getting ads. Contacting the developer and will request refund if they don\'t do anything.  Update: Has become so glitchy that I can\'t even play very well anymore. Still have ads and haven\'t received a refund.' ,

      'It\'s OK I love to play the game when I\'m bored and it helps me to be settled back and have a good time. But these all happens when I\'m offline. But when I\'m connected to Wi-Fi there\'s too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you\'ll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I\'m playing the game??!! It\'s too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.',
       'Nice game but became boring in just one day! 2 options of controls: Spin (Steering Wheel) and Tap. Tap option is easier than spin. You have to complete the damn missions but the coins are only available in Normal mode they aren\'t available in arena mode. For making easy highscore follow this!! 1. Switch your controls to tap mode. 2. Open Arena mode. 3. In the beginning take the U-turn. 4. Keep driving in the middle line i.e in between of lane 1 and lane 2. 5. Just keep driving on that small line dividing both lanes and you\'ll get your highscore until and unless you get tired, I\'ve made it to 3,887.  Normal mode is quite harder than the Arena but it provides coins and you\'ve to play it for getting your missions accomplished!  Thanks',
       'I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don\'t you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?',
       'It\'s stupid. It\'s really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn\'t turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked.',
       'I dont know why people are rating Ketchapp games below 4 stars... I agree games are difficult but one of the unique one\'s in every launch. Their creativity is awesome... Love to play each of their games. Kind of more chanlenging and unique ones',
       'This is an amazing game! But there\'s a tiny problem with the controls: they are hard to be used. In addition, there are so many advertisments and that\'s the only reason I gave 4/5 Stars' ,

      'You\'re game is ok at best. It kinda really sucks that it takes way too long to upgrade ships or even make any gold playing the game in order to upgrade. And when I do play the aliens are disproportionately stronger than my ships and the power up come way to far and between to make the game overly enjoyable. And I don\'t want to have to spend that much money or invest that much time for a game on my phone. It could be a way more addictive game if you made a few upgrades to power up faster or earn gold quicker.',
       'GREAT GAME, AWFUL DEVELOPER! Downgrading from 5 stars to 2 stars. There are some ridiculous bugs such as winning on PVP mode not only failing to pay out but actually leaving you with less money!  Don\'t bother asking the developer to fix or credit your account, emails are ignored. This developer is one step short of criminal.',
       'Just purchased a Galaxy Pack, thinking I would get the 4 additional ships. Surprisingly, it didn\'t and just got robbed $6. Just messaged their FB page and never got a reply.   I recommend to have this gaming company closed down for scamming and robbing people of their money.   TWO THUMBS DOWN FOR THIS GAME',
       'Game randomly places a big red "buy" button right where the big red "play" button is.    I\'ve been given a message saying "could not process payment" several times without intending to buy.  My account is locked down on purpose.  It\'s a real shame because I want to give this 5 stars but can\'t because it\'s trying to contact me out of a lot of money.',
       'Spend $$$ in the 100s or waste 100s of hours getting what you need to "win" and on top of that half  of your time will be wasted watching ads between ALL beginner levels.  It is addictive, does not always work properly, NO customer support and constantly finds ways for everyone to spend their money on a make believe spaceship that is gone in seconds.',
       'It\'s a great little shooter that\'s easy to pick up. Only thing I\'d like to see is a way to pick which ship you\'re always using at the start instead of the starter green ship and having to rely on getting the ship you want to switch to to drop..., other than that this game earned the 4 star rating.  Edit: Now it seems that an update has zoomed the screen in so much that on the main screen theres icons being cut off and can\'t be seen.' ,

      'The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won\'t annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!

       'Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it\'s fun because it\'s challenging and there\'s super fun things in GD except hacking because that\'s no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I\'m super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! üòéüòÇ',
       'Well, I admit, I\'m addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn\'t be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can\'t Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! üôåüòéüòç',
       'It\'s a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ‚ö† the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it\'s super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.',
       'The game is great. I just have three words it\'s AAA Addicting annoying but awesome at the same time. The graphics and colours made the gameplay even better. I love it! And for all the people who have it u just need to practice cause practice makes perfect and don\'t rage quit !üòé' ,

      'Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It\'s nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don\'t want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn\'t get a key.',
       'Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion.',
       'Fun game but takes forever to get gold to upgrade. The cost to pay for the gems to buy so you can buy gold is really expensive. Not much dynamic to the game. Same stuff on each level just takes longer to bet enemies cause of higher HP.',
       'It stopped working on my One plus! Help! I was excited about the side games! *********************************** Excellent, addictive fun. I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn\'t level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can\'t progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.',
       'This game is really good.  The more you play the harder it gets but it is doable and you can watch ads to get you trough without paying.  I am around level 35 & haven\'t spent anything.  It is a hard to put down game.  The visuals are super satisfying,  especially when you get your little bombs kicking butt on the upper side of the enemy and they get faster and faster.  So satisfying!',
       'I wish I read the reviews before I downloaded this "game". Absolutely awful. Seriously, don\'t waste your time. If you like a stupid amount of ads and you are a fan of being bored then go for it.' ,

      'OMG! I love the gameplay in this arcade game I love everything about it. It is very cool that you can evolve sharks that can eat more stuff. Keep the updates coming it would be better if you added more sharks in this game . I recommend downloading this game if you want something to do in a long amount of time. This is so addictive I can\'t stop playing it!',
       'My apologies for the negative review lately. But to be honest, I have to use VPN just to log-in in Google Play and enable cloud sync or else, I wouldn\'t be able to sync my progress. Just a little request, can you make the gameplay smoother for lower end devices, such as devices with 1GB RAM? It lags frequently during gameplay. Thanks a lot!',
       'Amazing game. I completed this game in 48 minutes Hahaha! Because I used luckypatcher :) I downloaded the luckypatcher in Googlechrome But it can harm your Device..... And the last shark is Moby dick His baby is as big as Megalodon.',

PLEASE CHANGE IT( I\'M GUESSING YOU GOT THE PURRING IDEA FROM MY TALKING ANGELA).3.I CAN\'T BRUSH HER TEETH ONLY USE THAT SUCTION THING PLEASE FIX THIS!  BUT OVERALL A VERY CUTE AND FUN GAME TO KILL TIME!',
       'It\'s so cute. I cant even describe how great it feels when youve been gone for a long time, then you come back to the app and see you have like 30 likes or so. It just makes you feel acomplished. I also enjoy how its not a pay to win game.',
       'Love my bunny,but would like to be able to save my progress from one  device to another maybe via email form as I\'ve worked hard on her,game sometimes bit glitchy please also add more games so this game does need an update',
       'Like everyone says, it is a knock-off. But beside that it is super boring. And tje animation is creepy. Also they bombard you with ads. Don\'t waste your time with this trash of an app.',
       'I\'m so impressed! I am only on level 8, but I love this game. I found almost all of the hidden animals, which makes me happy because it\'s nice to get special things. All it really needs is mire mini ganes. Great game!' ,

      'So nice to sit and enjoy a game of challenge. Almost as much fun as chess, but easier to carry. Great way to relax while waiting for the zombie apocalypse or the bus to come. Thank-you and keep up the awesome work.  *UPDATE* 17 FEB 2018.  Have started my friends and family trying to get Top Score. No one is really trying as they are all enjoying playing the app to care. Brought a tear to my eye. Once again, "Thank-you"  for a truly  wonderful game.',
       'Great game. Starts easy so you can get your eye in and then gets harder. Fun to play and not so difficult that you give up and uninstal. Ads are over fairly quickly and I like that you can choose to watch some to get extra coins.',
       'Nice game I like it very much and in game if we don\'t have money so they ask watch and after watching video they give 100 or 200 Rs the game is very long and after win we got a new Ball',
       'It starts easy but gets you thinking later on. the graphics are good for the style of game as well. Overall a very fun and addictive game.',
       'Addictive and keeps your mind alert to new routes for the ball, the adverts are annoying but hey!!!',
       '1/13/2018:  I really really love this game!! Hope you keep making more levels!! Keep them coming!! Thank you !!  UPDATE:2/6/2018 Still love the game even tho the levels are getting harder. Keep them coming!! Thank you!!' ,

      'Great timewaster! There are a lot of characters to earn and you don\'t need to spend real money to get them, so that\'s a plus. However, rated it a 3 cuz there are sooooo many ads. I get that ads generate the revenue to keep a good game free but an ad populates for literally every action. Win a game=ad, lose a game=ad, go to the settings=ad, change the volume=ad... ok the last one is fictitious but it really seems like that\'s how it works',
       'The game is simple to immediately start playing and fun. I shouldn\'t rate a game based off of this but, these pop up adds are tremendously common. Adds are essential so that the app can support itself but to have an add after every single play and then have an add to open a chest? Really? That\'s a bit much, especially, when the adds are not easily skippable and even force you to the download screen of the add. The game is simple, fun, and has witty, silly, and quirky characters. But the adds are a bit much.',
       'Me and my son have had fun with this game and made an attempt to collect all characters. The game is set up so you can not earn all of the characters but have to buy the last couple in a cash grab. It would be fine if they we\'re only available for real money but the game gives the illusion that you can win them in a chest. One that we have spun over 50 times without success',
       'The game itself is enjoyable and the controls are quite simple. Very intuitive. But Jesus Christ on a frosty log, the ads are way to much. After every round, ad, want your prize? Ad. Wanna do anything in the game? Enjoy the ad. Jesus guys, I don\'t mind ads and I understand that\'s how you make money, but you shouldn\'t have to watch an ad to get your prize for winning... Come on.',
       'Everything else is great, EXCEPT the amount of ads... I love the game, but I don\'t want to keep turning on and off airplane mode so I can actually enjoy it.  Edit: there are ads after I go into settings and more information, which doesn\'t leave the app!? Seriously? And the "messages" are all more ads for other apps too, lol. Bro calm down with the ads. This is why I\'m now uninstalling.',
       'So many aaaaaaaddddddssssssss!!!!!!! The game itself is super fun! But the amount of ads is ridiculous and effectively kills the enjoyment. Now every ad opens the play store regardless of if you watch the whole ad or hit the X to close it. This is the last straw. I\'m rating one star until this gets fixed. Will give 5 stars when the ads no longer inhibit gameplay so severely.' ,

      'Would of gaven 5 stars. But there some bugs that need to be worked out. Like connection and handling. But other then that this game is really close to PUGB for the phone. Massive open world. COULD do little better on the mechanic of the game but nothing to major. Would like to have a better money earn system like small amout per kill or something. This game is well dont. Ive played almsot all games on gogole play and when i say this game is fun I MEAN IT!!..',
       'Thank you for constantly improving the game. Id say at this point not to add more but to fix and adjust what you already have. Fine tuning before more additions would be great. Optimizing sounds, movements, vehicles, rendering, scoping, responses, all that good stuff would be great. Its a little laggy but thats just what you get for a giant game and 100 million+ players. Love it either way.',
       'The game has so much potential they just need to make it easier to see other players and easier to shoot people close to you. Also the game doesn\'t need to look realistic they should make it more like fortnite graphics and gameplay wise.  My main point is that it is too hard to see others in the game. still a good game though',
       'honestly a great game. but dont get diamonds to buy their packs. not only are they really expensive but the chance of actually getting their special clothes is so small I bought 10 packs of the monkey king and I got the same 2 grey items from all 10 packs.... like wth???',
       'Yea sure there\'s some bugs, but pros totally outweigh the cons. The game runs beautifully on a good device. Most of the problems that people are having deals with their poor devices. Lol. New gears and new map are just awesome. Best game on mobile and very ambitious for portable. Bravo! Keep those updates coming.',
       'This is the best mobile game that adopt PUBG genre, with good graphics and customizable good controls. A five stars game on normal condition. Unfortunately the game won\'t allow me to login around 10am to 10pm GMT+7. It stuck on the selecting server scene with loading icon spinning endlessly in the center, which I can\'t do anything about it. I can\'t even use any button and I can\'t tap anything. So, three stars it is, until the problem is fixed.' ,

      'One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.',
       'Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn\'t get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.',
       'I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That\'s why if I\'m going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.',
       'Hi Hay Day Creators! I personally love this game, it\'s very relaxing and a nice way to kill time and does not use a lot of data. However I am having issues with watching the trailers to getting free stuff, I have an android operating system and I\'m not the only one having this issue, please fix this.',
       'I love the game but going to give 4 stars because the newspaper should be in color! Please change this. And please give it a tan for mining tools and maps act so it don\'t take up storage space IJS my opinion!',
       'The game is addictive and nice to play. Please consider my suggestions and fix in the next or upcoming releases,  1. Reduce the time in the preparation of the jam machine as it consumes very long time. Else provide another machine  2. When we add something on the queue in the machine, there should be an option to remove the added item on the queue if the particular preparation not started. For example.  Am preparing product 1 in a machine and added 2 more products in the queue, later found that we have incorrect added the 2 more products, an option to delete that.   3. Why the puzzle moves to animal randomly, it\'s taking very long time to unlock an animal on the sanctuary. Hence request you to unlock one animal and then the puzzle goes to another animal.    Thanks.' ,

      'The best racing game ever, I\'ve played this game along time ago. the first version it has 4/5 cars it was so fuuun.That was 5 years ago now I want to play it again.I feel the nostalgia ooohh the good old days.Now I\'m going to install the game.U guys change my life Thank u guys soo much guys. I hope my tears will help u guys. :)',
       'Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it\'s just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............',
       'Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!',
       'At first I wasn\'t sure how good the game was but after playing it several times on Android and Windows 8.1 phone, I like it.  It doesn\'t weigh down on the phone\'s processing power. A very addictive game!! Give it go.',
       'I love it and I\'m addicted to playing it.   I like the fact that you can earn points if you don\'t want to buy them.  It would be great if tilting the phone had an impact.  don\'t change much though, its a great game:)',
       'Yow I had this game on my old phone and I really liked it but could you please add like a mini games  that reward gems but only appears once a day like a daily challenge and each day in a row it gets harder and the reward higher... You know like reach this airtime or travel here or jump this high etc. Etc.' ,

      'I think it\'s a good game but sometimes the ball would go in but then it bounces out you should also add modes, one like there are walls all around and I like the game keep making these addictive games:D also all you guys stop with the adds just turn off your WiFi let them have some money after hard work on many game\'s like would you want to make a game and not get money and just get  ALL YOUR COMMENTS WITH ADDS! ohhh that would be soo annoying.',
       'Ya hate ads? Turn off wifi and play. Stupid phone/gaming noobs. Its a good game and dont hate on it for ads. The ads make the people who made the game MONEY. Give then a break. Let them have money while u watch something u might want. If u wanna turn it off, like i said, turn off wifi.',
       'Fun simple game burdened by a slew of constant advertising. Ads while you play, full screen timed ad when you restart (99.9% of time) and an optional 1 time 30s full screen ad to resume. Simply put too many ads!',
       'Would pay for the game to remove ads. I get you can turn off WiFi/data but it shouldn\'t be necessary, and is unfair to the company itself. Please offer a paid ad-free version!',
       'I genuinely liked the game it was fun and addictive but the ads is what kills it. Ad pop up like almost everytime you lose.. other than that its a grest game. The ads make me want to delete it. I hated giving this game a 1 star..',
       'Fun game but way too many advertisements, which happen to blow through data. I\'ve spent about 1 hour playing the game and have gone through 224mb of cellular data. There is a 30 second ad after every single restart. Even if you goof up and get a score of 10. It\'s horrible. I have to turn off data in order to play the game, and then I can\'t do a 2nd chance. You neeeeeeeed to cool the ads' ,

      'After reaching level 39 my camp game completely erased and I\'m back to level 2. wasted so much time making hearts. .update. I tried to play again. I even have cloud saving my game again. I reached level 30. Suddenly all my dragons are gone. Again. What the hell game! Update: once again  the updated and all my progress is gone. This time om at level 53. I\'m done. The creators don\'t even reply or show that they are listening to the players to come to a solution. I\'m not playing this game again. WASTE OF TIME!',
       'Purchased the 30 day gem subscription. Got the first few days then it stopped. No way to contact support from inside the game, help menu continually crashed. Emailed support from outside the game and received no reply. Hoping Paypal can get my money back. Cute  time wasting game but don\'t spend real money on it.',
       '2018.02.19 update. Game crashes mid level, when reopen game, doesn\'t start in level, have to start over. Chalices lost, recharge time vs level cost ridiculous. Don\'t always get rewards from special events. Customer service completely absent. Have emailed from their website several times with no response. Game is fun, but such a hassle.',
       'To start off, the game itself is fun and addictive. That aside there are some serious problems. The app crashing is very frequent, often causing you to lose progress and purchases. I bought the premium land and my game crashed right after unlocking it, resulting in my loss of the purchase/land. Another issue is that they have absolutely no support staff. If you make a purchase and it doesn\'t go through or if your data is lost, you will NOT be refunded and will NOT have your purchases restored. Invest at your own risk.',
       'Love the idea. Would love to have getting gems be a little bit easier without spending money, watch ads or something for gems, since they are required to complete some quests. Also, mine all of the sudden stopped working. Said the hardware in my phone couldn\'t support it anymore. Same phone. So, now I can also no longer play. Bit bummed about that.',
       'This game is fun and pretty but DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON IT. The game WILL crash and the developers will do nothing to help you. The reviews and the Facebook group are full of people who lost money and have never been helped.   I loved this game until the Jan 16 update made it stop working completely, with no response from the developers. I purchased dragon gems which i did not have a chance to use yet, and if the issue isn\'t fixed soon, I\'ll have to file a refund request with Play Services.' ,

      'This game was great until the most recent update now I dont play as much. Only being able to save 25 cupcakes when before tgere was no limit IS terrible! I\'ve purchased boost to pass a level & several times when I\'ve used them the game freezes so I lose the boost. I contacted customer service got a generic response & no refund but they want me to rate their service ü§î no thanks! I loved the game before but not so much now!!',
       'Would of gave full marks but on a few cooking appliances when I tap on it doesn\'t work. Second I think it would help if you could carry money over from one country to another and convert currency. Some of the levels are hard to achieve and you don\'t earn enough power ups and spoons to help you through the levels plus restore lives take ages. Customer waiting is to quick.',
       'It is a great game and very fun to play but just needs a little more to it. The one thing I can\'t figure out is why do we keep getting coins if we can\'t use them to purchase anything after you get all the upgrades on your ingredients. There should be a use for them or stop giving us coins in the rewards of each day. I wish there more things to buy or if the coins could be transferred to the next level or something. Okay thanks. P.S. I was just enjoying this game until you guys decided to cut my cup cakes down to 25 only so that means I have been saving mine only to know that after I use them up I can only get 25 at a time well that sucks and I hope you change that back if not my time with this game has come to an end.',
       'Was a great,  fun game,  but now with the new Update things will not download.  I\'ve sent emails to them and nothing has change.  I did receive an email back asking to rate their and of course I told them you don\'t want me to rate something I never received!!  Can\'t open game,  this issue has gotten worse!!üò°',
       'I LOVE IT!!  Very addictive & challenging. My only problem is that I accidentally uninstalled it while removing games from my tablet that I no longer play. I had just reached level 50 so now I have to start all over again. Fortunately this is one game I don\'t mind doing that with!!',
       'I hate that we don\'t have unlimited lives.  When I double tap my food goes to the trash.  When it should only do that if its burning or tap on the waste bin. Oh and these new challenges are extremely hard why can\'t we get a tutorial on how to make the food 1st?  Other then that great game and addictive' ,

      'Good game, quite addictive. However, two things: 1) It\'s draining my battery quite a bit when running 2) There\'s no way to quit the game. I can only exit by hitting "home" on my phone. It seems as though the battery drain is preventing my phone from running properly, so now I need to force close the app to ensure I can continue to use my phone properly.  I would like to see this game improve in terms of battery usage,',
       'It\'s a great game, but you\'ve plagued it so badly with ads I\'m guessing in the hopes that people will then willingly spend money on your game.   This isn\'t right in anyway, if you cared more about the people who\'d play this you\'d cut it back immediately. Apologise and then drop it back to $3 for the game for being douches..',
       'You fucked up with to many ads to the point of annoyance. It drains battery life heavily for such a small game. Was fun for the first couple hours, but uninstalling because of these reasons.',
       'This is a terrible game because you ruined it with ads. First it was every 2 hits which almost had me.uninstall within my first 10. Then you let me.hit it once more an gave me.an ad. VULTURES!! A friend showed me this said it was good we are no longer friends that\'s how bad your game is',
       'As nearly every review has pointed out, your game is riddled with ads. A person will quite seriously spend just as much, if not more time watching ads than playing the game itself. Horrible. Uninstaller after 5 minutes as the ad frequency doubled.',
       'Great concept here..... really enjoy the game.... but please please please do something about the ads..... they come up literally every 5 seconds. It is quite maddening. Even if there were ads like every 5 hits or something that would be tolerable. If it weren\'t for the constant ads this game would have easily gotten 5 stars in all aspects...' ,

Game play is ok but progression is slow. I suggest you make the "reasons" section free text so that you can get an accurate assessment for process improvement instead of a BS pre stagged answer.',
       'Honestly i really enjoy the game thus far thank you for all the recent updates niantic... but there is one thing that has been bothering me and that is 1v1 with friends and trading... both features were shown in the original trailer... yet again i love the care your giving the game niantic i truly praise it but i would like to know whats happening with my 2 listed thoughts',
       'The game has been majorly revamped and has benefited from it. It\'s so much better to see that content and events are happening more often. Hopefully we\'ll see the first wave of gen 4 by April or May and a nice egg event will happen to get a higher chance of a baby Pokemon from gen 4. Keep up the great work only downside is legendaries. I can\'t get them as not enough people in my area play Pokemon go and I\'m not travelling for a Pokemon. Can we have a legendary event for one week you can get 3* legendary raids? That would make it easier.',
       'Updated content since the app was launched. Still recommended. Suggestion: After the daylight savings time change, raiding ends too early in the evenings. Setting raids to continue spawning eggs until after 8pm EST at the earliest would be great. Thanks and keep up the hard work.',
       'I love pokemon go and always get pulled back into playing it. I\'m still getting use to the updates after not playing for a while and am disapointed in the gyms. While I love being able to use them like pokestops, I wish to recall my pokeon from the gym. I love I a rural area and my poor Vaporeon has been at a gym for 13 days. THIRTEEN. I want my pokemon to come back please.',
       'Can you please make it so that some Pokemon spon even if you dont go out, I wanna play from home but no Pokemon ever spon . Also can you make it so we can earn coins. I can\'t buy coins but I want to have a chance to earn coins so I can buy things to use. Thanks I love the game though it\'s awesome!' ,

      'I played Game of War for appx 3 years.  The game started out great, everyone was on a somewhat even playing field. The game advanced to quick and left thousands of players behind. Other Players and I felt we could never keep up.  I hope this game advances at much more slower rate.  We all spend money to enjoy the game!    Don\'t be gready like GOW.  Thank you in advance.  Kirk',
       'Overall great game, however to play and be competitive ait is important to spend. In fact just to unlock some features you must spend at least .99 which is fine by me since I love to spend on this game anyways. I have been playing koa from the start and when this game came out I jumped on the bandwagon in the first 50 kingdom servers. So with that said yes it is LOTS of fun, I love my GoG family and definitely addicting LOL see you on the burning war field ;)',
       'It is a fun game and is the most indepth game I\'ve ever played. That all being said, unless you have a ton of money and a lot of time there is no way this game is worth it. I\'ve spend over $100 and play multiple times per day and I still find it hard to level up my estate. Even in an alliance unless they\'re all very high level it isn\'t much help. I\'m sure they\'re are much better games in this genre then Guns of Glory. To me it seems like a game for wealthy people and made by a company to just make money.',
       'What a great game!  Need to have introductory levels for newcomers, though.  You build your kingdom up and larger kingdom\'s just rush in and destroy you.  When you recover, they come right back.  Level into the attack mode, so people will enjoy the game more.  I am uninstalling after 6 weeks of running an Alliance, because it\'s just not worth the trouble.  Great concept, fantastic graphics!',
       'Love this game! Very entertaining, never boring. My only complaint is with some of the collecting events. You have to do certain things to obtain the necessary items to put together, but for some reason with the current one you don\'t get enough of one item, and too much of another. It would be great if you could trade within your alliance for things like this.',
       'It\'s an interesting game of strategy.  You make allies in order for your alliance to grow. At the same time always on your guard knowing at any time your allies can instantly become enemies to prevent you on your way to becoming the strongest alliance in the kingdom. There are new quests to complete weekly. Each with different rewards that help you to achieve power.There are many kingdoms on the map which is great. The only downside is you have to leave one kingdom and join another to enter it and play the game in it. Not sure if you get to keep the same level and strength you achieved. But I\'m sure that the developers will one day have it to where kingdom will be able to attack kingdom and there\'s a lot of kingdoms. The game would definitely become very intense and even more exciting then. It would also become one of the best of the best strategic games there is.' ,

       'Really so sick of this game. They really need to change some things it\'s absolutely ridiculous how some people spend a lot of their OWN money buying coins and spins for this game for someone to go right behind you and take almost every coin you have before you even got to spend them after you just spent $25 Of your actually money. So done playing this is ridiculous I should have never spent real money on this game anyways so it\'s my own fault but I mean COME ON NOW...',

      'I kind of enjoy the game but would like it more if there were cheaper options to buying. After you buy some the prices jump to 99.99 and have yet to see cheaper prices. I\'m not unloading that in one go. The people of this game would probably make more money if they bring cheaper prices. I would buy several different little packs that eventually add up to 100 bit you ain\'t getting nothing otherwise. Also wish you could buy more things with the gold you purchased. Like have a choice to spend loyalty or gold',
       'When it\'s not crashing, it\'s fun to play.  Sucks when it doesn\'t load of locks up during game play.  Also it gets expensive as you have to buy packs at $99 a pop after the 1st 2.  The game play is addicting, but no fun if you cannot afford the special offers they continue to throw in your face every time you log in.  I love final fantasy games but this particular one is a money pit!.  Not to mention the constant crashing',
       'I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.',
       'This game has potential to be fun but it\'s completely ruined because IT\'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don\'t get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it\'s full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it\'s a complete money bucket!',
       'This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.',
       'The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it\'s free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15' ,

       'Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won\'t reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.',
       'The game starts off good in the first couple levels. But once you start getting to the faster cars, it becomes way harder to keep up with the cars PR points, to get to better races. Unless you spend real money to get the parts. One question I do have. Is about the blackridge rivals. Why put some one with a car at a way higher level against a person who\'s car isn\'t even close to the car at a high level, and one more thing... make the races longer. 20 seconds a race isn\'t fun at all. Thinking with the name "Need For Speed". You guys would of done a lot better. The only thing that I seem to like are the  graphics... But that\'s about it...',
       'Goog game, adddictive infact. But I don\'t understand the concept of PATANJALI adds. Whenever i choose to see adds to reduce the waiting time, you comeup with Patanjali adds of 10 and 20 seconds and the irritating part is the time doesn\'t gets reduced even after watching the whole add. Please fix this. When you say reduce wait time by watching add, you need to actually reduce the waiting time after the add instead of insisting to watch the add again and again.',
       'When I started playing this game I really enjoyed it. But now I realise that in order to progress, you MUST spend REAL money. I am a family man, with a wife and 6 children, I just wanted a game that I could play when kids are in bed and wife is in bath, I don\'t have cash to spend on games, the worst thing is the 7 Day events, you cannot beat them without spending money. Very disappointed. Good game but don\'t expect to progress very far if you don\'t want to spend money.',
       'The game is undoubtedly based on a pay-to-play foundation. Car Series is virtually impossible without spending money. Even with pulling all nighters, spending over 1000 gold, and not wasting a single ticket, I couldn\'t make the PR requirement for the final race of blackridge rumble. 7 days of suffering to get 40 blueprints.' ,

      'I really like the game, but as soon as I played multiplayer my phone crashes. I know it\'s not my phone itself but the program because my phone never crashes to anything. Please fix the multiplayer mode! It\'s really nice but constantly crashes!!! Only because of that, I\'m giveng it one star. As soon as it\'s fixed I\'ll be sure to give it 5 star and share it with my friends.',
       '1. The online mode isn\'t letting join a match 2. There should be special moves, like when you fall down, if you press the slide button, you won\'t lose speed (like in Mirrors edge) 3. The courses/levels are too easy, make it more harder',
       'The game is good. I like this game because of the fact it\'s parkour. The fact I don\'t have a life means I can take time on the game,the graphics are great I can clearly see what and how I\'m doing. So the game play is good. I know what controls to use, what to do, and it\'s a good. But I can\'t get over the fact that there is not a lot of color. There is only red and black. So I think they should be color.  Good game otherwise',
       'The game is amazing, just the online part, not that it crashes it\'s just people leaving the game, such as disconnecting when I\'m ahead. Can you add a system to where you can\'t leave a game even when you close the game. It will be great for people to stop rage quitting when I have a good lead.',
       'So I turned on the game and I did some steps, maybe 30 passed and I laughed, I turned it off and I uninstalled it.  It is without a doubt hilarious.',

      'Is game could be so much more than it is! After a few weeks, PVP becomes a joke when you are up against paying users who have one shot kill guns and a barrage of armour.  Then single player is just rinse and repeat over and over again.',
       'Still full of annoying bugs. The worst game I ever played. Earnings are exactly layed out so that you can\'t level up as you should and in a way that you should spend a lot of money... üëé Graphic & other bugs, really not fluid etc. üëé Full of annoying ads üëé Some can shoot through walls; but you can\'t. Some can see you behind walls, but you can\'t. Starting pvp, you get placed on the map with the back to the others. Your oponents have 10x stronger weapons... Fairplay üëé Nothing is balanced fairly in pvp üëé',
       'The latest version is so annoying. On the sniper arena, my men get killed immidiatly at the end of the countdown to begin. If i even shoot any sniper he wont die rather it will finish it shoutout and then turn to my soldier and kill it. I hate now i hate d game. Please do something about it.',
       'The game is fun. The campaign is very grind worthy. And the PVP is nothing but pay to win. Every match there is at least one person with the 100$ sniper. The Dimond currency if extremely slow so if u wanted to buy the best sniper u would have to level 4,000 levels. Overall the game is fun if u don\'t mind committing hours of game play for little reward. If it wasn\'t so heavy with pay to win I would rate it higher',
       'Good graphics but the character movements are clunky.  I\'m a hardcore FPS gamer and I like to test the limitations of a game.  So tried shooting a shoulder and the bullet went for a headshot instead whereas I clearly know my aim would miss. Glitchy.  Clunky and not so realistic unfortunately.  So not sure why the high ratings.',
       'The basic concept of the game is fun, but like all games these days, micro transactions are rammed down your throat. I would be fine if that was all but then they time gate you with the weapon upgrades you need for missions and lock content out for you unless you\'ve paid for a better level of gun. Avoid this one.' ,

      'The game is fun, but results take 2 and 3 days and if other people are on higher levels they have access to better tableware and vases, pictures etc, so their rooms stand out more and they have a better chance at getting 5 stars. And some items I\'ve purchased don\'t work it gives a message saying they couldn\'t find it in the warehouse. But the game never gave me my gems back and of money. NEED TO FIX IT',
       'I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.',
       'Entertaining, enjoyable and inspiring! Brings out  your creativity in utilizing your available resources and in maximizing your limited funds. The game makes you travel around the globe.  Hope to seeing homes from less popular countries. Sad to note that there are times that free diamonds don\'t add up after watching the videos and there are items not found in the warehouse.',
       'I really love this game! It surely brings out my passion in interior designing, nourish my mind as i see others works, getting inspired also to continue want i really love in life, which is designing/art. And it does help me to chill or relax whenever im depressed bcoz it makes me think what to design, and helps me get out of the stress that life brings. It indeed help me with my mental and emotional instability. 5 stars for this! Number 1 app for me. Never failed my expectations. LOVE IT!',
       'I love this game!! "it helps a lot" with my shopping addiction because I feel like I\'m buying real merchandise. I really enjoy the updates and how you guys added more room to be designed!!!! Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))',
       'I thoroughly enjoy playing this game.  It\'s well made and no technical issues. 2 problems I have is 1) you can\'t sort the items by price and 2) and this one is a big one you can only use an item you purchase 5 times.  That\'s it.  I bought more diamonds so I could purchase more inventory so if you\'re taking my real cash you should let me keep the item in my inventory.  That really turned me off so I definitely will not be purchasing any more diamonds until that changes.' ,

      'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn\'t one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you\'re better at making farm and army games. Please make more of thoseüòñ',
       'This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own üí∞. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.',
       'What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I\'m in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can\'t push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something',
       'Really a awsome  addictive  game.. but its not a fair play..  It  offered me only one  legendary card as I am playing from the beginning.  In the other hand one of my friend started playing just 4 months ago but he owned 5 legendary cards. one from the crown chest, another from the legendary chest and recently he got another one in the super magical chest. Now you decide. Is it a fair play?.  Really Disappointed üëé. And on the other hand it is pay to win game.. In some cases skill doesn\'t work .' ,

      'Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn\'t respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I\'m willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.',
       'I\'ve noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don\'t think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying.',

       'Definitely a fun short game. No real incentives to keep on playing though. The eye candy is not good enough and the music is repetitive.  Needs something more than the simple leveling system and the music either needs to be in beat with the obstacles or have more variety.' ,

But this game suffers with the same problem of other LEGO games: why there\'s no cloud saving? Why can\'t you use Google Play or Facebook to keep our progress? I just can\'t understand.',

      'Best color by number pixel art I have played. Beautiful art, reasonable controls (would be better if you could click and drag without pressing and holding first, but the only one that does that has such awful art that it doesn\'t matter), it\'s fun. Thanks for making this.',
       'I love the gameplay, graphics and controls and this is just so relaxing to play! I love this compared to other sandbox games because of the controls are way better! Also when you take a pic and colour it in can you have a palette so you can colour it in different colours to the image that would be great if you could kinda edit photos by using different colours.',
       'Amazing! The only problem is that I might accidentally touch a number I already coloured and undo it. To fix this problem I suggest you make it so if you have completed a number it cannot be changed.',
       'I think that this is a good way for people in high school and middle school to relax and be stress free. My daughter has been using this app since 7th grade and now is a junior in high-school. She suggested that I try it because I am always stressed after work. I did. I love who ever created this game and a BIG THANKS FOR THIS GAME',

      'PLEASE READ: This game is great I love it though I would rate it better if you were not so money hungry. This game is a pay to win but nearly every time you get a big update the weapons you have become really bad and you loose a lot more matches. Coins are cool to have but the weapons u need to win matches always cost gems and gems are too hard to get for free. Increasing the chance of gems would be a bit better because what fun do people have if everything good costs real money and you lose every match',
       'I love it!!! Every problem I faced is finally fixed! Can you make the Mega Destroyer a bit more powerful for the players who managed to get it before it was removed? I like the re-skins of the weapons. But can you search up a weapon that\'s in real life, add a skin to it, and then add it into Pixel Gun? Make the graphics more realistic. (Not Too Realistic)',
       'Its Great You Can Rent Guns you dont have yet and u can earn diamonds but there a problem. Every time i use the chest i never get a gun so can u increase the luck system? I love this game and its awesome my freind got it for me',
       'This game would be more fun if 1. Did not die every 2 seconds 2. Fight with people my level, not 20 levels higher 3. Everyone else survives for way longer with nothing while I die every 2 seconds with golden armour 4. To not get shot from nothing 5. actually get rewarded for playing, win a really hard round of arena? Here\'s one coin! 6. Actually getting rewarded with leveling up 7. Actually getting rewarded for playing 8. Being able to buy coins with gems, and being able to buy gems with coins 9. Being able to buy stuff with in-game currency, not real money, like I said in 8  There you go! Please take it into consideration, or at least understand Thank you Edit: and if you think that\'s done, no, you get oneshotted WITH FULL MAX LEVEL ARMOR AND MAX HEALTH. WHY, JUST WHY',
       'Absolutely wonderful, great graphics, good range of skins, nice selection of modes and maps and epic items!! it\'s awesome and a great game to enjoy. But abit of lag... I\'d rate 5 ‚õ§s if the controls were less laggy other then that its a marvelous game',
       'This is an amazing game! I love the pixel graphics and the variety of wepeons that you can choose is outstanding. However they\'re is some bugs that you must fix. Sometimes when I battle against players my the app crashes. And when I load the game back, it says penalty for leaving match, then I loose trophies. Overall, comparing to other games, when you leave a match u don\'t loose exp, grids etc. But this game you do loose trophies. So pls get rid of the lost of trophies.  Also one question. Is there a computer version of this game. Thx for taking the time to read my opinion.' ,

I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!',
       'Amazing game... Loved it...üòç The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it\'ll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it\'s okay üòä',
       'It\'s an amazing game. Sure I run around my bedroom screening every time I fail next to the end.... but there is something about this game that makes you happy. Is it the music? Maybe. Is it the back ground and the way it moves?possibly. It\'s all of those things plus more   In a nut shell I really really really really really really really really really love this game :p',
       'Good songs. That\'s about it. The hitbox detection and lag spikes are horrific, the checkpoint system is a blatant cash grab, and what annoys the most is that the timing of music+taps (the core mechanic of the game) is completely broken. It is significantly easier to play the game with audio off, so that you don\'t get distracted by the miss timed turns. Doesn\'t even fulfill it\'s most basic selling point. Atrocious.',
       'This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn\'t as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn\'t there but now it\'s forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.',
       'The gameplay is unique, but one thing I notice that is so hard to get the highest level as we totaly have no idea about the beat from music while we play it. Need to play the same level on and on until I become familiar with every single beat from it. Anyway, use your best headphone. They come with so much beautiful musics you\'ll ever heard' ,

      'Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I\'m 32 and play this often so it\'s not just for kids . Give it a try it\'s very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen üòâ',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.',
       'Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can\'t do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!',
       'I love this game, its very challenging. The only thing I don\'t like is that your aquariums end up way overcrowded with stuff before you can move to the next aquarium. Of course you can move on to the next one as soon as its unlocked, but I won\'t move on until I have all 3 stars. So honestly, I guess this is just my issue. I probably should have given it 5 stars, because my issue is the only reason I didn\'t.',
       'So far I like it. But not on a very high level well see how this progresses. Well now I\'m on a level that I keep losing  by one  or ten mainly bcuz all the graphics  are stationed in the exact space so. And while it\'s true u don\'t need WiFi to play u do need it for ur daily prize which u really need.',
       'Oh this is so cute! Other match games don\'t give such a reward - it\'s like playing a decorating game also! It would be very helpful to grey out or list the items & fish already purchased. It\'s easy to duplicate items which wastes coins earned & doesn\'t count towards trophy challenges. I don\'t like the bomb boosters on the right as I\'ve accidentally used them when not needed. I haven\'t spent any real money on this game. I just keep retrying the level. I\'m on level 644. Lots to go yet!' ,

      'Good game however, once you\'ve taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world\'s and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.',
       'Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.',
       'Very simple. Gives me a lot of nostalgia. Two things though, it seriously needs music maybe some Celtic tunes or shanties. And secondly it needs more stuff to do. When I first saw a whale I was excited about doing some whaling but nope. The whales do absolutely nothing. Maybe even some treasure hunting puzzles or something. Good game just needs a little more content.',
       'Awesome game! Two things: please do something about the controls, they feel very poor quality. Even addig a left and a right arrow would be more comfortable for me.. Second is content. This game is huuuuge. But I\'m so addicted I managed to conquer all the islands by now, so I really want more challenges. Thanks for the awesome game, keep up the good work!',
       'Amazing game, graphics, and animations. My one wish is for an actual circle pad for movement because I have quite large fingers and I can\'t see what I\'m doing/ what\'s going on. Also would like maybe different routes to go on with boats: better damage but lower turning, faster but less health etc...',
       'This game together with Clash Of Clans are the best games I have ever played. It\'s addictive and fun but there\'s a lack of content. I completed the game and I don\'t know what to do now. I would really love it have my progress saved in the cloud and have more content added to the game. This game has perennial!' ,

It is too long a slog to get any lvls or resources to be build your castle to any lvl to have any sort of fun. Takes to long and not worth it. Better faster ones out there without the ganking on earlier lvls. Avoid like plague unless you like paying to get ganked by others all the time !!!! They only way to get ahead is to pay and then you still get ganked !!!!',

       'What is wrong with this app,, I\'ve had it for over two years now and never had a problem, for the last few weeks it\'s freezing, closes and not to mention the fake virus that constantly pops up and won\'t go away no matter what I do, even though I have anti virus, I even uninstalled talking Tom (virus was gone too) I then reinstall a week later and even the virus came back with it. It\'s very upsetting since I loved this game????!',
       'Okay heres the thing,every f game is with money and this game was so much better without those money,i was 1000 lvl and my tom is gone why? Cuz u didnt made that feature back in the days,also u made this stupid diamonds alll for money,and not coins like it was...its not all about money get it? This game was so popularbback in the days and now is trash with all those videos to watch all those money you need to spend on clothes for tom...its ridiculus...sry for my english im just disapointed cuz u turned this game in real money not coins where you can be able to buy everything by playing like i did....',
       'I like this game very much. I have played this game from 2,3 years but I don\'t the recent update of this game in which the premium galactic and royal fittings beddings, clothings are brought by diamonds which I don\'t like. Before this update these things are brought by coins and now these are brought by diamonds which I hate it and give it 4 stars.',

      'It was really bad the control\'s were very slow. Animals and mobs were very glitchy. If you want something simalur to Minecraft the closest thing is crafting and building you can even go on cools servers and stuff and it\'s almost just like mcpe. This game needs a lot of work and it should still be in beta.',
       'The game loaded just fine but the controls are weird and there are SO many ads.. Wouldn\'t recommend unless you\'re just really bored and don\'t mind having ads ever 3 seconds:)',
       'Okay, Okay, Stop worrying about the ads. I must tell you that... This is not Minecraft, It\'s Dumbcraft. The reason is is that you can NOT activate Redstone (Bluestone) stuff cause preserplates, Buttons, and Levers don\'t activate and all you do is hit a thing. So don\'t download this.',
       'there are way to many adds there are so many I didn\'t even have time to load a game it i sutpid! I do not think you should play this game!',
       'It\'s ok, I hate the ads AND HOW DO YOU FREAKING GET THINGS OUT OF INVENTORY!!',
       'This game would not load i just sat there for 5 mins and nothing happened. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME ITS HORRIBLE.' ,

      'I think that we should get more  coins for winning the levels. I find that the game can cost me money that I don\'t have, so I will spend less time playing your game. I love this game alot but why play if you are not getting enjoyment because it costs to much to play. (Otherwise I love the game) I also never got my horse, please give me my horse, I really need that horse btw. I already had a name for her to. I was going to call her daisy. The name goes great with the garden theme. (If you hadnt realized thst already) Please please send me daisy, I love her already. Peace.',
       'It was a lot of fun the first few "days" but got very hard very fast. Don\'t bother with power-ups as it doesn\'t really make a difference. The only way to win is to get lucky with a big bomb. That\'s it. It\'s a shame because the game is nice, I just progress way too slowly now for it to be worth playing.',
       'I enjoy playing this game but I think 900 coins is crazy for 5 extra lives. There are other games I play that offer less coins and a boost for a smaller price. On one game I play it\'s 65 coins for 10 extra moves and a boost, on a different one it\'s 25 coins for 5 extra moves. I also think that stars for each level should vary too. For harder levels it should be 3 stars, for medium levels it should be 2 stars, and for easy levels 1 star. I\'ll continue to play no matter what, it\'s fun, challenging and strategical!',
       'The first thing that comes to mind is that you guys have gone above and beyond on this one!! It\'s so much fun!! From the interactions of restoring the grounds, to decorating them (custom, might I add !!)    To the actual sounds the game makes while playing.. I can\'t stay off of it. And yes I\'m constantly tempted to purchase coins when I can\'t beat a level, for like the 7th time!!  Haha üòÇ Great game guys!! We would ALL appreciate more gifts than currently available. Especially for your daily addicts, üòÅ Forever a gamer.     Xx',
       'I rly enjoy this game the only 2 dwn falls it has.. is it only let\'s u spin the wheel every other day and when you get a free life.. it won\'t let you use it. It says ur lives are full. so you never get it also i wish it gave u more than 5 lives im on level 244',
       'Loving it.  Reached level 370, and am really enjoying the game. Fun, good graphics, good story. Nice balance of challenging levels and easier ones, but so far no levels that look impossible. On the negative side, 900 hard won coins for 5 extra moves is ridiculous. When replaying a level it would be nice if you could go straight to the game play without the screen telling you what you need, we already know.' ,

      'This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don\'t worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you\'ll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!',
       'I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who\'s better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn\'t seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don\'t think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.',
       'I\'m in love with this game. It\'s challenging, you don\'t have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks.',
       'This game has no WORLD\'S favourite song  DESPACITO  SO i m hating it tooooo much  when i see this then i think that let\'s download it bcoz it contains despacito song also but when i see all album of this app then i started hated it. So i would request from CHEETAH GAMES that plezz add DESPACITO SONG also in it This is my humble request from CHEETAH GAMES.',
       'TOTAL GARBAGE!!!!  (MY Rating: -100)  Songs constantly skip and stall out or both at once. I sent numerous emails report it but never heard back. It\'s ridiculous that the music skips between 54 to 100 times in one single song. Will never waste my time on this game again unless it gets fixed sooner rather than later.',
       'This game is honestly a great time-killer and even has it\'s challenging parts, but from what I\'ve noticed as you get to the higher tier songs they just get slower and slower and are just flat with barely any challenge. I expected more of a challenge with a higher level but now this game is getting horribly boring.' ,

      'This is by far the best chess "trainer" for me.  It\'s got a nice flow and the game isn\'t "stupid" like most other chess apps/games I\'ve played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I\'m making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.',
       'I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn\'t show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.',
       'For the non experts, let me tell you that 5his game cheats. I sat with a real chessboard to analyse why wasn\'t I  able to crack master level.   And what i observed was it didn\'t allow you to make actual moves when you show high levels of intell8gence. Sometimes it makes moves which are faulty. I think there is some mistakes in coding, perhaps deliberately made.  So not a fair play but a foul play.',
       'it\'s just a chess game yea, but it actually looks nice for a change. most chess games are really boring because all they have are symbols and very rarely, possibly sound. when you think it\'s boring that means you don\'t like chess, but not the app. what do you expect? guns and explosions? didn\'t think so.',
       'So far it\'s o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It\'s not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game',
       'The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.' ,

      'Ever wanted to be Mayor? Ever wanted to run a town, develop the land, and see a metropolis grow? Well, look no further than Animal Crossing cuz this game does none of those things. You just merge buildings into better buildings. It is fun, if you spend money so that you\'re not bombarded with ads. But then you run the risk of being unable to watch ads when you want to to do things like double your earnings or unlock a better building from the mystery box.',
       'I like merging games, but this one has a huge ad issue that makes the game somewhat frustraiting to play. I\'ll click the store to buy a house and it will auto start an ad video. It\'s lacking a bit in the story line department too. For a base merging game it\'s simple and fun, but definitely needs some work.',
       'Such a terrible money grab. Ads cinsta tly pop up, making a consistent method for progressing impossible (which was most likely the goal). Didn\'t have patience to get very far, I feel like I\'ve wasted my time in the 5 minutes I played. Greedy devs forcing quality content behind a paywall making the game virtually unplayable for free. Terrible job.',
       'When opening the game it loads fine Nd does its idle thing, but I can\'t tap on anything. Completely 100%unrespomsive. After multiple attempts. Will change rating if game becomes playable before I forget about this review.',
       'The game just gets exponantially harder without any sense of progression and the worst prestige system ever. Didn\'t mind spending 2$ to remove overextensive AD use. They try to sell you lvl ups for base chest that are useless. You still need 256 boxes for the next building and 512 for the next evolution. Still grinding? To bad now its 1024 boxes',

      'I like this game, I really do. It is intense and fun, but the ads are a little too intrusive, if I connect to a game and the players disconnects before the map starts - you get an ad. I do understand that the game is free and all and I want the game to have ads to support the game, but this game has the most ads of any other game I know, so please atleast have a limit to the ads shown a day or have it shown every 2 games. Also I think it would be cool to have an option to watch a couple of ads to get a club ticket or have it to speed up the 24 hour cool down on the club arenas. Overall this game is really fun and I hope Ninja Kiwi keeps improving it.',
       'The only thing I do not like is how you need the vip membership to use the special modes, which I get you guys need money to keep it going but I think like one day a week there it should he free for that day or and hour or two. Keep up the good work Ninja Kiwi üòä',
       'The ads are ever increasing, I don\'t pay for games and being forced more and more is a deterrent to continue playing. Turn it down a notch.... edit to developer reply...that doesn\'t explain why more and more ads are popping up. What was wrong with it before?  Getting greedy with get you nowhere.',
       'It\'s a fun game, great for passing the time. That being said it suffers some very problematic connection issues, if I tab away for even half a second it disconnects me and causes and auto loss',
       'I thought it was a really good game and very addictive. I wish that instead of you losing when you\'re connection is down the game should carry on until you join again. I\'ve lost loads of battle\'s that where going really well then lose connection and it won\'t reconnect so I get a loss. Also there are loads of ads.',
       'Ranking system is horrible,  to many game options make matching a hassle.  Defence mode is to hard to play even though its made to be like single player, very discouraging.  Then when you get into it the game it crashes.  This happens frequently, very upsetting I don\'t know how this game has a 4.4 star rating.  It also throws ads at you randomly as well as has pay to win with  the ability to buy metals.  One or the other please.  Not made for the player at all.' ,

      'It\'s double the fun with TWO brand new maps available in all game modes now! Go with the flow on Riverside or head to the hills on Mountain Pass! Not only that, Club Members can shoot for the stars on an additional exclusive map: Space Station.',
       'You can now also add some extra depth to your tournaments in the new Best of 3 mode.' ,

       'It\'s awesome very addictive, my game likes to freeze or glitch sometimes and I crash or die but it\'s a free game so not overly concerned about it. Overall great game when they game out with the sequel it addressed the main problem with this one mainly no other maps and you have to pay to get the female character',
       'I think this  game is so interesting  that I play it all day , and somtimes  it tell you that you  should  never ever  steal any thing  from a dangerous  place where nobody  is there, it is really  difficult.  Good luck  and be  safe',
       'It\'s a great game to spend time playing on but I would like the controls to change, their to annoying when I jump I die and am like WOAH... I JUMPED, THOUGH!!! otherwise. Great game.',
       'The game is cool but there\'s a few things that have gone wrong because when my 10 and 5 year old grandchildren  play they say when we try to jump it won\'t let us so it would mean a lot if you changed it a bit',
       'I did it I mean I get my high score and then I died makes no sense right snow total stands but not mad at this game because like I can definitely not beat it it\'s like a fun and active game I would give it like a 5 of I didn\'t die like the heck' ,

      'First of all It\'s joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add "Edit and changing names"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all üé±',
       'I realize y\'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don\'t pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I\'m pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It\'s a pretty good app and I\'ve sent many people to download your app.',
       'Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don\'t decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don\'t mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don\'t actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.',
       '8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don\'t win any games until those coins are over and I\'m only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don\'t know why this is happening but it sucks because it\'s putting me off the game.. it\'s like 8 ball is making sure I\'m losing hence the rate 3',
       'This is the most addictive game i have playing since a bought this phone. All the new updates are cool. Need to get rid of those hackers playin along. Also when we get a phonecall the game reopens, its better if you  reconnect it during the tier its self .. very plesent game give lots of happiness.. make sure you work with above mentioned glitches, then 5* is sure.',
       'I love this game an it is def super fun. Only complaint I have has nothing to do with the actual game play tho. When ever I try to get free coins from doing offers like surveys even tho I do everything it ask in order to get the coins it ends up never giving me the coins even after I do everything it says... plz fix this problem. Or reward me with the coins I never got from completing certain offers.other than that I love the game.' ,

      'I truly enjoy this game. There is a learning curve at the beginning if you\'re going to have a successful mission. However, soon enough you\'ll be traveling the Stars. This game is challenging enough to keep you interested. You are solely in control of all of your missions, which I like because I don\'t feel like I\'m forced to jump through hoops to get to the next level. Very well designed. Now for the real reason why I\'m sending this review... Designers, please move the engine ignition button away from the acceleration bar. Too many accidental engine ignitions while trying to adjust engine power.',
       'Awesome work with this new updates.  I have an idea. Maybe you\'ve already thought of it.  Multiple engines under the same fuel tank.  For instance, I\'m trying to reenact the Falcon Heavy, but because you can only put one engine under each fuel tank, I had to put several boosters to reach the required thrust/weight ratio.  If we could put multiple engines under a single fuel tank, I wouldn\'t need more boosters.  Maybe, something for the future.',
       'I replayed the game, and also thanks for replying on my other review, but I noticed a lack of, understanding. As I said, it\'s very realistic and challenging, and also that I would really like to be able to send pieces of a space station into space and connect them there, which I\'m happy with now that it\'s possible now. One thing I would really, really, really love and that would help many many people is a hands on tutorial. Like a demo mission(or multiple missions) that teaches how to play the game properly. It may be difficult, but it would just be awesome because me and many other people are hands on learners rather than visual learners. Keep up the good work!',
       'Ok I like the Game game. It has a neat build system. But you don\'t have a way to see current weight, you should have upgrades to unlock as you go farther in space and for reaching planets. I suck at the launch I\'ll be honest. Maybe add in a guidance system. Otherwise keep up the work and add in more planets I want to see Jupiter or land on a comet. Oh add comets too.',
       'Seriously one of the best games I\'ve ever played. It\'s just so addictive.  However, I am currently working on trying to land a rocket on a platform in the earth\'s orbit and I find it almost impossible. Can you make something that let us target another rocket and calculates the transfer window for us (much like the target system for a planet that you currently have).  Would be nice if that can happen. Anyway, here\'s a five star for the great work!',
       'O.M.G. This is the most beautiful, awe inspiring app I have ever used. I feel like I am living out the history of space exploration! I did two sub-orbital shots, then orbital. I did the three orbits of Col Glenn... ran out of fuel! Aerobraked home after a total of 8 orbits. The coolest game ever! (One thing, I think there\'s a scale factor error somewhere. Orbit periods are about ten times to quick, given your stated velocity. Also mission report says you went to 15km when you went to 150km.)' ,

      'The game itself is very well thought of, highly addictive and is a great time killer. Plus, there are almost no ads in this game. However, there are just too many animations. It\'s almost impossible to play this hame st a consistent frame rate. Maybe add an ability to downscale the resolution or tone down the animations?  Edit: after the new update they fixed it. The game runs buttery smooth',

       'This game is very addictive but it just seems like an ad watching game. All the company cares about is money so they spam ads on to the game. Why play mini games for Golden Apples when you could just watch ads for Golden Apples since they let you watch infinite ads. Why play Classic, Zen or Arcade for Starfruit when you could just watch ads.',

But once you have been playing it for bit you get board or at least I do.and to the creators of this game to make it less boring you could put levels or different modes in it or add more  shapes. Please reply or just update. Thank you.',
       'Your English is so bad it is insulting.    You need to hire someone to proof read before you post requests for ratings.  A definite turn off to the game which is actually quite fun and challenging.    Requires strategic planning.',
       'The app is fun but it needs a no ads option for purchase. Also if the game is muted the ads should be auto muted as well. Currently the play at full volume whether the game is muted or not. It\'s very frustrating.',
       'My four year old likes it and I feel like it helps him on making decisions. I can actually see him thinking what going to be him next move. I like this game and I love playing with my son. Only thing I hate is that it does have to many ads üòí',
       'Great game to pass time. Adverts are frustrating but necessary unless you want to pay to stop, BUT very annoying when they pop up as you just lifted a puzzle piece and because of advert it just drops randomly. Also being able to rotate pieces would be handy, granted not as challenging however.',
       'Game is good when they ask you for the rate they say "Our God we are begging you for a rate" or for  "help " sorry but I will not play this game I am not there God and I refuse to be called their God. It has glitches wear it just freezes up in the middle of the game or it just randomly puts your block somewhere because it freezes up and wherever it freezes up at his where it\'s at' ,

The entire screen goes black after playing the game for 5-6 minutes. That\'s pretty irritating not to mention how much slower the phone gets as well. Didn\'t have these issues with the last update. Fix it please!',
       'The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen',
       'RSYFJH Great game very addictive, and I don\'t know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, üòí you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats\'s kind of ridiculous. That\'s the only bad thing I have to say about this game.',
       'This game is very nice and the best game I have ever played. If you have a chance to download this game dont let this chance to pass by. I prefer you to download this game. In this game you have a small place to decorate but there is more place which you have to buy. There is a guide in this game called Ernie who has the most beautiful town ever. You can visit his town any time you like and also make friends with anyone else. Me and my all sisters ( I dont have a brother )play this all day long and have much fun. This is the best game ever.',
       'This game is sooooo addictive,  it\'s like 4get cooking,  cleaning once you start it\'s hard to stop lol.  Lots of fun races,  prizes,  co-ops to help each other & make friends and have a great time.  But be forwarned this game can cause you to lose track of time.  Oh I will play for couple hours & next thing you know it\'s 1 am lol.  Hmmm few more mins bam it\'s 4 am.',
       'I love this game! It is very addicting. The details and graphics are outstanding. The only thing I don\'t like is how long  it takes to accumulate coins and cash, the videos to earn coins and cash are glitchy most of the time and don\'t work. The factories are expensive once you get to higher levels and are hard to buy due to how many coins it cost. Overall, this is one of my favorite games hands down!' ,

      'Great, addictive game! However, real fast, I was wondering how the free box worked. I always hope for something real good but ALWAYS end up with either raw materials or ONE coin. Now don\'t get me wrong, I LOVE getting free stuff, it just seems like the "spinner" purposefully chooses raw materials. Like, it\'s not random like it seems; it never chooses anything close to a weapon! In any case, I cannot play this game enough, very very fun!',
       'Honestly ive been waiting for close to 2 months. This game was like crack for me until the update left me no nice place, no hard earned stuff. I dont mind starting from the bottom again but at least give me some perks. This game is worth every cent and time. But until i get my account back or my stuff back im leaving 2 stars when really this game should be 5 stars all the time. I wont be playing this game til then. Thanks for the good times.',
       'The game doesn\'t load!!! 1.) There\'s nothing wrong with my internet connection! I don\'t have any problems playing RIFT, LOTRO, Neverwinter, Aura Kingdom, Allods Online, etc. or any of my other Google Play apps on my internet connection! 2.) Using Task Manager doesn\'t work! 3.) My device has way more than 200 MB of free space on it! 4.) I haven\'t been able to play for 14 days now!!! 5.) Jurassic Survival looks more promising since there are no loading problems!!!! >:(',
       '**UPDATE** Was an awesome game. Could use a few more perks (ie. Weapons and hard to get items) in drop boxes and yellow zones.Now the down side is if you die in a level your last position is no longer there to try and recoup some of your items. Players killing you as you open trunks in inventory screen. With that I think I am done with this game. Oh ya and the free spin box...give random prizes instead of coins and rope. People will get really into it if perks are awesome.',
       'I love the game. It\'s awesome. But I do have a few questions. Why are the bunker cards so extremely difficult to find? I\'ve been looking for days killing every zombie possible and looking through every crate without finding the cards. Also. Why isn\'t there a disclaimer that says if you die in the game, everything you purchased will be lost? I think that would be extremely necessary so no one over spends their money. Other than that, absolutely smooth running, fantastic graphics, and realistic deaths. I love every aspect except I can\'t find these darn bunker key cards.',
       'Absolute love the game and would\'ve gave a better review but version 1.7.6 and 1.7.7 won\'t work. It keeps saying "connection lost... It seems you lost connection to one of our game servers. Restart the game to proceed" over and over again ever since the 1.7.6 game update. If they fix it I will be updating my review to 5 stars because it is one of my favorite games' ,

      'This is an awesome game that gives you daily and weekly quest\'s and offers treasure chests. Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven\'t tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.',
       'Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a "slide," I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don\'t compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.',
       'I love all the graphics it\'s a bit like the        piano tiles it test\'s your fast skills but except it is temple run 2 love it. Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.',
       'I love this game, very addicting. And I love that it has the daily, weekly and global challenges. As well as objectives and the daily chest challenges. Lots of things to work for and win. Makes the game more fun. Plus, so far, I haven\'t come across anything that I\'ve had to spend money on in order to advance in the game',
       'All I want Imangi is a reset button,  the ability to start from scratch... Your original allows me to do this when I uninstall and reinstall. Been there,  done that,  would like to do so again but all my collected junk follows me',
       'I have been.playing this game and won valentine and Chinese new year run but main problem is same glitches as in old temple run the score 24,000 suddenly becomes 4000 and then to open new map destinations you need 500 diamonds so it\'s quite glitchy and unrealistic' ,

      'The heroes should be for all players from the lower level. They can make their own choice to choose the hero or switch them. If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy? It\'s the strategy game, not for only the big or strong players. Thanks!!...',
       'Coc is on the first place in my games list. It is very addictive and enjoyable. I am looking forward till the day town hall 12 comes. I am not much happy with SUPERCELL ID thing. Because it is not much easy to use. I recommend using the normal GOOGLE PLAY sign in method because it is much more appropriate for me. Overall COC have become my life. I also recoomend to have a time limit for coc, like coc automatically switch off if the user plays coc more than 1 hour. Long Live COC!',
       'Awesome strategic game, love it. But I have one request to Clash of clans creators that pls update clan castle of coc village that there would be an option that how much treasury do you want to Transfer to your storage. I think all coc players would be love this option and it would be great idea because you can transfer required amount of treasury to your storage and the rest of it will remains safe in clan Castel. If you like this idea and will work on it then pls reply me. I would be thankful to all Coc creators if that happens.. üòä',
       'NICE GAME, NICE GRAPHICS,NICE GAMEPLAY.. Been Playing Since 2015 and I See A Lot Of Changes..  I Wish new content would Be Added More Frequently and I HOPE The Village must Have Village Houses! Cause A Village Is Not A Village Wihout Houses SUPERCELL. There should be houses that has different colors and traits, some which raises stats of barbs and valks, or reduces time to produce troops and spells like in Builder Base,there should be houses which raises defense or offense and houses which reduces building production. This May Give Clash Of Clans A New Spark and Would Be More Strategic than usual. Thanks For Reading Devs Godbless.',
       'Hey supercell,no doubt your game is awesome but I didn\'t like the supercell id technique in the new update...why did u removed the Google play login system? It was easier to change coc account in it...but in the supercell id it takes a lot of time to change the accounts plus we have to write our email then wait for the password....please fix this issue..... Probably I m not the only one who is facing it......    So I hope that your team can fix this issue..',
       'it\'s a good game and challenging. Strategy is needed on going through battles, Arranging your defenses is very tough to manage lol..... You want to keep away the enemies from your lawn though........ and I love the "Builder hall" when I\'m done on my "Town hall" I manage the second camp.... although the loot in Builder hall is limited it\'s fun and addictive a real time killer........ keep up the good work developers........ have a good day.... ^_¬§' ,

I mean, u shud send the blocks such that people shud love thinking where they all will fit, if allowed in comments I would have sent screen shot of game where I lost in it, to ask u guys where the hell these three blocks fit. I wud suggest to take it as an error in ur game n resolve it.',

      'As a Scrabble purist I rather resent being able to reorganize the board whilst secretly enjoying getting high scoring squares randomly together. The app works well, only a micro improvement but I would ideally like a little more space between the bottom of the board & the playable letters, as if the area\'s crowded it\'s hard to see what\'s what at a glance. All in all great, thanks.',
       'It doesn\'t recognize many, many words...I find that so very frustrating "internet" IS a legit word...duhhh....nut apparently not to these creators. Update pleas√©, I mean aren\'t you embarrassed by that? Internet is not a word....lol',

       'Absolutely love this game. The only thing I don\'t love is that my profile picture will not stay up. Fix that and I\'d give it 5 stars for sure.',
       'Ive been playing the game for a long time and it\'s great. The only changes I\'d make would be to have the ability to resigned whether it\'s your turn or not... And my selection of random players seem to be the same dozen or so who I have no interest in playing, I it looks like I\'ll run out of players... Then I\'ll be gone.' ,

      'Very fun and time killing. I play with my bf and 2 friends and we all try to beat eachothers high scores. It can be pretty competitive. Im prob gonna try to get more ppl to play with me too lol. There could be more variety in the blocks, and there should be like different modes, just an idea',
       'Its cool and all but needs some extra features.  Maybe a way to store 1 brick for later or some level advancement.  Maybe challenges or a power up system. The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.',
       'What they show on the preview and what it gives you in game don\'t even match. They make it look like it so easy. You cannot rotate the pieces. The pieces they give are so random, and most games you can barely get past a couple of turns before you can\'t place anymore and you lose.',
       'This is very deceiving. It looks like it\'s Tetris, but it\'s not. The pieces don\'t come down like the pictures show. I hate apps like this who deceive people to believe its a certain game when it\'s not just to get people to download. Will never download a game from this developer again.',
       'This app would score a lot better if there was an option to get rid of the adds. If gladly pay to have them gone but that isn\'t an option for some reason. They\'re so intrusive and far too frequent even for a free game. Uninstalling and won\'t be coming back',
       'This game says it has all different types of shapes but it has the same ones from another puzzle game. I think this game was very boring and that you should not download it' ,

      'To anyone saying the magnometer should be free; no, it shouldn\'t.  You guys are requesting it be free because it is in demand, which is exactly why it is for sale.  Parents don\'t let you buy things on the app?  Good. The magnometer is something EXTRA that is absolutely not necessary for the app to function.  Sure, it can help make the right move; that\'s why you have to pay for it... Without the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app.  With the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app and paying for it to help analyze your moves.  You are not entitled to a free move analyzer to help guide you simply because you want it to be free.  That\'s not how economics works, hate to break it to you.  There are many, many ways to analyze moves, positions, and get better at chess; the Magnometer is not and will never be the best way to do so. It is simply an added convenience that you can choose to pay for to help you find or analyze a move/position.',
       'Feels great to have a simulated match with a Magnus-like computer AI opponent. Will definitely destroy you even at the lower age levels. The only thing I don\'t like in the app is the gray color graphics of the board and the chess pieces. The upside about this is you can surely change that setting if you got the appropriate in-game currency to purchase a different color scheme, with some playthroughs that are needed first to be able to get them.',
       'Good job It seems like that you are not paying this app any attention anykmore. I dont understand what was the need of another Magnus Trainer app. You coukd have very well integrated the same fuctionality here. You closely missed the opportunity to create the best chess app in the world. Alas....',
       'Sound effects and graphics are distractingly poor. Missing basic features like turn confirmation. You can see a video on YouTube of Magnus himself making a mistake in placing a piece using this app.',
       'This chess game is very good, I would give it five stars except for an internal error that will not post my record of wins, losses and ties against Magnus. Maybe I fried the memory with all my losses...üòÅ',
       'Love the idea behind it. Well executed and a really fun feel to the game. Wish there was a 3d board option- have always found flat 2d chess board graphics frustrating to read.' ,

      'It\'s definitely an adorable game and is one of the few games of this kind that has reasonable "waiting" times for stuff! :)  Sadly... There\'s one Major issue I have with the game and it is the constant notification to link Facebook with the game, which of course also has some great rewards locked behind it as well. :P I don\'t have a Facebook profile and it\'s incredibly unfortunate that there\'s no other alternative to choose (especially when there\'s plenty to choose from these days) Those are the reasons why I rate only three stars.',
       'Great game, shame is so heavy on the pay to progress.  Everything takes far to looking and not enough storage.  The option to build a stiff warehouse would be great.  Otherwise fun and engaging.',
       'Most of the event need to use cash then can complete 100% of it. Every single thing need to buy with cash.',
       'It\'s an ok game. Not what i thought it would be.  Actions take a lot of energy and do not recoup quickly. Rewards arent the greatest.',
       'Keeps having a connection error at 67% loading. I can\'t even play it',

      'I like this game. I purchased it because it deserves, also I want to remove ads. 3,50 ‚Ç¨ and ads are not removed completely. I\'m disappointed, expecially for the "restore purchase" button that not works. Despite this I think that as a game is fun but monotonous in the long run, defect of 90% of apps of this kind. I hope developers will add something with updates that are not other challenges that ofter go to luck (and waiting time should e removed also). Sometimes there are some bugs but irrilevant for gameplay. The development house has made other interesting apps too. Sorry for errors, is not my first language.',
       'Hi everyone!  I\'m really not a fan of this game, I mean it\'s ok I\'m not going to lie but is very boring. The graphics are ok but it is repetitive. I suppose it is quite addictive but I lost interest after a few goes. It wasn\'t my cup of tea so to speak. I hope this review was helpful and remember to give it a big thumbs up!!!

      'Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!',
       'Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can\'t just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can\'t advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it\'s basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.',
       'This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said "add break". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them.',
       'Love this game, its an addictive time killer. But I would like to have replays and not sure if it\'s only my device because I haven\'t seen other reviews about it but it doesn\'t have an accurate count of flips, my friend counted 11 and it said 3.5 I do many more (yes at one time, before landing) and it still says 3, 3.5, 4',
       'Since the last update, being able to double up on coins from hourly balloons is impossible.  Also watching videos for coins isn\'t working.  This game is great when everything works right.  However, it is getting frustrating not being able to view videos for coins.  I\'m game ad breaks are still working, so what\'s the deal?  The # 1 thing that keeps me in a game is not having to spend real money.  I a star simply because of this.  Fix it please.',
       'In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it\'s newer it\'s boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star' ,

      'Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.',
       'I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I\'ve already dumped into this game and the devs didn\'t give me my in game rewards. I\'ve submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.',
       'Wasn\'t sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to "farm gold,xp,mats". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it\'s an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don\'t be jealous, just play your game and have fun.',
       'Nice graphics, intuitive control, fun. In the beginning, it was a little too much going on for my ADHD self, but now I\'ve been playing for a couple months and it\'s my favorite mobile game of all time. I love collecting all the interesting heroes as well as saving for events and seeing what RNGsus  will bring next!  My only complaint right now is that their notification system is whack. Especially in the beginning, it\'s easy to miss things you can do.',
       'Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I\'ve progressed it\'s just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I\'m not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!',
       'Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an "annoying add". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It\'s simple, it\'s fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend.' ,

      'Most of the controls are excellent, I love the snap-to by selecting a ball, and the fine tune dial, however the "spin" mechanic is terrible to the point of being broken. No matter where you put the contact spot on the cue it is always maximum front spin or back spin, there is no diagonal spin or English, and no gentle spin of any kind. Fix this and you have a perfect pool game.',
       'I played without sound for a long time. After Upgrading my tablet, the sound won\'t turn OFF!   I have it off in the settings but am still getting sound after sinking a shot and at the end of a game.  I am very dissappointed that i wont be able to play this app anymore.',
       'Was disappointed when I reached level 816 and found no more game. Also, game could use some kind of "side game" to avoid boredom.  But still good time killer.',
       'Really like this game but now at level 563 and it is becoming repetitious. I think I am missing something because at one stage some of the pockets were blocked. There has to be more to this. Anyone help ?',
       'It\'s not horrible by any means but it\'s basically the children\'s version of what the game should be. Way to basic way too easy and no points and buying system or any sort of upgrades every level just diffs with amount of balls and placement not difficulty Thanks',
       'I enjoy playing this game. I already reach level 400 but i don\'t know how many levels this game have. Do you increase the levels every time you update this game until it reach to never ending levels so that no one will stop playing this game because of the never ending levels. This game is fun and challenging.' ,

      'It has the right elements of effortless competition, continuous improvement and no blatant "pay to win" aspect. I\'ll keep running it because I can pick it up and drop it at a moment\'s notice.  Also nice to see one of these games that isn\'t just a re-tread of the spaceship scroller. It\'s a different theme!',
       'I love the game but needs just one tiny update, you need a create your own ride option, all out make your own vehicle and guns and gun damage, based on what you created it will tell u your damage and health,, also you need a user store to publish and use other users vehicles, you make cars semis bikes planes etc.but in order too get all these cool features, you need to beat the 3rd boss in the game. But I want a vehicle creator because I want too make a mark 2 version of Darkside from twisted metal, (seems fitting, right?) So plz, plz, PLZ, make a create your own car feature.',

Other than that great game',
       'I would 5 star this game. But there are to many road blocks, and they coincide with bridges which block your view of both road blocks and rockets. I am actually losing interest in the game because there are so many road blocks. Why have a road block covering 3 lanes and then put more blocks in the remaining lanes.',
       'This is such a fun game! I ligit played this for hours!! The ame of the game is to BLOW STUFF UP and who doesn\'t like blowing everything around them up!? ONE IMPROVEMENT could be that it dosen\'t take 3mins to load because I really want to get on this fricking amazing game but it is making me wait! I love the game it is really fun ‚ô°',

The only other thing is they grew more wise  for the latest update, you can\'t change the time on your phone to add lives anymore! Probably better that way, one (read: I) should pace themselves when playing....',

      'I\'ll keep this short, this game was way better when players were able to buy things like the hearts (lives), small and large boosts 750m and 1500m, and other items like this. I have since started to play this again after getting a new phone and this game has changed a lot. Although I like the new power-ups, it wouldn\'t hurt to bring back the old ones as well, and by that I mean allow players to buy more lives, boosts etc.   I hope the developers can make this happen, although I\'m only one person so they will not listen and probably couldn\'t care less what I think, but listening to the customer (or player of your game in this case) would probably work out quite well.',
       'I love this game. It\'s pretty old, but amazingly, still one of the best games on a mobile device. It\'s unbelievably addicting, which is quite a problem.. üòÇ But I love this game so much, and I play it everyday. Keep it up, Halfbrick Studios! I\'ve been playing this game since I was about 5, so sorry for the late rate. üòÑ',
       'Pretty good game. It\'s a really fun game to play, and a great killer time. But it has way too many ads. It also tells you to spend a lot of real life money, to the point that is ridiculous. Like, having to pay to be able to use a third slot. Really???',
       'I love this game. It could be improved though, I think that during missions where you have to do a certain amount of something in one game (for example, ride 500m on the hog in one run, or collect 4 tokens in one game) there should something that tells you how much of that thing you have done during gameplay. This would be super helpful so you don\'t have to count yourself. Also to those who are complaining about ads, I simply turn off my WiFi when I am playing (this prevents ads) and I turn it back on to do the S.A.M challenge.',
       'I remember when the game was new, you did not have to pay for as many things. Greedy developers, that\'s right milk it for all it\'s worth.',
       'Played this before and really enjoyed it, second time through was not so great.  Felt much more monetized.  Also, ads frequently fail to give rewards. I sit through a 30 second video and then game shows an error and doesnt give the reward.  Uninstalled because this was frequent.' ,

      'Whenever you die in the game you start completely over again. And after each game an advertisement plays. Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It\'s a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It\'s very competitive!!! I swear my husband can\'t beat my score no one has lol',
       'It\'s good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it\'s my opinion so don\'t get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don\'t have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn\'t play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! üòÄüòÄüòÄ',
       'It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone\'s or tablets I find it hard to control I don\'t know if anyone else thinks so but that\'s my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company',
       'Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface',
       'start to crash often when playing online. i think it need some sounds or music. playing silent for long time feels like going stupid after long time played. since it so addictive . keep repeating boring play but keeps ppl playing. is fun though, but I think everyone need to keep control how much time played. can\'t believe I can play for like hours haha. don\'t know why my Nick name don\'t show anymore. usually is \'eat uuu\'. but shows as nothing ____ now.',
       'Game lags way to much. I can\'t enjoy it at all. It\'s a waste of an app. You guys really need to fix it. To many people like playing but the lagging has got to stop so the game can be enjoyed. If this game coast two pennies, I wouldn\'t by it. I am uninstalling this game for the 2nd time. Never again. Sucks, cuz I really like playing without the technical difficulties' ,

      'This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you\'re willing to go broke',
       'Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.',
       'This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!',
       'Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses.',
       'I have a significant concern with how easy it is to accidentally spend the gems. It has happened at least once, though I\'m assuming it happened a second time while I was quickly clicking building a building, since fifteen gems are now unaccounted for. I cannot feel comfortable with this game if at any given moment, all my gems might get spent because of one misclick.',
       'I really like this game it is very fun. The only thing is, how do you wave, I dont know but I play it on PC so I am not very sure how to wave so please tell me if you can do it on PC. Also can you maybe update is so you can use it on PC with w a s d because I am used to it. Anyway love the game good job!' ,

      'I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It\'s fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn\'t want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.',
       'Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It\'s reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series\' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis\'s and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I\'m offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,',
       'I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I\'d end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!',
       'Hi there Admin.  The cash purchased Super Giant Box has just crushed on me while I was opening it. I think much of its content is still out there instead on my account.  Would you be so kind and check the status of this cash purchased Super Giant Box?  Best regards,  C',
       'Game it self is great and a ton of fun.   But, the system for showing ads is so annoying.  It\'s not just your normal video ad no, they make you watch 3 different ads and a min of 16 or 11 sec each.  After you have watched the minimum time, you have to hit next and repeat again',
       'Wasted up to 200gems in ultimate league so far. When you lose a match, they offer you to keep your progression in exchange of gems, but they put the option on the right side instead of left. I keep pressing it by mistake and waste gems that I\'d much rather use to reset gang fights instead.' ,

      'There are far too many ads in game that you have to deal with, and game limitations basically force you to purchase stuff in order to even approach something resembling actual progress. What makes things worse is that there really isn\'t much of an actual game to be played here, just spin once, wait for the ad, spin again, wait for an ad, repeat until you uninstall the game permanently. I\'d only recommend this game to someone looking for an actively painful experience.',
       'The ads weren\'t the problem (I know U gotta make money some how) but the game just crashed for my phone.  I\'m gonna update the review since it was a bit harsh to give it one star. It\'s probably just my phone playing up it\'s been pretty buggy lately üòÇ',
       'The amount of ads is truly ridiculous. And if you intend to actually make any money at all with this game you will have to play for probably over a year to make 1 dollar. don\'t waste your time',
       'At the rate you get coins it would take youbabreally long time for you to redeem for five dollars, but the ads are not very intrusive, and the game works.  If I can get an extra 5. Bucks by the end of the month, I\'m happy.',
       'I really like this game. It\'s a great time killer but can you please not have the double reward and x2 thing pop up all the time. It is really annoying',
       'I just do not enjoy how long it takes to redeem a card.   Also,  the "claw machine" needs to be updated so it ACTUALLY works.   I have used so many coins on it and not once has it given me a prize.' ,

BEWARE PLAYERS: this is a bait. it wont made the ads go away. ads will also appear out of nowhere during my gameplay. delete it now',
       'Used to be a fun game but unfortunately it no longer works. Game has you waste your coins on quests which you complete and then you receive no reward for some reason. You\'re supposed to get free coins but about half the time you don\'t actually get it after you click the button. I wasted 90 coins and complete a quest and then I received nothing but it clearly thinks I completed the quest because I need to pay another 90 coins to get a new Quest.

       'What is this???? After every 1 or 2 game when the main menu comes I touch screen just frozes I can\'t even touch any button. Neither I can play nor I can go to shop it\'s nothing I can do but just to quit the game. My phone is Samsung S6  Pls do something it\'s really irritating',
       'This is a nice idea for a game but needs a lot of work. First of i couldn\'t even understand how the game works. Always saying "connection is slow" every damn time. Controls? Terrible. Before i even learn how to move i get eaten. Please look into these and you might have a good game there.',
       'fix the laaags please. I have high speed internet but still facing lags. I spent a lot in this game and don\'t want to loose it. Still lagging :(. It works with only high speed internet. Can\'t play with the data packages only strong wifi.  You didn\'t fix this in the new edition of the game and the rush mode is not working. The new party is sucks big time. Fix fix fix',
       'Over all great game, but there\'s just one problem. The problem is that when you get huge (35k mass or higher) it tends to lag and freezes then eventually the app crashes please fix it really annoying .. Edit : There seems to be a bug in the controls shooting food will split tf' ,

      'This is a great game but it has it\'s draw backs. Due to a glitch in the game I had some coins and trophies taken from me in a game that never loaded. The biggest issue with this game is there is no offline solo play. A solo or practice mode would be great to allow people to get a feel for the game and be able to make tweaks in certain scenarios when playing with others. Easily worth 5+ stars if some adjustments can be made. Very addictive, very fun and suspenseful, and a great time killer.',
       'I think that you should win the balls all so instead of just trophies!! You pay so much money to qualify for a tournament and you got to pay a 10,000 dollar entry fee and then 1000 ever hole!! The game is coming to how much you can spend instead of how good you are you shouldn\'t be able to enter a rookie tournament if you have over a thousand trophies!! Maybe it shouldn\'t cost so much to be able to get into the tournament!!! Besides if you spend a lot of money the people who can\'t spend as much!! I enjoy this game a lot I play it all the time I believe that it should be cheaper to qualify for the tournament!! And when you lose your game that you should loose the ball your playing with!! I really appreciate your time in listening to my opinion!! Hopefully this might make it a little more fair to the people who can\'t spend the money they would like!! Sincerely a Huge fan of the game!!! Thanks Joseph',
       'Awesome game. The only thing I don\'t care for is, why am I playing people that have 80 trophies but have played 2,000 games? I mean I\'m working with starter clubs and they are playing me with so much better clubs.. I just don\'t think that\'s very fare. And is there any other way possible to receive extra gems and coins or get extra clubs higher-ranking clubs? Thank you for your time and thank you for coming out with this game it is awesome',
       'Really a great experience! The game play is awesome and very addicting. Only issue I have is when I finish in the weekly division standings I am not receiving my rewards. I just placed 3rd and was supposed to get a golden chest but I did not receive anything. That was a little disappointing after investing all that time, but still one of the best apps I have ever downloaded.',
       'Game is based on luck. Could be so much better if it was more realistic ie club selection. How can it be fair when it is easier to chip in from off the green than it is to hole a putt? NEED TO FIX BUG THAT MAKES MY SHOT HAPPEN WITHOUT MY FINGER LEAVING TABLET SCREEN!!! HAS COST ME HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF COINS!!!',
       'Game seems fine as long as you DO NOT BUY ANYTHING!!. Game is so rigged and its about the most obvious Ive ever seen. Just before tourney time, you will not make a shot and you will be reduced to ZERO coins, balls and trophies. I have over 10,000 matches so I know the game and support very well. DO NOT BUY BALLS, COINS HEARTS OR ANYTHING ELSE FROM PLAYDEMIC.' ,

      'This game is perfect for anyone who loves magic, fantasy, collecting, and a whole new level of adorable! Dragonvale takes everything to the next level! I highly recommend it, as it is a amazing game, my most played, and I hope everyone else enjoys it just as much as I do. Five stars! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü Edit 2: I was re-organizing my islands by Element the other day, and I had just finished the Plant Island. I put down a Oversized Oak Tree, and immediately, a image flashed through my mind: a young girl, sitting on a branch of the oak tree, a book in one hand, a baby Plant dragon sitting next to her. Stretched out in front of them was my Plant Island, the dragons freely soaring, the other islands in the distance. And that sparked a inspiration in my head. I just wanted to ask; can I write a Dragonvale book, which takes place at my park? Please let me know !  :)',
       'Cmon Backflip! Okay look I love Dragonvale, I\'ve been playing it forever. First off I lost my amazing park a while back and that really sucked. But now I am restarting and I go to buy the beginners pack for 9.99 and it says there was an error and i wont be charged...come to find out it did charge me and i didnt receive anything! Please help',
       'When I first had it it was super fun. Then I saw a game I wanted so I deleted it I did that before and got it back I could log into facebook and go to my old island. But this time I could not. I was so far and looking forward to seeimg my dragons but it did not let me go to my old island. It left me im tears that I had to do what I did all over again. So I deleted this stupid game and gave this. If I could rate 0 I would',
       'its ok, and you might think you cant li e without it, but trust me.... after a while year of playing, which is what i have waited to wrote this review, the game play becomes very repetitive. sure try it out, its fun, but not something for the rest of your life. dont put money into it, you will regret ir later.',
       'After Gardenias update i was good. Then yesterday 02/08/18 it wont even fully load up. It says it had trouble downloading a file. I tried the classic restart of device - didnt work. So I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I can play through the tutorial on a new park but attempting to load my level 102 park I get the same download message. I play on android. Please fix this. I havent missed a day of play since you implemented the daily rewards.',
       'I love this game but all of a sudden this morning I can not start the game. It says it can not download a required file. I tried on two different devices and got that message on both. My game is level 73, so I have been playing for awhile and this is the first problem I have had. Please help!' ,

      'I never EVER been so absolutely in love with a app. I only read about 3 stories and spent $82 for gems and tickets because not only I couldn\'t resist it\'s the least I could do for the creaters for creating such a perfect game that seriously was meant for me in every way possible! (And I NEVER spent money on ANY apps so THAT is how much I LOVE this!) This brings me endless amounts of happiness! It\'s EVERYTHING a story lover could love! üòçüíì AND THERE IS NO ISSUE AT ALL ABSOLUTELY NONE! And I am so not lying when I say NO ISSUE! üòÅ 100/10 game! My only wish is I\'d love for another way to earn gems.',
       'Game is fun. Dont even mind spending money in gens every now and again. But seriously to get the outcome you want, this app is charging waaaaaaay too many gems. Like 50 for one simple choice. And its goes up higher depending on the amount of gems you have. If I pay $5.99 for like 60 gems.. that should get me through and entire story. Not just one chapter. Will delete app if they dont change it. Not gonna spend $40 to finish a story.. Sorry but I think thats outrageous.',
       'This game is really fun! I wish there was a way to restart a story that you are in the middle of or that you could change your appearance or other people\'s appearence at any time. Also when you decide what your character is wearing, sometimes you can\'t see it because dialog is in the way. Also when you choose what you look like. I would prefer it to be against a white background. It\'s hard to see what the darker colors look like.',
       'The stories seem great so far, the app is really nice. But the limiting of how much you can "read" is way over the top. Two short chapters and then a 4 hour wait to get another two. Or buying more chapter tickets. All the actually fun choices are also gated behind premium currency. If it was even a bit less limiting, it would be great. As it is, its fun but annoying.',
       'Really fun, the animation style is adorable but the waiting time is killer! Two short chapters, then you have to wait a ridiculously long amount of time to be able to play more unless you pay. Also the best story options are only available through micro transactions to get more gems to unlock the ability to make certain choices',
       'I like it.  So it\'s really fun and it\'s full of drama! But your options are short because when you have to choose between things, you can only say yes to something IF you have enough gems.But to get gems you have to pay with actual money SO . . . It\'s limited options every single time I play.' ,

      'Two big things hurt this otherwise great and fun idea:. 1) projects are not saved in progress!  If you leave one unfinished and go back to it, you have to start all over! 2) there are not enough tools/ways to get at all the pieces in the more complicated patterns. There are other minor things. ... I will say the positives.  This is unique and a good and fun idea!  The designs and colors are very nice!  I did not have a single crash so it is very stable!  There seemed to be a fair amount of ones to do with the free version.  Ads were not any worse than others that use this model.',
       'In general it\'s a fun game but the controls aren\'t easy to control/get use to and aren\'t smooth. There aren\'t many new drawings every day either. What I like is that some of the ones where you need to pay you can watch an ad to unlock it. It\'s also a great time killer.',
       'It is quite cute and you can even do the ones that need you too pay by watching an ad. They are quite detailed and you can rotate around unlike some other apps. When I was moving around, the controls were a bit slippery, but it was a big upgrade from other apps. I recommend you download it if you like medium difficulty pixel art, although there are a few simpler ones.',

       'This is rlly fun I love the part where u can see like a type of slideshow of when u were coloring it and starts off of nothing then fills in the areas u filled in when coloring .

Love the app in the fact that you can turn the pictures all around makes me love you even more because there is not very many as I could find this good I don\'t think I can find any answers.

      'I used to love this game, very addictive but recent updates have made the game have too many elements (clubs - who cares???) Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels "fixed" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.',
       'This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.',
       'This game is fun, it is addicting. However because of the constant changing and the unfair advantages that some players get (not everyone has the same events, quests, or in game things) it\'s becoming less and less appealing. And the multiple device fix is a joke! EVERYONE had that advantage you they took it! Dumb!',
       'Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the "boards" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it\'s addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It\'s becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.',
       'I really liked playing as mindless entertainment despite what I consider to be unreasonable costs of the games as you advance in levels  and even tolerated the forced ads when they began. Unfortunately 2 days ago   it refused to load and continues to ask to retry or restart.  My connections are optimal and no updates pending.   Have tried to contact support to no avail. Disappointing.',
       'Love playing this game but I\'m getting sick of some of the levels feeling rigged. They can be impossible to win. And not just like, oh I didn\'t plan my strategy well enough. No. Like I will legitimately get NO useful cards in the entire deck and won\'t be able to clear ANYTHING. it\'s clearly fixed for us to spend money on it. Disappointing.' ,

      'This is a very addictive game. I don\'t understand why people don\'t like it. Fast paced. As for the adds, you people should turn your internet off and play. It will help.. ##VOODOO## Would you accept a video from me? You can use it for advertising purposes. I thought it might be of great help for you.  Please get back to me by replying. I would be happy to email the video to you..',
       'The game is fine. But OMG the ads....they make you watch an ad every few seconds until you pay for the premium version. This is just sick. I mean games do have ads but the number of ads in this game are unbearable. Very frustrating . So if you are looking for a free game THIS IS NOT IT.',
       'Hey Developer! This is Great Job!. But, if there are other players who have the disease "Afraid of Heights", this game will not be suitable for him. You make players Cringe (Afraid), because there is no music. This game like a Dark Theme Games.',
       'I know a lot of people seem to not like this game but I actually really enjoy it the only thing I don\'t like is the lack of sound.   It would be nice if there was background music of some kind and a glass breaking sound effect when you went through each barrier something pleasing to the ears  Oh and shorter ads would also probably be good.  It could also use more roads and balls and barriers to work towards. I feel like this game has a lot of potential though hope it keeps being updated.',
       'It was hard to play but the commercials r the worst. I get that you have to have some to offer the game for free but every single commercial was 30 seconds long or more by the time u can hit the X. The commercials we longer then the game play',
       'Since I got this phone, no other app have I liked or disliked enough to write a review. This game is pretty fun actually. But after you play it a few times (they wait until you get hooked), they start showing a 30 second ad every time you fall off the map (the map is the same every time, but it is a very different game. It reminds me of flappy bird - you will die almost immiately at the beginning, but your skill will increase with repetition). So every 30 seconds, I got a 30 ad. And the game costs 3 bucks. Rip off. Zero star review.' ,

      'I\'m 11 and i love it so much.I have some Ideas for a toca kitchen 3. You can be able to make sandwiches and soups or stews. And more ingredients, more people. And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.',
       'I want YOU to read this Toca Boca I love it! But I have to ask, Why is there bread if you can\'t make a sandwich? Also can you make there a way to make soup? I really like your games but I am only 10,how do you expect me to pay for the games. At make 5 free like this!',
       'I like how I can give the guests disgusting drinks and food a see and hear their really funny reaction! Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!üòÜüòÜ I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!',
       'Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I\'m sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP',
       'I\'m giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won\'t make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least',
       'This is the best game ever it is also funny because I was giving the girl food and I gave her some strawberries and I put a lot of lemon, hot sauce, Barbiecu sauce,Manas,keckup,salt, and pepper... SO funny, it also sounds just like a kid is playing with the food, that I\'m eating grapes right now,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÅüòÄüòä‚ò∫üôÇüòê' ,

      'Horrendously intrusive advertising I play this game regularly, and enjoy the gameplay. However, the advertising is a horrible and annoying part of the app, and probably borderlining app guidelines. When the advertisement is on between rounds, they block your entire UI, and there\'s nothing you can do to shut it down. They will frequently stream video, which can easily consume your entire allowed data from your telephone company. This is NOT how you should provide games, free or not.',

      'Parts of this game are really confusing. I built all the materials to make a ship and they\'re not usable in any way. The quests are also really messed up and once you have nets collecting materials there\'s nothing left to do. Seems like most of the issues with this game would be simple to fix but the developers obviously aren\'t interested in making the game better, just in getting people to click ads. Shame because it could\'ve been a fun game.',

      'Game all in all pretty cool.. they only thing is the game really is rocket based. It really has nothing to with your bike. I have the best bike and like lvl 4 bikes are beating me. I don\'t like the rockets because it takes away from the rhythm and flow. Im probably done, but it was fun for about 4 days. Im not spending 20$ on rockets every day.',
       'As usual games like this are th. Until there is a ridiculous challenge. Such as a racer no matter how much upgrading you do its impossible to beat them. Been atuck for four days on the same challenge and there seems to b3 no possible way to win unless i spend actual cash to progress games like this are the usual money hungry. Lemons that aren out there. All you want from us is our money. Your gameplay sucks your upgrading syatem sucks. All around for a side scroller you do not deserve my money. Did your money grubbing issue and maybe mlte people will play King Fury was better than this and it\'s a literal 8 bit game. Temple run was better',
       'This is an amazing game! The graphics are nice, game play is smooth, and it is difficult. This game actually makes you learn how to ride the track better to be able to beat the opponent. Nothing negative to say about it, other than earning cash is a bit difficult.',
       'Love The game, just like i loved mad skills motocross. Just wish they had a head to head like motocross, to challenge friends. Hate the gold to upgrade, and no way to get gold without buying it.',
       'Great game as a fan of Mad Skills Mx 2. I would like there to be more fun ways of getting cash once you defeat all of the bosses.',
       'It\'s certainly a good game. Bit it\'s just another example of pay to win. It\'s practically impossible to beat the top end bosses unless you\'ve purchased upgrades or a better bike.' ,

      'Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I\'ll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily "less than 20 coins" reward. Sooooooo cheap!',
       'Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don\'t ever plan to, but here you also don\'t really need to. I\'ve won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you\'re not forced to watch them. It\'s not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.',
       'Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don\'t even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.',
       'Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn\'t be putting people in the "club" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this "club" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they\'re INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game',
       'Greatest game ever~~¬§mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  üò¨ üò≤ üò† üòê üò≠  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don\'t terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.',
       'Awesome game, definitely feels like I\'m playing the UNO card game. However, the little bit of energy you have is a killjoy. Especially since matches are short because it\'s timed and most of the time, there\'s no real winner. I don\'t mind the energy so much as I mind the games being cut short and instead the winner is decided by a point system.' ,

Im currently at 39000 Gems. Looking for Guild members at Butt_Pirates. I\'m Guil Leader (Draft_FS), message me via Castle Clash built in messanger.',
       'Game is getting better with being fair. Free to play people can actually roll decent heroes after a while with persistence. IGG is still unbelievably money hungry for their newest released things - but I guess it\'s better to wait for everything or pay for it upfront. I chose option 1. Thank you IGG for making rolling a little more fair.',
       'I\'ve played for 3 years and this game has just gone way downhill, this is the biggest pay to win game that exists. It\'s enjoyable to see people have the ability to buy what I worked so hard during the last 3 years for a mere $10. I haven\'t enjoyed this game in months, it\'s a chore to still play. Download only if you\'re willing to drop a fortune.',
       'OMG This app is annoying in all ways... And on Certain hack things I play this for 30 seconds but still don\'t get a pass! Tell CoTops to give me my credits',
       'Lol I\'m changing my review once more. I love the game but every new hero you guys drop completely messes up the game and makes things unfair. I don\'t know if your way of trying to fix it is by making more OP heroes but it simply makes the game less enjoyable. The last few heroes that came out completely made my account useless and if I don\'t put in a good couple hundred dollars is just gonna stay useless. I think that\'s unfair so for now I\'m taking off a few stars. I know you guys don\'t care but its the only thing I can do to express my opinion. In my humble opinion you guys should balance the useless heroes you already have rather than coming up with new ones that make the old ones  useless.',
       'DO NOT ENTER!!!!  Unless you have thousands of dollars lying around and burning a hole in your pocket, do not bother! This game takes care of p2w (play to win) players and it is getting borderline impossible for f2l (free to lose) players to catch up and the gap is just getting bigger by the day.... its ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Edit: After 4 years of playing this game I have finally thrown in the towel.... I loved this game, and maybe I still do, but you guys make it bloody impossible to play anymore  (*Queen playing in backround* ...another one bites the dust)' ,

I do believe giving an emergency C-section for an illegal is a bit much for a story line, but whatever. Totally makes sense. I love how we\'re able to take care of the premies and foster them until they\'re adopted! 6/10 - Would play again if bored.',
       'I hate this game you can barely use it half of the stuff sont even work and its so boring you could find bette games with coco play',
       'It was realy fun but I think  you should be able to choose what the mom looked like and the babies and choose if you wanted a girl or a boy and choose what teddies you wanted to give them like a rabbit toy or a dog toy but apart from that it was great. Thank you so much.',
       'This game\'s control quality is terrible and I even started to get frustrated because the game wouldn\'t let me do something I needed to do to advance.',
       'This game is really good the best part is dressing up you can match them with the mommy and Iove how you can name the baby number one was Laura and number two was Lauren ok last words I liked this game',
       'This game is good I liked it also not so many adds are there  and the part I like the most is that the dressing of the babies.if looking for a game like this please download it. Thanks' ,

      'Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?',

      'I can\'t say I love it,maybe I can. But any way, this would have to be in one of top hundred gamesüòÄ. There are a few things I would like added though. Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed thisüòÄüòÅüòÄüòÅüòÄüòÅ.',
       'I think you guys have messed up your game in the past few updates. Seems like there is some memory leak or something. After a while the steering wheel lags so much. Only the input. Graphics don\'t lag at all. Please fix. Also would be great if you could add some button to start and stop a timer in free mode so we can set time challenges for ourselves. I like the game but it is unplayable after a few minutes after the recent updates',
       'What you should improve is that YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ADD\'s I MEAN SERIOUSLY I WATCH MORE ADDS THAN THE GAMEPLAY. I ONLY PLAY FOR A LITTLE THEN MOST OF ADDS SHOW UP. I WQ5CH ADDS THAN PLAY8NG THE GAME FOR CRYING OT LOUD!!',
       'This is crazy like I understand that you need ads but the fact that they are popping up on the middle of the screen is crazy! Like I woodnt mind if you had a small one at the bottom is the screen but the fact it pops up at random in the screen is really annoying and finds the game. I do love this game but the ads ruin it. Please fix this!',
       'This game was just really really good! But please please make the exact same game but instead, if you do something illegal like crash into another car, the cops start chasing you. If you do do this I will comment on every single game that comes up on the adds. But, there is a tiny bit to much adds. Anyways, AMAZING fame!!!üòä',

      'This game is AMAZING I think its  suitable for any age because its entertaining and it doesn\'t have a lot of adds which is really cool since this game is free. It also has a variation of different puzzles to keep u entertained. I think that if u r reading this right now then DOWNLOAD IT NOW.',
       'This is actually quite addictive & enjoyable. Definitely distracts you & helps kill time or zone out when your brain is too busy. My daughters, (16 yrs & 5 yrs) along w my son (12 yrs) play w me, and we try to race each other thru the levels. I would give this wee game 5 stars if it weren\'t for the amount of ads & the length of time the ads play. If the ads were adjusted a wee bit it would be easier to do the side by side races. Hope y\'all üëç it.',
       'Would\'ve been a clean 5 if it weren\'t for the damned commercial breaks after almost each level. Enjoyed the game but couldn\'t stand all the breaks and half of them end with a blank screen so you have to exit the game and come back or it doesn\'t give the X and all you can do is first visit Google store and then return to the game. Horribly done. Too bad for such an enjoyable game.',
       'I abseloutly love this game. The controls are amazing the games are great and it is so stress relieving and I would play this in every second of my spare time. I would totally reccomend this for kids and adults!!! Go and get this free app that I am addicted to üòÄüòç',
       'This game has everything: any puzzle game you could imagine organized into well-staggered difficulties, unlockable content that can all be earned for free, regular updates... The only annoying thing is the ads that play every few levels but I liked the game so much I spent the $2.50 to get rid of them.',

      'Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can\'t stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn\'t happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can\'t buy any of the bikes.',
       'okay .. tbh i love the game.. it\'s addicting ,fun,and time killer , but i don\'t like the ads... get 30s ads everytime want to see some replay l,when creating some mp,even when i go to shop.. and i can\'t skip that, just lost atleast 400mb data for ads... just decrease the video ads, because not everyone use a wifi..',
       'After only playing a few short but addicting levels, I am already having a blast! The game may not look spectacular on a technical level. But the gameplay is so freaking fun! And the controls aren\'t too complicated either. Recommended for everyone!',
       'Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you\'re racing friends.',
       'Bugs and Glitches... Multiplayer links are not being sent back and forth properly. Some games keep giving me desert level 1 and not showing any replays or ghost bikes are doing a different levels then the one I am suppose to be racing against. Please Fix!!!',
       'I love playing this game but id give it no stars seeming that there are so many ads and when I collected enough stars for a ghost bike I DIDNT GET IT!! HORRIBLE!! unless you can fix this, you\'re not getting a good review on my hand. Oh and also, for anyone wanting to know, it\'s 21 dollars a month for some bikes. Not in real life. Wow such a great deal... No really a great deal.' ,

      'Great game, but honestly they need to tweak the chests for in app purchases. Why are the things not all even? I should be able to get the same level of item. If I spend 80 jewels, all the items should be equivalent. There should 3,500 feathers on the same page as 7,500 feathers. If I\'m level 300, even the common chests could reflect that. People will spend the money. Why not offer all the daily specials all the time? It\'s fun, but I spend cash money on this game, let\'s make it worthwhile...',
       'Pro: Its a pretty challenging game but not to put your out. There is also some daily chanllenges, new revamped arena to do with also some clan battle. The new room system that brings makes some level design unique. Some variety in levels and pigs. A new bird introduced: Silver The fortune tower   Cons: The lives system. Doesn\'t have that much of a story. Silvers ability is kinda disapointing.',
       'Game is fun. I\'m giving it 1star because I can\'t turn off the notifications. Just turns back on and bothers me at all hours. Oh, and the stupid debris flying through stupid tunnels over and over and you can\'t progress until the debris breaks and it never will and wastes your gems.  AND the game won\'t connect to other wifi sources. Just your home so if your away you can\'t get daily rewards or play the arena.',
       'It dosentt work at all since last update 2 weeks ago,   I\'ve tried re-installing it on my Samsung galaxy s3 and my tablet..    It is still completely useless on both devices.    rovio needs to be better than this to its paying customers...  It is ignorant as a company to not even try to fix this problem. I know I\'m not the only one that continues to have this problem.',
       'The reason I gave low rates on controls and game play is you are not in control of either, ROVIO is. This is by far the worst game I\'ve played since I\'ve been playing online games due to how crooked and unfair this company is. Stop what you\'re doing ROVIO it\'s wrong. Kids play this game and spend their allowance on it. How does that make you feel ???',
       'The game is very nice.Pls do some minor bug fixes . When will the NFL hat sets will be for sale by using black pearls. Please fix the tower of fortune as the pig never allows to go above 2nd floor and it appears on any card I pick after that. Fix these issues. A very nice game.' ,

       'Fun and simple design, however the AI is a little dumb.  At the end of some games, it will call a draw by stalemate, even though you can clearly still pull a win.  Like one game it was just the opponent\'s king left, and I still had both rooks, a bishop, and queen.  It called a draw!',

      'I played it a long time ago and i stopted like 5 months ago. Then now i reinstalled it and:  1. I could not enter my acc  2. I could not connect to facebook or google play.  3. I had to pay each time i danced wich sucks.  Till that update this game was the best game/app ever. It was so fun and so great that I just wanted to play nonstop.  I mean before this big update u payed for a song and u could dance on it as much as you liked. Now it just ain\'t fun anymore.   Please return to the classic game or your gonna lose much much more players like me.',
       'I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.',
       'Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren\'t enough. And one of them didn\'t work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.',
       'It\'s fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I\'m bored. I love the songs and dance moves it\'s awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it\'s awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don\'t know how to dance then you should download this game it\'s perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.',
       'Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn\'t have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!',
       'I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn\'t make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun.' ,

      'I have only had this game for a few days, so I can\'t write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it\'s up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.',
       'On one of the quest, I think 11. There ia a syrange new animal and I went to the game menu for information and there wasn\'t any. It looks like a brown rabbit, I tried killing Rabbits squirrels and deer, but It wasn\'t the right animal! Is it in the snow biome?  Anyways hope you can help me and otger quest 11 users. It\'ll be great that when you get the same animal twice it counts as duplicate. For example "Wolf Common Duplicate +(however acorns). Thanks and the update is great!',
       'It just lags now. The new update made it to where my chat, my character, and my animations won\'t work. I run about as fast as a turtle, and I am not pregnant. Please fix!!!! I love this game. I have a few questions if you don\'t mind... Can you guys add in multi-player mode, like single player mode, that we can pick up our pups, it would be cool to add that option in the top left menu. Thank you guys so much!! Love the games!!',
       'I LOVE THIS!!!!!!! thank you, thank you, thank you! This game is so amazing. Are you going to add more creatures though? Maybe like wild chickens or somthing? And with the deer, I think they should run away from you like rabbits, cuz deer in real life deer run away from wolves and lynx.  I would also like it if you made a horse/pegusis/unicorn game(s) as well. That would be amazing.',
       'Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you for making this!!! I already installed it and I can\'t wait to play it!! Thank you so much TRG! (Turbo Rocket Games) üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ oh an one thing.. when your wolf is pregnant could everything be a lot slower & a lot weaker please? That\'d be great Thanks! üòÉ Oh, yeah also for the new game seasons, I\'m thinking.. Autumn & Summer! And I like how you can randomize the name! And for dog sim, I\'m thinking.. maybe Samoyed Husky & maybe Chihuahua! üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ',
       'Man i love this game!!! So much better than wolfquest!!! I do hope tht this game soon be added new things like more animal to play as, better in performance. The ad free guys...keep it up!!! Just wondering if there\'s a add as mate system in multiplayer in the future? Anyways....this is the best wolf game tht i played!!! Do hope tht you guys one day add more animals to play as (like a snow leopard for example)' ,

      'A great game, but WAAAAY  too many ads. Its the same thing after each level: AN AD. The game is fun, but its hard to enjoy when you\'re watching ads every second. And Im getting the same ads over and over! I want to rate five stars, I really do, but I cant if there\'s going to be this many ads in a game I think everyone would enjoy. üíõüíõüíõüíõ‚ô° (( pretend the hearts are stars )) I\'ll download the game again once I see less ads in your games, like My Talking Angela, which also has way too many ads. Please take this into consideration! Thank you!',
       'The game was great until they put the ads on there, there are too many and 90% of the time I try to "x" out of one, it takes me to the play store anyway, and the game freezes a lot more now. It\'s also frustrating you can\'t alter the decorations. Game needs some improvements, and I hope they address them because it\'s quite fun to play.',
       'This game would be a whole lot of fun IF there weren\'t so many ads! My niece is not patient enough to wait for stupid ads to finish, and u can\'t play the game until the ad is finished! Very disappointed!',
       'Love this game. Super fun but how do you get rid of ads? I paid for coins yet i still have ads. This is highly annoying especially if i can\'t skip them. Still love the game just not the ads :(',
       'I hate this game cause one, you can\'t even change the decorations or visitors. Two, you can\'t even get coins for completing a level and the daily wheel is rigged cause you can\'t get anything good. Three, if you watch a video for a reward or life, it never gives you anything. And four, they don\'t give you enough moves for each level, there are too many ads and everything\'s so overpriced. Hate this bullcrap gameüò°',
       'Ahh I think it\'s a pretty good game. This is the 1 st time I\'m giving my review. I loved the game.I\'m.now in lvl 179 this game is fantastic but the lvl r so hard as we increase our lvl. This game have a good graphics, game, control n plz make more this kind of games' ,

      'I like playing this game although i find that male characters do not have many long hair/ girl hair options available to buy unless you are vip or have diamonds. I think i speak for many people when i say that boys and girls should have more hair options from the opposite sex, for starcoins, as some people may take offense if they are strictly only allowed "boys hair"/ "girls hair" unlsss they are paying for it. I think you could inmprove further by making it easier to earn starcoins and another way to earn diamonds because many people do not want to/ cannot afford to BUY items in a fictional world.. Overall, i think this is a well rounded game, with a few improvement points, however i enjoy being able to have my own unique style in a virtual world :)',

      'Graphics are awesome, but the game itself is very monotonous. You can fall asleep waiting for something to change and make it more exciting. When a change such as an added bonus does come (bomb or a rainbow bubble) you realize that it wasn\'t worth the 20 or 30 levels you just wasted your time on. Progressive enticing events need to happen more quickly.',
       'On level 19 I scored three stars bit it shows only two. Aside from that, no other complaints... YET. I will say thank you, though, for not aggressively pushing ads, pushing to pay to extend the aim line. So far, its amusingüòÅ',
       'I like that you don\'t have to pay for the Assistance or no stuff on the game to help you advance like the Hammers the ball that matches any color different stuff like that you just got to watch the ads which is fine with me at least it doesn\'t cost you a fortune to play I like the color on the graphics are very bright and colorful and good for children to play no violent content to it whatsoever great game for everyone across the board',
       'This is a really fun game but my  my concerns are that when I have no balls left, for me it doesn\'t have the option to play a video to earn more but for my brother it does therefore it makes me start all over again. The other concern is that when I use a bomb for the chest it takes away a ball for example I have 12 balls when I use the bomb from the chest, I get 11 balls left which it doesn\'t do that for my brother. I hope you can fix this.',
       'Love it!!! I love how it doesn\'t get that more challenging. I\'m currently on level 75 and it\'s still not that difficult. I wanted something to just enjoy and not get worked up over by added tools/suspense/goals.',
       'I like it other then the fact of every time I got to shoot the ball goes slightly left or right not exactly where I want it. Might be my screen sensitivity?  Other then that I dig it!' ,

       'Sadly have to rate the app with 1*  I did 3 10x summons and got nothiing but 3 stars. It says you have a chance at a 5 star hero so id actually like a chance. And since I can get a 5 star, I can\'t win raids. Would love it if the game devs actually made the game fair',
       'Very fun, combines traditional match 3 gameplay with base building, character collection and deck building mechanics. Have not hit the "now you must buy things to advance" wall yet, but unclear if that exists. Like Candy Crush plus Lords Mobile plus any other collectible card/character deck builder game. Worth a look.',
       'I like it so far. Been playing three months. It\'s definitely a game that requires patience and a bit of dedication. I spent 5$ when I started, but honestly.... Spending money would seem like defeating the only challenge of the game. If you just buy the heroes, it won\'t seem as rewarding. I like my alliance and I\'ll keep playing until I have an all-star team. But I won\'t put in any more money.',
       'Raid system sucks. Use up all of my resources on reroll to find an opponent I can actually beat. Still lose to people with 4&5 star heroes at same team power. Opponent heroes attack very quickly, I\'ve had raid where 4 or 5 attack in the same turn and just get decimated when they are going to attack again in the next turn or two. Plus the risk and reward are very uneven, win 10 trophies and lose 50?' ,

      'Lemme just say ketchapp your games are soooo good!! And addictive including this one it\'s fun and ever since the first play I\'ve been hooked there are barely any adds and the graphics are phenomenal. I play it all the time plz don\'t change this, if u do your going to loose my five starsüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü.',
       'Most of my apps are from Ketchapp. Their creativity and style of games have just been wanting me to download more and more! Right now, Ketchapp is one of my most favourite game groups ever! Keep making more! I don\'t have any improvements, which means that their games are top notch!',
       'Patheitc. Being such a fast paced game you cannot have the blocks starting to move a split second before you\'re going to pass it. Makes the game pretty impossible from the first level. For something that was supposed to be fun, is more frustrating. You need severe luck on your side to get a win. Recommended do not download',
       'Its a good concept, but you need to update it, and make sure the blocks no longer move. Right now, it is by far the most luck based skill game. It is impossible to dodge the moving blocks, so if they are to move, they should move much slower',
       'This game can be a fun one but it keeps moving slow when I roll over about 5 or more of the yellow arrows and it\'s distracting. Idk if the game is new but could you review this please. Only one \'kind\' of obstacle is there. The black boxes. Otherwise good game. üòä',
       'I think it is a great way for amiee to get design for her Xbox 360 and help her get over with her anger with her sister and to help her to figure out what\'s the matter but what is the most important thing is to be a fantastic family together but why are we so lonely.... Well i think it is a great opportunity to make new friends to life' ,

      'Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh',
       'I love the game but its frustrating when you have all 8 Spartans and the sword guys get in the way so maybe an extras set of controls to control where your men start or something. Also for me the screen keeps jumping I try to look at enemy and I catch a glimpse but then it jumps to my side then back again and again and again please fix this.',
       'I wish there were more commands. Like maybe you could command the miners to garrison while the rest of the troops guard. Also, redesign the swordwrath helmet. It looks like someone spray painted their hair gold and then glued jewels on it. I also wish there could be more types of zombies. The idea of endless is cool but please add the zombies to the campaign.',
       'It\'s nice how you\'ve mashed together Stick War and Stick Empires together to make this masterpiece. I know its only meant to be a remake of the original Stick War, so I shouldn\'t expect too much updates, but it would be cool if there was multiplayer on Legacy. Keep the games coming!!!',
       'This is one of the most awesome game of all time and thanks to the creators you can play it on mobile too. But it still lack some awesome components, 1. Add Chaos Empire, 2. Add multiplayer!!! Overall still AWESOME!!!',
       'It\'s fun but you should  add  like  you know make the waves smaller on the zombie part it\'s hard to survive  and you die fast are 0it is hard you should  add a guy that brings zombie to the Humans to its in fair to the humans that the zombies have that thing that brings humans to him.' ,

      'The ball is super hard to control. Half the time I\'m swiping over and over again just to make the ball move. The game acts like it is super easy when it is the hardest task to do. I\'m also being spammed with ads because once or twice you restart the level because you lost an ad plays. Plys the ads take me to Google Play without me touching the screen or tapping on download. And since the controls are a nightmare because of lines glitching around the ball, (thus making it not move a single centimeter) I have to watch an ad. or lines just glitching themselves. And finally, this game spams me with notifications to "thumbs up" you and download your other games. I\'m obviously NOT INTERESTED IN PAYING YOU WITH ADS!',
       'The ads are forced onto you, and that is the worse system I\'ve seen yet. The controls are pretty good if you have an s pen. Most puzzles are way to easy.',
       'Don\'t get me wrong this game is fun and gets your brain thinking but I hate how many adds it has. Plus every time an add comes up it takes me straight to Google play with out me even tapping on it. It gets annoying. Another thing I don\'t like about this game is after a certain amount of levels you have to watch a video (add again) just to unlock more levels. And it does this more than once to. On the flip side it is a good game that gets the brain running and the levels do get more challenging throughout.',
       'It keeps on hanging or get slow and this is most I the times. Other wise it is good  But because of this problem I Am unable to play the game',

      'I think there should be option of chatting with guild members and other players not voice chatting but message ones.  There should be some research option in every guild or either there should be some Commander talent points by which we can increase some of the tactics of team & player.  Main Idea :  I think there should be some event in which 2 guilds can fight with each other & there should be option of ally & others.  I know it\'s kinda different game but it will make fun to game.   Overall this game is best and addictive,  Thanks for making this game.  Great effort by dev team.  Love you.',
       'The game itself is awesome, the gameplay is awesome. However I\'d suggest to make the following changes to make the game better. First I\'d add an event each week which would allow players to play different matches like training with bots or zombie apocalypse and many more. I know his might be hard but I\'m also recording free fire  for my YouTube channel ( Natan Prokop ) and trying hard with it. So it would be nice if you also added ladders and so you could climb to like buildings and towers. I\'d  also add revolvers, at least one type. Please sub to my channel and if you could add the things above that\'d be great',
       'This game is good fun but pls can u stop peoee from running u over as when 8 get in top 3 some keeps running me over. It\'s still and amazing games but when people run u over its boring and wish u could stop people from doing this   is th8nkthere u should maybe be able to drive places but when u want to fight they have to get out and shoot and have a proper gun fight . Overall this is a great game my favourite mobile game and it\'s really enjoyable. But pls can u make people not being able to do this. Thankyou',
       'I\'ve been facing a new issue. I always used to get a ping of around 140 - 180 ms with my Jio until day before yesterday. But, since then, I\'m always getting a ping of 300+ ms. This is really annoying. Close combats are pretty impossible. I\'ve checked everything. My network is fine. I get a better ping in other online games which I play. My friends have been facing this issue as well. So, it has become harder to play squad and duo matches as well. Please do something about this Garena. I would definitely drop a 5 star then.',
       'great game!  i love the game, its a great game to pass time, with epic moments like a random dancing gun and etc. I have played other games like this on my phond i still prefer FF. BG, the update was also good love the addition of the grenade. 1 thing that would be good to add is a chat box when players are still in lobby. I would have given this 5 star but There are still bugs and glitches',
       'This game is soooo addictive, i play like 40 matches on day. It would be cool a new map in desert or something like that. 4 stars this game because almost everything you need to buy with real money, but no money matters skill matters. Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!' ,

      'Hey RobTop, the game is ok, but there is one issue. im used to playing geometry dash with my samsung chromebook 3 (it doesn\'t have touchscreen) and when i press the spacebar on my computer (this is the same issue on geometry dash lite and subzero) it doesn\'t let me jump. And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.',
       'Got all the way to the end,  and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow,  and ended up having to restart all of the levels,  fix this,  it doesn\'t happen with the other geometry dash games,  just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted...  Fix then 5 stars',

       'I love this game just...can you fix one glitch? On the final level final area the wave is bugged ...when I tap it goes down by itself! Can you please fix it? I was trying over 3 hours to make it but I can\' t because of the glitch :( Please fix it.',
       'When I heard that this was out, I rushed to the Play Store, freed up my storage and installed this app. This is fantastic, as I had been craving for 2.1. I finally have a little sneak peek, although‚Ä¶                                           A) No Spider in main levels (Challenge excused) B) Ads‚Ä¶ugh                                                        C) No Account Loading (2.1 fixed)                                      D) Levels too easy and short                               It‚Äôs still great!' ,

Yes there are sone ads but they are smart enough to  use them in a creative way so that you are not frustrated with them and they go by fast or you actually use them to advance the game play WHEN you decide to on your own in certain situations.  Anyway, the game is kind of addictive and super fun. VERY cool fun game Congrats to the designers',
       'I think this game is awesome! But I have some suggestions. When you flip your tank in a battle there should be a button that ONLY works when you flip your tank you press that button and then it will flip you back on to your tracks so you don\'t die. Is there anymore tanks you could add? Because I think there should be a few more. There\'s should also be achievements when you do something specific. Maybe some daily missions that expire after Friday and start Tuesday. Maybe more maps to battle in. And more bosses to fight. And a little bit more health. And for each tank should have the health and firerate as it\'s level gets higher. And some more enemys. And a higher upgrade number like 20.',
       'Well takes to long to collect coins.and even though my tanks max it doesn\'t make it any further then when it was basic. The rank status has a glitch where it may climb up 3 or more times before it stays.

      'There are ads every time you load something new as a level loads, again right after that. which is mentioned in multiple reviews. The game crashes every few levels and the Levels are now designed to be use the power ups for which you will end up paying for more. The first one was such a great game and some of these are enjoyable,  if you have the patience to wait for them.',
       'Its very nice to play. But........there is a gate where they force to get 3 keys by either watching advertisments or asking facebook .   And the worst paet is that u can only watch ones a day which makes 3 daysssss.. Thats what i hate.',
       'The ads are ridiculous. It crashes after some levels. I loved wheres my water 1 because I purchased it. Wish that was an option with this one. I\'ll probably uninstall and look for something else',
       'Ok I beat it but it was to many ads so many that after every level it would go to the home screen but im just glad they finally make the next level free i remember a lot of complaints on that also i was like waiting at the end to do some type of celebration but i dont know if i should uninstall it or like is something suppose to happen',
       'Much like the first game, it\'s fun but the bombardment of ads and the inability to progress without either sitting through tons of them or buying keys is honestly is a disgusting slap on the face. I\'d honestly rather just buy the game outright.',
       'Omg because I can\'t save this app to ANYTHING I\'ve lost all my progress because my phone broke. And I\'ve spent alot of money on this. Why cant u ppl add google or adding facebook to save progress. What a waste. Fix it and I\'ll consider going back and spending more money to get ahead' ,

      'Good fun and very addictive. I see people moaning about the adds üòß but what can you expect from a free game? You get an add pop up after about 5 puzzles and to be honest it is only for a few seconds....just close it if you don\'t want to see them.',
       'Saw it advertised and gave it a go. Pretty fun, once you understand the tactics it\'s pretty easy but I still like it. If you want to waste time, but not on a Candy Crush rip off, this is it!',
       'Simple easy game that just let\'s me stop and focus. I don\'t find the ads too bad, gives me a break between boards. I like the occasional board I can\'t figure out right away.',

There is a bug that needs to be fixed it is on the gold game mode and it\'s the game that asks you to select which colours are more prominent out of all the squares but the coloured squares don\'t appear. Please fix this as soon as possible because I really enjoy this game.',
       'I really lived thus game because it isn\'t just tapping something but it\'s actually training your brand and improving your attention, memory, logic and your mind in general.

       'I just started playing but so far i am truly loving it! I\'ve always preferred games that teach and/or exercise your brain rather than the largest number of games available! Within a few rounds it is obvious this game will promote brain activity and help in every aspect of life! I highly recommend this üíó',
       'Simple but fun. These games are challenging and do make you use your brain without taking much time. You can play a few levels in just a few minutes easily. Ads are not too bad either, not too obtrusive and are sporadic enough.',
       'Cool game, but it has a few bugs. The one where items go through some thing and one of them gets lost - it doesn\'t show me the items going into the thing so all I can do is guess.' ,

       'It was good but then this happened. I was playing just like any other day. My phone had died while I was playing, so I charged it and left it untouched for about an hour or two. When I signed in, all off my progress was erased! Please respond and tell me what happened.',

       'Irritating. At first it gives you an option of playing a video to receive additional help. Which works only for the first time. Next time onwards no way to cancel the video in case you don\'t want to install it. It is so frustrating. Either allows to cancel or tell the users what to do next. Worst way of promoting other apps.',
       'Why ask people to pay to have ads removed and still have so many features that you need to watch ads for? It just seems like a rip off to me very disappointed in this purchase',

      'Really liked this when I first started playing. Honestly,there is no point me keeping it now. Can\'t perform my operations,as don\'t have bought staff and ward not on the appropriate level. I can\'t get any new staff,as I don\'t have enough hearts,and once you are at a standstill like this it take FOREVER to earn hearts back. Have loads of cash but nothing to do with it!! Game seems to be designed around getting people hooked initially (as performing operations etc is really fun), but then can\'t continue or progress without purchasing hearts!! Not wasting my time with it any longer.',
       'Your new update will not let me, or several people it looks like,  get into the game. I am currently doing the 12 day event and am on level 17 please fix it ASAP! I refuse to lose all my progress. This is the best game I\'ve had on my phone in a very long time.',
       'I\'m VERY unhappy!! I downloaded the update and the game informed me there was a problem with the download. I then uninstalled and reinstalled the game and ALL my progress was lost. Its back to the beginning. Worst part is I just spent 10 bucks on content...money down the drain. Lesson learned. It\'s a very good game but DON\'T spend money on purchases.',
       'I downloaded the game, it\'s a great game except for today when I did an update and now won\'t let me get back into the game. Also, really difficult to level up after level 7. Everything is really expensive. Not so much fun when you have to wait along time for money to accumulate. Might delete the game.',
       'Enjoyed it for the first two days, but it just feels boring now, the game is very very slow, and there is nothing new in it, similar type of surgery every time, and in most of the cases only we have to stitch the wound. Also the upgrade time for everything is too high, have to wait for nothing.  Read some reviews before in which the developer had asked to wait till the next update, i did so, and today i updated the game, and surprisingly, nothhing changed. Wasted my 203MB of data. Finally uninstalled it. Anyways thanks for the two days fun.',
       'This last update screwed it up so i cant get it to let me play it just sayd issue loading game and to come back later. I uninstalled and wont be re installing becouse im not doing all that hard work all over agian.' ,

      'I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it\'s meant to be "skillfull" but thats harder than skillfull, you can\'t even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don\'t care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.',
       'Why I liked it? Because it\'s a simple game that doesn\'t make you addicted to phone but rather enjoy going forward focusing your attention entirely on your finger. What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven\'t listened to this game\'s. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I\'m entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.',
       'This is game is ok if you are bored and don\'t know what to do.... however it becomes irritating after playing for a while.... overall its a nice game',
       'I would like to report a bug. When you pause the game, moving obstacles keep moving. Someone would use this as a cheat',
       'This is the best game to relax. But i have a problem i do i change the music there are some music that i like and i want only that to play so i request ro put a music option  Thank you',
       'It\'s ok because the controls are horrible I say that this game is very annoying and that you should not play it if you are stressed because it will irratate you even more it is an ok game if you are bored and do not know what to do' ,

      'I would rate it a 5 because I absolutely love the game. However, I tried to make a purchase and the money was taken out of my account and yet got screwed over with the currency in the game seeing as how NOTHING CAME THROUGH! So I lost out on money and didn\'t get anything in return.',

      'This game is the WORST!!! The controls don\'t work and there is not even demonstration on how to play. Also every time I retried to do it a stupid add came up. I AM FURIUS!!!! Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don\'t get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don\'t mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!',
       'It\'s honestly a fun game, and I\'d love to use it as a stimulating activity (ah, who am I kidding, it\'s just a great time killer), but it makes my head hurt-- and that\'s a problem. I\'m not even the type of person that is negatively affected by fast-paced graphics or rapidly changing colors. It\'d be five stars if it didn\'t give me headaches, but, for now, it gets three; good graphics, smooth gameplay, but no matter how great the app, it isn\'t worth physical discomfort. (Note: if you are looking for something similar, try "Run". It has the same sort of concept, but without the advertisements and headaches.)',
       'The game is stupid. I HATE IT. It\'s very annoying because of all the ads. It\'s sad that some people actually LIKE  games with all these ads. I mean, WHO would give this game 5 STARS? That would just be an idiotic thing to do. ZIGL, This game stinks. I mean, REALLY SKINKS. It stinks worse than DOG POOP. HOW DO YA LIKE ME NAH?! I\'m not trying to be mean ZIGL, But I\'m just giving my opinion. Thanks for reading ZIGL, don\'t get mad at me and go cryingüò¢ to your boss. Bye!!ü§ô',
       'tbh it\'s a really good app! The only problem is that it gets a little boaring after a while (obviously that\'s my opinion) And I don\'t know if it\'s just me but there or tons of over 30 second ads.',
       'I like this game  very much cause you dont know what comes in front of you which makes this game more interesting. But 1 problem is there that the second i crash to any obstacle an add popups',
       'I really do like this game. It\'s a good way to learn to think quickly with what side you should move to. Although, it would be even better if you didn\'t have so many adds, but every rose must have it\'s thorns and I\'d say the adds are this roses thorns.' ,

       'Found a game called "Infinite Balls" on my friend\'s iPhone, we loved it. This is the best Android alternative we could find, but it\'s not quite as satisfying. Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls. Would be nice to turn off the help lines, too.',
       'I found a bug. If u are playing offline and game is over, you choose to watch video ad while internet is off, it gives u the life anyways. Without watching ad. May b your developera forgot to call the reward video function on that UI\'s onclick () üòÇ. Overall a nice gameplay',

      'Love the game, easy to understand and they have videos on how to use the equipment and make ur farm expand. Also, their customer service is great!!  Recently my phone was stole and had to get a new phone.  Familyfarm helped me recover my farm within a couple of days.  Their services were quick and resourceful.',
       'I used to love this game. Played it everyday. Now things I\'ve purchased with the special currency have started disappearing?! I\'ve been in contact with support multiple times and they are completely unhelpful. They just repeat back what I wrote to them and say, I hope this helps! It doesn\'t. If I purchase a product I expect to receive it. I\'m not giving money to a charity this is a service just like everything else. Sadly, I have stopped playing the game now. Too many crashes and missing items that you work had to earn. Very disappointed.',
       'As much as I like this game Im thinking about uninstalling it bcuz its still messing up. Been having to repeat the Grape Jam making part bcuz it will say it needs to restart every single time it gets to the part it says "you wanna know a secret about my brother Daryll hes scared of chickens" part. Its a very relaxing FARMING GAME! Doesn\'t have all of the pressure the others tend to have...',
       'Fun game, but...What happened?  Don\'t like the snow,  it lightened all the colors of everything, they are not as vivid as they usually are.. With cataracts,  too hard on eyes,  all print got really small and can\'t read anymore.  Will have to quit til eyes get fixed.',
       'I love the game and have played it for almost 5 years now but for some reason it will not connect to facebook. Not sure what happened in the last update. Hopefully it gets fixed soon. I would hate if my phone got messed up and my progress is not saved',
       '. it would be nice if you could give the. game more expansion as with all the things we need to put on our farms there is not enough room to put things on the land we get. It is getting very frusting when I get videos and do not get. the. green tickets. for the. vidoes. Please fix it' ,

      'lnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'First, I don\'t like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don\'t like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you\'re just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!',
       'im not sure what\'s the cause of the problem but what i know is the sims\' act a lil bit freaky. i just redownloaded this game bcs i cant log in this game before bcs i just updated it. before this, the sims is ok, but now they act really awkward. when they\'re walking, they legs dont even move! it\'s like they\'re flying, plus when they\'re doing any action like "clean the dishes", they dont move, they just stand still in front of the sink. this is freaky. please reply to my review bcs i really want to know more about this. i really like this game except what i said above. this game is really addicting:).',
       'I like everything about this game no questions asked but i do find a few things annoying the main one is selling items in you inventory 1 at a time i wish there was a sell all for an item that would make this less annoying  to sell after house building and such. Please add a sell all oh and when do you think you can make more quests i really like doing them.',
       'Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools "playable",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it\'d be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.',
       'For the fact that we can\'t sell multiple items at once is a big downer. I have accumulated so many windows, computers, chairs etc with watching the daily news ads and it\'s a complete pain to delete 30, 50, 70 or even more! items one by one. Please consider adding this function in the app as it\'s in the real The Sims games.' ,

      'I totally like the game and all but there must be balance between different robots especially..... some robots have a big advantage like the haechi with 3 medium slots and its dash ability.. its like u cant even aim at it......  Also please remove the components so that everyone is able to buy newer robots... u can make them available in gold or silver or even workshop points',
       'They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It\'s definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you\'ll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.',
       'Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don\'t be fooled. This is a pay to win game.',
       'A great game that brings back the old Mech warrior days. One of the few good theme fps shooters on this platform that is "FREE". You can pay to win but it will cost you alot. Investing afew tens to smoother the growth? But you can still have plenty of fun without spending a dime.  Until it slowly draws you in deeper.....',
       'I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that\'s cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!',
       'This game is more geared to people who are capable of spending hundreds of dollars but it is still fun.  More non pay for content would be nice as far as more weapons.  But it\'s still a descent game for a pay to play even if you can\'t afford pay.  I think you should be able to upgrade more than one item at a time though.  It only allows it if you pay to.' ,

      'Pretty good design, but there is a cheater mode which tells you when one is wrong even if it\'s not apparent. So the fastest times are always really fast even for the hard ones. Also the ad bar is right below the numbers so you accidentally hit it when you play. Pretty sure that\'s intentional to get extra clicks, but super annoying.',
       'having lots of fun with the game, especially the daily challenges. But  ads that cannot be skipped pops up way too often, and its quite irritating. Also it would b good if u can ad d something like automatically mark (diff cotour, shade out) the numbers thats already been fully filled so we dont have to check it manually.',
       'I love this game. I can play nice and easy games when I have "brain fog" or when I\'m feeling better play the hard games. Still haven\'t been able to finish an expert one in under 30 mins although I will keep on trying.  I understand the need for ads but putting them between each game is ridiculous!',
       'The ads are too frequent (after each game play) very annoying, and you have to wait too long for the option to close them.  If I wanted those other games I would have downloaded them already.  I\'ll probably uninstall because of the ads.',
       'Over all....quite nice, challenging but not throw the bloody phone difficult. I really like the colour options. So far I\'ve completed all january and most of the up to date febuary puzzle. 8/10 always room for improvement but definitely worth a few moments here and there.',
       'I NEVER thought I would like this game. As it turns out it is so much fun...so far. I\'m just a beginner. Soduku is a very addictive game and thrilling when you "get it!" This particular game is designed very simply and clearly, which I like. The only drawback (hence only 4 stars) is that the "choosing" numbers at the bottom are spaced too close to each other and I often tap the wrong one accidentally, making my choice incorrect. They need to be a larger or thicker font or be further apart from each other. Otherwise I am excited to move my levels forward.' ,

      'If you\'ve liked the first game you\'re probably gonna enjoy this one. It\'s more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it\'s built around microtransactions so if you\'re feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don\'t understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it\'s likely you\'re going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren\'t aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don\'t expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!',
       'I was unable to launch the game for some stupid reason.....i sent several messages to the developers email seeking help,but everytime i get a same reply,asking me to visit the ea gaamjng website. It doesnt work,and seems like the message the developer replied is auto generated. Does popcap/ea rlly take time to fix it? Pls help me,i dont wanna miss out on speacial events. Thanks',
       'I like this game so much, but after the last update the game is a bit laggy, and I noticed that only the normal level music plays every time no matter what type of level I am playing. For example: the ultimate battle theme and the minigame music are all missing. I am playing on Galaxy A5 2017.',
       'EA doesn\'t care about the problems of the gamers. Im not interested anymore in this game after my profile has gone. 3-4 years of playing and buying stuff and most of my plants are in level 10 plus 4k+ gems, but with one stupid glitch, all of my achievements are lost. the game does not deserve even 1 star. I DONT LIKE TO PLAY FROM SCRATCH AGAIN & AGAIN. STUPID!!! u dont care about our feelings, all u want is money..',
       'Please help! The game crashed so I reinstalled it, now none of my progress is saved even though I\'m signed in to Google+, this is the 2nd time this had happened and I can\'t start from scratch again. Can someone suggest a resolution Please?' ,

The only down side is that the spins cost alot of coins and those coins can be hard to earn. So 4.5 stars i would rate it is that was a option but its not so i rate it a a big fat 5',
       'this game is the bomb. it is stupid that they asked you is this game beautiful, of course not, people die, and crack their necks, backs, and shoulder blades. This game all in all soooooooo fun and you should totally get it. just say no if you want to write a reaport on this game because it will ask you is this game is beautiful which it is not. GOOD LUCK, good  night, new york city. at late night talk show with stephen colebert......jk',
       'Would rate give starts, but the amount of ads is absolutely ridiculous. I\'m actually thinking about uninstalling please fix that. I know you want players to pay but in all actuality, it\'s quite stupid. Anyway, I do believe the game is quite fun',
       'I  am still going to keep this game but it definitely need a new update like Flip Master which is way better. On Flip Master you can upgrade your characters  So they are better and have more skill but on here they stay the same. The last time I got the game it was fun but this time the characters are stiff and you can hardly do any flips. Definitely keeping Flip Master as my favourite!  Fun game for people who: Want to mess around Need a game that doesn\'t take to much skill Need a game to to pass five minutes  Everyone who likes this game should definitely get Flip Master because overall it is so much better! Hope my advice helped for future updates',
       'Whatever they did last update broke the game for me, this is why I never buy anything in these games. No way to contact anyone to resolve any problems.  Game gets boring anyway',
       'Its a good game however there isnt a very clear plot to the game therefore it doesnt hook the player. Others may argue thaat the game is just meant to be  a bit of fun and there isnt supposed to be a clear storyline however to me i feel like its a bit boring. Anyway its a good game i would recomend it to my friends' ,

      'good improvements, make more tracks and some challenges to do. also remove rocket bunny cars and make just rocket bunny parts, make more parts, last exhaust is curved but flame goes straight, let us tune engine by putting different parts, like intercooler and turbo, let us change tire graphics, also let us put different wheels on front and back. this game got very big potential, try to involve some multiplayer, with ghosts and rankings, or open multiplayer room for more users live. high graphic option need very powerfull phone, my nexus5 doing 10fps, on medium i got stable 30fps. after update i had to buy last track even when i buyed it before, save file keeps my cars but no track data. let us make layouta for parking track. thanks and thumbs up for you :)',
       'love this game!! The control are easy, the graphics are amazing, really well made!!! I would LOVE to see some BIG updates soon, like able to somehow earn gold plz?!?! And maybe have a little more variation of parts u can change. And hopefully some new tracks will come out Right?!? But GREAT JOB to the developers and everyone who put effort into this game. Thx guys  :D',
       'Well... Ive bought all the cars that you can without gold... All you have to do is get to 50x and you will have around 120,000cr and thats enough to buy all the cars... And put what you want on it... Add more cars and add tuning, also remove the god damm machine gun exhaust not all drift cars do that... Fix it because its annoying and it also over powers the sound of the car...',
       'It\'s an okay game. The customization is actually really good and the physics aren\'t too bad either hit the optimization isn\'t great and there aren\'t that amen cars. Would love to see an MX-5 though. For some reason my upgrades don\'t seem to be applying though.',
       'Its got great potential, the physics are pretty good and the game stops lagging if you put it on low graphics. The fact there is only one option for steering is upsetting as i would prefer tilt steering to be a bit more precise but all in all its a great start to something big',
       'I know I said that this game is one of the best but I\'m not so sure now. One of the reasons for that is that the buttons need to be customisable while playing the game because I can\'t seem to press the turn button at the right time because my thumb is not where I need it to be ( plus I need it to be bigger) and you guys have retracted the CR mode for purchasing Nissan GTR r35 and Ferrari 458 Italia as well as the Mercedes AMG c63 and the BMW M4 rocket. Bring back the CR mode for purchase of these vehicles. At least for the Nissan GTR r35 please' ,

      'InstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (TVCD) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. VEarn points equals vac instead of like some of the others where it takes Toyo points to reach mac etc...Also, InstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TVCD) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to Bankk. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to WaIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'I just started playing this game and I don\'t think it\'s live matches. The opponents have ai style movements. I\'d like to play against other players in the matches. I\'ve been crushing the ai and want to try real people. But all in all it is very fun. Best badminton game I\'ve played yet. And most realistic too. I\'ve played badminton for about 15 years so it\'s nice to finally find a good badminton game.',
       'All of all the badminton game i\'ve played, this is the best. I love the graphic, the gameplay and all. But the rank, -50 when we lose is just too much. And the price of the equipment and ability is just too expensive. Especially because we only got like 12xp and 82$ when we win a game, its doesnt match with the those expensive things. So i hope you\'ll change something about this whole rank decreasing, the xp and the coins that we get if we win a game. Thank you :)',
       'i should have given 5 stars to this game very addictive and easy to play. But only thing it lags is that a player cannot update there game progress to any platform do they can play from same account if they change there devices or anything like that if this thing fixes up surely u guys are up for 5 stars...',
       'Early game just keep hitting short, AI will always mess up after 5... Trophies broken says smash 100 times at 99/100 smash 15 times in game trophies say 99/100. Hasn\'t changed so can\'t collect or move up for that to get what little money is given to buy gear. GEAR, omg wait for box to unlock, unlock gear, go to equip screen and still have to buy it, with what coin? forces you to watch videos for more chump change or pay real money for more.',
       'Wow. I have never played a worse badminton game. Hits always go out, the voice that yells "out" is insanely annoying after about 5 hits out, you cannot see the birdie in the air when playing through the story. Training level is ridiculous, "special shot" does not work and is unstable. First level is ridiculous, you lose one point and the game stops completely, the CPU trash talks you, and you never want to play again.  DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. Instant uninstall.  EDIT: thank you for replying to my comment so quickly. +1 star for customer service.' ,

      'It\'s gonna be better if you can do any useful upgrades or some useful items to help with flights. And do come out with a solution regarding zooming out and in. The missiles sometimes come out of the side of the screen too suddenly and we can\'t see and react to them. Maybe the screen should be zoomed to the part where the players can react to the missiles from side screen. Other than that, nice game.',
       'I don\'t expect a ton from such a simple game, but the controls are a little touchy. The thing that really upsets me is that I paid for "ad free", and I am still bombarded with ads. It\'s infuriating! If I pay for ad free, I expect zero ads. Not an ad on screen while playing, and a pop up ad every other restart. Very uncool.',
       'Ok so, I really enjoyed this game so I decided to pay in order to remove the ads... Turns out the ads are still poping up and of course there is no way I can contact them about this issue. Just a bunch of thieves.',
       'I played a few rounds, decided it was a great time killer but it has too many ads. Paid for no ads, still have ads. Update: emailed the developer, have not recived an answer, and STILL have ads. Next is an email to Google play, if they don\'t do anything I\'ll be contesting the charge with my bank.',
       'The game was super addictive, but the frequency of the ads during the game spoils everything good about the game. If i\'m going to play this game, the ad freqency must be reduced. I cant watch an ad after every restart. Thats annoying and very very frustrating',
       'It\'s just a constructive criticism. Now to be honest. I Uninstalled it within 10 minutes.  I know you need to earn money but you know greed is bad ALWAYS.  Too much ads every single time.  And touch controls also lil weak. Just so annoying.  Better luck next time.' ,

       'I love it and all that but it should really make some more valentine mini games because it just gets boring after a while and the thing i don\'t like about this app is that every time when you die it just goes onto an advert which are so annoying.

      'I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there\'s only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can\'t beat them! Keep making more awesome games!',
       'I understand that people want their games to be entartaining. But i dont understand why there is a thing that downgrades your item upon trying to upgrade it. I have soent the last 3 hours trying to upgrade my helm to lvl 15. Guess where it is now, On goddamn lvl 11. I have spent less time grinding mounts in wow than getting my gear to lvl 15. Stupidest thing ever. One tip. Play the campagin lvls to lvl 40. Then dont do campagin at all and run hell for gold and xp. Repeqt to lvl 80 and then get rekt by the stupid item upgrade system.',
       'This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn\'t always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing',
       'I really like the game. But there\'s one thing that annoys me: when I don\'t play this game for a few hours and then I do another battle in dungeon, the game crashes after killing last monster in that battle.  I found out that if I switch on mobile data it works. So I wanted to asked why is that. EDIT: now all works just fine. 5 stars',
       'I can\'t help but love a mobile game that doesn\'t constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it\'s tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.',
       'Excellent game, can\'t wait for a new map. There isn\'t any tutorials but it\'s quite a simple and fun game, you will catch on quick just be patient. Hope to see new maps soon don\'t make it too easy on us high levels now : )' ,

      'Why in the f**k does this require an internet connection. Fallout shelter is the same thing but doesn\'t need internet. Sure you can use internet for purchases and rewards but it definitely should not be required. Please consider making this offline compatible and I will change my review to 5 stars and a positive actual review of the game. Thank you.',
       'Definitely worth downloading and trying out.. It\'s just like fallout shelter but a little more. You can do a story line and attack other players rather then just sending people out and HOPING to get something good. It\'s a little slow at first but it\'s really quite alot of fun and the creators actually listen to its players.',
       'Good game but when your rank gets high all of a sudden most enemies are too powerful. Then it takes forever to gear up. Solution is to deliberately lose and lower your rank. Not good. Also you will find yourself with a lot of gear after you played a while. Would be nice to able to sort it, not only for your different warriors but also all the production gear. Would be good to be able to more easily compare gear in your stash and what your inhabitants are wearing. It\'s a bit messy now.',
       'Overall a great game, there\'s one feature though that I feel lets this game down. Just the small fact that a father can copulate with his daughter, then again with their inbred child if you so wish. I currently have 4 generations of inbred mutants running my castle, if anything the extra fingers actually help with certain tasks such as cleaning. Do you happen to have a designer working on this with the surname Fritzl?',
       'Deceptive in game offers.   Be careful of what you think you are buying.  I purchased a limited time offer to instantly increase the level of my barracks, vault and training room but after paying found out only my training room was upgraded with the purchase.  When I notified the game support of my findings they refused to upgrade my barracks and vault and are refusing to refund me my payment stating that I could have clicked some sort of link with some fine print stating upgraded rooms will not be upgraded by the purchase. I am contesting the payment and be careful of the offers you think you are buying because you may not get what you expect to get.',
       'Definitely P2W but if you have patience, there is a little fun to be had. I\'ll never spend a cent on this game and I know eventually progress will halt because of it. *Game no longer opens after Feb3 update. Sits at loading screen for longer than I have attention for. **And I\'m done. This game doesn\'t hold a candle to the fun and longevity of FOS.' ,

This is ridiculous, I shouldn\'t have to download anything just to get a gem or a rune chest or whatever the deal of the time is. I\'ve already asked the developers to fix it, but it seems it has fallen on deaf ears. So, yet again, I reiterate... Fix the damn problem or lose a paying customer.',

       'Love live love this game but I and a few people I know who also love this game have had a problem, the same problem. I just had 30 somthing gems saved up and I went to fight in the dungeon and just got two more gems and when I went back to the main game all but 8 gems where gone. This has happened to more than a few people and I believe it has to be a glitch that NEEDS to be fixed. It takes us a long time to save these gems. We play long hours to receive these gems and they are gone now. I have had people tell me they might quit the game because if it.',

      'Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I\'ve basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I\'ve got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.',
       'A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it\'s a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you\'ve done them and reached level 10 on both, there\'s really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.',
       'It\'s a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the \'colony\' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you',
       'Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON\'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!',
       'Well I was only shown this game last Friday and by today (Wednesday) I have reached level 10 on earth and Mars, both my rockets are fully upgraded. Nothing to do now, I thought you would be able to set up buildings and colonies and keep jumping to different planets. But no. If it\'s enjoyable but over quick, nothing more to it after you you level 10. Can keep taking astronauts up but to what end? You don\'t go no further, they make you money but you\'re maxed out on spending anyway. Shame, concave been really good',
       'A Ads. You get most of your coins by watching ads. So if you want to level up then be prepared to spend some time watching ads. Also an ad will pop up in the middle of the actual gameplay and throw off your rhythm. Gameplay lasts MAYBE 10 seconds, why they need to stick an add in there beats me. Good control,concept,gameplay. Simple and fun' ,

      'It\'s nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it\'s not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It\'s just not fair.',
       'I have now completed a 365 day streak... During this past year of playing this game daily, I\'ve had an idea. What if once you hit a certain amount of streak days you unlock a new something? Like a new pack or flow color? That would be nice so that you are working towards something. :)',
       'I loved flow free from a young age. I\'ve played until 9√ó9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I\'ve tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs',
       'Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.',
       'Edit: New horrible LOUD advertising you can\'t stop. Very disturbing to others and prevents usage around others.   Great puzzle games, lots of levels from easy to very hard. However it will eat your battery like there is no tomorrow. If your phone is plugged in, it will overheat. Use for more than about 15 minutes and your phone will burn your hand and shut down.',
       'Fantastic game. Real addiction game I\'d say. It\'s an awesome time killer. Different types of levels never make the game boring. Graphics is okay. Number of ads for a free to play game is less compared to other games out in the market which is a relief.Overall I would give 4.5/5' ,

      'I really enjoy this game, but I have found a flaw in the design. The game speeds up as you go and after a point it doesn\'t go faster, but after around 10,000 you notice the ball start to move forward on the screen and after about 20,000 you don\'t even have to move the ball to not die. It just misses the spikes. I know you might be thinking Its not on the leaderboards, but that\'s my next complaint. Im currently 6 on the leaderboards, but I\'ve gotten a better score and it won\'t update. I quite frankly destroyed that score and it doesn\'t show up. Thank you for your time and I hope this helped',
       'I think the game is good but the pop up ads make it almost impossible to play as when ever you about to start a new level pop up ads and some where even in the middle of the game and it happens to a lot of their games',
       'Game is great, far too many ads, after each level AND major issues with the videos giving rewards. I watched 4 and only received 1 reward which makes the game unfair and not worth playing.',
       'Really great game! I\'d definately download and it will sure be worth it. Really addictive and fun, usually a game you\'d play when you have no internet or when you outside. Ketchapp games always seem to please me!',

      'Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I\'ve never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.',
       'I\'ve been playing this app for a while now and up intil now I loved it but ever since the daily race-off challenge the game has been full of bugs. The daily race-off is a great idea but there are just too many bugs in it. I lose lives when I didn\'t even lose the race or I lose all my lives when I only lost one race.',
       'The game is my little boys favourite but the recent batch of adverts in game (Yahoo specifically) don\'t close - meaning you have to force quit the game. Lazy programming and terrible QA process from the developers. Avoid.',
       'Whoever decided to put the HW Poppa wheelie in the game is an idiot. Loved this game until i came across that car. Im seconds away from fully upgrading and moving on but i couldnt let it go. That car is a load of frustration.',
       'It\'s really really fun  ut the game restarts when I start an ad, or when it\'s finished with an ad. It also restarts after certain levels (depending on how longs it\'s been or what I lress). It\'s the only thinf that is annoying. Other than that, this game is addictive lmao',
       'Upgrading the vehicles makes little to no improvement to their performance, which makes the game too frustrating. For example you get stuck at exactly the same place without enough grip to go up a dumb hill no much how much you upgrade your car. There\'s no skill involved.  The game forces you to keep playing the same tracks until you get a better car.' ,

       'This game is kind of creepy... I was talking to a boy named Lucas and he asked "What is your last name?" Then I asked a girl named Jessica a question and she said "When is your birthday?" This game says it isn\'t looking for personal data but it is. It\'s not safe and it wants to learn more about people. I don\'t trust this game! Also if someone mentions \'Dr.Wallace" ask them who it is and then you will see what I mean.',
       'If you download this game and you are reading this , ask someone who Dr. Richard S Wallace is. I got the name and went to ask her to "tell me more about Dr. Richard S Wallace and it wouldn\'t let me, it kept kicking me out. CREEPY' ,

      'I really like the concept of this game. Unfortunately I am not prepared to even give it one star as it doesn\'t take you long to realize that the only aim from this game is to extract money from all who wish to play. Pitiful really as there are many similar games available which you don\'t have to feel pressure to buy',
       'The game is very fun, but I only get to play one or two hands before I have to wait another hour to get more credits to play. Would be a lot better if you got more credits for wins or had free play. I\'m not spending money to buy credits. Also, it would be great if there was an option to turn off the fancy card movements; I get motion sick from it.',
       'If you like solitaire you will hate this game. This isnt a game of skill or strategy. Its a sort of a matching game and it becomes clear quick that they are going to drain you of your seed currency quick so you can start spending real money. You will just pull card after card that you dont need.',
       'Its great game love that I don\'t need Wi-Fi to play it. But some of levels just get so impossible to beat you spend four day on one level. Make the crops pay out more and levels make them a bit easier make the challenges be the hard ones.',
       'Great game concept, great graphics, however it really sucks that the amount of coins required to play  increases too much and you don\'t get enough coins. I wish it didn\'t cost so much to play, it seems like they just want you to actually buy more coins. No thanks. Will be deleting.',
       'Great solitaire game! If you want to play on and on, you need to buy extra credits, which I did because I could not wait+their CS is amazing!! Games are fun to play and challenging... You could still play without buying credits,,, it would just be slower. Highly recommended,! So grateful for fantastic customer service' ,

       'Used to be my favorite game.  The latest update completely changed the character of the game.  The ball is faster, bouncier, and everything is smaller, and it all adds to just randomness.  The AI got worse at the same time, so it\'s not really harder... just more random.  I now find that this game stresses me out instead of helping me relax, so I have to give it up.',
       'Stale gameplay with nothing interesting. AI sucks. Lv 27 has little difference from lv 1. Too boring. Time to rid this trash from my phone at least I bothered playing with AI till lv 27. I wonder if there is even a end game or maybe the level keeps increasing aimlessly without any interesting change. Bored to max.',
       'First version was my favourite thing to play but the update looks like a different game entirely. The ball got too small and the physics became stupid and random',
       'This game is really bored! I\'m so stress! I lose and second you lose again why Glow Hockey is bored a bored game! But like it. I\'m nervous to play because you lose... but I\'m happy..',

      'I hope in the new update you can upgrade the engine and body kits as well. That would bring back the fast and the furious Season 7 track 6 nexts to be check it says three lap but you are basicly doing lap 2 twice and it says wrong way. Third lap starts when u finish three laps and doing 4th lap counts as 3rd lap. Needs to be looked at this is cheating  u guys are doing',
       'Fix the detection when you touch/hit in perfect drift mode. There\'s been hundreds of times where ive definately not hit and yet it ends. So Infuriating, love the game but that one detail could definitely be optimized better. The drift should not end unless you actually hit and it screws up your direction. 4/5',
       'Game is really good. Best drift game I\'ve ever played on the phone. But there are small bugs in the game such as season 7 second perfect drift track (should be Turin) the race is not 3 laps. Even though I finish 3 laps it didn\'t finish the race and it gives the "wrong way" warning Everytime I pass from start/finish line. I hope you can fix this.',
       'I love this game and so do all my mates. It dose have a few light glitches as most games do. I would love a night track of some kind in the future but other wise great game all together. Also out of all the drifting games this is the best one at of all of them.',
       'I love this game! The cars are some of my favorites. There\'s only a couple things I would like to hopefully see in this game. First, if you could upgrade the cars more and you didn\'t have to use the cards. Like us money to upgrade engine parts, buy body kits, etc. And there\'s some kind of a sound glitch. The sound stays on for just a few races and then all of a sudden it stops working but I can still play the game.',
       'Hey! Absolutely awesome game, dev! Ive been playing it daily now.. But id like to report some bug. On season7 career, perfect drift race on turini south, the game reads me in the wrong way when i was crossing the finish line. So the race would never finished altough the time is still decreasing. I need that 1 starr üò¢ Xiaomi Redmi 3pro' ,

       'Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you\'re given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.',
       'The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item.',
       'Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.',
       'Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.',
       'Annoying ads with sound even i off d sound , if u need a life they forced u to see the ads first there is no option to buy energy power by u\'r point still u want then they are selling in $ ... and lots more... Bad experience i m going to uninstall the app.' ,

      'Yes this is addictive, yes it\'s fun, and it\'s great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don\'t have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it\'s not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it\'s clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.',
       'I really liked the game but I hate the pay to win more stuff and all the ads and incentives to go download and play other games. I know that\'s what mobile games have become but I want to just enjoy a simple clicker game in peace without a thousand tie ins and adds ruining my sense of immersion. Oh vanilla cookie clicker how I miss you. The game itself is great. Tying in a leader board with a game that incentivizes you to pay real world money to increase your earning rate in game seems messed up, but once again that is what mobile games have become.',
       'Everyone I know plays Cookie Clicker (CC), definitely too much. I absolutely refuse to play Cookie Clicker myself. I am not one to compete over single-player games, so I was looking for something similar, a game that none of my friends play. AdVenture Capitalist (AVC) fit the profile and is a simplified version of CC. I\'m not saying that AVC is more rewarding than CC, but it isn\'t nearly as convoluted. It\'s a simple game for those of us who want to minimize our time spent on phone games.',
       'Since the last update on don\'t get as much return back from my businesses as I used to. Of it isn\'t fix i will be deleting my game soon. Was fun 2 play, now it\'s not worth it.(edit) I\'ve had this review up for a month and not a single dev has looked at my review or care. They just want your money and do not care about their players.',
       'You should be connected to facebook. So when people change from iPhone to android, we can keep our levels. I just had to restart again and I had 6800 lemons and not much longer to complete the game. What an accomplishment I\'m going to try to receive this time',
       'Way way WAYYY too laggy. It\'s an easy casual game though. I wouldn\'t say it\'s "fun" but it does pass the time and make you want to achieve the little goals. Only goal, make more money in game. That\'s it and you achieve that by not even playing the game so there\'s no challenge whatsoever. Uninstalled after first day reaching about 500 Trillion and force closing 100 times.' ,

      'This now a prize example of a freemium game that needs a premium option. I would gladly pay ¬£10 as a one off purchase to do away with the need to say for lives. In the past games worthy of a one-off fee would offer it and this issue such game that should consider it. I will never pay for any in app purchases on any game and I am sure I am not alone. This has 5* written all over it but the long wait times and exorbitant cost of energy replenishing means this doesn\'t get anything higher than average.',
       'Loved the game but if the life was free this waiting for minutes to play again is not cool. Also noticed if you have to score more than 1 goal and you make a mistake you have to start from the same goal you already scored. If we can get the requirements before each challenge that would make it much more fun otherwise I love this game a lot keep updating for more seasons. Thank you. I am on Level 560 with 1257 stars I am awaiting Season 29. If you can also create a full football game with same concept. This is a Great game!!! Thank you developers keep developing Great games like these!!!',
       'Wonderful! Game by first touch   But I can\'t wait till the hearts üíö are filled!  So Reduce the time. Improve this game more and more and create a new exciting games.  I have finished 390 levels. And I have a doubt what is the last level and what happens after it? All the best for ur future and I\'m a biiiiiiig fans of u guys!!  Hands off',
       'SCORE  HERO RULES This game is so sick dudes. It so cool that this gives us idea that how to play soccer or football. Gameplay is so smooth . They players show us some epic skills . It has an commentary. The worst part was the heart. I can\'t wait till it get refilled ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ this. Graphics are great . Just reduce the time of refilling the energy . Overall this game cool. Thanks for the game FTG.',
       'Most irritating game plan.  Have any one ever seen in real game that if a player miss a goal then all the previous goals are cancelled? But in this game such thing is happening. You should not cancel all the goals scored only for a miss or loss of a ball. Goals should be saved and to be started from where it stopped for missing a goal or losing a ball. Developer should take it into his consideration.',
       'I am crazy about this game, I cant stop playing. Real time killer. The only problem i have is the fact that we get rewarded with credit not that often and its very little compared to cost of the additional upgrade options of the hero player. Finally the game can be very frustrating at times as the cpu makes unneccesary and stupid foot mistakes leading to start all over again with that level. Thanks' ,

      'Fut can not be developed with this building team. Football is one of the most attractive games but how this fut goes? In Vs attack mode, what the hell meaning do chances have? Players must creat chances by themselves not the game. You must let them play whole game and create the chances by themselves. EA is a big builder in football games and develop a lot but have you ever thought how your fut only stands at this place?',
       'overall its an awesome game great experience. but Its hard for free to play players to complete and go through the events..... the icons are too difficult to get please make them a bit earlier to get, it will be awesome to have them in the team.... its difficult to get elite players in a pack of 500 fp totw pack n few others packs too... the vs attack mode is great.... EA please make sure that the free to play players to get a good experience of getting new and better players....',
       'Can you please make the following improvements then your game will rule the playstore. 1) Make your graphics good. Sometimes one can\'t even recognise the player. 2) Add  real referee there on the pitch. 3) Add a feature of commentary in all languages. 4) Add an option of the records of every individual player\'s stats, goals, assists and all. 5) Add some weather conditions,night mode, attendance. 5) Add a number of more celebrations and especially player\'s signature celebration.  Please take a look on my review and make the game more beautiful.',
       'The game is nice for every football fan.... Nice controls and good graphics...events are awesome... There r different game modes.. the only thing that I don\'t like after the recent update is that while playing campaign mode there are many stages which requires u to be in certain lvl in VS mode.... I think both the modes should be independent.. otherwise it\'s a fabulous game... The most awesome football game in play store right now.',
       'Dear EA Sports: We really want to get the icon Ronaldinho but its changed and its very hard. Before we were required to have an 89 ovr+ team with atleast 5 Brazilian players but now it has completely changed. Now we are required to have a 98 ovr+ team with atleast 6 Brazilian players. I hope you make the icons a bit more easier. Thanks‚ò∫',
       'overall it\'s a pretty good game. with one exception. the game is clearly slanted, by that I mean it keeps making the clear shots I have on goal either hit the cross bar or the vertical bars. I don\'t mean every now and then I mean like three times with the same player on the same shot on goal. I shoot hits cross bar,get rebound, hits cross bar,get it again hits vertical bar. then of course the goalie recovers and grabs it. all of this I with in 5 to 7 yards from the net. this is happening  every game for sure for me. and fix the attack mode. there is no way a goalie that is like a 70 something would be making the kind of stops the folie are making against me some sure but not all of them . especially when my keeper is an 83 and he gets scored on like he is retarded.  it is making me want to delete this game fix it and it\'s 5 all day.' ,

      'Really fun game. My 2 year old adores Hank. The only thing that I feel is missing is a way to save your progress to the cloud. My phone needed to be reset a couple times and we had to start over. Didn\'t mind so much because hank as a puppy is much cuter.',
       'I like this new update. Hanks now have His own happy meter like Tom and Angela. Nice. Also this is just my suggestion. Can you guys also make My Talking Ben and My Talking Ginger. Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that\'s it. You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It\'s not fair. Lastly good job guys.',
       'Great game, probably best talking animal game out for adults n kids... but sometimes u watch a video so u can spin the wheel n win gems or coins but the wheel not always comes up... ive had approx. 20x it has not happened in last 4 hrs... would like it redeemed n fixed plz...',
       'I like my talking tom and I download this one thinking that it will have some fun stuff like play mini games I know this one have a picture feature but man only eat, pet, sleep , and pics? Sorry I am re-downloading my talking Tom and start from scratch that only take pics feed and sleep on this game',
       'My three year old grand daughter got around my password and charged $40 of in app purchases and did a monthly subscription, too. I have gone through everything to try to remedy this, with no help from the customer service from the this apps developer.',
       'I\'m only on level 1 wrong so correct me if im wrong but I thought the game was a bit boring at first and the game doesn\'t seem to give you much choice andyou have to folow what it says but if you enjoy the game thats great! I also did like that u got stickers for taking pics. I did end up having to uninstall the game as it took up to much storage space D: Overall I did really enjoy the game yay =D' ,

      'Would be nice if there was a redo button for the last move. I\'m very quick when playing and I often misplace a block. Also, why does the Apple version have stars and the android version doesn\'t? I was trying so hard to earn enough stars to buy the colour packs on my iPod, and I got quite disappointed that I can\'t do that on android. I guess I\'ll just delete the game off android since there\'s really no goal to the game now.',
       'Very fun and addicting but nice calm relaxing game. Ads only happen after each round and not a big deal. If you want to keep playing this game FREE then add up with the package. Quiet whinning about ads. Someonbe has to pay the creators for this game including the upkeep and updates. How else will the creator make his money? 2 choices, either gets ads or charge to download. So I can deal with the ads. It\'s a FREE APP.',
       'Really annoying when ads pop up and you have to start from scratch. That\'s really my only complaint about this game, but it\'s a big complaint. It sucks to feel like you get really far and then all of a sudden it stops in the middle of the game. This is a finished game not an interactive advertisement where it stops you from going further.  In all honestly it plays simply and I like it a lot but it needs some improvements.',
       'I like the game a lot but it would be nice if there was a way to take back or redo your last move. There\'s been times that while I\'m playing, the piece I\'m placing ends up 1 square off from where I wanted it to go. Situations like that is where a "redo" or "do over" option would be very helpful and greatly appreciated. If you were to add that, it\'d be a 5 star game for sure. Also some other colors options that didn\'t cost money would be great too! Other than those couple of things, keep up the great work you guys!',
       'Kind of fun just trying to beat 1010. Played 5 times maybe and more than doubled the score that it says 1% get to..... not very fun after beating it. After the targets destroyed, what else do you aim for?',
       'Way too many ads. I just need something for my fingers to do while listening to podcasts but this constantly interrupts my listening pretty much after every round. I really liked the game but I have had it with thw ads and am uninstalling. It\'s just not worth it.' ,

      'Awsome game. Completed all levels without any hack jzt waited  for hope   ( the lives ) evrbdy shld try this. Sry i gonna uninstall this app only bcoz i finished all levels. Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.',
       'The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don\'t get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new "enemies". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you\'ve lost some lives. But that\'s not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.',
       'I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It\'s more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.',
       'Completed all but just couldn\'t get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I\'ve ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.',
       'I love this game üòçüòç it is my favourite but.... I don\'t like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it\'s a great ideaüòãüòã btw i loved it üòçüòçüòç ill give it 5 stars thenüòäüòä',
       'I believe this app will quickly become 1 of my most played. It\'s very enjoyable also gives a good challenge. I\'m getting the hang of the controls in time I\'ll get better... I hope lol I would recommend this app definitely 1 of the better 1s of today üòç üëç I would give a üëé to the wait time if you loose too many lives you will then have to wait 17 mins to try again. I just started so this is my opinion so far. If I find more good or bad I will then update my comments üòä' ,

      'Was an awesome game Very addictive game! Was well done.. until the update. Needs more pens and new themes as I have thousands of coins but nothing left to unlock. Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don\'t register as pineapple hits for the counters. There\'s a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it',
       'Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.',
       'Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.',
       'GREAT!... but the coins are a bit hard 2 earn thought the game is very addictive and the adds are not very frequent but they do appear on the bottom of your screen while playing thought there is a no adds purchase also the only purchase in the game the thing I like about the no adds purchase is that sometimes it will let you get it for 50% off so it is only one dollar instead of $2 (USD). The game has a lot of pens and I so far have unlocked a bit more than half and have played the game a lot of the game. But really needs an update.',
       'Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.',
       'The games controls,  features,  graphic are really good and can\'t get your eyes off the screen once dart playing BUT, They are advertising companies that pop up there add moment we open the app... And whenever huge pineapple is on the move these things pop up please patch this immediately.' ,

      'Cool passtime. Several elements I recignize from series like Sid Meiers Civilization or the Settlers. The fights turn based combat. And the guilds are surprisingly helpful. The game offers some pay to win stuff but nothing you cant get with a little extra time. Nice game. 1 star taken because i have some issues launching it sometimes.',
       'Nice game, plays well. Only when you scroll the screen it keeps making a clicking sound if you touch a building doing so. Also, some free diamonds once in a while like in clash of clans would be nice. Give some free stuff then maybe people will be willing to spend some money',
       'The latest update "moved" Rogues from 1st on the list to "hidden" way back in the rest of the troops.  Very frustrating.   ALSO the fact that we can only "trash" or "use" rewards given to us in the Expedition.  Shows how worthless many of the rewards really are.  If we could sell them or trade them with others?  That would make them actually valuable.',
       'This game follows a typical progression. Early game moves fast so new players stick with game. Then there is a rapid slow down in the game where you either a. Spend real money to have anywhere close to the same sense of progression or b. Wait and wait and wait. Very quickly the game turns into logging on every 4 hours just to tap the screen a couple times and then exit. Eventually you won\'t play for a few days or maybe a week and then you log back on and tap the screen a few times and see that nothing has changed durring the week so you log off because you made no progress and are now bored. So you go delete the app and then write a review as honest as this one.',
       'I want to like this game, 4 star potential, but daily mission is impossible to complete.  And pvp should be separate from pve.  Combat is terrible, opponents are always a level higher than you so it\'s a waste of time creating an army just to have it destroyed in 1 battle.',
       'The game is challenging and fun. Gave it 4 stars because you better not depend on the people who made the game. They are snotty and snobbish. They told me they couldnt be bothered to answer "basic" questions. The players have been super nice and helpful. The graphics are so, so amazing.' ,

      'EarnFreeMoneyüëá DownIoad "UNOPAY" App Enterr (ALEXA) to Start Earning So far so good. Fun way to get Money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. 3000 points equals $6 instead of like some of the others where it takes 3300 points to reach $1 etc....Also, TOYOCASH App is very reliable in paying you when you redeem to Paypal. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Paypal for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for adding some fun to my day.',
       'Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it\'s so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I\'ve had to start all over again... but the fun continues!',
       'This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don\'t play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don\'t make us wait foreverrrr!',
       'I\'ve had to start this game all over from the very beginning 3 times. After working hard to get all the way to the top sharks, the app will suddenly refuse to connect to your Facebook account and want you to start a whole new game. Waste of time. Very frustrating. Not enjoyable at all. Find a game that\'s enjoyable. This one is definitely not fun.',
       'It\'s a fun game and I\'m enjoying it. However, I\'ve come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.',
       'Fun time waster, can get quite a lot sunk into it, and get e erything without paying up. Glad its always been grindable. Just has had trouble connecting for saves. I lost everything a couple years ago before they had cloud saves... They\'re here now and aside from a logout/in they are wonderous afaik. Good stuff!' ,

      'AMAZING! The graphics are stunning and the story lines are so good! Just 2 things I would improve to make the game even better:      ‚Ä¢Less time to wait for more keys (4 hours is quite long).      ‚Ä¢The diamond cost is really high considering the fact we get one diamond after every story chapter we play and having to wait so long for keys.  Other than that...AMAZING JOB WELL DONE!',
       'I like interactive stories and some of these are cool. A bit more personalization and less predictability would be nice, but I enjoy the stories. I dislike that many of the choices you have to pay for but it IS a business so I understand. It\'s just that other story apps weren\'t like this. Then again, said apps weren\'t as attractive as these. You can tell a lot of work goes into them visually speaking and in the programming. The stories could get better though.',
       'Great game but the only downside to it is, some choices need more diamonds to make it all interesting whilst you only earn 1 dimond per chapter which basically leaves you with no choice left other than reluctantly pick the one that is free.  If there could be more diamonds to earn ,without spending real money to purchase game ones, it would receive higher rankings of course.',
       'Love the story lines, the graphics, all of it. Would have liked to seen something that can be done to regenerate the diamonds or do something to earn more diamonds other than finishing a new chapter earns you only one. Did experience my diamonds disappearing and the timer of keys along with the keys reach zero and not returning. Hope this issue will be resolved. Other than these issues really enjoyed the game, it\'s highly addictive.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a few days, so here\'s my review. I enjoy the stories even though they use a lot of archetypes, and I don\'t mind waiting for keys. The biggest issue I have is with the gems and premium choices: not only do the premium choices cost an unreasonably high amount of gems, but every time there are choice options with at least one premium choice, the premium choices are always presented as the better ones. This is less like making my own choices and more like reaffirming my assumption that the premium choices are always the better ones. I\'ve come to the conclusion that I would rather pay once to have this app installed rather than install it for free and pay money for gems just so I could pick the premium choices.',
       'I love this game, it\'s so addictive and the artwork is really pretty. My only real pressing complaint is the length of time it takes just 1 key to generate. If I had to wait that amount of time for my keys to completely refill that would be fine but about 1.5-2 hours for 1 key seems like it takes forever. Overall it\'s a super fun game and I would play for hours if I could!' ,

      'Bought all the babies when I first downloaded the app. Everything was working great. So when the most recent (3) babies were available for purchase I bought them, but now those babies don\'t work!.... I\'ll give five stars when you get them to work. In the meantime, I think I should get a refund on my money.',
       'Downloaded this game for my daughter and we never got to play because the game will not load. It gets stuck on the bottle screen and then has a black screen after that. She has Nabi tablet, so I will keep the app for now and just disable it. Please fix soon!!!',
       'My daughter loves this game and plays it all the time. I just bought her all of the last babies today for her to have them all and the bottle freezes and she can\'t play with her new babies. If someone could fix this for me or refund me that would be great. I just got 6 new babies and she can\'t use any of them which is ashame cause she loves this game.',
       'Bought the game early on, then after an update with new babies they mixed the new babies in.  So you are left with a child constantly wanting the new babies.  A horrible money grab.  Otherwise a fun game.  Shoyld not show the locked babies mixed in with purchased ones.',
       'Dang, I wish the purchases I made on 6 more babies for my daughter would just work! She loves the app, but gets frustrated that the whole app freezes when she clicks to play one of the other babies. Wouldn\'t recommend this app because of that... it\'s just stealing my money..',
       'Like the others have mentioned - good game, daughter loves it but bought the 3 new babies and now itnjust freezes any time she tries to select them. Waste of ¬£1.59 or however much they were and no means of refund or correcting it.' ,

      'The game is ok at least when I get a chance to play it -there are way too many ads every time i click on a level to play an ad shows up even sometimes during when i play an ad shows up. I strongly recommend that you do not install this app',
       'Th is game sucks! It\'s a total waste of time and it is so boring. This is the worst game everüò°üò§ Also there are so many stupid ads! The taxi is so slow and when other cars get in front of you it\'s even slower. I would not recommend this game to anyone!',
       'First if all... Its down right BORING! Also there is adds after every single level! Sometimes the adds are weird and innaproprete! I do NOT reccomend this game, download at your own risküòï',
       'I liked the game and all but there were way to many ads. Every level there was a thirty second video playing and some of them were extremely inappropriate. I got a bit impatient waiting for all the ads to end but I liked the game set-up. I think that was a neat idea. I just think it would be better without all the interruptions',
       'You see I\'m not the only person  who wouldn\'t recommend this game. Adds constantly and how could you play they game when it\'s so tricky to drive. I thought it was my bad driving but it seems I\'m not the only one who disliked this game.so  please make some improvements. I could drag you through all the bad things but I won\'t make you suffer. So I will give it sadly a üëé.',
       'I think it should be a bit more realistic and by that I mean more people on the streets; if you crash into someone, that person would come out of their car angry and cars get damaged when you crash into them. Maybe, to add a bit more reality to the game, you could add the money that they pay you to the levels. Apart from that it is an excellent game. However, some people, when they get in a taxi, chat away to the taxi driver.' ,

      'Good Game a bit challanging, easy control , Good to play it',
       'Game is good but sometimes the level of ads get silly. Answer a phone call in the middle of a game and you have to see an ad, often messing up one shot in the process.  Also game gets hung when displaying ads.  Over all good but needs improvement on stability and toning down ads a bit to earn better rating.',
       'The game is a good time waster & I find myself playing it quite often.  However I always leave the game feeling frustrated at levels that cannot be completed without using coins. I have read many other reviews saying the same & responses from llyon saying all colours are random. If that is the case then I need to have a go on the lottery because I can predict what colours are coming up towards the end of the levels & they are always repeat colours of those that cannot finish the level.  Of all the bubble shot style games I\'ve tried this is my favourite but just let down by this small annoyance. On top of this the frequency & length of the ads is getting ridiculous. I fully appreciate that these games & developers require income from ads but they are actually dominating the app now.',
       '2/15/18. In reply to Developers response; As I stated in my original review, I DO understand the need for adds, but this game not o my have ads in between levels and to earn bonus bubbles & level helpers, it has ads after before & everything.  And giving a reply that players can get ad free play by buying the premium play is not a good business reply. Every player now a days knows that we can no longer play FREE uninterrupted games, we have to PAY for everything. As the apps say, the download is free, but we all know that the play is not.  Thank you for at least responding to my review. Most developers no longer address their negative reviews so they can improve the game experience. ******************* The game itself is fun and challenging at times, especially when it gives a colored bubble to shoot, but none of the bubbles in the puzzle match.  The biggest negative is the ads. I understand the need for adds, but to have ads immediately after a level is won and then again after you click next and the 30 second ads when additional shooting bubbles are requested is a bit extreme. It\'s a level win excitement kill.  I don\'t mind a few ads, but the amount in this game is to the point where it\'s borderline excessive.',
       'Good game but the advertising is just a bit too much. I know it pays for the game but so many 30 second long adverts is overdoing it. There is one for Wishes that is particularly annoying.',
       'I freaking love this game!üòç Sometimes,when i get nervous about something,i play this game and it makes me feel less stressed... Sooo cool Download it and i promise you won\'t regret itüòÅ' ,

      'Game is really great! Amazing graphics, amazing cars, lots of continuous fun! A few bugs and connection issues which can be frustrating at times especially when your team depends on you for points. Though I believe they\'ll eventually fix these issues as this is the BEST racing game out there and it\'s only getting BETTER!',
       'Love the new updates where you can carry on the trials without having to go back to the garage. It would be nice to able to trade up your keys i.e 500 bronze for 10 silver or 100 silver for 1 gold. And the stage 6 upgrades be not double up or get stage 6 upgrades relevant to the cars you have.',
       'Best onlin3 mobile racing EVER!! IM A VETERAN GAMER AND THIS GAME IS HANDS DOWN TOP OF THE MOBILE RACING GAME. Great detail and graphics. Precision tuning. REALISTIC CARS IN ALL ASPECTS. PLUS an added Bonus is it features FAST AND FURIOUS AND CARS FROM THE SERIES. I need access to more cars. Its so hard to get more silver or gold to get newer cars updated.',
       'Customer support has won me over. They have literally provided the best resolution can think of for the game removing all my fusion parts. Hopefully I don\'t have many issues in the future but this one time moment has definitely filled me with confidence that in future, zynga will fairly sort things out.',
       'Excellent graphics and easy to upgrade but the live races leave something to be desired,  you start off the same way you do on single player mode against the story line but in live race it makes me sit at starting line for almost 2 full seconds before I can take off. I have unlimited data and full bars with my service, defiantly not worth the effort on live races.',
       'Prepare to have your pockets emptied with very little support if anything goes wrong and trust me it will. From losing fusion parts to losing your account and connection issues that have been present for the last few months. Don\'t worry though you will get bombarded with cars that cost a small fortune from events and a new special offer every now and then tempting you to pay more money. If anything ateast the devs are consistent and are very good at taking your money off you but putting in as little effort to fix things as possible' ,

      'I absolutely love this game. It\'s so addictive and a really good game if your bored. I\'m really curious to find out what happens when you have collected all the balls, does the game just carry on or is their more challenges?? Overall, this game gets five stars from me üòö',
       'Its a really good game. The only thing is, that I wish there was maybe some instructions that appear at the beginning, because I didnt know that you couldnt hit the black lumps etc. Maybe if you add little phrases that say what to do and not to do, then it would be almost perfect.',
       'Great time killer I love everything about it and it is a great game to wake up to. The only down side is that you fall off the ledge and that makes it harder to dodge the black. Everything else is 5 stars so that is what I think about roller coaster.',
       'This game is amazing! It is addicting and fun to play!! The only thing is that I was hoping for some sort of introduction to the game, to tell me how to play etc. Also, I was hoping to be able to choose what kind of ball i use, the black one is plain and kind of boring. But overall its an amazing game!!',
       'Its really fun and addictive. Awesome game play and good for passing time. Not always so friendly to my battery and too many adds. Other than those little hick ups I absolutely love it.',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH   I love this game because it is exciting and addictive, it has easy controls and it is so many different colors as you move on and on! Try to beat the next high scores and HAVE AS MUCH FUN AS I DID' ,

      'Stupid game. I spent so much time on it building just for a higher leveled person to come in a destroyed it to point i couldnt rebuild. Not worth time spent on rebuilding things if higher leveled people just continuously attacking lower leveled teams and wiping them out. Only shows u have to have money to play this game to level up to defend. Im not spending a dime on this retarded game',
       'I\'m impressed. This really is a fun game. And with all of the aid, events and rewards there are you really don\'t need to pay to win. There\'s a lot to learn so you may feel a bit lost at first but it keeps the game from being repetitive. I didn\'t think this would be a 5 star game but after 2 weeks of playing I can tell you that it certainly is. A+ üíØ',
       'Great graphics and addictive but not alot of explanation on how to do things. Too many updates in short amount of time,  too long of a waiting time on researches. You need to spend money if you want to keep up with the rest and you\'re placed up against players alot more stronger so always have to go protection buffs. Not an even playing battlefield.',
       'A whole lot of effort to get anything done. They\'re constantly trying to sell you things at obnoxious prices and if you don\'t buy them you\'re setting yourself up to be abused by those foolish enough to waste their money on this game.',
       'Really not happy I have spent loads off money over time on buying gold in the game and packs.. I have had major glitches in the game that have made it a waste of my time and money I have lost over 10 advanced teleports on the game and when I contact your customer service team they don\'t even reply to me.  I find this very bad customer service and that all u want to do is take my hard earned money and not even reimburse me what I have lost.i really enjoy playing this game but this is making me want to not play any more',
       'I really like the game. I think i would rate it higher if i could learn how to use points during battles. Thats a big part of game that i just cant seem to figure out. DONT CONSUME OFFICERS THAT YOU MEANT TO KEEEP' ,

      'So nearly perfect. I tried several and they all had too many ads... some (others) with startling loud sounds that you couldn\'t turn off! Very upsetting! THIS game, however, has only ONE ad at the start of each game, and allows you to mute the sound "once" for all future ads. It\'s simple to click the ad off before the game commences. *wink* The background is lovely and the graphics are wonderful! So relaxing. The happy little "card dance" animation after each win is nice, as well. Thank You!',
       'I grew up with all I had to do so day long was teach myself how to play Solitaire.  It\'s not like I didn\'t have friends but was bored with the ones I had to play with.  I think the game is very realistic.  And completely challenging.',
       'I usually don\'t play games on my phone and this is the first one that I did play electronically (I usually play solitare the " old fashioned " way, lol, with a deck of cards) but I\'ll have to admit that I Iike it much much more than I expected to....I enjoyed playing!',
       'I\'d really give it a 4.5 - plays smoothly and easily, ads are expected in a free game and these are easily disposed of.  The only downside for me is the "wins" are too frequent - not realistic.',
       'Is there a way to get rid of ads? I\'d even pay a couple dollars to rid of them. I\'d give this app a 5 if it had a way to get rid of all the ads. They are very annoying and you don\'t enjoy the game that much then.',
       'For some Unknown reason Queens Game~Solitaire Won\'t Work On My Tablet Any Longer, And THAT Was My Favorite Version Of This FUN, ADDICTIVE & RELAXING GAME.  That being said, out of Many, MANY Other Versions I Tried Out Recently, I like this the most!  What it Would Take To GIVE IT THAT ONE OTHER ‚≠êWOULD BE TO ADD "THE MAGIC WAND" TO THE GAME!  I Miss That Cool, Game Winning Feature. A few more SUPER COOL THEMES Would Also Be Needed... there are some nice backgrounds, but most of them are just plain, solid colors, which to ME is kind of Boring.  One last thing is How SLOW The Auto~Collect Feature runs at the end of a winning game~ Sure, it\'s a matter of a few seconds but why not Pick Up The Pace~ It Seems Like FOREVER When You\'re Sitting There  & Watching, Waiting For The Next Hand To Be Dealt!  Maybe it\'s Just ME!?  HOWEVER,  WHEN I NEED TO PLAY~ WHEN I GOTTA HAVE A FEW GAMES IN ORDER TO CLEAR MY MIND & RELAX... THIS GAME IS WHERE I AM & I\'M THANKFUL THAT I FOUND IT!  Thanks To The Developers!' ,

Without this problem the game is so nice and the gameplay,  grafics, controls evrything is too good. Everyone should download it if they can tolerate ads.',
       'It\'s funny that u cannot play offline because u are reqiured to watch ads everytime u complete a mission or fail couple times. Reduce the amount of ads and i will download this game again. No one wanna finish a mission in 30 seconds and watch ads for the same time. Ridiculous',
       'So much ads !!!! And it sticks to only one level only worst game the game always crashes and it stucks to a particular lvl only we always have to play it online  it\'s not offline !!! Worst game ever!!! Pls don\'t download wastage of your storage and internet data!!!',
       'You need to put a checkpoint everytime the player loses the ball so they wont start over again. And please do not put too much ads on the game it\'s just making it worse. Make it an offline game why because you are just making it an online game to put ads on it. This sucks.',
       'Internet problem The game is good but it suddenly ask for internet connection to continue its. Very bad fix it and pls reply to me',
       'Nice game but hell lot of ads i can\'t play it consistently as i get interrupted by ads frequently and is so annoying that even though i like the game, i only give 1 star rating! Please reduce the ads and don\'t be very greedy developers' ,

       'It\'s a great game and a virtual version of fifa 18. You will enjoy it as you are guaranteed good players. It\'s not just about the draft you can open packs and trade duplicates.',
       'I think it\'s a very fun game. But only thing I would like to see is maybe a market where you could put up duplicates for a price rather than having to trade with 25 million people just to find someone who is willing to buy. It kinda gets annoying when you\'re trying to sell some duplicates and all you find are cheap people who waste time. Also, there should be more packs being released because of how many cards there are. It\'s just too hard to find a card you\'re looking for, through trading. Secondly, if the market idea doesn\'t work there should be an option in which you can talk with the trader and/or be able to set a price of the duplicate you\'re trying to sell rather than wait for people to make unreasonable offers.' ,

      'I wish I could post pictures, but the game is too easy. I beat the first 2 levels both on one attempt. Though I am an experienced geometry dash player. But if I can beat a level first try, not knowing the course at all, that\'s some easy stuff. I highly recommend geometry dash sub zero though.',
       'I love every Geometry Dash version! And this one might be the best. But my only downfall is that the music, which is freaking awesome,gets ahead of the actual gameplay and I miss my jumps. Plz fix and I\'ll rate 5 stars! But keep up the good work!',
       'Great fun but needs more levels. I laughed when I saw a review made by an idiot because he said this was a copy of the Impossible Game LOL it\'s the other way around, dumbass.',
       'Hardly worth downloading. I love the full version of the game and figured this world be similar, or at least have some interesting levels, but much to my dismay it does not. The levels are easy and somewhat boring, which is unfortunate because Geometry Dash is usually neither of those things.',
       'I think it should be more easy it\'s kind of hard and RobTop Games can you plz ohh plz add more levels to try   ok so now I\'m even more upset it keeps on not jumping when I want it tooo!!! I will and I mean I will keep lowering the stars until you fix it!!! I am fed up with this but I will keep the app',
       'This is the worst game ever but it\'s so good even I have to pull my hair out of my face for it! It\'s the worst but the best at the same time! Even my mom plays it! And she doesn\'t have any games on her phone except this.' ,

      'This game is AMAZING! With that said, heres the problem. Stop with the obnoxious freaking monkey!!!! Im sick of him popping up every 30 secs with no skip button. Ill be getting up a good tapping speed and it will jist ruin it by popping up with no option to click off. If i want to explore the game further, i will, at my own pace. I dont need you to hold my hand. Its really spammy and ruining the game play. Tutorial based gaming is a waste and a headache. Also its laggy. Please fix this. I LOVE this game and i want to play but the spammy monkey is a deal breaker.  Rant over',
       'I like the game very much. I bought the starter pack for a dollar 99 and removed ads. After the update came out, the one that and the ability to watch a video to double your rewards, your offline rewards, I click to watch the video and then the game sends me to the store to buy a gem pack. I click off of that and then it says the video is not available. I assume it wants me to buy another gem pack in order to enable that feature. I will not be doing that as that is ridiculous. I already bought the starter pack. Please fix this as the game is very fun and addictive.',
       'The game would be generally fun if it didn\'t shove an ad down your throat every 20 seconds,  and how about the tabs that want you to buy something for the app up constantly covering the screen from time to time.   If you enjoy ads popping up when you try to go to the menus DURING A TUTORIAL then by all means get this game.',
       'One of the most obnoxiously money grabbing games i played. Commercials popping out constantly, and the rewards for watching them are more often than not just worthless. It\'s a shame because the game is quite fun to play otherwise',
       'It was fun, but im slowly starting to hate it. One moment youre just looking at youre businesses and the next they are shoving ads down your throat. I shouldnt have to look at ads unless i get something in return.',
       'taps to riches is a really good game with understandable controls constantly having events   and if you play this game you be the mastermind of the world. the richest person alive with a monkey as a partner greeting you when you come home from jail. : )' ,

      'I like it a lot but I hate how the drawings are so linked with pokemon go. I hate pokemon go!!!!! The graphics are okay but I wish they were a bit better quality. It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn\'t like how easy the drawings were and I don\'t think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn\'t recommend this game if you don\'t like colouring. It\'s ok!!!!',
       'I think there should be more cartoons to draw and color. And it should not always be right colors to trace it in. Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn\'t color the whole background, because what if you didn\'t want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!',
       'I love this app! It\'s sooo good. And its brilliant for when your bored. But its a little hard sometimes to go over the lines with our fingers as the lines are so thin. But overall I think it\'s a fantastic app!',
       'It\'s a great app however it keeps crashing and I have to start the drawing all over again. The whole app stops and my drawing starts over and it\'s really annoying. If this gets fixed I will definitely rate 5 stars',
       'I like it because it teaches young artists how to draw animated characters such as Pok√©mon Avengers Princess and loads more characters from movies like Snow white and the seven dwarfs and Toy story 2! Overall it is a brilliant app for boys and girls of all ages!',
       'It\'s great except when I\'m learning sometimes the next step button blocks some of the drawing so I can\'t see what to trace over plz fix this' ,

      'I really hoped that this would be different than Episode, Choices, or Chapters, but nope. This is even worse. The fact that the game doesn\'t even give you any diamonds to start off is bad, but it\'s ridiculous to not even be able to choose the special choices because they require a lot of diamonds... So disappointing. Solmare, for the love of god, please be unique! Give the readers more tickets and diamonds and give us the ability to earn tickets/diamonds through watching videos! Seriously! Don\'t download unless you want to go through a circle of pain.',
       'So far it has been interesting. As far as these games go, at least they have challenges that allow you to win some diamonds unlike choices, choose your story and episodes ( with chapters you can watch videos, but that only gives you one diamond, so this is still better ). The characters faces are a bit odd though, but there is a similar problem with  episodes and choose your story',
       'So sorry if I don\'t like it but it doesn\'t depict reality there are. Many skin tones in the world but you choose to put two skin tones on here and to be perfectly honest I bet I could make a better game that depicts real life',
       'My problem is why is the black characters so ugly... I mean the other characters are just decent but the dark skinned black character looks lik trash and I get mad because the other ones don\'t...',
       'Love great stories very mature Really like the chapters can\'t wait for more as the game progresses thank you and works very smooth download fast just live it',
       'The characters look terrible and they talk too much, rarely make my own choices. The Alice girl focus too much on guys and sex which was annoying.' ,

      'Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can\'t without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.',
       'First up the images used as what the game looks like are fakes. I saw too many polygons.... (Shudder) Secondly there is no start menu. NOPE! Just some fancy loading screen and boom you\'re in the game without a chance to look at the controls. Plus your first mission is ruined by the tutorial at the worst places on the track.   Bad game knockoff. If you download this just delete it. This game is EXPLICATIVE',
       'Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that\'s excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.',
       'Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?',
       'It would br better if you could exchange coins for diamonds, not just diamonds for coins. I also have a screen shot which shows that I should be the 1 place, yet another car which was behind me and crossed the line 1 sec later got the first place :/',
       'So many ad\'s, there back to back ad\'s. When I am finally able to select a race, guess what...another ad pops up and takes me to the play store to download it. I go back to the game and I gotta start all over again from the first screen. Ad\'s ad\'s ad\'s I was only able to play on the first day I downloaded it, after that..... Ad\'s ad\'s ad\'s                    "AD\'S!!!".... But i did like the game when I played it' ,

      'Game is fun but just as others say it takes forever to get through a round due to big pauses between questions. The ability to write in your own question sounds interesting but I don\'t think it really adds much in the end. The game is worthwhile when it\'s on sale but don\'t pay full price for it.',
       'Just stuck saying waiting for other players when me and my son are both connected and there isn\'t any other players. Won\'t start because it\'s saying that',
       'This game is the best family interactive game I have ever had the pleasure to play   The developers should design more like this ie catchphrase , family fortunes etc  Fantastic game play  We have many nights of good fun   Can\'t understand the poor reviews they obviously haven\'t got a clue how to use or play the game   A decent Wi-Fi connection from the router is required don\'t blame the game   It last an average of 40 minutes a game which is good going   Extremely happy please develope more quiz games like this',
       'Finally a spiritual successor to buzz',
       'Great app work perfectly with the game',
       'Think there should be a kids mode.   I have been playing this game with my husband and my daughter who is 8. She really struggles with some of the questions. I think that it is good for her to be challenged by the game but at the same time it is meant to be fun for her too. Please can a patch be added. If there is an option for this please let me know. Thanks' ,

      'I enjoy the game--very much in the vane of classic sonic racing games, with a lanes mechanic and some mariocart-esque abilities. The micro transactions speed up game play and can help progress your character, but won\'t make up for being a bad racer. Instead of transactions you can often watch ads. Typically, the ads are a fair trade off, but some are nearly game breaking. An Airbnb one is running right now that cannot be exited after watching on my OnePlus 5.  Otherwise, 5 stars.',
       'Decent game but why are there so many rings? I mean literally I have 1000s and the only thing it seems you can spend them on is upgrading your characters. This nesitates you having other pieces for each character which take ages to get then when you finally have enough of those bits it\'s like 1000 rings to upgrade them... Which is absolutely nothing... Give me something else to spend them on or up the price for upgrading characters... Obviously.',
       'An addictive game that never gets old. With the unpredictable players and teir upgrades, there is always a challenge. I have a few friends who play this game, and while it\'s fun to watch them, being able to play against them would be amazing. Also, the graphics for me are a bit janky (the device is fairly new) and isn\'t pleasing to the eye. The smoother, the better, like chocolate.',
       '*Sega does it again*  I am really happy about this game! Some may not like it, which could be reasonable, but I love it. It\'s fun, fast gameplay with killer music. I\'m very happy that they made this game the way they did. I was skeptical about it, I\'ll admit, but was very pleased with the results. It doesn\'t have all the super fancy bells and whistles, which is good. It\'s simple menu and play system is very easy to get a hang of. People who played the first, or even the second sonic dash can get the controls down. I am very pleased on how easy it is to get characters and level them up using a simple card style, collect a certain amount to unlock and upgrade, instead of the DREADFUL wheel in Sonic Runners.... *shudder*  Anyway, it\'s a very good game and the only problem I have is I enjoy it too much....',
       'Very enjoyable play on the Sonic Dash formula and the microtransactions aren\'t as obnoxious as they could be. Occasionally get a loading screen bug that necessitates force quitting and restarting. There are so issues with certain sound effects playing even when SFX is muted and when connected to a Bluetooth speaker all sounds play even when muted.',
       'Yeah great game and all but trophy system is unfair. Also a big bummer is that the game keeps crashing, sometimes even before u have entered the game. Cannot start a new match cos you are still racing in a match u never actually even entered. And due to this u now have lost 1 of ur reward star runners goes... Disappointed!' ,

      'Purchasing the other ponies is worth it. Don\'t know why other people are complaining. It\'s only 5 dollars, you could get a DQ lunch for 5 dollars. Anyways, game is amazing. What\'s cool is that you can reset your progress so you can have fun all over again. Amazing work Budge Studios!',
       'This game is my 5 yr olds favorite thing to do during trips. She loves the music and animation, and the gameplay is entertaining enough to keep her engaged. It\'s definitely worth the few bucks to get the add free version.',
       'Installed it, launched it, after the bungie screen was presented by a full screen ad for some game involving a woman + handcuffs + panties. Not a good look for a game aimed at children, my 6 year old was standing behind me.',
       'Remove the paywall and just charge for the game, it\'s worth it and people will buy it. But the way you can\'t unlock ponies without paying is insulting. Such a shame... I\'ll be sure to avoid any games you make in the future. And, yes, that\'s a bit harsh. But if we all don\'t stop letting devs get away with this kind of thing every company will turn into EA and will ruin the fun of gaming.',
       'I had purchased the $4.99 to unlock all the ponies for my daughter, but all of a sudden they became locked again and saying I need to purchase then when I have already. Very disappointing.',
       'Ads popped up every 45 seconds. I timed it. Made the game useless for my son (4). And he really wanted to play it too.' ,

      'Really fun.  But crashes constantly on my Galaxy S5.  Then I have to force stop the app, and restart my phone to get it working, for about 5 minutes....  All have to do to avoid ads is not restart until the respawn timer clears, so they aren\'t that bad, and it\'s really cheap to turn the ads off.  I would happily do so, it the app would run for more than 5 minutes.  If it wasn\'t for the crashing, I would rate it 4 stars at least.',
       'Love playing this game...very addictive! I would rate it 5* if there was a reason for why you level up and why you keep spinning for little lightening bolts when you do level up  as once you have bought the small amount on offer they are no longer needed. Add more things to buy and give the game a reason for levelling up ü§òüèº',
       'Smooth game. Plenty of fire ball options and endless level options but after every death you have to watch  15 second ad. EVERY DEATH. Which just spoils the experience and all. I understand ads but like after 3 deaths that\'s fine. But after every death and some are unskippable. So download of you have patience. It\'s worth it of you have time to spend',
       'A wonderful aesthetically pleasing game.  Get as far as you can, with as many points as you can while unlocking different fireballs and portals. I would love to see how this game evolves in the future and i have not seen as many ad\'s as people claim so perhaps that issue has been resolved? Working perfectly on S8+',
       'TOO MANY ADS, every time you die you get an ad and that\'s just being money hungry what ever happened to games without long ads what\'s the point if you\'re gonna make a game and 1/3 of the gameplay being ads. Perhaps every 10 or 20 games, or just have those small popup ads, but don\'t ruin the gameplay because you want money. I\'m uninstalling and I\'m sure other people are as well.',
       'I hate this game because it literally makes you watch ads every single time you finish, and doesn\'t reward you for it like some apps do. I would not recommend this at all, especially because when you close the app to try to skip the add, you open it back up and it says it\'s stopped running and closes itself again because you didn\'t want to watch the stupid advertisement. If I could give it 0 stars, I would!!' ,

      'wow ! why is this game so good!! addicting I got a problem ! to many ads! I under stands u need money but you should put purchases so u get some more money !! and also I want to have new characters and themes that will be cool course I nearly got all but I haven\'t! also change rating to pegi 3 I know there\'s the characters can be a vampire but srsly IT\'S NOT SCARY what is with wthat!  sorry it\'s long but thanks for taking time and reading bye!üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÅüòÅüòÅ',
       'It\'s a very good game! I got my boyfriend hooked on it, but my problem with it is, sometimes when I start up the app it sits on the beginning stage of the app?? Like when am I going to be able to play again? Was just updated? So I\'m going to have to delete it and start it all over and re gain my high score??',
       'There are wayyyy too many ads seriously. You don\'t need that many ads for your game you have enough money you have a bursting game brand . Most of your games don\'t even have as many ads. Every failed turn "here\'s an ad buy my game!!!!" No!!!',
       'The *only* complaint is the frequent,  long 30 second ads after nearly every single round.  It\'s quicker to close the app and reopen,  but either way,  it\'s annoying enough to not want to play the game.   Other than that,  this is a fun game! :D',
       'WAYYYYY too many adds. There is an add after EVERY round. That\'s annoying. The game is great, but that\'s NOT how to get people to purchase it. Please consider lessening the adds to maybe once every 5 minutes, and not every 5 seconds!!',
       'This game is super fun...what kills it for me is 1-2 ads between every round.  Really!?  I think this game can be financially supported by an ad here and there I am sure.  One every couple of minutes is absurd.' ,

      'I love Beat the Boss 4! But there are some things that I would like to be fixed. For example, when naming your custom boss, the name duplicates. The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can\'t go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.',
       'I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i\'m asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting',
       'Too many ads. It\'s annoying especially when you are connected to the internet. The King Boss is not working and is always saying "Something went wrong, please try again later" and crashes the whole gane. On the other hand it\'s a super addictive and fun game to play.',
       'This game needs a lot of work done. So many glitches its really weird and hard to explain the glitches that happen. One of them was the screen uncalibrated itself an it was moved to the upper left side , an the right side was just black . idek if that makes sense but it shouldn\'t happen.',
       'The game is amazing, but it is pathetic at the fact that there are ads popping up every 2 minutes and there\'s no way to remove them... I would be happy to pay to remove the ads, I won\'t be playing this game until this is fixed. I remember playing this game years ago, I understand you guys may be making more money from displaying ads than people paying to remove them.',
       'I really love this app it is so fun to play but there is a glitch that happened to me and my brother when we were playing, the friend thing didn\'t work and we were logged into our accounts and the loading screen was just black outlines and Joe\'s face. I\'m pretty sure it didn\'t load like that before but over all, 5 stars! Have a good day/Night!' ,

      'Graphics were generic until now for x86 devices. Thanks for that update. And that moving data to sd card, it is really appreciable since now a days even 32 gb  not sufficient. Hope other game developers get inspiration from this. And downloading just updated part is also an improvement instead of downloading whole data again. 4 stars because this game just wont allow to play older version once it finds out new version is present.',
       'Best driving and racing game on the net. There is so much you can do, it not just " drive a car on a track and try to win", in this game you can choose your path on the track, perform unbelievable stunts and trick\'s, take out other players and cars.  The game play is absolutely great and the graphics are f***#&@ awesome, the only step to fallow in the graphics is realistic and their close to that now, love the game, the only thing I would change is I would make it easier to get car\'s, now the bikes and car packs instead of having to work really hard to get them or spend a lot of real money, granted the real money goes to development of the graphics and game, I would like to be able to get the car and bike packs a little bit easier. Definitely a winner, ü§©',
       'Asphalt 8 airborne is a very exciting game to play. The addition of bikes is mind blowing. Wish all time limited events could be on mobile data rather than wifi. Thumbs up gameloft for an exciting game. After the recent update of this app it keeps crashing with a pop-up message "unfortunately asphalt 8 has stopped working". Please fix this issue.',
       'I\'m addicted to this game, I love it. And with this new story mode update  I\'ve got more excited, I won all the starting races and now waiting for the refill. Only one thing that is negative, it is the upgrades are too much expensive and takes a huge time to gather coins versus the escalating events and this is depressing. I hope that game developers will fix this problem and make it fair enough.',
       'They fixed commercial black screen bug. Now i can play normal again. Wish longer time for events and R&D, because of work i dont have enough time to play. Money rewards sucks. You cant buy cheapest part from one 24h event. If you spend real money, you are way above evryone else. Also, slow cars are useless. There must be better way for multiplayer ranking.',
       'As racing games go, this is probably the best. The graphics, sound, gameplay are excellent. Race solo, against friends or the world. The variety of ways to race is big. The selection of cars and now bikes, keeps getting bigger. The only down side is buying something from the shop or on offer. I purchased a special offer and never got it. They got my money, I never got the goods. Trying to get in contact with them is a joke. All replies to my emails were automated responses telling me to do the same thing over and over again.' ,

      'Amazing game. Me and my friend spend hours on it. I get to shows him my mods. He has none though we both have completed the levels. The game NEVER AND I REPEAT NEVER gets boring. Definitely better than the angry birds series must download. The only problome is the metal flap things don\'t work correctly. They just float in midair.Apart from that  Please make a new selection of levels. My life depends on it!!!!',
       'The game and level desgins promote and foster a great degree of creastive thinking. With very unique mechanics and obstacles that actually require thought and consideration when building. It has great art, along with many bonus levels and content. Fun game overall but level experiences do wildly vary sometimes. From simple to extremely  difficult, sometimes you win by mer luck and not strategy. Along with all that I don\'t know if anyone else experienced this but the levers on lvl6 were buggy and never worked. All in all good game to play.',
       'FIX THE ROAD TO EL PORKADO I swear this is frustrating to the point of unplayable. No, those levels ARE unplayable. They cannot be done with this platform glitch at all. Also, sometimes in sandbox mode when I click the tick it disappears when it hits the ground. Occasional and not as game breaking or frustrating as the moving platforms not working but still',
       'Great game but el porkado is broken I can barley ever get any crates, they are in levels that are literally impossible to complete, fix now also the king pig system is garbage. I accidentally piled up about 100 of each cake and then spent about an hour dragging my finger hundreds of times. Power ups are too rare. There should just be a feed all button or something, can I please improve the king pig system',
       'Generally great, but destroyed by graphics/world modeling glitches that render levels impossible to complete! Generally involving trap doors that aren\'t in the right place. Frustrating. AND the new cake race won\'t unlock rewards- 24000 hrs to go apparently so I can\'t play more levels.',
       'I would give it a higher rating, but on those levels like 6-18. The button activated doors and platforms don\'t work right and they glitch out. I\'ve been able to get through a few levels without the doors but on 6-18 you can\'t complete the level without this door working. Please get this fixed' ,

       'Game was great and haven\'t stopped playing. Just bought the new Note 8. Transfer all files over from old phone. Logged back in to Dragon City through Google games and guess what it has reset my acvount. I was level 17 and now I have had to start again from level 1. But when checking achievements all my achievements from my original account are all there. WHERE HAS MY ORIGINAL ACCOUNT GONE. Wil give 5 stars if this is fixed...',
       'Where is support? I have gem confirmation enabled but it\'s just taken 70 gems without warning. I\'ve also done extras to win gems but they haven\'t been added. There needs to be a cancel button like on food etc. Need to say time it will take to hatch eggs etc. When doing challenges it should say exactly what you need to do and spend so you aren\'t guessing. Besides these issues, I am really enjoying this game. It\'s easy and fun. I just wish you didn\'t need to spend so much to get further in the game.',
       'This one of the coolest city building games I\'ve ever played in my life, and the various types of dragons blows my mind. I play this for hours and hours and it\'s insane gameplay because the choices of breeding dragons is vast. I also love the fact that you can battle with the dragons currently available to do so. I 1000%+ recommend downloading this game, and I\'d give it 5+ rating for EVERYTHING. BEST GAME EVER!!!!!üòÉ',
       'I love this! The events are hard to progress in but not so hard that you will want to punch your phone/tab. Breeding and hatching always surprises you because you don\'t Know what dragon you will get. Cool and good. Also heroic races can be made easier by using these tips: breed double terra and terra 15 second breed and hatch time then if u need to feed for a task then breed a new terra when it gets too expensive. And use the fastest food. I don\'t buy gems for races I\'m probably gonna win the heroic dragon',
       'Love this game so much. I can\'t put it down for to long. My son also loves it too. This would be alot better if i could do what i need to on my islands but cant. I have uninstalled and reinstalled 3-4 times and the dame thing happens like nothing loads' ,

      'After a week of play , I am getting to attack smaller cities , KILL KILL,  grate time filler,  some sexier clothing options for the (ladies) would be nice,  lots to do and manage, clans mates are important, so chose wisely. I am enjoying this immensely.  Edit after (time seems like forever,)  I am really enjoying this,  Negotiated a couple of Peace Treaties, built my crew and strength, I am getting to be a force to reckon with... But there are still bigger fish, frustrating  Would love a feature to hunt the attacker, but then that would backfire too,   Great game...lots of challenges and opportunities for growth,  Highly recommended   *****',
       'It\'s your standard "GOW" clone with a Godfather ripoff motif.  You know the formula: spend money, build fast, get stomped by the kiddies with access to daddy\'s credit card who spend thousands of $$$.    Guaranteed to trigger the easily offended due to scantily clad women.  Hilariously bad "Engrish" text throughout the game.    Just get your currency for whatever other game it is you play as fast as possible and move on.',
       'So many players have reported on one player that keep spamming the city.  Just because he cant take it when his city got burned .  Check ur report n banned him from playing. Or many others player will start quitting.',
       'Newbie dont play this game. It\'s was fun at first then you follow the instructions as normal. But at the end of the day you will get stuck and you will run out of supplies.. Their idea is to make you buy.',
       'I reported a spammer a lot of times and for whatever\'s happening I know I\'m not the only one who does it but he\'s still there. The server chat is crashing and we see no actions done against him. This is getting ridiculous. One of my clan mates who is a p2p has already quit due to this level of obnoxiousness. Do something.',
       'I love this game. But please 1. Introduce something like a poll, where the leader can call a poll about something just to get everybodys say. 2. It\'s annoying when some inactive player teleport close to the clan and you have no way to kick him from there inspite of so many attacks!' ,

Your finger starts where it should, but moved slightly lower than the finishing point. This way your finger is out of the way and you can clearly see where your piece is going. Very fun game with lots of options.',

      'Great game if you wanna run low graphics for a smoother gameplay on your phone. 40 instead of 100 is great for mobile games as well. Maybe make the controls a tad bit larger for default size. Otherwise really fun. Maybe add a first person mode? Unless I haven\'t found out how to haha. Great game. I seemed to like this one out of all the others tbh.',
       'Good game, but after the last update the game game is riddled with bugs and glitches, making the game next to unplayable. Will often come up with queue error and kick me from the game and the screen constantly freezes. I can move, but I can\'t pick anything up and my teammate position is also frozen. Pls fix or I will uninstall. Also, you got rid of the aim button which sucks. Was way better before the update. You\'ve ruined the game for meüò≠üò≠üò≠',
       'One of my favorite games at the beginning.. Ever since the Last 2updates Been facing Problems almost every single Game.Can only run and open Doors can\'t Pick any Weapons.. Sucks I hope y\'all Fix This or Its Time to uninstall this',
       'Well I love the potential. Has a lot of bugs. Dual or quad mode doesn\'t work and overall it takes too long to wait. I waited 10 minutes for quad and then it just stopped and put me back to choosing game modes. I think thi s game can be the best if it had more work put into it.',
       'I honestly liked the game better before the update. You got rid of the aim button, the game is full of glitches like taking damage inside the safe zone, and I get lagged out all the time even though I have a pretty good Wi-Fi connection. To be honest,  you kinda ruined the game.',
       'This game is good and very challenging but i dont like the new update. My overall Stats have stopped working and im still dyeing even when im in circle and the aim button needs to come back it is so hard to play without it.  But overall a good game it just needs a few adjustments.' ,

      'I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I\'m a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events.',
       'In depth in both gameplay and attention to details of awarded items. Continuous hours not required but with once a day of incentive activities. Controls are  sometimes unstable. If a glitch does happen, its fixed fast and your also awarded for time spent. Very happy customer. Enjoyed the best dress up game I\'ve played so far. Thank you makers!',
       'I love the game. From its cute and addictive style to its unique and original dress up gameplay, it turned me from a dress up hater to lover. But I feel like there\'s a Paywall especially during events, and diamonds are forced to be bought, but they can be earned, which is good. But so far, you seem to have listened to feedback, from the skin tones to the bug fixes. But I love it still.',
       'I had seen many ads for it and was kind of interested, but I didn\'t think a dress-up game could be that fun. One day I couldn\'t find any games I wanted to play, so I decided to give it a shot. To my surprise, I am really enjoying it! So if you\'ve had any inkling of interest in this game, give it a shot. You might enjoying as much as I have.',
       'I love it... I know I\'m not the age range who gets into dress up but God I love this... also can you make the the events a little easier I know you want paying people but I don\'t  A. Have money B. Or a credit card  So in all its kind of hard for me to get anything as my parents think it\'s a waste of time... and it probably is but you know it just is so fun and the stories cute to...',
       'I was a little sceptical of this game at first because of all the ads everywhere, but it\'s actually better than the ads showed. Its a little confusing at first, but once you get into it, it\'s so much fun. The online community is great and the story mode is really fun to grind through. If you like Pokemon and dress up games this is perfect for you.' ,

      'It\'s a good game.  Three things I may add.  Every so often when you improve a ship , the app goes "improvement failed" yet but takes your coins. Bit frustrating. Secondly, the matchmaking can be at times frustrating too, you\'re getting wrecked in seconds by other very powerful ones.. And last thing , hey , the music of the game becomes straight boring and dull after a while. Add something , anything , Frank Sinatra  ffs , you got about 15 seconds of soundtrack in all this game..',
       'I love this game, i have been looking for a capital ship vs capital ship game for a while and this is s a great game. Its diffiuclt to level up but it is always fun. Although i am experiencing a glitch where my super heavy cruise cannon has been placed in one of my gun slots, and i cant place it back in my super heavy slot. Otherwise great game',
       'The games great over besides the lack of game modes. One major problem I face continually is that people are getting modified versions of the game with everything maxed out. They all go by the name player####. If you could remove them all that would be appreciated.',
       'This game is extremely fun!!! The controls are intuitive, the graphics are quite good, and the gameplay is well designed and shows off unity quite brilliantly. The microtransactions are a bit pricey but they dont take away from the overall fun factor of the game. Kudos to the devs',
       'overall a good game some small bugs to fix like it won\'t let me add my super heavy cannons which is a bummer. and some others would like the creators to fix the problems so I could get back to slaying',
       'I like this game!  Feels like actual space combat and the correct style of combat.  Leveling seems little slow, hopefully there\'s lots of different weapons to upload and upgrade.' ,

      'All you do is watch ads. Start the game, you get an ad. Play one round (rounds last about 30 seconds), watch an ad. Play two rounds, watch an ad. Want to double your earnings from last round? Watch an ad. Play a round. Game crashes. Open the game. Watch an ad. The game itself would be ok but the constant bombardment of ads is just too much. Literally half of the time spent in the game is just watching ads.',
       'Simple mechanics. A bit TOO simple. You can only equip each turret ONCE. So if you want to try different combinations, you\'re SEVERELY limited. The order in which you equip them matters very little since the rockets are random. There is very little player input. Equip. Press play. Sit back. Has potential but is just a simple time waster as is. DO NOT put any money into this. I don\'t even know how to make games but could probably do better than this within a few days of practice. Right now, it\'s just an ad machine. Ads.... Ads everywhere....',
       'The amount of ads in this game is preposterous and it asks for permissions it doesn\'t need - including the ability to make phone calls. Many of this developers apps do the same so I\'m pretty sure they\'re spyware.',
       'When I play I have my Wi-Fi on for multiplier please turn off Ad\'s! from turning on every time I enter the level and die( it\'s enough for me to watch Ad\'s  to get bonus credit please turn them off for free it slows down very badly my speed of progress! Only rated the best! "For you guys to remove AD\'S...',
       'Can\'t disable or lower sound in game. Seems like such a basic mechanism to be missing. Overall feels incomplete, with an unbalanced economy based on advertisements with no real progression coming from play time. Decent concept, poorly executed.',
       'There seem to be way more ads than in earlier versions. it\'s getting a little ridiculous, especially early on where a round might only last a minute or two with a 30 second ad between each round.' ,

      'This game is great, it\'s a lot of fun. Until it decides that you\'re not allowed to pass the loading screen.  Then there\'s the premium store. The pricing is pretty outrageous for a mobile game. $35 for a t5? I paid less than that for my Matilda IV on WOT. Please address this issue. So we can actually show you our patronage. You occupy our spare 15 minutes. Not hours daily. Think of where this is played and charge accordinly. That\'s all I have to say.',
       'I do like this game. The support team is good and are helpful when they can be. But the silver and points awarded are much too low in my opinion, when in comparison to the costs of modules and supplies consumed during battles. Also the supply crates could stand to be better. The ships are pretty awesome and are very well rendered. Very good graphics. Everything runs smoothly with no lag or server issues.',
       'This is a great game!!.  Yes, computers have issues, yes its short then the PC version.  This is not a PC.  This is a great 5 minute break.  I play the PC game too.  Its flipping fantastic.  The programmers at WOW are brilliant  and they care about the product.  If you love histroy, Warships, strategic games pitting you against other human players.  GET THIS YOUR GAME.  There are other warship games.  None get it more right then WOW.',
       'The games mechanics and controls need an overhaul. The secondary weapons should be automated as fast firing ships operating in touch screen controls requires immense micro management. Second, the post battle screen graphs extremely limited battle details and the UI is equally as lacking in features and navigation. Finally, the battle time is far to short and the majority of battles are ended with ships still in action on both teams. Potential to be a 5 star rating when the mechanics become as user friendly as they they are on PC.',
       'Made you play the game for 30 minutes before you can enter a promo code. Can\'t enter any promo codes in game, you have to make an account for their stupid website. None of the promo codes actually work. Clearly a marketing scheme just to get a bunch of downloads so they can get more money from investors. I say boo.',
       'Great game absolutely the best that I have played on a mobile. However, sometimes when I go into battle it says I have no repairs or the other thing who\'s name I can\'t remember even though I have around 100 most of the time. Could you please look into this? It could be an interesting balancing mechanic if one ship is far and away better than all of the ones on the opposing team but for now it\'s just annoying. Thank you for making such a great game though and I will certainly keep being a highly active player.' ,

      'I love playing the game but there are so many updates all the time. And when they do their bimonthly update you have to download new package and then some gameplay features dont work. I have had a couple things not work from last update. I tried to contact support and they havent replied at all. Its been three days now. Im an everyday player who spends real money in game. Would rate higher if someone would help me out..',
       'Will i ever get the chance to play again? Cant sign in to complain and it doesn\'t look like LOD  really  care about the players. I haven\'t been able to get on since The 8th!!! The game has stoped loading after the last update. It will either reach 21% or 71%.',
       'Same problem as most people, my wrath wings menu has been freezing since 4 updates ago and now my skywings freezes the game as well. How do I contact the software report team to fix this I feel like I should be twice as strong by now. Really cool game but you\'re going to lose a lot of players if things go on like this. Please fix the bugs I feel like each update just makes things worse.',
       'I am level 83 and i love this game. But plunder dont work soul vortex also dont work and more players are experiencing same thing. I send support ticket 10 days ago no one answer. If u fix these bugs il give 5 stars',
       'Spent almost two months time in this game but end up their glitch after an update resulted certain claim item forfeit. Maybe I was an f2p hence not worth their time and effort to assist me. Game deleted.',
       'The features of the game are cool.. i like all the pvp dungeons.. but most of the dungeons with event goes in certain time and limited.. if i miss them..then i hardly get the purpose of installing this game meaning.. nothing else to do.. it\'s getting boring for player like me who wants to spend hours online but no more rewarding pvp dungeons available overnight.. maybe create some entertaining 24 hours pvp features? I can tell many players tend to be inactive for more than 1 day...so hope for more crowded and better LOD..' ,

      'I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance',
       'Great simple game with AMAZING colours‚ù§ I love this...dead simple and fun. It took me ages to work out how to unlock the new skins...click on the banner that has the amount of diamonds you\'ve collected and what looks like 3 sheets on top of one another  (it comes up before you press the start key...)',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME This is good game design. It rewards you no matter how high you go with a beautiful little tower. The colors are really satisfying. It keeps me engaged since you can "regrow" your blocks. That creates tension too--something to strive for. It\'s so simple but soothing and really addictive!!',
       'A Great Game For When You\'re Dumpin\'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin\' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I\'m in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren\'t too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I\'m happy to say that. I don\'t like to stay too long. Great game!',
       'So,  basically it\'s a pretty fun app to play when you\'re bored. It\'s a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It\'s a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don\'t really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!',
       'Good, with a major flaw I\'ve ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I\'ll tap, and the game won\'t register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I\'m on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I\'ve closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It\'s an issue I\'d like to see fixed.' ,

      'This game is really fun and interesting. But i have a question. Under your character which says tap on me, there were 3 choices in it, although i\'m not sure if those are actually choices. As i try to tap on them, nothing happens. Is that really normal? Or am i suppose to do something? Especially since one of the options there was "meet the lost soul." Please help me out',
       'The game is AMAZING !! I got all three endings already and it was super fun. I just really hope there will be an offline version so I can play it without WiFi, it\'s a good time waster. Also, maybe you can put a feature where if you press the person you are in that life, you can see the stuff they have like the superhero, smart feature, timeshare, etc. , so that it\'s easier to know what our person has. Also, maybe put a description for it? Just a suggestion! Play Nirvana guys it\'s great!!',
       'Hi dev, i sometimes don\'t understand whats the icon under character\'s name means. Can you please put what it means in help sections? or maybe you could make a list about that in game that you could unlock.  That\'s just a suggestion though. I love your game, keep up the good work üëç',
       'Alright, so in a response to someone else\'s review, you said that talking to Death could give a hint as to how to get the third ending; the advice that comes when you ask how to escape is pretty much useless, so I assume the advice that\'s supposed to help me beat this cursed game is the "if He eats too many years he explodes" part. However, I\'ve gotten over 800 years in, and the Creator hasn\'t exploded. At this point I don\'t even care about getting the third ending, I just want that bastard to explode.',
       'I really fan of Reings the best strategy and puzzle. This game little bit confused and don\'t understand how up or lower.  Can you make update something little more easily like sign ‚Üë and ‚Üì please this game so very interested.   P.s great job',
       'dear dev i actually enjoyed your game because its remind me of lapse. but i have several problem  1. i only get to play as a male once in the game 2. another life dont have diferent situation its the same situation again 3. i dont like how when you fulfill one of the bar you get punished by dying  but overall i like this game concept and how it work and i hope that future update will improve the game by adding different situation every life' ,

      'Downloaded this through another app (free golden eagles) where if you downloaded and played this game, and got castle to level 10 would be rewarded. Sent off request to support a number of times with proof and no reply, and after a week still no reward.   So if you are downloading this to get reward from another app don\'t bother as you won\'t get it',
       'Pure pay tto win. You will either pay or quit out of frustration. Build times are hilarious. Seriously, our Earth\'s sun will die before you max out your hero\'s knowledge or most any other knowledge.  The Stronghold is worthless and a huge waste of resources. It\'s more of a trophy.  Sure you can join a clan, get some bonuses and buy some shields with points, but you will be destroyed by the winners. Me, I had a gift card and blew on this game, now I just start fights and make people quit.',
       'you guys give an update for us to move kingdoms. but it make so expensive that\'s it\'s unaffordable. like really 2 dakars  on a 12.99 pack. So you expect us to spend over 100 dollars just to move a kingdom. I don\'t know if your team there at plarium realizes that there is not 1 ps4 game that costs this much. seriously don\'t release an update that\'s not affordable don\'t make any sense.',
       'Great time killer, I love the interaction and concept of the game. It can get a bit laggy at times and at it\'s worst, it will crash on you. The wait times are unbearable though. No ads at all since the first time I played too!',
       'Having trouble still with scrolling through the Kingdom map. Also got a issue with someone \'s shield not coming down when he attacked me. People cannot attack while there shield is up, or do they attack that fast they put a shield up after the attack. less than 1 minute .Anyway the game is very slow and glitchy, was better when first installed it. I cannot do battles like this the game sometimes crashes or I have connection problems.',
       'The game itself is great. Zero complaints there. But the fact that it I am unable to ever log in is infuriating. I\'ve literally been zeroed out because the app won\'t let me log in... multiple times. It\'s absolutely ridiculous. Needs to be fixed.' ,

      'Its a fun game, really, however in my opinion its too easy. I got 150 First try and 346  my second. and maybe consider adding things to unlock like different balls or hoops. other than that its a fun game to kill time',
       'The first time I played I easily got over 800, now I swear the game upped it\'s difficulty like crazy, I can\'t get past the 200s. Not sure if it\'s a bug, an Easter egg feature or what, or if it\'s because I completed challenges but I don\'t appreciate the inconsistency especially when playing against friends and I don\'t feel evenly matched :(',
       'I absolutely love the game the only.problem I\'m having is when I\'m playing I keep knocking the ad advert at the bottom where your thumb goes to move the net and keeps ending game and making me.lose cause of that will change rating if gets sorted',
       'This is an awesome game! I love it but maybe it could have a few more fetures like it could have a two person mode, it could have two hoops to make it harder. Or maybe it can have like a differnt backround. Over all the game is pretty great.',
       'So many words but after u got all the  things there is nothing to do bar from play on it but it a  really good game love it soooooo much',
       'The problem is that every time it asks me if I would like to continue I say yes and then kicks me out of the game' ,

      'This game is just impossible to finish, even if you spend lots of real money. 66% of the game (trick and powder) is about pulling tricks out and you can\'t even choose which ones. Controls are very bad and graphics also. The only thing that makes it more fun is the online challenges, but other than that this game sucks. I would expect a whole lot more from Red Bull.',

      'There is a huge delay from when you hit the key to when you hear the key and too many ads. I was trying to find something good to get down song ideas so I wasn\'t the intended consumer and I can see how this could he good for learning, but you could get the same thing off youtube and not have the excessive ads.',
       'It\'s pretty good, and good enough to warm up my voice and practice before singing at my church, and when I\'m bored I just play the songs that comes with the app. And it\'s also handy for when I don\'t have my bass guitar at hand and trying figure out song notes and chords, this is pretty useful. I like it.',
       'Got annoyed by the notifications. Calm down, it\'s just a piano app. There are plenty of them, no way I\'m paying $20 to remove the ads.',
       'If you take synthesia tutorials and apply them to this app, you might just be able to play any song! I can\'t say I love this app but I really like it. .... I change my mind, I do love this app! Glad I chose this one ‚ô° (watch for adds though)',
       'It didn\'t work. (Desclaimer: NO HATE, JUST BUGS AND STUFF THAT DIDN\'T WORK)  Very laggy and so many glitches,  I\'m just stating the cons, no hate. It just didn\'t work for me and when I tried to record, it got all glitchy and recorded multiple at a time. I tried to press keys but it wasn\'t picking anything up. After a while, all the keys I pressed came into a big bundle and sometimes, it randomly recorded for no reason. Again, no hate. I just found a lot of bugs, which I would be happy to play this piano with, if the developers fixed it. I couldn\'t move the keyboard as well. I tried to drag it to a different spot, but no avail. Just a couple of things that didn\'t work for me, like how it wasn\'t timed when I pressed a certain button. (NO HATE)',
       'The ads are literally infuriating, if I let my phone lock it\'ll open with another freakin ad. Then when I\'m trying to play I\'ll accidentally click on an ad and it\'ll redirect me. I\'M JUST TRYING TO PRACTICE. This app used to be good but now it\'s riddled with ads like a virus. Do NOT get this app.' ,

But then it has lots of ads everytime i arrive at the green light and also when purchasing weapon at the weapon shopüò£üò£ its also difficult to climb up the hill or mountain especially when i accidentally fall into the sea.  Maybe add some extra moves like to able to grabbing thing, and speed up the ability to punch or kick people/thing.',

      'this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates',
       'A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it\'s really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it.',
       'I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.',
       'Calling this a physics game is a joke. Sure, it has a physics engine that handles things like acceleration, "mass" and magnetism... But it\'s really just a very limited drawing game. Want to draw a ramp because it would lead to the most elegant solution? Sorry, can\'t... Because your "pencil" is too thick and the ball just hits the base of the ramp and bounces off. Know a simple solution? Well, have fun drawing it fifteen times while you get the exact dimensions needed in a very inexact system. I really think there are far better games to practice problem solving that don\'t get in your way as much as this one.',
       'The ads suck horribly if you don\'t buy it! But it is worth the dollar. Drawing with your finger is not very precise, but more about timing and placement.  So be prepared to reset, and try again numerous times, especially if you are going for a 3 star complete.  Great game!',
       'LOVE this game!! Literally, I don\'t think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it\'s just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move üòú' ,

      'The original sonic dash is better imo. had a better atmosphere, maps looks better gameplay also better. the original was a masterpiece. also, I don\'t like that they introduce scenes that requires you to tilt your phone. since i played sonic dash i didn\'t expect it to be there. it\'s annoying when you\'re laying down and play the game and you got that scene just ruins the gameplay.',
       'The responsiveness of the controls I  this game make it unplayable... it\'s slightly more responsive than the original sonic dash but it\'s still no where near good enough for such a fast paced game.  I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it\'s the same on all of them',
       'Way too many advertisements. I actually downloaded this game because subway surfer makes start over everytime you download it but after my next tech upgrade I\'m going back to that, atleast the game not flooded with ads.',
       'I would give it 5 stars, I made an in app purchase to remove ads, but after the game updated non Sega ads started showing again and it asked me to make another purchase in order to remove the non Sega ads AGAIN... love the game, hate the ads...',
       'TOO MANY ADS!! Decent game but ruined by an add every 20s. Sonic forces doesn\'t have half as many adds as this game but isn\'t as good so looks like Sega have fallen short trying to add more pounds to their fortunes and made the game unplayable.',
       'The game is great but the ads are so intrusive, immersion-breaking, and so annoying that I\'m giving the game 3 stars. Please, I understand that ads are necessary to make money for a free game but make it so that they are not so persistent that an ad automatically opens after a single run. A shame really, this would be such a great game if this would be fixed.' ,

      'The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I\'d like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.',
       'Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It\'s very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again',
       'The more stuff is added the lagier it gets. Game freezes when buying items, when going over your city, with the chat, loading the flobsl trade, travelling to other cities and basicly everything nowadays. Requires multiple restarts of the game and reboots of my phone regularly to keep jt playable nowadays. It used to be really good and smooth, but it only gets worse each update and no improvement in sight. I only play now because I made some good friends in my club, but the actual fun is long gone. :(',
       'This is a great game,very addicting, but can you please fix the glitch that makes everything either too big or too small. The contest of mayors screen doesnt even show up  only shows up one third. Will rate higher once this is fixed, its very annoying',
       'Game is basic in its features. The worst part of the game is the trade hq. Rather than letting you buy directly off the hq menue you have to load the other players city. If your phone doesnt load it as fast as someone else they can snipe the goods you need to buy.',
       'Lots of potential! A EA omega blog headquarters building for idears would be good. bring back the cinema, city with no cinema! Simcity needs a expansion. Don\'t like the desaster battle concept, it should of been a stock exchange battle concept. and had a better approach to the desasters.like Desasters emergency service building with weekly events for random desaster repairs for existing and new realistic scenarios. Get rid of vu building and desaster island and replace it with emergency desaster service building and a weather towers. Then instead of having to event there would be 3 online events.' ,

If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games üòÄ n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area.',
       'I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn\'t have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn\'t get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren\'t vigilant of their customers and don\'t take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.',
       'REALLY GREAT GAME! The ONLY thing is,when I try to get enough money and save up it takes s√≤oooooooooooo long so plz INCREASE THE AMOUNT YOU GET IN BATTELS! :). My family always plays this game so they would really apriciat if you add money to my account. Thank you if you DO. My name is TheOneProGamer50.',
       'The best shooting game ever. Lobed each and every single thing about this game but there a little suggestion that we can see the player if they are online or not but how is this if we can see there live going on matches? That concept will be great and games lag sometimes so if you can fix this and add my suggestion in guns of boom that will be hell great!! #the best game',
       'I was loving it and have spent alot of money but this update made it to where i can\'t even open it back up. Please fix because i loved this game and have invested time and money and if i don\'t get to play it anymore sometime soon I\'m not coming today back. Please fix very soon i was trying earn a special gun but I\'m not sure if that\'ll be an option if an when it gets fixed',
       'Played this game on my old 6S and S7 edge without any problems. Now that I have a Pixel 2 XL, controls have a major glitch. Seems to go nuts on its own or sticks too one side of the screen. Happens every match, almost unplayable. Very disappointing!' ,

      'Some things are hidden in such a place makes it hard on note 8 due to curved screen. Level 89 doesn\'t work, as well as other levels where touching the same place over and over and over might get something to work.  Most puzzles are extremely easy,  it\'s just a matter of the game not working.',
       'Got stuck playing til lvl 40 before I realized an hour had past, and I only came to the play store looking for sonic 3, but this looked interesting listed under "recomended." Great recommendation.',
       'Some levels are straight forward. Others you just have to skip because there\'s no logic or something is missing. Could be good with some type of help if you get stuck rather than just skipping an entire level.',
       'Not responsive to most touches. I finally got a cheat only to realize it was the game.  Ads were not frequent but had a strobe light going off (health issues) and would not turn off. Had to close out of the game every time so I just quit playing. Typo many similar more challenging games out there to try and work with this one.',
       'Items don\'t move when they are supposed to therefore making it impossible to complete each task. It is very frustrating because the game would be more fun. It would make it more enjoyable with at least 1 or 2 hints.',
       'I found it boring. A character in the game tells you what to do, where to find the key etc and you do it, then you move a level up. How is that exciting? But millions of people do, so go figure.' ,

      'Maybe the reason people think its boring. It\'s probably because they are boring and lame. I beat the first level without a problem, they didn\'t because they feel like everything should be easy and they shouldn\'t have to work hard for anything. The game is challenging and fun if you like a challenge. If your a lame, whinny, expect nothing to be hard, and can\'t handle a challenge as tough as making toast, then this game isn\'t for you.',
       'The game controls are very annoying. The character won\'t go where you want him to. During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don\'t want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn\'t want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.',
       'These other reviewers are jerks! Lol. The game is awesome! And my 4 year old can even play it well!  I like it so much, I\'m downloading it onto my phone (4 yr old plays it on my old phone)  just to see how far I can get lol',
       'NC and you know what you doing today beautiful lady and her husband to be with u but I can\'t wait till I see you in the car and my mom said she will be here for me to go to the store and get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get the money for the first time I was just wondering if you want to be a good day at work and I don\'t know what I',
       'This game is stupid because you have to get a part of the key just to get more lives and the bad guys are technically cheating because they have guns I made it to the last level and it was impossible to beat the boss because he puts fire everywhere on the second level the guy keeps shooting you so it took me an hour to get off that stupid level  it took me about five days to get of the last level but I suggest that you just play the first level. This was a ripoff it doesn\'t make sense to wait that long for a stupid freaking game I\'m to cool for that dumb game. Another thing that is stupid about the game is the remote controls its confusing because they all look the same they should put the names of what that control does in the buttons. And the thing builds the stuff for you at a scale of 1 to 10 I pick 1  I rather play with realistic legos than the iPad ones don\'t waste your time on waiting for the game to download  its a ripoff',
       'It is awsome I love how on the last level (the black night) has two levels the black night and the vampire  the whole game is so fun I\'m done the whole game still play it all the time  but it needs more levels love it so much  so it needs MORE LEVELS' ,

       'The idea of the app is very nice, however, I am disappointed in the fact that the app requests to access my calls, contacts, and other data. I fail to see why is that necessary for a simple game like this. Moreover, when I listen to music and play the game, the ads come interrupting my music with their own. When I mute them and press X, the music on my phone stops completely, forcing me to leave the game and start the music again. Again, this is inconvenient for an app which I expected to be very simple.',
       'It seems that the touch is way off on my Galaxy S8, when i touch the differences i get a X, but get O for random spots mid-screen! This would be a great game if i could actually play it!!!',

    description: 'This is by far the most flexible word search app on the market. Multiple configuration options create a game that exactly corresponds to your device and your expertise.Play with an English word list or choose one of 23 other languages.Designed for fun games from the smallest mobile phones up to the largest tablets.Bored of seeing the same words appear repeatedly? Frustrated at looking for bizarre words that are not even English? Struggled with grids that are inappropriate for your device or difficult to read? Word Search Ultimate solves all these problems. You can configure:1) Grid size    Specify exactly how many columns and rows to use (from 3 to 20). Even non square grids (e.g. 12x15) are possible.2) Screen layout    Choose how much screen space for the grid and how much for the word list, using our unique movable split bar.3) Difficulty of the game    Specify approximate proportion of words that are written diagonally, backwards or vertically (e.g. allow no diagonal or backwards words, ideal for introducing children to Word Search).4) Difficulty of the words    Specify the size of the dictionary to generate a game, from the 500 most common words (good for kids and language students), up to 80,000 words.5) Maximum # of words    Choose the maximum number of words to find in one game, from 1 to 150. This will provide enough words to fill a 20x20 grid.6) Minimum & Maximum word length    This helps avoid searching for many small words (a common problem in word apps). Also useful for specifying really difficult games (e.g. set both minimum and maximum word length to three).7) Highlighting    Mark the already found words, or keep the grid unmarked and easy to read.8) Word list layout    The word list can be arranged in columns for easy reading, or close to each other to minimize screen space.9) Language    Choose the language of the word list, from a large range of downloadable dictionaries.  24 languages are currently available (see below).10) Orientation    Can be played in portrait or landscape mode. Just rotate your device and the display adjusts automatically.11) Word categories    Choose the words to find from a range of categories; e.g. animals, food etc.This app gives you the ultimate power to play the game just the way you want.Each game is assigned a difficulty level from 0 (easy) to 9 (very hard). The difficulty level is determined by the settings. Each difficulty level maintains the high scores (measured by fastest time to complete the game). The game displays the best 20 scores for each difficulty level.Compare your high scores with others around the world by using Google Play\'s "Game Services".Other features unique to this app:1) Two methods of selecting words: (i) the classic swipe (ii) by touching the first and last letter of the word from the grid.2) Game aid if you are having difficulty.

    descriptionHTML: 'This is by far the most flexible word search app on the market. Multiple configuration options create a game that exactly corresponds to your device and your expertise.<br>Play with an English word list or choose one of 23 other languages.<br>Designed for fun games from the smallest mobile phones up to the largest tablets.<br>Bored of seeing the same words appear repeatedly? Frustrated at looking for bizarre words that are not even English? Struggled with grids that are inappropriate for your device or difficult to read? Word Search Ultimate solves all these problems. <br><br>You can configure:<br><br>1) Grid size<br>    Specify exactly how many columns and rows to use (from 3 to 20). Even non square grids (e.g. 12x15) are possible.<br>2) Screen layout<br>    Choose how much screen space for the grid and how much for the word list, using our unique movable split bar.<br>3) Difficulty of the game<br>    Specify approximate proportion of words that are written diagonally, backwards or vertically (e.g. allow no diagonal or backwards words, ideal for introducing children to Word Search).<br>4) Difficulty of the words<br>    Specify the size of the dictionary to generate a game, from the 500 most common words (good for kids and language students), up to 80,000 words.<br>5) Maximum # of words<br>    Choose the maximum number of words to find in one game, from 1 to 150. This will provide enough words to fill a 20x20 grid.<br>6) Minimum &amp; Maximum word length<br>    This helps avoid searching for many small words (a common problem in word apps). Also useful for specifying really difficult games (e.g. set both minimum and maximum word length to three).<br>7) Highlighting<br>    Mark the already found words, or keep the grid unmarked and easy to read.<br>8) Word list layout<br>    The word list can be arranged in columns for easy reading, or close to each other to minimize screen space.<br>9) Language<br>    Choose the language of the word list, from a large range of downloadable dictionaries.  24 languages are currently available (see below).<br>10) Orientation<br>    Can be played in portrait or landscape mode. Just rotate your device and the display adjusts automatically.<br>11) Word categories<br>    Choose the words to find from a range of categories; e.g. animals, food etc.<br><br>This app gives you the ultimate power to play the game just the way you want.<br><br>Each game is assigned a difficulty level from 0 (easy) to 9 (very hard). The difficulty level is determined by the settings. Each difficulty level maintains the high scores (measured by fastest time to complete the game). The game displays the best 20 scores for each difficulty level.<br>Compare your high scores with others around the world by using Google Play&apos;s &quot;Game Services&quot;.<br><br>Other features unique to this app:<br><br>1) Two methods of selecting words: (i) the classic swipe (ii) by touching the first and last letter of the word from the grid.<br>2) Game aid if you are having difficulty. You can choose to reveal a word that you cannot find.<br>3) View the definition of the word from an online source (e.g. Wiktionary), optimized for viewing on a small screen.<br>4) When you play with a word list in a foreign language, the word definition will (where possible) be in your own language. This is great for language learning!<br><br>Additional Features planned for a future version of this app:<br><br>1) Blind mode.  The word list is hidden.

      'Too much lag, no connection when I clearly have Internet, some units way too strong, costs too much to upgrade obviously made to make as much money as possible out of you. 85 pound a year to be competitive haha bye bye',
       'The game itself is fun.   But occasionally you end up playing a bot and have no chance at winning.   It will send out copies of a unit right after it initially sends one.   I don\'t mind the losing but the fact that it does whatever it takes to beat you is disheartening.',
       'Overall very good game just need to add a ton of cards and maps I thought it would be cool not just a nothing want to be clash of clans games since this one has army characters in it that\'s all just need there to be a lot more cards not generals.',
       'It\'s so buggy. Screen become black so often for seconds, then when it turns on, the asset become glitchy black box, so do the cards. I\'m on asus zenfone 2, don\'t know if this also happened on other device. But man you need to fix it. It\'s so annoying when it happened when you almost win the battle.',
       'Good game. Like clash royale type of game. But card is hard to get. But the bad things is air unit is too strong. They can shoot areas and hit air and ground unit at once. Its no sense.',
       'Terrible can\'t win **** also I got a sort of a defeat streak so this game is retarded cause a player can out 5 units down and the battle lasts 10 seconds worst game ever' ,

      'If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It\'s by far the best maze game app I\'ve come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I\'ve tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It\'s the only maze puzzle app I\'ve found worth playing! üòÄüíú',
       'Time killer. B&W colors are a bit hard on the eyes after awhile. I wish the controls weren\'t so touchy. Even if I\'m using my stylus it\'s easy to move into a wrong corner by accident when you know it\'s not the right direction.',
       'I\'m not far into it, but it\'s fun so far. My eyesight could be why it\'s not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It\'s still a very good game though.',
       'I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven\'t played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I\'ll have to download a separate kid version for her.',
       '5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes',
       'Where is the challenge? This game is as lame as the rest of the maze games. If you would  try make the game more challenging then maybe I would not have deleted it.' ,

      'Angry Birds used to be a game you could just tap on and play to your heart\'s content.  Now it\'s gone fee-to-pay (sic) -- you can read the other reviews to see how well that has been received.   Not well is an understatement.  I\'d say more, but you\'ll have to gain 50 more stars to read each new paragraph.  Meanwhile, watch these unskippable half-minute-long ads.',
       'Between ads completely over running gameplay and the new requirement of having to earn stars to proceed, Rovio continues to run this once great game into the ground. **Update** game now freezes randomly requiring a force close. This is beyond ridiculous. I HATE what this franchise has become. Rovio should be ashamed.',
       'Too many ads way too often. I get a few sponsored ads help keep apps free or inexpensive but the frequency here makes the app annoyingly unuseable. Sponsors need to realise that the more we consumers are harassed with unwanted advertising, the LESS we will be interested in their product. I outright boycott or blacklist such companies and products.',
       'I loved the mighty league ... until it forced an update that caused a glitch, and all of a sudden I was back in the Feather league --- and no matter what I did, I couldn\'t get out of it. I waited for update after update --- but to no avail. I was stuck. Not so fun anymore. So I uninstalled and reinstalled --- and lost over 13,000 points.  But at least I got to play again. I built my way back up... only to have it glitch again, sending me back to the Feather league. More frustrating than fun #Fail',
       'This is nolstaga.  I totally  love this game and rovio keep on doing what you are doing wow this new profile is kinda trippy.  Aslo my boys wow yall changed the name and an added classic.  Hmm good wow y\'all changed the layout and the amount of stars it really never bothered me  that Much.  But thanks anyway.  Anyway I earned the badge that said pop me/them.  Then I played a level I noticed that      rip.     the pig said pop them.  I was like WHATTTTTT I wondered what they used to say.  I thought it was something thing like Omelet it sounded like it.  Which would be totally Fugded up cuz you know the Eggs.  When I  imagine them saying pop them its kinda creepy and scary and weird. Anyway thanks rovio I totally love this Franchise/series.',
       'This game used to be awesome, sadly I have just removed it due to the star issue. I used to be able to play for fun, however, due to the its current standing, one MUST achieve three stars in each level in order to play other levels. Madness! Great job for taking the fun out of a game!' ,

      'This game is dope I play it all the time! Alot of ads but I may just pay the 3 bucks to remove them. Only thing I would request is maybe an option to view the race stats at the end of each race. to see who we raced and their times rather than just a quick glance. So say I beat a high ranked player I\'d like something to show for it. Besides that I love this game!',
       'This game was worth 5 stars until the updates... More than half the time i try to connect to a race its doesn\'t work and doesn\'t give me back the 20 energy it requires to race. Also, I watched 50 videos to get the new car BLADE and i received absolutely NOTHING!!!! Until they fix this issue its getting a 1 star from me.',
       'So first of all way too many ads... When you click race you get Frozen and then sent to home screen and you lose your fuel... When you\'re "waiting on players" and they don\'t show up you lose fuel.. out of 10 attempts to start a race I play one',
       'Awesome game! Play it everyday. Even have spent actual money on it. That goes a long way for me.  Although, it\'s sucks after the latest update. Can\'t even go 12 races before it freezes up entering races and during races as well. Thats when i go to a different game. It\'s too bad.',
       'I reinstalled the game because the game has no sound what so ever, and now it has put me down to level 3 and I lost all my progression. Hours just down the drain. And to top it off, there still is no sound.',
       'Amazing concept, I just hate when I just spent 20 gas tanks on 1 race and either it moves me to another lobby where I have to spend another 20 gas tanks and it might happen again, or I am in a race and the server crashes and I lose 20 gas tanks. Other than that, this is a very fun game. The gas tanks regenerate to full in a quick amount of time. And there are many chances to earn a lot of stuff, Wish I got it sooner.' ,

      'This is the most addictive flight simulator I have ever played. The game is fairly easy to progress through without having to spend any money. If I had to find one fault it would be that you can\'t reverse when on a runway which means some times you have no option but to crash your plane as there is very little room to turn around.',
       'So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game',
       'A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job \'fun games for free\' üëèüëåüñí‚ò∫',
       'Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you\'re having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.',
       'I\'ve been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn\'t force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game\'s development! :)',
       'Pretty cool app. I\'d like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes.

      'The game could be great if not for the really poor choice of words. Why would you include words such as \'shooting, suffers, fur, sue\'  into a game that is supposed to be nice a relaxing? And these are words just from one of the levels. Each level has some words I\'d rather not read or even think about. Nice pictures and vibe though. Please do something about the choice of words. You don\'t want people think about \'shooting\' if only for a brief moment not in this day and age.',
       'Great game, fair balance of ads. Only thing it needs to mix all the songs thru all levels, as the single song while does hold up to repeat play, eventually gets repetitive. Also need better dictionary because I often play real words and it doesn\'t count them which stinks.',
       'They repeated words a lot. Also, words that exist aren\'t always counted. And some words that were counted in some rounds aren\'t counted for others. For example, ale has been a valid word for most of the levels but not for some of them. When I first started playing, did was not accepted and then became accepted as my level got higher. Sloppy work, and it\'s so frustrating. The level I\'m on right now, for example, is not accepting "wad" "wed " or "dew"',
       'I love it. There\'s only two problems. When you\'re on a streak and you accidentally hold a letter and don\'t make a word you lose your streak, even if you don\'t try to make a word. As well as that, the WORST part of the game is the notifications that constantly pop up even if you turn them off. Seriously might be the reason I uninstall the app.',
       'Several problems with this app, and I see the same complaints I have over and over again. From the first moment, this is not the game I saw in the ad, which looked like mine sweeper. But it still looked like a good word game, so I played for five days. I expect a certain number of ads for a free game, but not every level. The word acceptance rules are arbitrary, sometimes accepting plurals and sometimes not. I\'m pretty sure "legs" is a word. Sometimes does not recognize other actual words, most recently "stork." Frustrating, notifications constantly, uninstalling as soon as I finish this review.',
       'This game is sooo addicting, I can\'t stop playing it. There are several games that are very much like this one but I like this one the most because when it starts off with just 4 little squares it doesn\'t go on and on. The beginning is so boring when it\'s only 4 squares. This one starts out 4 squares but only goes about 8 levels then it gets harder right away. The others go on & on & on!! WORD CROSSY IS #1 !' ,

       'It would be a perfect review but the thing crashes neat every 20 seconds. That is a fundamental part of the game working, that the game actually works (I know, pretty self explanatory). I honestly hopes this gets fixed because I do enjoy the game.',
       'It\'s okay but it\'s nothing special. Unfortunately it\'s another take on the type of game that gets popular every few years in which you throw stuff at a ball. That\'s it. There\'s unlockables, and they are possible to get without spending real money, but they don\'t add much to the game itself. Just a reskin of what you throw at the ball. It definitely killed some time for myself but after a day\'s worth of playing in my free time, I\'m already bored. Other reviews indicate the same.',
       'The levels need more diversity. After a while it just the same level just faster or slower spinning. Maybe add challenges or spinning platforms. Also if you could pick a color then choose  knife that would be awesome.',
       'Great time killer, although, ever since I downloaded the latest update, it will load to the main menu, and then become completely inactive. The start game option, nor the knife selection, or any other buttons work.' ,

      'The game is awesome. It is funny, has some challenges, it\'s community is friendly and you can collect familiars. Also you can use your equipment as costumes if you like a specific item\'s look. =D And I didn\'t even talk about the way the game looks like... It\'s the best pixel art I have seen in a while. =) So stop reading and start playing, have fun and thanks for making this game Developers! =D ( The only thing I miss is more coop gameplay =\'D )',
       'Cute, adorable and haven\'t seen any hungry money grabbing offers. Game is relaxing and you can even 5x the speed during battle. Other games would want to bite your wallet for that special feature. Get to recruit familiars from battle and it has an auto feature just in case you get lost. The items change how your characters look and you can pretty much be whatever you like. Good overall game, will be playing for a while üòÄ',
       'Great game and a lot of fun but... waiting for energy REALLY kills this game for me. I really don\'t feel energy limitations should be part of of a dungeon crawler where the object of the game is to run random dungeons for the chance of better loot.  I for one will never spend money on refreshing my energy in a game like this and the energy refresh costs are pretty high.   I feel like it be playing this game none stop if it weren\'t for the energy restrictions.   Otherwise good game and very enjoyable - when I can play.',
       'The perfect MMO RPG for your phone in my personal opinion. If you\'re a fan of dungeon games then this is the game for you. With its cute design, simple combat systems, dungeon patterns and loot systems, you\'ll find yourself easily sucked into the MMORPG world of Bit Heroes. Fight your way through the dungeons and gear up to strike fear imto the creatures who dwell within as well as the other players in challenging PvP matches.',
       'Spent over ¬£200 in game and no legendary pet or accessory. This game uses RNG and it\'s extremely low you can\'t advance past a certain level unless you spend lots of money and even then you have to be extremely lucky to get legendary pet or accessory. Guilds won\'t take you without legendary pet or accessory. Don\'t waste your time on this PAY 2 PLAY game',
       'Perfect, very close to the perfect ultimate bit adventure rpg! I look forward to expanded versions. For this one the only issue i have is when i accept or decline a friend request, and i think duels, the request text lingers above for white someone even tho i already accepted/declined. Great work tho! I love this game!' ,

I just think its great you people let us play these here slots all day and dont cost us nothing to do it. Thats about all i gotta say bout that.

      'I play real poker and do pretty well. This game is clearly made to force you to lose your chips and buy chips. They are obvious bots, and the amount of time I have a great hand on a turned and get called by absolutely  nothing but lose on the river is just unreal. I understand it happens, but it happens way too often in this. I have spent alot of real money on thia game in the past, and now I just remembered why I actually stopped playing it',
       'I would like the game very much never had to spend it on time kind of addictive. I can figure the game out sometimes very easily other times not. You can usually tell whether you\'re going to be lucky (those are the times to hit the slot machine while you\'re playing). Sometimes the hardest part e dealing with it dummies who think it\'s bingo. And sometimes I got to admit how you had enough time and I\'ll play that way too but that\'s usually when the game teaches you a lesson at other times it\'s very predictable and I know that I\'m going to get that hand but it\'s fun',
       'Fun game. Most of what I know about this game, I\'ve actually learned by playing it on this app. And yes, it\'s very addictive!! And yes, anyone with negative comments???...they haven\'t taken the time to REALLY know & learn the game & it\'s rules. Just because ya lose...doesn\'t make it a bad game!! LEARN THE GAME & ITS RULES, SPEND A LITTLE TIME ACTUALLY PLAYING, (WITH GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP)...AND YOU\'LL LOVE IT. The more ya play, the better it gets!!',
       'More ad pushes and Facebook posting than anything I\'ve over downloaded. Posts without asking and you can\'t play a single game without 20 notifications asking you to spend money or share it with friends. Popular game but can\'t do anything for 10 minutes after opening app until you sift through all the nonsense they throw at you.',
       'I\'ve played enough years to know that setting down at a real table, playing.... No one is that lucky and no one is that unlucky unless the dealer is dirty or YOUR game is rigged to eat your chips. Heck! Everyone gets lucky once in a while. I\'ve put millions on millions of chips into this game and there is absolutely no way in getting them back. Do I continue to spend real money on this game anymore. NOT EVER!!! TOO MANY other games I can down load without it coasting an arm and leg.',
       'Not only are their are too many unlikely calls , some are absolutely ridiculous! I feel like it is deliberately causing you to lose so that you are forced to buy chips if you want to continue playing. Another thing I don\'t like is being in the big blind with several empty spots in front of you and the button and you fill in those spots one at a time near the end of the hand so you are big blind again. I\'ve had this happen 3 or more times in a row while playing 1-2 million. You are screwing me.!!!!!' ,

      'The gameplay is unique and challenging and fun but this game feels like a demo as all the other game modes (PvP , co-op etc) are locked for free users. And you can\'t even use checkpoints without paying them( like SERIOUSLY?!) So once the game is over you have to start all over again if you are a free user. Apart from that this game definitely deserves a try from people looking for casual , relaxing yet challenging gameplay.',
       'Great game This is a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing aesthetics and highly addictive. Totally worth the $2 for the premium version. I do have one problem though: even though I am pretty decent at the game, Google Play won\'t give me any achievements even though I\'m sure I have earned some. It won\'t even let me open achievements or leaderboard pages. Is anybody else having this issue?',
       'Spectacular Shockingly Good Game This game is addicting and amazing who thought breaking glass could be so fun. I mean somebody thought of something random when they made this. I I love it it is just so amazing. If only the person who thought of it made the game so that you didn\'t have to pay for some stuff like extra levels. Still if you\'re reading this and you\'re questioning if you should download this or not you definitely should.! üòâüòÄ‚ò∫',
       'I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I\'ve decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I\'ve upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!',
       'Really fun and addicting! The first time i saw this app was when my dad told me about this game, he said that it was very good. Literally the first 10 minutes i played this game my mind was blown and i beacame addicted. Around 2 years later(now) i found this game again and instantly installed it. I love this game and I have played it for a long time. The graphics and music are amazing. This a really good game and you should install it! Who could think that glass could be so fun. However I think this game would be better if some of the thing you have to pay for would be for free.',
       'So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn\'t save where I\'m at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won\'t be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!' ,

Why is it i had completed some of the achievements but it still shows zero progress??i don\'t know if it is just only me but i really want this to be fix or any solution can the developer suggests. It is a big deal to me since I enjoy playing games with a purpose to achieve something haha btw GREAT GAME!',
       'Great game of my childhood. Unfortunately, had problems with award when you connected Google. It\'s okay that game didn\'t count some levels, but I replay all suburbs and didn\'t receive any medals and there is no progress. It\'s really sad :(',
       'This game is so good! Far too many ads tho. I am addicted!!! Dont get the wrong idea guys  from other reviews - ads dont come up in actual gameplay its just when u lose or inbetween levels',
       'Just finished the entire levels of Part 1. I might have stolen a lot of cash by being Bob here but in reality I lost a lot of money because this game wouldn\'t let me focus at my work! Haha! Great work to the inventors of this game! King of all the mobile phone games out there!',
       'Great game! Very addicting & its just like your being a real robber & make the people don\'t catch you, i like it when they investigating open doors & when they hear the dog bark because its like its realistic. Please add more Levels & make many characters not just Bob. Thank you. .',
       'Robbery Bob is an amazing game, it\'s very challenging. You just can\'t stop playing it. It doesn\'t have a lot of adds, it\'s the. Number one game to me. I\'ve never had a game this good. I\'m planning on installing Robbery Bob 2 when I finish this one üëç' ,

      'Love the game & love watching kwelbol. Hope to win the $1000 bcuz the game is simple. But my only question is, is it different on ios, Android & PC? I notice how in the video the character is able to keep rolling face down or the blocks move. Also in lvl 10 the first one falls. I figure how to pass the first 3 parts but it still bothers me how my guy doesn\'t roll like in the video. When I die its instantly puts me back  & its not even a sec and im back at restart. Great game thoe‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ',
       'I think it has potential to grow but the game breaks on level 10 because you cant get around the wall with the second you get to jump around it and then jump breaks so instead of this being a 30 second level make it a little longer from the start to make it possible. It also is WAY too sensitive on controls.',
       'There\'s not too much wrong with the game. But I started playing level 10 to see what is was like and after smashing into the wall for a while my jump button stopped working R.I.P. also the app asked for 4 permissions: contacts, location, make and receive calls, and access files on your device. The game required none of these permissions though, so if you could remove them that\'d be great.',
       'Kweb, I expected this gane to be FUN. The controls are way to sensitive and the respawn concept is comfortable. The game has RageQuit written all over it. I love you man but this game really is a major setback. And I have no idea about what\'s wrong with level 10. Have you played it yourself kweb?',
       'Good effort for your first game, level 10 is probably more realistically possible from a pc but definitely think it\'s possible with practice. I think there\'s a gap to add shooting or an attack to the game? I\'m guessing the orange character is based on you so possibly a green and or red avatar for some bad guys to attack?',
       'Awesome game jordi!!!!!  But one issue the controls are WAY to sensitive. üòØüòØüòØ Don\'t get me wrong jordi is fire‚ô®‚ô® But on level 3 it is really hard I beat every one until nine on PC and phone but level ten is impossible with these controls. BTW love your videos.  Keep it up' ,

       'My younger cousin really enjoys this game and it keeps him entertained for hours, which is gr8 as he has ADHD. The only problem that stops us from giving this game a 5 star rating is a small bug, on the fact that he can\'t get through to arronville which upsets and annoys him when the game crashes, please fix this problem as it would be a brilliant help to us. Thanks. Btw I would recommend this game , just beware of some small problmes but dont worry as they always update this app to sort these problems out.',

       'The game is very good but the thing is that when merlok is like "hmm, not sure if Ava gog all the bugs out..." and it tells me to go on the Nexo scan thing (it\'s the only thing i can do anyway because its forcing me to) and it plays the nexo scan sound with the screen dark at the same time and then it suddenly goes all quiet with the music stops playing and it does NOTHING!!!! ITS REALLY FRUSTRATING!!! FIX.   IT.    NOW!!!',

       'Nice',
       'I would like my 1.79 x2 money back. I clicked on some equipment and it said to upgrade. I brought the dimoans to up grade. To fine it upgrades to one star so you still can\'t make any extra recipes. I\'m now stuck where I can\'t move forwards with the firework order as I can\'t get the recipe. I had enough with this game as I feel as u get into it the more money you expect people to spend as you can\'t do stuff. I Spent about 20 pounds so far when u add it all up. No that not much to some people but there was no point. I wish I could ask for the money back. But I know this won\'t happen. I use to love this game. But I don\'t at the moment.it also nothing like the video you show',
       'I really do like this game. I find I can play this for hours! it\'s addictive and the stories are awesome. my only complaint is that I\'m noticing if my servers are assigned to a phone or truck order I do not get Rubies from my machines that would supply them if I did the orders myself. This ruins the flow of my game if I\'m focusing on festival orders or guest orders to fulfill storyline. if this could get fixed I\'d definitely consider changing rating to 5 stars',
       'I wish there was no such thing as üí∞ in this game, everything is for free because I\'m struggling to upgrade coconut flakes to level 3. Also, there are some errors about this my caf√© update. There is no character named Comet when it says new character: Comet. And it says holiday ingredient fortune cookies, are there any fortune cookies no. Please fix this as soon as possible as my sister and I are feeling really angry because we want fortune cookies in this game. Apart from those errors that I not long said, I say that this game is good.' ,

      'Boring and repetitive and poorly designed. The obstacles are hard to see. After starting a (new) stage, you don\'t have enough time to avoid the very first obstacle. The rooftop stage is unfair, you cannot avoid obstacles because either the controls don\'t work or because you don\'t have enough reaction time. And restarting from the beginning gets very boring very quickly.',
       'This app won\'t load at all. My son really wanted to play it. He was very exited only to be very disappointed.  I tried deleting and downloading it again but it still did the same thing. I would not recommend this app because all it does is disappoint.',
       'Terrible, absolutely terrible, and I was so looking forward to playing this game. I love the Lego Batman Movie and I am so devastated to download this game to only see that it crashes almost every time I try to play it, and when it does work, pressing play leads just to a black screen. Highly recommend that if the game doesn\'t work for you, don\'t bother reinstalling it, because it\'ll do nothing and isn\'t worth your time sorry to say. If it works for you, which I have seen happens in the comments sometimes, lucky you, wish it did the same for me. Basically you are able to play it or not at all and can\'t change anything after.',
       'Love batman, I live for anything lego... this is an utter failure. The first level is beyond difficult for a seasoned veteran. Game to difficult, plot line staging is beyond negligent and shame on the creators for designing such an impossible game to progress through.',
       'we love the game but it stop working time to time it starts over and closes by it self. doesnt let us report it. would love for you guys to fixes it. our five year old loves batman games. and this one makes his day.',
       'It wouldn\'t even load past putting in my son\'s age. He is very disappointed. He earned the game and I uninstalled a bunch of my own apps to make room for the app.' ,

      'I love the game... But every time I hit 400 on every single song it glitches out. Now I\'ve just gotten the song for 820 and it glitches the second I hit a key. It\'s really aggravating üòí',
       'Love the Game, it\'s fun and addiciting. But, it seems to be a bit \'rigged\' and NOT just me. But me and a friend of mine always have our game \'Lag\' at 304. Please fix the lagging. I don\'t appreciate it being lagged on the 300\'s, especially when it REPEATS on the EXACT number.',
       'I like this game but it won\'t let me get anymore lives from watching ads but all in all its quite a good game. I would also like to say that this els me control my emotions',
       'It\'s alright, it\'s starts off ok but with in like 10 secs it is going so fast that you don\'t have anytime to get into it and I keeps getting faster until it\'s not humanly possible so it\'s 10 seconds of fun wish the speed would progress over a much longer time, for me there is no point to this game',
       'literally every song fails you at 402 because it freezes on the 402nd note you hit, then skips ahead a few notes and fails you. Would have been fun if it wasn\'t for that major defect.',
       'Vey addictive and fun... good practice on focusing and sitting still got my twin girls.  They love challenging each other,  until MOM comes and beats them both.  :)' ,

      'I never had to pay a single cent for this game, and it\'s working out perfectly fine for me. Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don\'t like my non-responsive faction members and I\'m worried once I leave my faction I couldn\'t join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.',
       'This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn\'t make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!',
       'No one from the support team will respond. My game was unistalled and reinstall and I lost 2 years worth of data. Can\'t remember sync it and I know scopely can do it for me. I\'ve provided everything they need and still nothing via email or in-game support. Will change my rating if this is sorted',
       'The last update has caused it to have to load every few times I log in. It takes 4 to 5 minutes each time. Never had this problem before! Can\'t get past prestige rewards screen... I have uninstalled and reinstalled... not happy',
       'I love the game it\'s really epic. But one thing that pisses me off is during the tournament for survival after completing a level with 3 stars there is this part where u have to claim tokens ND after claiming the game crashes  ND starts again. So could u please fix that would mean a lot.. otherwise I got no other problems',
       'I used to play this game on an older account and became bored of the difficulty spike. Uninstalled. Came back to it after some time and have now found upon reinstalling that I can\'t progress past the opening page, skip and next are unusable...  Scopely&gt;Fix the issue please.' ,

      'Constantly force stopping. Cannot finish a game without the game closing on me.  Update: uninstalled and reinstalled game and did not fix the problem. Uninstalling until game is fixed. Other then that game has potential.  Update 2: after installing the game again, it finally worked. But now I\'m uninstalling the game for good.  After scoring over 7b points in 1 game, the game only gave me just over 2b points. Game is garbage. Do not download this game!',
       'Update 2/20/18: the game had an update again and now created even faster than before. It was 90% unplayable, now it\'s 100% unplayable.  Over a week after my initial review the game is still broken and has not been updated.   Loved game for the first week or so after I discovered it. Now it just crashes constantly no matter what I\'m doing in the game.',
       'The game is fixed so you can score more than 2.15 billion.  But you can bank anything over 2.15 billion still.  So I just wreck once I hit the 2.15.  About to uninstall unless the code is fixed to keep all the points you score.  Game is very addictive.',
       'Ok so there are two ways to fix the crashing and frequent ad problem. Simple way, just turn off your internet while playing. Second, disable the internet permission from app settings for permanent fix. No crash, no ads just a fun game. :-)',
       'Seems like it\'d be fun and addictive if it would stay open. It constantly stops and closes in the middle of playing it. I\'ve tried restarting my phone and uninstalling it then reinstalling it, but it still happens.',
       'In the last update you enabled the top score to go above 2.5 billion however the score to upgrade is still locked at 2.5 billion. My last game I scored 16 billion but I only had 2.5billion to spend on upgrades. Please fix' ,

It was super fun and interactive at first then it gives you the option to pay to continue to play or to complete free offers to unlock the game for free.  I have found that you can complete as many offers ad you want but the game won\'t ever unlock and emailing the support web site doesn\'t do any good either. They don\'t ever respond and it is a complete waste of time.  Don\'t waste your time on this game.  Go out and find yourself something worth playing because this surely isn\'t it.',
       'DO NOT DOWNLOAD CAN NOT BE COMPLETED DUE TO A BUG!!!!!!  After buying you eventually get to the accordion level just before leaving the prison roof only for one (or 2 on some phones) ball being outside the play area which makes the mini game impossible.  Many reviews all over the internet highlighting this bug but the developer has not bothered to fix it.  AVOID THIS DEVELOPER !!!!!!!!!!',

They don\'t ever respond and it is a complete waste of time. This game has highly disappointed me.',
       'I was figuring out the puzzles, mildly annoyed at the amount of ads within the game (there is one every time you open the game or pass a level), when I hit a paywall. I either have to download an app from a questionable source to unlock the paywall, or pay to continue the game. I get having ads to help support the creators, or premium features that unlock if you pay real money for them. But to flat out shut the game down unless the customer pays is ridiculous. Immediately deleted.',
       'It\'s fun in the begin it has a great starting puzzles.. they are challenging but interesting.. until you get to put your plans in place and then find out you can\'t continue unless you pay for hints or you do unnecessary task using other apps.. I found this feature pointless because I don\'t even use the hints but the producers are making me extra hard to get them.. it\'s a bunch of b.s. at this point I am unhappy with how they set this part up.. don\'t install you\'ll be disappointed unless you have money to spend that for no reason',
       '"Free" version lets you play minimal levels. I then completed 2 different offers to get the whole game. After spending an hour on each offer, still haven\'t been given access to the full game. Game is a joke and makers are a fraud. Waiting for something to happen to my info that was added to the offers.' ,

      'A very fun and addictive game. I make bows all day, but it\'s nice to be able to shoot from my couch at night.  The influence of wind on the arrow is accurate when it comes to drift. A little costly on the upgrades for those that don\'t buy their way to the top, but all games are that way.',
       'Ok game, but bingo mode is a huge pain.  My shots filled out the opponent\'s card better than mine.  Stupid way to lose a lot of progress/coins.',
       'Game was fine. Lately, keeps freezing and somehow opponents are getting 10\'s when I CLEARLY see them hitting nowhere near the middle. Matches are freezing while i\'m ahead, then match ends and says I lost. Somehow i\'ve lost 20 million coins, and not from legit losing either. I also just played a match for 1 million coins, i had over 1 million in the bank. I know sonehow have 0 after I clearly won the match but it said I lost. Either people are using cheats or the game is not functioning properly',
       'It\'s really pathetic that apps like this only allow Facebook login... At least provide Google login too.... Not everyone uses Facebook.... Google should make it mandatory on Google play store apps to provide Google login....',
       'It feels like I\'m playing a cpu, because the first cup is easy and my opponents only score very low points. I mean, I score 8-10 and my opposition have a hard time hitting the mark at all! (I\'ve repeatedly played it a handful of times.)',
       'I personally would like to see my opponents record like you can in other games. I understand that in the higher price games its difficult to get even matches but when im a level 12 and i end up playing someone ranked 100 or higher thats a bit much.' ,

      'Great. It was working fine i used to have fun playing it before it did the last update! But after that, things changed. The game lost its memory i suppose it isnt loading my account! It starts from the start my all strategy is gone now if you could plz fix that tell me other wise ill have no choice but to uninstall this game.',
       'The game is buggy and needs some work. For me the game does not go ahead and it points on Unlocking the chest when the other chest is in process of Unlocking. None of the functions work, clearing cache, dalvik has no impact. Game works only after uninstall and again install.  Edit : the game is super smooth now . The shadow energy required to upgrade an element is increased manifold without corresponding increase in drop chances of epic and legendary chest. Hence a star removed.',
       'I have given 5 stars earlier because it was early in the game. Even in chapter one, you can\'t really progress because there is no way to make more coin other than the side quest which needs hours to refresh. In the end, you kinda not able to do anything but wait. You can\'t even replay earlier fights to earn some coins. Different mechanics than the 2. Boo.. Uninstaling..',
       'Few suggestions: 1. Add an escape roll or a quick recovery move when downed 2. Beating an opponent in duel should reduce the opponent\'s trophies. It will help in balancing match ups that appear in duels 3. Add an option to discard chests after winning a duel. It\'s most definitely a pay to win game  right now.. hope it gets better',
       'The game is cool and action packed but the only way to level up is to play the main campaign and there are no achievements with rewards to help you out. Also the ai difficulty seems like it knows your next move and not only that but each level is so much harder than the last. Plz fix',
       'Amazing game!!! but crashes after every duel fight, even though I win nearly every duel, I loose coins and progress due to it crashing after every duel!!! Very very frustrating!!!!!!!! Iv done the 10 lunar fights but it crashes after the 10th fight and I never get my rewards, every Lunar tournament fight crashes after each fight and so I\'m never rewarded so iv given up on the Lunar tournament I\'m just wasting my time in fact the whole game is a waste of time due it crashing after every duel fight, this game Could be fantastic but sadly it\'s not due to it crashing every second' ,

      'So I\'m changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it\'s a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I\'d rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!',
       'Scopely is the most greedy, disgusting company I have ever seen. The ads they have littered into the game play literally crash the game at least 4 times during a match. You will see about 10 ads on top of the crashing per game; you could be in mid roll and the ad will ruin it. So desperate for money.. Don\'t support scopelys terrible practices.',
       'Too many ads, basically requires you to buy dice. Literally the only way to ensure a win is to have dice for re-rolls. This wouldn\'t be a problem except you\'ll hardly ever win dice with the scratchers, and when you do it\'ll be one.  It\'s all a cash grab, and the ads every 3 or 4 rolls are intrusive, frequently locked in, and always very annoying. Gameplay itself is simple but just way too many ads.',
       'Dice Masters cheat. Games are rigged. Too many ads! I needed one 5. Rolled 9 times and not one. Dice Dog is very annoying!! Dice Prize Claw gives dice you already have! Played 10 times and gave me dice I already had 8 times. How dumb is that?!?',
       'This is total bull!! Cant play due to people leacing and i am not waiting 30 damn minutes again on one person too roll! Do not waste your time!!! They do not care if your opponent stays away from the game for forever. I am not waiting days to finish one game this is harrasment! Pissed off and uninstalled!',
       'It has become a chore to try and play.  Infomercials after every 2 rounds?  It is unreal.  Several friends have stopped playing and I am getting close to deleting as well.  Ads cause game play and tablet to slow down.  This game used to be fun' ,

      'It\'s fun building up stuff and I like how the game keeps playing even when closed.   One thing that annoys me, I try to watch the ads for free in game currencey, but most of the time either the ad crashes or the game is reset when I close the ad and I don\'t receive in-game currencey. Probably my potato Moto G5 doesn\'t have enough RAM. Another fingersoft game, HCR2 has the same concept and doesn\'t have this problem.',
       'I somewhat enjoyed this time wasting game until one of the characters (robots) I purchased for millions of coins just left, and sent me a picture to share with friends.  From there I had to spend another million coins to buy a human who had less skill.   Not worth playing a game that takes your hand earned characters away for no reason.',
       'I love this game but I found a bug, I don\'t know how exactly it happened but I was doing an extra task (a clown factory dice making one) I used auto clicker and was just holding one finder down and tapping to sell with the other. Now all of my factories have a die on each person\'s desk and it doesn\'t go away once sold. Other then that, great game and nice timewaster. :D',
       'It\'s a great time killer if you are waiting or have nothing to do. It does get boring after 3 and a half hours,but it\'s still good. Also way less and I mean way less ads than other games. Excuse my spelling and grammar, but you know what it means. (It\'s good)',
       'The only thing I don\'t like about this app is the controls. You can\'t hold your finger to make production faster. You have to tap constantly. But other wise, it was a great app and I recommend it\'s',
       'Absolutely love this game. Becoming addicticed already, had this game for 4 days and I love the tapping where if you use more than 1 finger it goes faster. So my family thinks I\'m crazy sitting there with my hand tapping the screen so fast, they even said "slow down there matey you\'ll break your screen of you keep going like that" long story short, now I have a cracked screen but vwry am addicted. Great game fingersoft keep up the good work' ,

Hopefully it will be fix soon and make sure to notify me when it fixed. I really love this. This might be the best fps game I\'ve played so far.',

Please have more ranked games IN AUS or else have everyone in a different server so we all have the same ping. Now i can\'t login from my phone but tablet i can, WHY???? Moderators dont do much and i\'ve never heard back from support. Please reply to this so i can change my rating',

They are so loud and I have to stop playing at night and in the day because of the vibrations can u add in a feature in the settings that enables u to turn them off!! Except from that this is the best game ever and I ADORE it!!',
       'Why do u have to pay just to see the picture and the videos? What\'s the point to that? U want us to be addicted to it but some of us can\'t buy it for a reason. Please update this and think about it. I know it\'s a low payment. It u want more people to install it. Please consider this thank u!!',
       'Personally I think the stories are a bit cheesy and there\'s very limited interactivity. Some of the stories I played had no interactivity at all. You have to pay to see photos or videos in the game, which is fair enough, but I wish the game had a set price or charged a small amount for each story. A weekly subscription fee is  too much for me. There is a free 3 day trial though.',
       'Love all of the stories on there, loads of mysteries and some good plot twists. Annoying that you have to pay to see pictures or listen to audio stuff but I just imagine what it\'s like but amazing work',
       'I SHOULDNT HAVE TO PAY TO WATCH VIDEOS. I should have to pay for certain story\'s maybe. But paying to watch the video is stupid, it throws me off the storyline Everytime because I can\'t watch the video. Shame on you, ruining a good storyline like that üò°üò°üò°üò°',
       'So I missed the first big reveal because I didn\'t want to give them money! It refused to let me watch a story critic video without paying them! I would be forgiving of a free game if it wasn\'t something important to the story of a game that is nothing but story.' ,

      'Whenever I try to open the app the screen starts flashing black and it\'ll stay like that or keeping turning back to the screen I was on and off, which ends up somewhat strobe-like. The actual game itself is amazing despite having a hard time trying to beat the bacteria level but, what\'s the point of a good game concept, if the game won\'t work properly',
       'I thought the new scenario was a free-trial only like the simian flu. (At least you can unlock it after being a brutal pro at the game) I\'m gonna enjoy playing this a good few times and unlock even MORE scenarios. Keep up the good work! I wanted to make a suggestion, but I just can\'t remember now. Oh well...',
       'Fun game. I wish the rate of death was more consistent. 37,000,000 a day at one point, but waiting 6 months for 100,000 to die towards the end. The disease didn\'t change, the rate of death shouldn\'t decrease just because there are fewer people. Good game otherwise',
       'I didn\'t buy the new plague, i might need to. The first 2 difficulty settings are easy, the 3rd not so much. Good game to me! Just have to read what it is that you spend your DNA points on and you should do just fine',
       'Really annoying ads keep repeating and covering controls.  So annoying. Pity as game is unplayable like this. It never used to happen before. Why can\'t developer just charge for extra content rather than make game unplayable. Will have to remove.',
       'Awesome game! Very addicting! You can replay over and over and it doesn\'t get boring! Just keeps getting better!  There is no need to buy if you don\'t want to.... Just because you suck doesn\'t mean it isn\'t beatable... You shouldn\'t give low stars because it\'s a difficult game! It\'s very beatable without purchase!!!  5 stars!!!!  Just keep trying!

      'The PvP system is super broken. One game might be played with someone at close to your rank and next you might be playing a player with 20,000+ more trophies than you. And along with that the 2 players aren\'t even getting the same waves of enemies to start with so someone with 8 less rank ups than you can beat you by 35,000+ points. This has only happened to me like 15 times a day so please fix it cause game ain\'t worth playing if PvP is broken.',
       'Bland, generic microtransaction-laden mobile version of a good game type. Levels are short and provide very little challenge until the difficulty spikes. Upgrades demand grinding or spending money. It\'s just more of the same trash flooding the mobile market.',
       'Great graphics and controls. Really unbalanced on PvP. So won\'t be bothering with that aspect of the game. Prices on gems is a bit of a rip off. Don\'t get much gems for the $. Will be avoiding that aspect of the game as well. Overall a solid 3 stars. Is fun, but could be so much better!',
       'Just wondering where my season rewards are I ranked pretty high and it started over but haven\'t recieved anything.  Why is this?  UPDATE: STILL WAITING FOR MY PVP REWARDS FROM A WEEK AND A HALF AGO.  WHAT GIVES?  THIS GAME IS A RIP OFF.',
       'The game was cool up until you start getting stuck and can\'t level up so the only way to move up you have to spend money to buy coins and hearts. Unfortunately people need to chase money rather than make something cool',
       'Kind of a bummer that the PvP has been under maintenance for soooooo long now.  Once you complete all the missions, the fun thing is getting new ships.  Can\'t get the newest ship without access to PvP.' ,

      'I downloaded this game and the very next morning my phone got hacked. I\'m not saying it was definitely related to the game softwares but I have no way of knowing, so I will not be installing this again. Also its clearly a straight theft of  Minecraft with only some textues and sounds changes. Blatant copy write theft.',
       'I love this game but you can\'t open chest or crafting table or stove. About the houses: it\'s really fun and easy to build the houses. And also it\'s one of the best and exiting Minecraft game ever!!! But like I said you can\'t open anythingüòë But other than that in love it can you please fix the changes that I want if you can please!! Thank you!!üòä',
       'At first the game was great but then there were a few things that need to be added. First of all, you can\'t crouch, second of all,it doesn\'t have texture packs, and make the graphics like the real version of momentary. If you add these, I will give you 5 stars.',
       'DO NOT WASTE YOUR DATA ON THIS PIECE OF TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!impossible to see at night due  to ads. ever walk around outside after midnight with a flashlight in your hand pointed at your face? well the ads make it hard as hell to see at night. i have started this game six times and cannot see anything happenning at night. and that is too big of a flaw for me tocontinue to use a game. paid 7 bucks and downloading the real minecraft right now. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!!',
       'OMG THIS GAME IS EPIC!!!!!!!!! I have 1 question, there are these holes in the ground  (in creater mode) and the holes have iron and sapphires but I\'m scared 2 go in. What are they and is it 100% safe 2 go in the tunnels? At the moment, I just block them up. Plz tell me! Oh and I LOVE the fact that the game saves on its own!!!!!',
       'CAN SOMEONE PLEASE CONTACT ME IN ANY WAY OR POST HOW TO MAKE A NETHER PORTAL!?!?!?!!?!? I\'m desperate!! My instagram is _t4nh4_   please message me how to make one or comment it here or MESSAGE ME ON EMAIL ..... Any way works! Please save meeee!!! :((' ,

      'Overall I liked the game. However, I have a few suggestions to make. First, could you please make it so the fish food is more effective or that you can upgrade it as another review said. Second, please make the time shorter because 1 hour is really long and gems are so hard to earn. Third, please make the tank more interactive. Like, you could make it so you can give the fish fish food or breed the fish or make the fish swim around freely instead of in their own level of water. Thanks!!!',
       'Adorable. I like how everything can be upgraded, catching the fish is the best part. Its very fun. You should really tell people that they can just swipe up in their aquarium to see their other fish because a lot of people seem to be confused by that. Other than than it\'s a cute game.',
       'I enjoy playing this game because the visuals are cute and the different fish you can collect are very interesting. I have a few problems with the game though, like how you can accidently waste your gems on getting a fish to come (It\'s hard to get gems in this game...). Also, there\'s not much to do in the fish tank. Other than that, it\'s a good game.',
       'The game is so awesome !!!! I love this game . It\'s very addictive . Can you add more fishes,  baits,  characters and more in the future ??.... PLEASE!!!! And the main thing is , please reduce the waiting time ..... You have wait like 1 hour which is too much .',
       'Addicting and enjoyable, with a charming art style and ambience to match. I adore it, and so do my younger siblings. The pop culture references are clever and fun to discover. I do agree that gems being easier to obtain/more interaction with your aquarium would be noteworthy updates, but love the game all the same. :)',
       'The game it\'s very entertaining for kids even I have a good time.. Gamepley is not too bad for children which is nice... but for adult it will be boring if you\'re not play the game with kids...ü§óü§ó' ,

       'Ok I changed my review from a star to a 2 star, due to the fact that this game is NOT an online game as it misleads you to think. You can turn off your mobile data and the hands still runs without a hitch. They wee so far as to randomize behavior of the AI. By that I mean in done matches your opponents or team mate will just stop, implying an AFK event. Anyway its a fun game Bhutto don\'t be a sham Devs.. Mean what you say and say what you mean..',
       'I think it would be great if the game didn\'t keep freezing on me after 2 minutes of starting it. I\'m sure it\'s not my phone because I just bought a brand new phone and it\'s been brilliant for me in every aspect and all other games are working fine. Plus the phone has a 4gb ram. I don\'t know how much more you might need',
       'it\'s just like rocket league. I love it. but may I ask something? is it an online game or am I playing against bots because there is no challenge.  but if you the developer\'s make the graphics better and have the first event free I promise to continue playing. good job on the game and keep at it can\'t wait for the full game. also I see you guys answer every comment but it\'s always the same. can you answer me maybe give me some tips or advice on the game and tell me when the next update will be thanks:)' ,

       'The latest update is shocking! Other than other reviews relating the changes on gameplay with the new update it also has many glitches and isnt able to load completely and unable to successfully play game which I\'m then forced to leave game. Won\'t be keeping game if these issues ain\'t rectified soon. I was enjoying this game till the new update, was my new go to game what a shame.',
       'The latest update has reverted my game back to when I first started playing (I still have my toons) and I no longer have access to quick battles. Really poor effort by the Devs.',
       'Amazing update!  You guys have fixed so many problems the game had especially game play. I was about to delete it, havent played in months but with how the game is now i can\'t stop playing it!',
       'What in the hell is this update? My task point is negative The source of wheelticket is gone This update is forcing me to give up this game  Thank you if you notice',
       'I have had the game for over a week now and ot started off fine but now it glitches out on me and won\'t let me play competition battles and since quick play has been taken away i have found it alot less intresting to play. And it is to repetitive on the wheel and needs to be more randomised to collect tokens for other characters.' ,

      'I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.',
       'I really, really love this game, but, I keep losing my ball count and I don\'t understand why this is happening. For instance, I have 90 balls and I\'m supposed to have 92, I don\'t get the 92. I will give 5 stars until the bug is fixed. The ads I don\'t care about because that only happens at the end of each game which is ok. Please fix this so I can give you 5 stars.  Update- I figured out why I keep losing my count with my balls. Everytime I get the balls by the number blocks, it wouldn\'t count themüòê I could get a lot further if this was fixed. If this keeps on happening, I\'m going to uninstall this game. I hope it doesn\'t come to that because I really love this game. Please fix asap!!',
       'If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.',
       'It\'s good at first but you\'ll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.',
       'Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I\'m not spoiling it, but I will tell you it\'s a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don\'t know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.',
       'Both my husband and I have this game.  I opted to pay for the no ads though, he did not.  DO NOT do this!  He is able to get "continues" for watching adds and can keep climbing up the levels.  I cannot since I purchased no adds.  I get to continue once and that\'s all since I have stopped ads from allowing me to get the extra chances.  I wish I would have known this beforehand. Otherwise, this game is seriously fun and addicting.' ,

      'Several times now I\'ve tried to type in a logo name and the app has told me I got it wrong but I thought it was right and couldn\'t see why I was being told I was wrong. So I hit "solve" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I\'ve recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you\'ve ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?',
       'This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further.',
       'Not a bad game, but would be great if you could simply type the name down, instead of slowly searching for each individual letter. Makes it all sluggish and takes away the fluidity of the game.',
       'First Level at Barbie and Twitter, even if type the words correct, the app tells me that there\'s a mistake. Solve shows me exactly the same word I\'ve typed in before',
       'Several times I have tried to use a hint and it  wouldn\'t take it off and it was difficult and easy. When I type in the logo it would tell me I\'m wrong then I hit solve and it was the same thing I wrote also and if people don\'t know some of the logos what is the point of the game.',
       'It\'s too easy to amass a huge number of hints and use them. I\'d like not to be able to complete every level without doing some online searches.' ,

    description: 'Put your engineering skills, intuition and smarts to test in this brand new Bridge Construction Simulator puzzle game. You will become a constructor who is required to improvise and ‚Äì most of all ‚Äì adapt to the task at hand. Use your resources to construct structures able to hold the weight of a car.¬†Try to become a good builder as fast as you can - things will get hard. You won\'t be racing against the time, so be a careful and thoughtful constructor.You will design and construct increasingly elaborate bridges across four varied locations. Each one is a different logic puzzle for a thoughtful builder. Things may seem easy when you start out in a city, but once you move to the canyon, valley and finally mountains it will get hard. The task is never impossible, but the size and resilience of your structures will have to increase substantially if you don\'t want to be responsible for a car crash. Use your logic and skill to become a master bridge builder and break some records along the way!In addition to the normal mode Bridge Construction Simulator offers an easy (for an increased budget and more flexibility) or hard one (for an ultimate, seemingly impossible puzzle challenge that will be able to break even the best builder). There is something for a constructor of every skill level. If you find yourself in a tight spot, a hint system will help guide you to the solution and help you build your skill as a builder. Use the help provided to construct bridges that will not break.The game is a simulator that makes extensive use of realistic physics. As the car drives through the construction you\'ve built you will see it stretch and bend. That way even if you fail you can see the weak points of your construction and use your logic to improve it. Build with your brain and you will be good.Realistic and detailed graphics make every level of Bridge Construction Simulator come to life and even offer a slight consolation when you fail as a constructor. Because when your bridge collapses and the car falls down, you can at least expect a spectacular crash! Just enjoy it and don\'t let it break you - muster your skill and try again! Nothing is ever impossible for an ambitious constructor. Play and become a legendary bridge builder!Game features:- Superb physics - a true simulator - Multiple addictive levels across four different worlds- State of the art realistic graphics- Fantastic, varied and detailed environments - you won\'t get bored as you build - Spectacular special effects- Mind bending, challenging puzzles requiring the use of thought and logic - Varying skill levels for increased challenge or more relaxed gameplay - something for every constructor - Built-in hint system helps you build your skill',

       'Money hungry. everything is gems now. Seriously. Dont download it. I played it for a while but immediately stopped when i realized they charge gems for grenades now and most players hack. Devs want to do minimal work and make max money. Gross excuse of what was once a decent game.',
       'Hit level 10 and the game is over unless you drop money on it. Everyone running legendary sniper, shotguns, ARs. Leading up to lvl 10 the game is equal and fun and the rented guns worked awesome making the chests coveted. Perfect game until you hit lvl 10. Pretty sad',
       'Pretty much after lvl10 kiss the fun time and balance goodbye unless you are willing to put cash into the game. It\'s bs that some weapons are so strong like sniper and shotguns. It was fun and has a chance at 5 star if you take care of those issues.',
       'Its not what it said it was but it is fun, till u reach hacker-vill i was killed out of no where when i saw the killed feed it said i was killed by a crowbar by someone on the other side of the man this game is ok but it needs alot of fixing that u more aswell make a new game starting from nothing (everything u see in the photos are lies)',

      'The graphics aren\'t the best and the set up isn\'t totally comprehensive. Some maps are so zoomed in that it\'s hard to recognize the general location unless you\'re already really familiar with geography. It could be more interesting, but the questions are good and it has helped me learn some.',
       'I\'m extremely impressed by your app. It is not only fun, but it is the best educational app that has taught me so much! The border outline is the only thing that needs better graphics...otherwise I couldn\'t be happier!!! (An offline mode would make this app perfect) . Thank you!üôãüíØüí°üëç‚ùóüå†üèÜüíù‚ò∫',
       'Was a great game, I learned a ton of geography. But now the ads are seriously out of control. Top players are really the ones who watch the most ads. Also, it would be nice if the encyclopedia allowed you to compare countries for a given category instead of only being able to view a single country.',
       'The graphics/fonts and everything are outdated, but there is SO much information you can be quizzed on. I\'m learning everyday!',
       'Good game, but could someone help me? I don\'t know where to ask anywhere else. I\'m a level 32 and I have changed my phone. Now it asks for my user ID, which apparently isn\'t the same as my user name, which I know. Where could I retrieve it? I\'d hate to start over.',
       'It is challenging and does exercise the brain! I do find the format a bit confusing and the categories misleading (e.g. questions about Africa under "Americas" (?) But fun overall.' ,

      'Absolutely shocked, appalled and quite frankly disgusted. I dont know if anyone else has experienced what my 7yr old son has but on loading the game he was shown a flashing image of a man getting stabbed in the eye. This gqme has been removed and i have reported it to the video standards board that apply ratings on these games. Not sure how these things are even possible?',
       'I would put a zero if I could. This is by far the worst LEGO game ever, and like always it\'s very boring and has poor graphics and gameplay. What is anything creative here? The fact that you get to choose what you build? It is so stupid on so many levels. I do not recommend this game.',
       'Love all the Lego apps. They know Legos are awesome enough that playing with some digital versions is enough to promote buying the physical bricks. ~~~~ NO ADS - Just Fun! ~~~ Even the adults like this one. It\'s comparable to minions paradise but with all the waiting and advertising removed.',
       'I think it is very easy and fun But the dragon and girls who were just a bit late and you don\'t know what are these guys were going out with a friend to see what he says it\'s been awhile but not limited number to be there by now I\'m in slug the same for all that stuff from this point to do some buildings on my island',
       'It is like the best Lego game it is a very I don\'t know how long I am going to say very great game i saw a lot of good rewies and they were telling that it was a good game that\'s when I downloaded it and it turned out to be a good game it has five islands I don\'t know how to get the fifth one yet if you find out please let me know and if you do thank you I would recommend this game because it is fun and there is no Ads because Ads in games sometimes take long and some are short I don\'t like them because what if you were at a good part of the game like you were at island five and there was an ad that took three minutes and you could not skip it I think it is probly in the top therty or fourty I love this game download it and you would like it too that\'s all fokes',
       'EVERYBODY WHO SAID *BORING* IS OBVIOUSLY NOT 7 OR UNDER. USING HASHTAGS? PLEASE, THIS GAME IS FOR 7 YEAR OLDS SO BEFORE YOU START COMPLAINING, PLEASE TELL ME WHY YOU\'RE PLAYING?' ,

      'Good I hope they fixed the bug where you double buy a car and it gives you the same car but still takes your money. But its still a great game. Ohh! And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.',
       'It\'s good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn\'t too much skill involved but it\'s a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I\'ve lost countless games because it doesn\'t stop or doesn\'t back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!',
       'Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it\'s a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can\'t go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I\'m out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!',
       'Good, but has some bugs I\'m sorry if I\'m being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall',
       'Shalom there, The game is awesome. I liked it very much and hoping that in the future they will be more cars to be added. I really hope that "military helicopter" can shoot something, it is funny...so idle. Last thing, a HOVERCRAFT can go "river mode" ! Wrecked... because of...water. Hope you\'ll add the " police boats " in next update. Overall, abundant of thanks and good luck.',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME. It just need\'s some work to do. Like, you guys need to fix the glitch of the lines by the road. And you need to fix when we explode the oil truck and fall on the ground and you disapear. And can u guys please add some new prizes like to change the color of ur car. And when I have 100 dollars u can spend it on colors  theirs a button to choose what prize you want. Like say I get the color blue for a red car. And I like the red car so I go to the prize machins and choose to buy a color than I have the button to change the color of ur car. That will make the game a lot better.

      'Some of the objectives are impossible complete. Like collecting the snowflakes in the big air. It\'s easy to find them but the locations they turn up make it impossible. And completing the rail slides in the halfpipe... I\'ve done more than enough board slides of every type and it won\'t complete. Still gave 5 stars though. The game reminds me of the original Shawn white pro snowboarding games.',
       'Thanks so much for the game, gave me hours of entertainment on car and plane rides, also helped me discover a couple old punk bands which is sick. A couple of small glitches in objectives you can\'t complete but oh well nothing huge',
       'Love the game. Disappointed that after making the quad exp purchase I am sti seeing ads. Kinda makes you not wanna play a game when you realize a developer is only out to nickel and dime customers to death...',
       'Really fun game with one glitch. Great graphics, great sound, really fun gameplay. However you cannot complete all the challenges. So as long as gamification completeness is not your goal and you can leave things showing as 14/15 complete then all is good.',
       'Ok so the last time I uninstalled was because the tutorial sucked and the menu was bad and the controls were horrific. Now with the new update, the same tutorials are finally finishable, the menu looks so much better. only thing keeping me from giving a five star are the controls, too sensitive',
       'Love it. Reminds me of my ssx tricky days, combined with the game objectives of Tony hawk\'s games. Played it once & immediately bought it. Well worth the money, I\'ve already spent hours playing this' ,

      'I hate it! There is only three looks to do, and the make up! Literally you have to click on it a thousand times until you get the one you like. The cloths aren\'t that bad, but they can be a little more pretty. They should make it for boys and girls, so you can dress up boys, and maybe the boys can take a girl on a date so, they could get married and then they can have children but, it would be a life cycle! They would start out as babies and grow on and get married!!! Hope you like my feedback!! P.S. Plz update the game!!!',
       'I gave you 4/5 star\'s, if you make a second version then i will install it again and play it then make it 5/5 star\'s, if not i will move on to more dress up game\'s and other types of games',

      'A really nice game which also got me hooked up! Nevertheles, it frequently and automatically shuts down, deleting what was there.....this really broke my litlle sister\'s heart, even mine. For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....',
       'So, this is an awesome, addictive and fun, satisfying game to play and it is really good if you want to become a nail artist. I would of gave it five stars but it is a bit unreal like you can just rub the nail varnish everywhere but it only appears on the nail but that can stop you from being annoyed because it is not as hard as it is in real life and one of my designs didn\'t go into my album because the game just got stuck and randomly stopped by its self and it went back to my home screen. Also there is too many ads. I am not interested! And you can\'t cross them off unless you download the app! What point is that?! And I cannot move and make the stickers bigger on match this so I can\'t complete it. Help! Sort this out!',
       'I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn\'t get me board everytime i have different desins to do.',
       'Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!',
       'Cute Its a very nice game. The best thing I liked in this game is that everything is already unlocked, we don\'t need to spend real money or even coins in the game. It has so many options for colours, designs and stickers. But it also has too many adds. On the whole I liked it very much',
       'I  am finally at the final last level! Before I thought it was boring but after I reached some levels farther I thought it was awesome! And it is the best game ever! YEAH!!!!!!!!üòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüíôüíôüíöüíöüíõüíõüíúüíúüíóüíó‚ù§‚ù§ AND when I was playing my 1st game all things were opened but when I played in my small sister\'s tab all, things were closed!

       'I think it is a wonderful, fun game to play but...it takes days for me to train I  really really REALLY wanna play online with my friends! I really love this game and keep up the hard work! Thank you and have a Great day/night! &lt;3 :)',

       'Love the game love that you can rear your own foal and transfer it to the real game fab xx',
       'Its really good BUT I can\'t get past this one training session with my foals. It just seems silly that I can\'t get past it because its really simple. I read another review before downloading the app which had the same problem. Also I think that there should be some more breeds that are quite well known (eg Thoroughbreds  or üíñStockhorses üíñ)  pretty good game all round.',
       'I hate how we have to pay to transfer the horses to the game. Not everyone can pay ya know? This app should cost no money at all since we pay so much for star coins/star rider already. Please be considerate or I\'m gonna have to drop both games cause I can\'t afford to pay for both.' ,

      'Classic tetris with modern graphics, you can use one touch controls or classic directional pad if you wish, both have their own advantage. I am afraid I can\'t find Bradinsky song. It\'s okay for me with advisement because EA need something to eat right? Lol',
       'Enjoyed it at first, and short adverts were expected, but recently adverts have become longer, and now last longer than the game. The latest video advert lasted inbetween games lasted 8 mins....ridiculous!!!. I understand the need for adverts, but if you can\'t play the game, the adverts are pointless, espeacially if it makes players quit.',
       'I just wanted to play Tetris. Happy to pay for it, was hoping I could pay a $5-10 purchase price and then have the game and play it to my liking. No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It\'s TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred',
       'When I saw that EA took on the game I immediately purchased it thinking it was any good. The graphics are good, but the controls are nerve-wrecking and the game makes decisions for you. It responds slowly and the block hold works by itself. These little things make you lose and make the game unplayable. Don\'t download it - free or not, look for another Tetris because this does no justice to the original',
       'Trying to play Tetris with these abysmal touch and swipe controls is an absolute abject mess. Just add some virtual buttons in, since your loot-boxing asses are supposedly so focussed on \'player choice\' lately.',
       'Great game, but there\'s an annoying window that pops up everytime I try and start a new marathon. The window is pretty much useless and wastes my time. Would give this 5 stars if it gets patched' ,

      'Hello! I\'ve seen this game many times from the ads and I tried installing it and later found that this game was really intertaining and fun. Anyways, I am having problems with the game\'s connectivity to the internet. I am using 4G in playing the game and it seems that it does not connect very well, other online games connect well to the internet. I think that is the only issue I have in mind. Just hoping for more smoothness though.. But I love the game, it is worth the time playing. Thank you!!',
       'I dont know why you chosen Retro style graphic and i hope for a change. There is a lot of IRANIAN players but PING is over 250ms and too much delay. Add iran flag. Google play sign-in is not working. Add more skins. Events are just bunch of objectives and prizes, add more artworks and stuff for events. Other things are good for now. Thanks for the revolutionary IO game. Congratulation on 10million downloads üíù',
       'simple, fun, addictive gameplay, good graphic with unique animations, great events that keep players active which is good, have great potential. dark adventure loading still takes too long, i already dead when the loading is finished. crashing and some bugs in event tab. talking about awaken system, man atleast dont downgrade the stars or reduce the percentage of downgrade, finding awaken item is already damn hard. this great game need new character and more feature but not p2w. keep the good work barbarq !!',
       'YOU GUYS ACTUALLY LISTENED!!! Im so happy right now because when I saw theres a new update, I immediately downloaded it to see if I can play it without crashing. I can actually play it now with my friends! A little bit of framrate drop but still... I can play this wonderful game. Im going to totally recommend this game to my friends. The devs of this game are the best devs in the Google Play Store. Again, Im truely greatful and I thank you guys. :D',
       'It is the best game I\'ve ever played! With simple graphics and gameplays, you won\'t notice how long you\'ve played! Generous with presents daily and very recommended to spend time. However with the new update, I can\'t connect and it stayed on connecting. Tried to change internet source, but to no avail it\'s still there.  I would like to ask the developers, to reply as soon  as possible, on what should I do to get rid of this problem.',
       'Feels like lots of players are AI bots. I\'ve won my first 10 matches with a 10+ holyshit mega kill every time. Looks a bit pay to win as a champ you must buy has a very OP skill. The amount of awakening to hit 5 and get the extra skill is astronomical and will require money to be spent. Also, not one person is speaking English. It\'s all Spanish/Portuguese.' ,

      'Great game for its genre. However it desperately needs some events maybe a daily login bonus and some form of vip ladder. I like the nostalgic of the old game but I feel like the developers made the game and just walked away from it. Please for love of games add new stuff and throw some events to us who are almost maxed out. This happens and I\'m totally cool with a 5 star rating',
       'Best game in years and I especially love the character jam and there are many more for you to collect they are worth the get even when your scroundging around for the last few characters. Also it\'s crazy how much they throw at you for watching an ad It can give you 20 diamonds to 8 hours of cash it\'s insane',
       'I was playing a game when this ad came up with a fake X so that it would take you to the play store. I hate shady practices like this so I installed it just so I can give you this review. Enjoy your single freak\'n star!  PS This is not a review of the game itself and I could care less at this point. This review is on this games advertisment tactics.',
       'Fun game, cool animations and graphics. Good music and sound effects. Can you help with diamonds and sell out features just a tad bit more. I enjoy the game. Awesome job developers and programmers. Nice twist on the classic crazy taxi game',
       'Great game, it\'s fun to play. Would rate it higher, but it often crashes when I\'m trying refuel or double my earnings by watching ads. Then the game restarts, and I can\'t refuel for awhile, or I list the bonus earnings. FRUSTRATING!!',
       'Pretty fun. But I don\'t think drivers or taxi drivers should drive like that, let alone be rewarded for hitting other cars like they do... Lol in the car it\'s cool but I wouldn\'t want to be physically in the game. It\'d hurt and be scary. Lol' ,

      'Well guys.. I just broke the game üòÇ it was the \'HEADLIGHT\' puzzle where I got stuck. I requested for a hint and I accidentally tapped out the E in it and now it\'s completely gone. There\'s no letter E no more in there. You should check this out. (So I requested a hint twice, went wrong on the word and then tapped E, and poof, it\'s gone) and maybe you should make a reset puzzle button for situations like this. üòÉ',
       'Very easy, boring and full of unskippable ads for no reward. Not a very clever game as some have suggested, this gives the player no sense of accomplishment nor any legitimate challenge unless you do not speak English.',
       'Just got really boring. In a group of 10 puzzles there was; 1 that was a clever brain teaser, about 7 that were just way too easy and severely lacked creativity, and at least 2 that were just genuinely terrible often making little to no sense whatsoever and then it just turned into a game of hangman with unlimited guesses. Clearly this was made by a team or individual who thinks that they are supper clever and witty but in reality just wanted to make a few easy bucks by showering people with adds and a completely unnecessary currency system.',
       'The best time spent by playing this game ... Some are easy, some are funny, some are tricky, some are still out of the mind.... But it\'s a wonderful game and waiting for more levels to come now...',
       'After completing 55 levels I get a blank screen. Are there any plans to add new levels?',
       'Its a great gane but is always glitching out.For example I have three leters after I use a hint,then I earn a hint and the other letter just disapears and it did not go onto the word or phrase.' ,

      'This game was actually better than I thought. I thought it was going to be one of those stupid games where it has a stupid amount of ads and stuff, but it was quite good. Unfortunately I had to uninstall this game (I\'m sorry Train Depo!) Because it I already have loads of games. This is a good game and I also love the way that you get loads of money when you go to loads of stations at a park. The only thing is I managed to upgrade all of the stuff for the coaster and don\'t know what to do with it. Other than that, it\'s good',

      'Very great game. Gets a little boring after a while though, you should consider adding some sort of multiplayer. Oh and add more weapons  and maybe improve the ai to be well, more smarter at least lol. Also maybe increase the time it takes for the zone to start appearing because well it becomes unfun when the game is cut short lol Other than that the game is amazing lol',
       'It\'s good, but it needs work. The inability to run and switch weapons at the same time is crippling, as you tend to stop in the midst of running to switch your weapon, leaving the enemy with a few seconds to land a few shots upob you. Another issue is the lack of customizability. I have trouble touching the run button as it\'s too small relative to my phone, and setting the gui to make it as large as possible doesn\'t help.',
       'Amazing game all together but needs some MAJOR changes: add an online multiplayer mode where you can play with random players or with friends using text invites or LAN (local area network). And add more guns like snipers and miniguns. And make AIs start with no weapon and make them able to pick up weapons otherwise it is too hard and unfair. And also make it so you can change the layout of the buttons because it is hard to run and then walk after. And also make the normal walking speed faster. Other than that it is an amazing fortnite-based game that you can have loads of fun in. And get rid of the zone or at least make it move slower. And finally make it so if you win the match you get gold. If you make these changes I will DEFINITELY make this rating a 5 star and it would make the game sooooo much better. I would really appreciate it if you did make these changes to the game.',
       'Honestly I was suprised, Ugandan knuckles meme was never hilarious but it gavd me a few chuckles but I\'d rather flex my knuckles. It was pretty fun just one thing... Add online, please the game is WAY too easy.',
       'I wish the ZONE could be removed. I want to play without the zone coming and killing everybody. It is like a time thing where you have to complete the game on time. I hate that. Pls remove it',
       'This game is great! It may be a new series for my channel "TheGamerNite100"! But one thing tho, can that red zone thing get removed. also can u add more guns plz' ,

      'One of the best wwe games.. even better than immortals.. the difficulty level is always fair when competing with online rivals... gaining loot boxes is also perfect and  not very difficult... I obviously made some In app purchases so I could compete well... just wish to open a loot box and get 1 four star wrestler... things would get awesome I don\'t mind paying for it as well..',
       'STRENGTH : Nice game, wonderful graphics and commentary, great feature of versus and events mode. WEAKNESS : I have spinned loot cases many times but I never got a good superstar. So, purchasing a superstar by using gold or cash should be replaced instead of spinning. Another issue is we cannot remain as a wwe champion as there is no race for championship. Entrance should be added like wwe 2k has done.',
       'My favorite game. But makers please read my request carefully it is very important. The New update has a huge errors when playing as a sting. When i use his finishing move scorpion deathlock the game stops and i have to quit. So if i am winning then also i loose and also then injured sting so that would be not fair. Pls solve my problem',
       'This is so conniving at times, when opening a briefcase you time it perfectly and the game suddenly changes the order of the rewards time and time again, so instead of the wrestler you would of landed on you end up with bloody big e for the 20th time. If you want to make it harder up the spin speed but this feels like being actually robbed at times. Poor practice, shame on you!',
       'Game is good except for one thing. You gotta fix the "Versus" mode. How is it "fair" for me to be level 3 but for my first match online be put up against a level 12?? Makes no sense. Should be match making so you match up with someone close to your own level..',
       'Missed out on pvp rewards due to event ending early. Ever since release this app has been plagued with issues. Support is not responsive at all. I\'m beginning to wonder if they will ever figure it out.' ,

      'I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won\'t give up.. And I\'m not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won\'t put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I\'ll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.',
       'So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em\' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.',
       'I enjoy playing your slot games.  They are captivating and entertaining. However, I have noticed a little "trick" with the algorithm... I have observed that when I started playing, I would win at a decent frequency and would win a decent amount.  The longer I play, the longer between wins, and the less I win. Fewer and fewer wins are taking the fun out of it for me and have me contemplating looking for another game.',
       'This game was fun but now a huuge waste of money.  You make a big purchase to play at minimal bets for 15 minutes. They did numerouse recent "updates" and now almost every person you talk to says how bad it is now.  Thatnks a ton for ruining what used to be a good game.',
       'So far this is without a doubt, the best casino app... It has Slots,  Black Jack, video poker, baccarat, as well as Texas hold,em.  GREAT Deals on chips and as far as I can tell; it doesn\'t cheat...  I recommend it over all the others in its class right now..',
       'I really enjoyed playing early on , payouts were nice and I really like the club I\'m in. Lately I\'ve noticed I don\'t get paid for all my winning spins, sometimes they would have been big payouts. Hit the same exact thing a few spins later and it will pay so I have to wind up buying more chips. Just like a real casino I don\'t expect to always win, but if I do hit something even a real casino pays so that needs t o be addressed.' ,

      'Honestly I think it\'s amazing that they sell this game for free because it is one of the best games I\'ve ever played in my life. It doesn\'t take any internet and the animals in details so good and the graphics. If you\'re ever bored you should download this game and play it all the time.',
       'Sometimes it feels like the difficulty of the levels is way off. Levels labeled "hard" or "super hard" are many times much easier than standard levels. I do enjoy the amount of unlimited lives given, and the speed at which lives are replenished, however. Overall, a good time-passer',
       'Guys, you have a glitch that needs fixed. Side game (right now the ignite game) causes app to close every time. Also... Inserting the gold in the piggy bank takes way too long. Speeding up that process or allowing a skip feature would be nice.',
       'I adore this game. However, I have had 7 gold bars for over a year and every time I win a level that awards lots of gold bars the game tells me my bank is full... even though everything costs at least 9 gold bars. According to my math I should have over 100 bars. I would settle for two at this point.',
       'Highly addictive. I love this game but there is one fault that it doesn\'t allow your device to enter sleep mode. I have ruined 2 phone screens with burnt in images because of this. I would fall asleep playing the game and when I wake up it\'s still on the screen.  I also don\'t understand why the special games are not offered on the Facebook game.',
       'Love it love it love it....1/218..this is still one of 3 of my favorite games but... you have this golden piggy who collects gold bars.. i have filled it several times but then i find out you want me to pay for them after winning them... NOT HAPPY...' ,

      'Dear SEGA,  can you see if you can release sonic 3 and sonic and knuckles? I love seeing Sonic return in his classic form. I loved Sonic 1 and Sonic 2. This game, Sonic CD had me excited for getting. I hope you love the journey of the original Sonic The Hedgehog  games. I never was around when Sonic came, but after playing his first act, I had to play ALL the games. Thank you. P.S. why did you put the Sonic killing himself secret in Sonic CD? Kids are playing him! Not teens! What age were you aiming him at? 11+?!',
       'One of the best Sonic games with some cool new features added. It\'s even better then ever with the glitches fixed. (Thanks Sega/Whitehead!) It\'s very playable with a phone touchscreen, and plays like the original.  Could use the custom touchscreen control options that Sonic 1 & 2 had, but the controls work just as good as those regardless. Kinda wish it had Knuckles unlockable though. Still, great remake, time trial mode is great, and offers plenty of unlockables. It\'s especially worth buying "no ads" for offline play.',
       'Okay, this is insane. Connections to the Play Store are extremely broken and the ads are horrendous. The static got EVEN WORSE now. Super loud and hurts my ears. Strange random graphical glitches on title screen and during gameplay. ALL SPRITES ON SCREEN DISAPPEAR except for environment. Extremely common. Completely unplayable.',
       'Hey this game is good but what\'s up with the ring statics and the walk and tap down? Some times in a act I walk into a couple rings, only to hear this crazy static. And the spining. When I spin(walk and then tap down) I don\'t hear a thing. Normally doing that you should hear this sound like in other sonic games. Can you fix both of these glitches? Thanks so much.',
       'THANK YOU :) but the audio quality is bad. Keeps cracking. This wasn\'t a problem when this game was on the app store before :( and it kinda sucks that I can\'t play offline. I wouldn\'t mind paying if it means I can',
       'Well see its good game buuut there are waayy too many ads like heck if I pause it it will show an add and I don\'t see way you have to stay connected to the internet at all times' ,

      'The game is fun. However, most times it takes a long time to "reload" from a previous game especially if you\'ve won some chests. often times the next game has already started and some times even missed out in buying cards for it. Also, When you\'ve leveled up, the prompt screen for this lingers for too long as well. Though I\'m not quite sure if it\'s the game or just my phone.',
       'When I was on Facebook a message poped up saying. Congratulations you been chosen to receive 3 free spins. So I took the chance and went for it. I got 3 free spins and I got winner on the 3 spin. How do I now receive the prize money of $3,500? This the amount showing I won.',
       'Would be a great game if the support team actually paid attention to complaints. I have written to them 3 times about my missing crediyd6and have received no response!',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a while. I\'ve made ZERO progress in the last 4 days. It seems this app forces you to spend money to make progress. Yes, they have their daily bonuses. But almost guaranteed you\'ll lose every time.  Haven\'t made any progress in 4 days. I refuse to spend money on an app that advertises as free. Will find a better app.',
       'it\'s impossible to get bingo and finish the levels. they made it so you can\'t play as a guest AND through fb with different credits balances and levels. I\'ve been playing this game 5 years. Uninstalled today because of that.',
       'I love this game but you don\'t give many bingo chips  at all or many bongos at all I am going to down load  this game one more time and if you guys don\'t fix this problem  I can promise  you it rateings will be worst then it is now' ,

       'I downloaded this game and tested it. The controls are terrible, I can\'t even pick up the scissors. Parts of the hair I found out that you could not cut it. I don\'t have a clue why they made this game when it is this horrible. I don\'t recommend this game at all. My rating will say 1 star because there isn\'t a 0 star option. My true rating is 0 star.',
       ',okay it\'s just that when I play the game in like when I cut the hair and stuff and messes up on me like that!! It would be great if y\'all will fix the game and make it like more realistic and more funner and make the controls work better cuz I\'ll be awesome',
       'It was hard to use in general and the graphics a bad. I wish it was more realistic. You don\'t even really get to choose where you cut.',

      'It\'s a great game in terms of versatility (as versatile a single game can be) and you can almost always play as there is a table for any amount in the start-up kitty. Like most Android poker games it gives you the option for daily free chips so you can play daily should you wish. Where it falls short is table talk and conversations are extremely limited. I mostly play in bed, at night, until sleepy so table talk isn\'t really for me most of the time but if you are wanting a social chit-chat game this isn\'t it.',
       'Look at your ledger board.. Typically the 1st names are Fake profiles, so you can\'t advance without buying chips to beat unreasonable winnings.. They all have similar stats.. no best winning hand.. no pic.. some have same name or real similar..It\'s obvious they are fake and Zynga has confirmed this, yet hasn\'t removed them.. They continue to allow it every week..',
       'Good game, but it has a major bug that a lot of people face daily, most of my poker buddies get the same issue. Joining a table will leave us on the loading screen and it gets stuck there. Back button does nothing, and you have to force exit the game. Sit and go tournaments do work every time, which is odd. I\'ve invested over 50 euros in this game, but with a game breaking bug like this, I\'m considering uninstalling it.',
       'I have to bring you down to 3 Stars bcos I think you manipulate my play. Imagine within 1 day I lost 400 million chips. Every hand I lost weirdly. Examples, I had a pair of Aces but lost to 2 pairs, I had a straight but lost to flush, I had flush but lost to house and the list goes on. Don\'t tell me that was coincidences or no luck and not my day. Then your announcements kept popping out telling me it is time to purchase chips and continue to play like a real HiRoller. This is really sickening to realise that I had been taken for a ride. Sorry I won\'t buy chips after this scam. When Iost the balance 47 millions chips I will say "Hasta La Vista" to you!',
       'Had trouble restarting sit and go. Returning to lobby and reentering addressed problem. Pretty good app. Real problem is goals get more difficult when previous goals not achieved yet. Why if I\'m not that good yet? And what are these trophies?',
       'What the hell zynga? I won around 20m, went back to lobby and suprise. 7m dissapeared in the dust. How can you take so much from a win? This game is so unfair and I\'m sure it\'s rigged. In real life you\'ll never see dozens of flushes and straights and a few 4 of a kinds in a day. Every day. And bots, hackers or whatever they are make it impossible to get to top xx in leagues so there\'s no way to advance unless you have a lot of chips and win a lot. I recommend you to not purchase anything because this game is broken.' ,

      'Uninstalling. The controls are imprecise (ball would slip off the desired direction occasionally) and the order of the colours would make it impossible to win on occasion. I can forgive the first thing (muscle) but making it impossible to win is not forgivable.  Work on the algorithm.',
       'It was great at first. Addicting. I was really looking forward to more levels but they suck. Too many kinds of bubbles. Why did the update change old levels too? Major disappointment.  Edit 2/19/18: it was back to being great when they took away all the extra kinds of bubbles. But after a few hundred levels...they\'re back. Balls with three locks, slime, water bubbles or whatever that is. Lured people back in and then disappointed again.',
       'Too many ads. Devs are getting greedy with how many ads they put in, I got 3 before I even got to play. Don\'t bother with this junk.',
       'Games really nice good mind challenge, great for color match making if color blind. You may not know what colors your matching however, ever since i started playing i\'ve also been getting better at matching my clothes and random day to day organising of colored items. Love the game however the ball simetimes seems to go where it wants to instead of where you released it... I noticed this a few times i would aim let go and the line would randomly jump to a new spot and the ball shots almost a completely diffrent location',
       'I loved the game before they updated everything. I hate the new levels and the slim and ice balls. I enjoyed this game bcz it was easy and calming but now its just annoying and frustrating!!üò´üò´üò≠üò§üò¢',
       'Was very much enjoying the game but the new update has moved the ball switcher underneath the ad bar.... So I can no longer switch between one ball and the next... I suppose I can\'t play anymore because that\'s just frustrating.' ,

      'Ok I get it but why do the army kill you for no reason? I like this game because you can do roleplay and I\'m a girl and there is girl skins which is amazing but can you start with a girl skin and a boy skin to be fair with the girls  Pls do these. Love your company :-) but can you add a roleplay mode that would be great DO MORE:-) but now on my new tablet it won\'t let me play it please fix that and reply',
       'Good. However, the apple versioned platform overwhelms us by many advantages: They can earn coins and cash quicker n easier. They get options on what currency they use to purchase things. They get to higher leagues easier. Their weapon description overpasses ours as ours literally gives us damage and capacity whereas theirs comes with fire rate, trait etc.',
       'I love this game but I have a couple of requests 1st. Could you add u YouTuber skin back like boy,girl,animal then YouTuber 2nd. Could you add a button that you can press that alows you to make your own custom paint job for any vehicle that would be amazing 3rd. Can you make and road that ends come back into the city at the other side example the road behind the hospital 4th. Could add like 5 houses around the city that you can go into 5th. More vehicles   If you agree with what I have sead in this comment like so the developer can see!',
       'I love this game. But for the next update, u should give each skin there own special ability. Like the flash and hulk skins. Give the flash super speed, give hulk super strength and etc. So that everyone can get a different type of advantage. Plz make this happen next update also make a goku skin. So u can turn super saiyan. And have other transformation. So can u plz have every skin to have different abilities that match the skin',
       'I have been playing the game for 6 or 5 years and it has been the best game i have played. So, i  think you have to make this game better in the next update.Here r my suggestions 1 make the graphics better. 2 day and night shift. 3police attacks bandit in adventure mode.4 add a clan.  I hope u will add these in the next update.Also too many players that hacked their health so plz fix it.Thx',
       'This Game Is Awesome Ilove It Somuch I could Play it With My friends Keep It Up I think That You Should Add some New Weapons Like Lightsaber And You Should Make The People Drive Cars .Why  Peoples Does Not Drive Car?. Well But thats not good make the people drive thanks Keep It Up.' ,

      'I mean it\'s obvious that this is fake. I especially like that it tells you to keep in mind that true love cannot be calculated instead of saying it gives real results. It\'s literally impossible for an app, or anyone/ anything to determine soulmates based on names. However I gave this game 3 stars because it caught my attention unlike some games do, also I like that you don\'t have to do a quiz or put pictures or describe personalities for a fake answer.   don\'t get your hopes up but definitely check it out',

      'Got too allgegro madness. And got stuck with the no face cards. 14 cards is alot to get. In fairway blast the card suits stick until a new none face card comes up, or reshuffles them. I find with this game they dont stick when the next card is turned over. So your run ends. And the run cards you ave accumulated as returned back to one agan.',
       'I totally love this game, but there\'s always aye glitch and then it blanks out so I have to reinstall the app multiple of times so I could keep playing.. So maybe admin you could take a look at it for us please as I would totally love to keep playing this game as its a great game to play especially when your winning down after such along day.. Thanks',
       'I love solitaire games, but this game is impossible. The first rounds will be easy, and then you\'re hit with ridiculous difficulty and straight up unwinnable games, that is, unless you spend money to get power ups that shouldn\'t even be necessary. 100% pay to win game. Which I find very sketchy. I\'ll never download anything from these developers ever again.',
       'It\'s a fun game!! can keep you very entertained only thing that sucks is if you have it on PC or iOS there are way more features and it\'s way better than the Android version!!üò¢ So the side note is for the developers at Big Fish Games....... So I think we\'ve all waited way too long it\'s time to step it up and come out with a greater Android version at least make it as good as the iOS version!!!!!?????',
       'People will tell you that it\'s good for your brain or that it\'s fun, but that really isn\'t true, especially since it won\'t even allow you to turn off hints. Immediately after you make a move, you can\'t even think for yourself and try it alone. It\'s annoying. Don\'t get it. Go to a different solitary game.',
       'PLEASE change where the 5 extra card for 2000 bucks is! I love this game but when you\'re short on money and you accidentally press it.... aaaaarggh. I\'m pretty sure others don\'t like where it is either. Could be a perfect game. And I spend hours a day on it as I\'m bedbound. Please...' ,

      'I used to play this game a long time ago with my brother. I thought since after all these years so many new updates have come, the game must feel different. But it\'s the same. I love the tune that plays as you play it. It\'s so nostalgic. My brother isn\'t anymore with me but playing this game makes me really very happy. It\'s just like I am back in those old days. Specially for me, as it has so many memories, this game is the absolute best.',
       'I have a problem with my account. My punk zombird was maxed out. Level 3. Then when I opened the game, my punk zombird was gone... I obtained that by waiting patiently and gathering 90 diamonds. I had to watch 3 15-30 sec long video for 2 diamonds each. After watching the 3 vids, I had to wait another 8 hours for it to be available again. It took me a month to obtain that bird and then all of a sudden it dissapears?! I obtained it again but I had to start all over again. I uninstalled this app because of that issue.',
       'The game is really addictive. but repeated zombie birds are generated and diamonds are getting wasted. Please change that. One bird one time please. One bird should be at max 3 level not another set. It\'s wasting my internet to watch video to get diamonds for collecting birds',
       'I personally loved this game. First off,  u cant jump for high periods of time cause u to run into the bombs. Secondly, whats sup with these prices? Thats ridiculous. You cant level up with prices that high and u have to buy üíé gems and coins just to get a level up... But tum... Very great game overall.',
       'I love this game cause it kills our time when were bored. Yep, we, my mom also is addicted to this game hahaha, shes always getting my phone and play this game whenever im sleeping. Love it, I recommend this game to everyoneüíñ you\'ll be definitely love this game. MobiGame you slaaaay hahaha',

      'Seems fun, but there is at least a 10 second ad every time you crash and it\'s really frustrating. I think Acid Cousins is really losing a lot of people to the excessive advertising present in this app even though the game itself has a lot of potential.',
       'Ads pop up during gameplay where your fingers contact so it stops game play ... other than that it\'s good but I\'ve had enough. Fk you chilly:-p uninstalling',
       'The game was awesome and I loved it. But the latest update ruined it with ADS. They put the banner exactly where you mostly tap with the fingers to change direction, the game got laggy which it was not before and has started getting way too many pop ups. Uninstalling. *Sigh*',
       'Don\'t waste your time. This is such an awesome game but all the ads make it not even close to worth playing. They put an ad in the bottom of the screen at all times. This is the most optimal spot to tap to control your little skier. Forces you to make your thumb further up and block part of your view. Plus full screen 30 second ads every third game.... When most games only last a few seconds, makes for a pretty bad experience. You almost hade hooked Google, way to drop the ball.',
       'It intercepts the back press event and doesn\'t allow to quit in the common way. It continuously places the advertisement banner on the bottom of the page and goes to immersive mode so you\'ll hit the ad instead of navigation bar while you are hopelessly trying to exit. Maybe the game itself is not bad but that disrespect overtakes all the pluses (if they are)',
       'It\'s a cool game but it has SOO  many ads. Please stop putting ads whenever we crash cause it gets annoying.' ,

      'A truly fun, interesting & free game. A good game for any age. If you need to do something relaxing, this is a good way. You\'ll get hooked!!! I\'m in the 500\'s & it\'s still fun! The ads only require 1 more touch on the screen than you have been doing. Well worth it.',
       'Great game, Love it! Very creative, fantastic graphics. Not so difficult or loss of life\'s to where you can\'t even play.  Yet still challenging.  Only negative is lots of ads. Would gladly pay nominal fee to get rid of them.',
       'I love playing games like this to relax, but on other similar games I can\'t stop myself from buying the stupid in app purchases all the time which makes me more stressed! This game is perfect because it\'s not so difficult that it\'s not fun and I don\'t have to worry about wasting my money on imaginary things!',
       'I really like this game but newer version I have updated to after 3 months and I see the Hooray Sound in the end and some more sounds in between has been changed to Ticking kind of sound.   I seriously and kindly request to the developer to restore those sounds which were there in old versions because I seriously loved it. I wish those sounds can come back which makes the game more amazing.   And ofcourse I still continue to play this and have hope for those sounds to be back.',
       'It\'s a cute game BUT there are way way too many ads compared to any other game, I understand that they have to make money and that ads are a must on free games but 3 and 4 ads  every round of play (5-7 seconds) is over kill, uninstalling now',
       'Great game. Gets harder as you progress but never impossible. One of the few match 3 games I\'ll stick with.  Update: Been playing a while now. I\'m at level 664 and I still really enjoy the game. Worth playing. Lots of fun and they don\'t rig it so you have to buy stuff to win!' ,

      'I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the "mine" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it\'s nicely done!',
       'I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.',
       'Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it\'s just my phone. Also I\'m not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)',
       'Overall the app is really great. It\'s the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you\'re not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.',
       'One of my favorite games ever!  I am glad to see it available for my phone!!!  However:  I do not like the constant switching between marking a flag and clearing a space, because I keep blowing up mines I am trying to mark, from being in the wrong mode.  A tutorial to explain the settings and the flag/clear switch would be nice.  Using a long press to flag a space and a tap to clear it would be even better.  I would like to be able to set the bomb number myself.',
       'While this certainly is minesweeper, there are some serious design flaws. First off, when you click the first cell the board does not seem to generate around that, meaning that 80% of games on medium you will loose randomly opening squares trying to get a start. Hard mode is literally unplayable, as the mines are so dense it turns into a guessing game. There are better minesweeper apps out there.' ,

      'It was fun while it lasted. I was a big fan of the first game and this one was an awesome improvement. Unfortunately my game crashed after months of playing and forced me to play the tutorial again. UPDATE: After reaching out to Pikpok customer service they reset my story progress and gifted me several leveled up weapons that help balance out what I lost. I appreciate their rapid response and look forward to playing more!',
       'After i reach chapter 4, suddenly all my weapons progress are gone,  then i contact the support team,  and they dont restore my previous weapons,  but they give me MORE than what i have before. üòÑ  I really happy with this,  and i really appreciate this.  You guys should try this game. This is AWESOME. Now it\'s time for me to kill more zombies üòé',
       'I give you guys a 5-star rating. The graphics are amazing. And the weapons are cool. The only thing. I wish we didn\'t have to have the stamina constraints. And it would be awesome if I was able to keep the extra ammo I find so I have it for future levels. And also its a pain in the ass to level up the guns all the damn time',
       'Excellent story line... Great graphics. I have been addicted to this past few years. Really wondered seeing changes after every update. I never put up my reviews for any app. The magic is, whatever I think about new implementation - it will be done by pikpok in the very next update...... Now I have completed 7th Chapter. No clue what to do next...?',
       'Excellent game. I am totally addicted to it. Developers can you please include a reload button. Also sometimes playing I hit a wall or fence and it becones impossible to move left or right. In that case moving a couple of steps backward coukd save us in the game. Please include these options for making the most out of it. Overall its an excellent game and I highlh recommend it.',

      'Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can\'t play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.',

      'Easy and Fun My son and I very much enjoy the game on my Samsung S3. I have tried to run it on his Trio Stealth G4 (which is a great buy for kids if anyone is looking) with Android 4.4.2. The games launches and runs fine right up until you hit race. Then it just crashes and closes. Please help!',
       'Fun for me and my 4yo soon! Love this game, and my kiddo is absolutely obsessed. I actually try to limit his time with games but he\'s really into the world of Chima now! Great thing is, he doesn\'t have to have amazing control to have fun and win, but it still gets challenging for us grown ups to get 3 stars.  Not sure what this latest update does, but the last one that added the Super Cup was brilliant!',
       'Looks fun but... 1st track when entering the building or arena (not sure what it is) the game just closes and goes strait to my home screen.  Cleared cache, uninstalled reinstalled, rebooted phone. Nothing is working, please help/fix.  Update: Fixed f/c 4 stars now',
       'Great for kids. This is a young kid\'s game, no more. It\'s nice to know that Lego\'s aware of its audience and doesn\'t add any in-app purchases for boosts or extra cash. The controls are big and simple. However, all races are just a variation of the same track and winning or 3 stars is no challenge: the first boss is completable without using a single boost. The game lasts only a few 3 hours, so consider the excessive ~70MB this game takes up.',
       'Thing need to be added First thins first where is the rhino tribe and more ravens and add the new tribes in season  2 like the scorpions spiders and bats and tigers and the fire bird and the Mammoth  and vulture  and polar bear',
       'THIS IS THE BEST GAME ON ANDROID I know in am 11 years old but I like it. It is not better than my dads game that he created and the game he created is called dead trigger its an amazing zombie game where our get to walk around killing zombies with shotguns machine guns and pistols get it it is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo√¥ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good' ,

      'It would be a real good app if they didn\'t have so many ads popping up. Budge needs to reevaluate this because it\'s not making my kid want more games...its making her hate this game. It\'s not an effective strategy...and no parent would download another budge game after seeing one ad a minute.',
       'It\'s a good game but I\'m telling you. There are way too many ads. 30 second ads without a skip ad button seriously I spend 80% trying to exit the ad then I do playing the game. I see that everyone else is complaining about the same thing. So Delete the ads Please. And please make all of the Ponies free. Some of the levels required a different pony but you have to buy them. Drag and drop is broken. Please fix it.',
       'Don\'t buy anything in the app cuz it doesn\'t sinc with other devices and when you complain NO ONE responds back! This app won\'t get another penny from me cuz you\'re a rip off! And if it wasn\'t for my granddaughter liking ponies, I\'d delete the app all together! Seriously crappy customers Service!!!',
       '"drag and drop the broken bits into the right place" game locks up and little 4 year old girl cries. Now I know why these games get hacked by little sisters older brother. People get pissed. Enjoy your money budge!',
       'My kid loved this game. She got really into it and was loving every moment, but then a part of the game wouldnt let her do anything. It was a boss scene on a pinkie pie level and a drop and drag boss on a rarity level. The game simply wont do anything and hence she cant get any farther. This is frustrating as i paid for all the stuff for it as she enjoyed it so much and its beginning to feel like i paid for my kid to be sad. Please fix!',
       'Let\'s talk about ads. I downloaded this for my kid. She would love it except for the fact that EVERY 30 SECONDS THERE IS AN AD! I realize that\'s how money is made, but that\'s ridiculous. One at the end of each level would be fine, but this 4-5 inside the level is overkill. And they play upside down. She spends more time trying to exit the ad than playing the game.' ,

      'One token per six hours? So you as a content provider only want me to experience three games a day? That is backwards... Do away with the tokens. You will have users clamoring to purchase the DLC if they can play nonstop. This means that you would have zero reason to charge for the premium game. Anyone who has already paid for the premium gets all future DLC for free and the rest of us would be willing to purchase it. This is a great game that could provide substantial income on well placed future DLC and franchise games.',
       'The algorithm used to determine rolls / battles is horrible.  After less than 200 games, I have lost over 20k troops, while destroying only 16k.  That amounts to nothing more than a piss poor design.  Unfortunately I paid for this app, so I am stuck with it.   Game definitely isnt worth the price paid.  Don\'t make the same mistake I made.',
       'This game is great but it could be so much better.   1. The expert AI is too easy to beat. Risk players normally gang up on an opponent, if they are dominating. There should be a legendary option.  2. It would be nice to have a match summary and timeline at the end of a game.    3. There should be an auto-save game feature when playing against the AI, in case the game drops out.  Edit: They seem to have addressed my third point.',
       'The game was fun i paid for the full game, but after losing game after game because an army of 30 lost to an army of 4 or 5. Or it glitches and my whole army becomes the enemies, or someone turns into a computer and goes in an all out assult i get very frustrated. Risk is fun but so many glitches. Poorly run app with very little work given to it.',
       'This is a very frustrating game. Every single time I play my turn (in a multi-player game that is) I get disconnected! .. and I\'ve to replay it again .. only to get disconnected again! and so on and so on till my time runs out. Sometimes in the middle of all this \'replaying\' I even lose my troops to other players .. VERY FRUSTRATING! And No .. I\'ve both a very good data and wifi connections.',
       'Was fine for a couple weeks.... Then it started freezing up in the middle of my games.... All of them. I\'m using a LG V30+ with 128g ram so it\'s definitely not a lack of storage issue.   I wouldn\'t recommend this app to anyone who likes uninterrupted gameplay.' ,

      'I love the game :) ,but can you add unlimited ammo and u can deliver any vehicle u own for free, if our only gonna do one of these, at least add u can deliver your vehicles for free any time. And oh yeah, add multiplayer where u can join someone the host decides whether the server is public or private. And that you can friend people with the Facebook thing. Thank you and keep on adding cool stuff! P.S. add that you can turn on and off friendly fire when host for when you add the multiplayer option and add weather like in the winter it snows and sometimes it rains. Sorry its long but please do all of these things to make the game even better!!!!!!!!',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Alot of things you can do, very fun and the missions are EPIC!  Although there are a few things gameloft needs to add/change: 1. Multiplayer 2. We can die and not spend money going to hospital 3. make graphics better 4. Go inside houses and shops  5. customize cars',
       'Awesome! The latest update rewards old and loyal players like me with the new trophy system, which gives us more than 1000 diamonds for what we\'ve achieved in the past few months. Removing the key system is another thing that we want to thank God of Games for. Keep up the good work. Will be supporting Gameloft in the future.',
       'This game is one of the BEST games i\'ve ever played in my whole life! The graphics,gameplay,story,cars,etc are all amazing! But i have one complain please give the original price of the cheap materials pack... But overall its the best Good Job Devs',
       'It\'s nice but mission fourth is very complicated as well as conjustedly tough. I would like this and would give full stars but my opinion is it should be more graphical, adjustable control,nicely gamed and less storagable. I hope that instead of ignoring the matter you should modify the game and improve it. This is my feedback and you should definitely do it please it\'s my applicapable request.',
       'In my opinion. This game is by far one of the best games I have played. Especially for a mobile device. My only problem is, diamonds. Diamonds are pretty hard to come by, especially if you are a free-to-play player, like me. The trophies can be a simple way to earn quite alot of diamonds but soon you complete them all, like me. So I think, to make the game better, is to try to find an easier way for free players to earn diamonds, something simple, but cannot be spammed by higher level players. Another thing is that levelling up does take alot of time and effort. I would hope that you could try to make it easier to level up In This game as the main story can be very difficult to keep up with as you are about 4 levels behind, you lose track of what\'s happened. So again, try to make it a little easier to level up and a little easier to earn diamonds. Other than that, great game ;)' ,

      'For what this app is, its full of adds. There are adds when you are playing at the bottom. Then every two or three selections ypu are blasted with 15 to 30s unskippable adds. Often loud vidoes wasting data. I do not recomend you download this blatant addware app. Its fun and novelty quickly gets replaced with advertisement. And you become a monkey watching adds rather than participating a very simple game of would you rather.',
       'It\'s good but you need to add more detail not just plain questions add like voice chat to a person will say would you rather to me. It\'s like good but you need to add more stuff to enjoy and it\'s also boring..',
       'I can\'t believe anyone can think this is playable with this many ads. A simple text based question game with more ads than gameplay. Pathetic. I can\'t believe how much this upset me',

       'Good game.  Too bad there are no comments like on computer.',

      'I wish I could give this game 10 stars. It\'s amazing all around.  It\'s adorable and fun. The graphics are amazing too without any glitches so far. Haven\'t noticed any bugs either. The developer\'s done amazing. It does get repetitive after a while but so far by the time it happens something new unlocks so it\'s still fun. Can\'t wait to see what else you guys do to improve the game play since everything else has been flawless so far. Great job, keep up the great work!',
       'This game is super cute! I love my lil ninja friend! Lol. Nice story, and plenty to do to keep you busy. Will def take time to master, but it def has the potential to keep you interested in playing. Even got my wife playing it, and she usually only keeps games for a day or 2, cuz she gets bored with them. I think she\'ll play this one a little longer than most of the other games she\'s tried. I\'m really happy i found this game!!',
       'This one is probably my favourite, with minecraft and clash of clans. If you don\'t have this Virtual Friend game, then it is you who is missing out. Install and enjoy. There\'s nothing bad about this game, and if Naturalmotion do want me to suggest an add-on, then maybe enable me to link the game with a new device. I was LVL 52 once but I lost it. Now I\'m level 17. Hope you liked the suggestion. :)',
       'I love this game, it\'s simple and sweet. However, there was a middle row in the item-picking menu in which I had invested many coins into to help me level up faster. Today, when I logged in, the row simply disappeared without a trace. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the backgrounding of my app, but nothing seemed to fix it. Now I only have the Training row and the Fun stuff row. It took me quite a while to get those coins and I\'d really appreciate it if you brought the row back or gave me a solution to get it back. If it helps, you should also know that the \'I\' on every icon which used to let you see how an item was used has also vanished. Please fix this, thank you.',
       'This is a great game that I\'ve played off and on over the years. I just redownloaded it, and it\'d still fun to play. My only gripe is that there\'s no place to save your progress. Cloud, Facebook, etc. I hate having to start from level 1 every time I have to wipe/switch phones. Even an account that saves your data would be great. Fix this and it\'ll be 5 stars all the way for me.',
       'I would have given it 5 stars because it\'s really fun, relaxing and addictive  except after reaching level 50 the game started to force close upon trying to open for over 2 weeks so I uninstalled it since customer/tech support was 0 help.  All I got was an automated message with general troubleshooting tips I had already tried. With no way to save progress sadly I have to say bye to you Clumsy. It was fun while it lasted.' ,

      'For anyone saying it doesn\'t make sense - this is a logic puzzle game. You use the hints to eliminate numbers and get as close as you can to the solution. Sometimes it won\'t narrow down 100% and you might have to be lucky, but that\'s why you have multiple attempts each turn until you get a high solve streak. This game is a good time passer and workout for the brain.',
       'Someone reviewed saying that if you have multiple solutions, you\'re doing it wrong. That\'s incorrect. You absolutely can have multiple solutions that fit all given hints, but the game will only accept one. At that point, it\'s no longer a puzzle game, but a luck-based guessing game. Put in one of the multiple solutions and hope it\'s the one.',
       'Good time waster but once you worked out the pattern it gets too easy',
       'It\'s too confusing, honestly.',
       'It didn\'t make sense at all.',

      'Awesome World,s greatest game ever. Super fast to play and on this phone it has no ads. So I don,t know what the rest of you are talking about you should increase your ratings to five stars. And oh yah they have already made all of the                gameshakers game they are on your computer if you go to Google chrome and then type Nickelodeon.

      'REMOVE TANKS AND ARMOURED SUVS   The game is amazing. All the guns are balanced but there is one big problem... It\'s the TANKS and the SUVS   or make it a banable offence because all people do is camp in the last circle with a tank or a suv. Please fix this and I will rate 5 stars. And I know this is meant to be a minecraft version of pubg but pubg never had tanks or armoured suvs so please fix it. And is it just me but some of the players feel like bots. üòÇ',
       'Problem I have is that it promotes multiplayer use, but you cannot tell who is an actual player or an AI, there is no chat system like it says, and half of anything it talks about is unavailable in the game. The concept itself is great, the game itself is a great time waster, but I have to call it out on its false advertisement.   Now, if I may have been mistaken, someone please correct me, but so far as I can see there is nothing in the game that suggests multiplayer capabilities.',
       'This game is actually mentally retarded. The only good thing I can say is that at least it runs at 60fps. The controls are not always there, for example, in the waiting match, I cannot jump, because the button disappeared.

      'The sound effects barely play, there\'s no mucic, and the adds rarely complete enough to give any boosters.  The controls are pretty smooth and the graphics look good for a mobile game, but I\'m running this on a Note 4 and it\'s barely playable.  Please fix your stuff if you care enough about your customers to keep them playing your game.',
       'I used to love the old version a while later deleted it and haven\'t played this game for a few years now i\'m back and i t is totally different the races are pretty much the same but everything else is diffrent. Could you guys make a version just like the old one and call it angrybirds go orignal or something just please bring back the original',

       'Impressed. But the videos  work once in a blue moon. The karts of Stunt area are the ones that skid the most. Still, it is good. It has much more reasons to like it than to dislike it. And I have a full confidence that you will work on the things not proper.... Kindly do reply.',
       'Do not download this game unless you want it to do random brief stopd while you are playing and sometimes even taking you out of the game!

      'It was undoubtedly one of a kind and perfect game at the time of it\'s release. Everything from balancing to controls and gameplay was perfect. Until.....until developers thought of this "awesome" idea of putting it on steam and allowing PC community to play it. The game that was originally designed for mobile users now overwhelmed with PC users. I mean how devs thought that\'s a good idea to compare PC to mobile??? PC players are right now literally annihilating every mobile gamer. We have no chance against them they\'re better in everything from controls to aiming shooting. Once beloved game now lays in ruins conquered by PC community.',
       'I would like to have the game on my phone that way i can spend money on the game instead of on tablet as it is more comfortable. The game costs over 3gb! My phone has that but with all the apps that come with the phone that you cannot remove. I have only over 1gb. Sorry wargaming the game costs too much data. Once that is fixed ill change rating given and review. I would play the game if it costed one gigabyte.',
       'This game is great in my opinion. Once you understand how everything works and the techniques while playing, winning becomes more common. My only little complaint is that since the last update i dont always recieve my 10 pieces of gold. Ill watch the 5 ads a day but only recieve 30 or 40 gold total. It would be nice if we got paid the 10 gold after every ad like how it used to be. Not everyone has the money or is willing to spend the money on gold. It would be great if this could get fixed. Thanks',
       'This game has great graphics, great controls, great features. Why only 3 stars then? It seems to be so heavily rigged and winning is almost never. With premium account you will advance quicker but i don\'t believe i am alone with my opinion that you will quit this game frustration winning. Since writing and thinking 3 was fair i have now reduced to a 1 as the email sent to the developing team bounced because their mail box is full. Wonder why!',
       'This game is completely pay to win and has a life supply of broken tanks that you need to buy and it\'s still 1s and 0s in the end. I also hate the fact it lacks modern tanks. Can they at least do a survey to see what the players want? Don\'t play this game it full with a bunch of idoits.',
       'Before update it was easy to play on 100 to 150 ping. It was smooth. But after 4.6 ... It cant be smooth like before. It lags alot...and cant defend myself properly. Barely i cant shot someone with laggy gameplay because of ping. My normal ping is just b/w 100 to 180 ....and i cant get lesser than this. Plz do smthing. #wargaming' ,

      'Not good enough It could get more better. It actually failed to fulfill the expectations! Not really very fun to play as was written in the description. The game could include a shop to buy things such as powerups or different colours and styles of jetski and some more creative adventures could get the game into a very interesting zone!',
       'Very fun, I love it In this game you can choose your players, Tom or Angela. Then you can ride and you try to get as far as you can throughout the obstacles and challenges. You also try to collect stars along the way. However many stars you collect determines your score. This app will keep your scores and will let you know if you get a high score. When you run into something you have the option to keep going if you watch an advertisement. This app is not boring at all. It works great and doesn\'t take up much space.',

      'This should be labeled as a demo. Subscription is a bad idea, and "lifetime" price is far too high. It looks nice, but that doesn\'t make up for the lack of content. A way to earn unlock points, even if slowly, would probably encourage more players to stay. The actual game is all right, but the rest makes it not worth it.  By the way, the image on the app store of a cat puzzle shows hints that don\'t at all match up with the apparent solution.',
       'I love this game! It is so addictive. A great mix of process of elimination and logic. There is a bit of a glitch sometimes when you press the button to watch a video for a free hint, the screen sometimes goes black and you have to completely shut down the game which means you have to use more energy to go back into the paused level. It would be good if you only had to use your energy lightning bolts one time only.',
       'Fun little game. I\'d love to do more puzzles than energy allows, but despite how cute this is, it isn\'t a $5 a month game. Sub too expensive. Pay once option is nice, but about $25 too much for this game.',
       'This one doesn\'t tell you when your wrong, also doesn\'t black out number sequences you have already completed in a row. Frustrating.',
       'I really enjoy playing this game but there is a slight glitch!! Some of the times when I opn the game it is nothing but black screen and if my tablet gets turned, it also becomes a black screen. I have to close down the game.',
       'Alright. I have played this app a long time and I have completed all the free levels. It is obviously a good game. I play it every day for the daily levels. But WHY does the game cost 5 bucks a month... Or 30$ CAD! hello? Who is in charge of marketing? This game is worth 3-5$ at most. The fact that it costs this much means that someone is buying it, this worries me. This game subsists off of kids spending their parents money. Too bad.' ,

      'Love the concept, but it doesn\'t work at ALL. I downloaded it, and no matter what I do, nor how absolutely silent it is, the chicken is running and jumping and I have zero control over it. Super disappointed--hopefully it\'s just glitching?? I wanted to try it, but neither sound nor silence give me any control over it üò£',
       'Ads are frequent and long. The audio sensitivity is difficult to judge. There is no mute button for the game\'s audio and the sounds interfere with the movements. When I jump, he lands and jumps a second time from the sound of the landing or a coin. Have to turn the media on my phone all the way down to fix it.  Add game sound settings or make the music and movements not register for the chicken. Shorten the ads. And maybe change the visuals to be a little less "flappy bird"-like.',
       'People complain about the ads but 2 dollars is all you need to remove them. Cheap and it supports this fun game. If your game audio is interrupting the jumping then plug in some ear buds, it\'s that easy people!',
       'It\'s a great game, hilarious concept, only thing I have issues with is that the noises for picking up the coins pick up as sound. Frustrating when you are trying to be careful and it dings and sends the chicken into a mine... Maybe make them doubtless so they don\'t get picked up by mic.',
       'Good game but enough with the ads. Way too many and way too long. The ads are longer than the game play. Ine ad was over 30 seconds long. You guys obviously do not read these comments or reply to any of them. This could be a great game.',
       'Way too many adds. The adds block the sensitivity, so I cant adjust that, so I have to scream as hard I can for a jump. Then a 30 sec minimum add almost every retry. No thanks. Could be entertaining though' ,

      'I was very surprised  at the diversity of things you can do. And you can speed up EVERYTHING MANUALLY. Ads are optional with selective rewards of either money or one of the three materials you use to build stuff with. The exclusive currency can be bought with irl money or exchanged for materials or in-game cash. Not like any tap game I\'ve ever played, I\'m very impressed! This is a keeper!',
       'This is the best tap games out there. It really loves up to its word saying to timers, unlike SimCity and just about every other game out there. Its easy to play and advance so it sets a wide age range. I would like to personally thank the devs for coming out with this game, something a was looking for for a while. 10/10. Keep up the good work!',
       'Absolutely excellent! I love the freedom of building whatever you like within reason. One thing that could improve it, and it might just be me thinking this, is that the buildings look different as you level them up. I do know that they look different at level 5, but at other levels it would be great, so you remember what level a building is. The idea that each building looks different, regardless of the type of building is still awesome, because it adds a slight feeling of difference and uniqueness. For example, I have come across at least 3 types of apartment and office, so my city/town doesn\'t all look the same. Keep up the good work! üëç',
       'I adore this game, it\'s such a time waster (in a good way)! I wish that the camera controls were compatible with wireless mice. only reason being is because I broke my screen and I can\'t use too much touch screen. :( apart fro',
       'Absolutely love this game, its customisable and you make your city however you want to. One thing I eould like to see is alternative buildings, like instead of a power plant, a hydro plant. Also plz add buildings that can go in the ocean like bridges. Overall love it',
       'It is true that there is no timer but instead your energy runs out very fast! At the end it takes too much time to build a real city!  Also has nothing innovative comparing to other games.' ,

      'The controls are simple.. it comes down to timing and playing it multiple times to get the most out of the combination of timing and luck. I haven\'t figured out yet how to score super well, but it is fine. I kind of wish there was more to it control wise, as right now it seems like just a matter of well timing and random luck',
       'This game is very buggy. I wouldn\'t pay for this. Your reward is 50nstsrs after completing the continental cup, yet you get 30. Then I went out do the game and went back in to see if it somehow didn\'t add, but instead I was left with 0 stars. Also the screen blacks out a lot.',
       'Integration with the adds glitches the gameplay.  It freezes quite frequently. If this gets fixed it will be more fun and interesting. If it would work without glitches and adds in between jumps it would be awesome. Try putting adds before each competition instead of in the middle. I am updating my review. It sucks! !!! I just  finished the season and everything I earned and bought just disappeared. UNINSTALL! !!!',
       'This could be so much better. When you\'ve completed a season...you then lose everything for a second season. I stayed on the season to improve scores and buy better equipment..but although my scores were improving my positions were getting worse and worse which doesn\'t make sense. Even when you hit the hill record but still come 8th....what?!?!',
       'Great looking  game, spoiled by the controls..  Tap to start the jump=OK, Tap to take off=OK, Tap to land=Too hard.. As a casual gamer you really need to either practice, practice, practice!!.. Or.. Have the landing reflexes of a Ninja!!  If for the casual gamer landing was a tad more user friendly it would definitely be 5*..  Not a game to send hours & hours on, but certainly a good time waster for a journey.. Give it a try & give Team GB a World Champion Ski Jumper!! (& the less said about Eddie "The Eagle" Edwards the better..)',
       'It\'s a great game so mental and challengeing I no it will keep you amused for a long time the controls are very sensitive so practice as much as you can before you decide to try out the career mode play happy it\'s funtastic' ,

      'This game is fun and entertaining and time will pass by you playing this. The only downfall is you only get so many chests locations on main screen and take hrs to open them up. So you have to decide if you want to play or wait the hrs. You can free up those chests by using your gold that you have but if you run out then you have to buy more with real money.',
       'Would be nice if I could actually get a club that can get a hole in one on a par 3. I\'m pretty sure nearly all par 3 mini golf courses we play in life make it possible for an ace. A little disappointed this game doesn\'t give the chance',
       'I was really skeptical about the quality of this, all other mini golf games I\'ve played have sucked honestly. But wait - this is actually a good game! Kind of rips Golf Clash off a touch design wise but who isn\'t copying everyone these days? Remember the Flappy Bird fiasco and the 500,000 clones still on the play store? Yeah, not going to complain about this game lol.',
       'Was 5 star game! But losing connection is a joke! My connection is excellent! 2 xbox 2 PlayStations play multiplayer online all at the same time! Yet this game loses connection as I\'m about to win! Yeah right! Nice try fkrs',
       'Don\'t want to play a long drawn out golf game? Then this puttputt  might just be for you.and there are plenty of twists and turns to make it a challenge. Need I say more!?',
       'Why do I always get paired to play against people with 300+ more trophies that my self. They always have far better clubs and I am always unable to keep up.' ,

      'First download crashed and wouldn\'t load. Had to reinstall the game and Hutch games couldn\'t recover my profile so had to start again from scratch. I\'ve played through several updates and fixes but the same issues remain, car X beats car y when it shouldnt. Hutch in game support agree there is a problem and send to devs but nothing gets fixed. The whole game seems flawed. To be competitive to you will have to spend about ¬£50 a month. I enjoy the premise but the game is poorly executed.',
       'Game is great. And like every game had it\'s pro\'s and con\'s. To sum this game up in short it is Top Trumps with the race.   Pros: game is different to all the rest out there, car list is really well thought out as well.  Cons the only things I have to say is, it\'s so hard to win decent cars sometimes. Seems quite a pay to win game as card packs are alot of money/gold and you don\'t win alot of money either.   One thing to bare in mind is that once you\'ve completed a level you can go back and claim all the cards from that event giving you more money, cars and rq.',
       'Multiplayer is not fair. Have the same car with lower 0-60 time better traction, and higher mph but still lose. Match play is getting worse. I either have to spend a boatload of money or always come in last place.',
       'Fun game that I do still enjoy... BUT more/different content needs to be added as far as events and practice races.  Also I have been VERY dissapointed with the support team,  and just learned they offer special deals to lower tier players that I van not access? SHADY! So it is too bad but I wont be spending more money on this one until I see any improvements.',
       'Graphics and cars are great but the complements end there. I have no idea what the point of this game is it\'s not a racing game though. You just collect card with cars on them. It\'s a shame i wish i could race the cars.',
       'I love the concept and it\'s been great to see how far this game has come, but I\'ve been playing since beta and nearly every update wipes my save data and forces me to restart. Luckily, I don\'t get too far into the game each time, but it is frustrating and enough of a buzz kill for me to drop two stars. If there was a cloud system implemented for saves this game would be a five star in my book' ,

There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn\'t have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it\'s Definitely Not a game you\'d wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!',
       'Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)',
       'Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout',

       'Guys let me tell u how to crack every level if u sit down in the game i mn the shooter sits on the knees it can reach every enemy without being discovered coz u can get close to them as much as u want and will not be able to ahoot the player once also. Ur lifebank will be full. Also developers should update the game due to above lacking..üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ',
       'FUN its super fun and active although when your done everytime an ad pops out then ask you "rate this app 5 stars will help" and im not gonna lie it is verry anoying but other than that this app is just fine!' ,

      'I was really enjoying the game, it\'s fun. Don\'t get me wrong. But I\'ve signed in every day, every single day and I make sure I do, and sometimes I do it from my iPad and sometimes I do it from my phone. And sometimes it lags and says I missed a day before it fixes. But today I signed in and it told me I missed a day. So I tried it on my phone and it still said I missed a day so I had to restart from the first day in the current collection item. I\'m very frustrated and upset by this. So this whole \'signing on from a different device\' thing is glitchy af and my game got messed up because of it. Very upsetting. Otherwise it would be a 5star.',
       'This game is amazing! Most games of this style sacrifice story for the sake of puzzles, or vice versa, but this is a perfect balance and blend of both. I was hooked from the first moment, and the briliant and individual characters and challenging - but not impossible - puzzles have kept me eagerly impatient to play more. (My only complaint is that the energy refill feels SO SLOW when all I want to do is play more!)',
       'I\'d prefer being able to search when I want to, and am disappointed that games like this must put limits like "energy" into their gameplay. However, the scenes are progressively more challenging so as to keep your attention, with good graphics and interesting storyline.',
       'I\'d give 5 stars for everything if the new update would work. It continues to crash. I love this game and wish I could play. I\'m also loosing 2 days of a boost item b/c I can\'t play ANY level.',
       'Love the game but miss not been able to get coins or energy with the new upgrade (like you could with the snowmen). Also when the games get tougher, a little extra time added when you add more things to find would be nice too.',
       'Thoroughly annoyed now. Another update, another problem. If this could be sorted then it would be worth recommending but once again it\'s glitching so I can\'t play it. Says it\'s awaiting downloads but won\'t do it.' ,

       'It sucks and it is super glitchy i do not recommend to anyone as it can let the other players win i am a pro player at games and i know what i am doing it is just a time waster played it for more than afour months and hoping to have some updates , by the way there are no more updates this game is fully developed .',

      'Amazing game, great time-killer. I discovered a game breaker: if you go into the settings after you die, the number of coins you got in that level, the number in the brackets becomes equal to the total number of coins. Keep going back and forth into the settings, and the game will eventually ask if you want to triple the coins by watching a video. Instead of tripling the number of coins you got in that level, the number of total coins you have gets tripled.  Instantly triple your wallet every run.  I want the devs to see this and see if they can patch it because I really like this game and I want the coins I earn to be legit.  Thanks for your time, Mike C.',
       'It has a progression system, but it\'s completely worthless. The only reason to try to win belts is to get weapons that serve no purpose. You can win most of them by paying 200 coins and getting a random one, but you can, for some odd reason, get duplicates. Not to mention the fact that coin combos actually do nothing, not even useless cosmetic items, nothing. I think adding function to the weapons (e.g. Making long swords slightly longer range or making small weapons quicker) could add more depth and more of a reason to play the game. Overall: It\'s a good timekiller.',
       'Great game. Best for killing time. Great concept. Need to add a  counter for counting the number of people killed, otherwise awesome. Also there is not much incentive to play to win belts. Make playing with boss again free. Add new opponents (not bosses but the minions) . Make the game a little less challenging. Also remove the brief stun completely',
       'Really fun game. Nice graphics and simple controls. More depth to combat system would be nice. There is no point in achieving coin combos. It does not affect the amount of coins won. Add a multiplier for coin combos, as well as a score multiplier for chaining combos together without missing enemies or coins. Don\'t allow duplicate items to be won. Very annoying to grind and grind for coins, only to get a duplicate you can\'t do anything with. Lastly, an option to pay to disable ads would be nice.',
       'First of all its a simple game all u have to do is tap left or right to kill people closing in on u.. No proper tutorial or hints on how to win each stage, weapons are awesome but u\'ll start to feel bored after sometime.. No way to skip the story line, worst game... But can definitely be improved if included more buttons n skills other than this left or right tap',
       'The game mechanics are exactly the same as many games out there ... so what\'s different ? There\'s a progression system, problem with that is there is no incentive to progress. Purple belt requirements include a certain amount of twohanded sword kills. Everyday for the last 2 weeks I\'ve purchased items, not 1 is what I need ... broken' ,

      'HACKER infested.  The world of Online Gaming is finished.  Useless.  Pointless.  Every online game, including this one, is filled with hackers.  People are scumbag imbeciles.  No integrity, honor, desire to challenge oneself,  etc.  4 games, back-to-back, perfect dead-center bullseyes, by 4 different people, at the last split-second of their shots.  First time was shocking,  the second I thought odd, the third, very strange and by the fourth it was obvious - there must be a hack for this game.  And 4 back-to-back losers must have used it.  It\'s pretty much the same, anymore, with all online gaming and this game is no different.   Online Gaming is now a complete farce & a waste of time.  Same exact shots, in the same exact way by 4 different scumbags.  The game is pointless because of it.  And the game is a money hog with the number and frequency of adds.  FIX THE HACKING PROBLEM!!!!!',
       'Loving it so far. The time allowed to take aim and shoot is indeed a real challenge. Sometimes makes it frustrating but that\'s what makes this game more challenging and equally interesting I suppose. Could have provided a few more guns and upgrades for us to purchase.',
       'The game is fun and easy to learn, but very hard to get other weapons.  Crates are At least 50,000 and I haven\'t got a new weapon yet',
       'Passes the time, controls OK when you get used to them. You need plenty of nerve and a steady hand.',
       'It\'s hard to aim plus it don\'t give you enough time to shoot it has a add u have to watch every time u want to practice shoot but it\'s still a decent game it could be better if all that I said would be changed in this game. I recommend to try for your own review this is just what I thought about there are alot worse games and this one.',
       'After level 14 there\'s hardly any chance if you\'re not spending buttloads of money these guys are unbeatable and I hit 10+ almost every shot I loved the game but sometimes just impossible to win' ,

      'This is a very addictive enjoyable game. You can learn new moves, create the looks of your character and get some wonderful backup dancers to impress the judges and much more! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that lots of things are locked and when I payed, they were unlocked for a while then locked again. Please fix.',
       'Ughhh Its really ok ...but the Ads omg...i wanted to throw up...i checked out  all the other coco games  and figured out this.. you people are giving us the same avatar!!!!!. Can u beleive that ! And after u get one dress for free after watching that stupid 20 sec. Video u people lock all the othet things.. this game is really nice and i loved the graphics but u could do somethingfor ALL of those LOCKED ITEMS ...AND UNLOCK THEM FOR US!!!!!!!',
       'The picture of the dance moves do not correlate with the action. There is no fluidity with the moves. I think there should be a partner. To the eyes are still messing up when putting on the makeup.',
       'One time I just played dance clash 2 months ago. But now I decided that I had to uninstall the app because I am dine playing this game. But now I decided that pretty ballerina what better than dance clash. Also gymnastics superstar was good. But I can\'t do all of those moves just like a real gymnast. That\'s all I have to say',
       'Hey coco! I just have one problem with the game.  1.Everytime it loads the loading screen, it freezes and i have to exit the game again and i dont get my results. I dont know if its my phone or your game! Either way, Do you mind fixing it?  Thanks  Love,JGüíúüíô‚ù§üíúüíô‚ù§üíú',

      'I lost my work on one of my hardest paintings and my removed ads too all because of THE FREE COINS. I accidentally pressed the button and then another one appeared after that. After I closed the next ad I knew everything I did to that painting was gone. The removed ads, the colors. AT LEAST LIKE, MOVE THE FREE COINS. I just quit this game because I know this will always happen to me every time. üò®üò§üôÄüòæ',
       'Controls are more difficult than others like this. It should not erase numbers you have already colored. You should be able to move the screen without coloring where you move the screen. Plus you can\'t color diagonally. Fix these problems and it would be better.',
       'I think its a great app and that you shoulf get it. But there is one thing that needs working on. Which is how much coins you have to use to unlock things. I also likr how they gave me alot of coins to start with which made it easyer for me to start.',
       'Can be kinda fun, but the pixel art is pretty bad in a lot of ways. Like, color palettes with weird contrast and too many similar colors, inconsistent line widths that look like they drew the piece too small and scaled it up without paying attention, or like they just converted art drawn in another style to pixel art without fixing anything. Actually a lot of this would be explained if the app makers just put a pixel filter over traditional art pieces or digital paintings. Shows a lot of disrespect for this art form that you made your whole app about.',
       'I HATE IT like what the flip why wold you put ads where the cullers are I can\'t select the thing with out going to  a website for sumthing  so I HATE IT Liam cardinal',
       'Cuz it had barely any good pictures available and I don\'t want to pay for something that I\'m not even gonna use mist of the day cuz ill be in school' ,

      'Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven\'t gotten very far yet. Thing I DON\'T like is you don\'t get an average..... IF you do, I\'ve yet to find where it is in the game. That\'s in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! üòâüíØ',
       'Quick fire is the best but theres only one down fall, the seconds. When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. üëçüëçüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..',
       'It\'s a  fun game but it\'s rigged. I think if you have a billion chips you shouldn\'t be able to play on lower lanes. I thought you were supposed to be matched up with people who are the same or close level. How is it I\'m bowling against someone who is level 171 and 8 billion chips and  I\'m level 43 .',
       'I have been playing for months and spent a fair bit of money on this app and also was enjoying playing until all of a sudden all the graphics went pink and now i cant play. Not happy!!! How do i fix it? Don\'t want to delete it really as i will loose all my chips and special balls. Someone help please !?!?',
       'Amazing.  It\'s just fun watching the bowling hall whizz by and get a strike.  I\'ve played and uninstalled this game, but the only reason for the uninstall part is storage.  For all of you who are new, try getting the ball between the front pin and either of the pins next to it, it usually gets strikes, but by strikes I mean doubles against level 7 Russians.',
       'I enjoyed this game for over a month and though I\'ve written to miniclip about the issues of a pink blanked out bowling ball and lane, they have not responded.  Ridiculously so, I used to play this game for a couple hours almost every day. I can\'t believe a game so fun that I would play with my friend and family became such a waste.  Fix the problems and the rigging of the game please!' ,

      'Best curling game I\'ve seen Enjoy the graphics, controls, love the 1 on 1 against international players and career game options. Seems consistent and easy to learn. Needs a few tweaks like... throws that don\'t make hog line or touch hogline must be taken out of play. Have seen the bug that others reported, sometimes rock after thrown disappears , some kind of glitch that happens occasionally.  Sometimes the sweepers don\'t react to my movement to sweep. Would love to see 8 stones instead of 6. If you love curling, this should satisfy',
       'Great game except for hackers. There is a hack that allows some to bump or change finish of a throw. Yoy can go from having 2 scoring to opponent having the score, changing after the rocks stopped. Developers have not replied ti report. Fine for some fun but don\'t waste your money in upgrades',
       'Very fun game. Multiplayer is awsome! Please add private matches so i can play with friends.   Physics still need work to hold up to real world standard. Rocks dont follow thru on take outs in real life as they do in this game. Also (rules), a rock needs to make it all the way over the hogline in order to stay in play.  Thank you for making this game!',
       'Nice game Not true curling but closer then any game I have played so far and it\'s still fun.  There seems to be a glich where stones jump to a different position after the throw, but doesn\'t happen often.  There is no hog line violation and it\'s difficult to promote so most games end up being a culster f in the 4ft.  Once you realize it\'s a game and not real curling your addicted.',
       'Full of cheaters Started to play and it was awesome. But it seems that some people created cheats and make your pins move from their places without even theirs touching them so that they win points. I will not play it until its updated and try again. Too bad.',
       'Not bad for free. Minimal ads. The two drawbacks are that in career mode, the game is slanted in the opponents favour too much. And in 1 on 1, it takes forever to load an opponent. Fix that and I would give it a five star rating. Also, it would be nice to see the developer actually respond to some people\'s concerns.' ,

      'Add compatibility with the Disney Party Just Dance games and then this\'ll be good. It works exactly the same as the non-Disney so supporting these games couldn\'t possibly be that difficult. Edit: now the app will not give me the choice of what system I\'m playing on. It\'s stuck on ps4 and I don\'t even have one nor have I ever set up the app that way. I play this game on xbox one.',
       'READ REVIEWS BEFORE INSTALLING! Just downloaded because I haven\'t played in awhile. It wouldn\'t read any of my movements. I had my husband  install it on his phone to see if it would work and it kept disconnecting right before song. Please fix.',
       'Well I\'m very upset as you can see!! I wasn\'t even able to play. I\'ve tried from a kindle tablet to see the screen from it which only has an Amazon store so it wasn\'t there. Then I tried from another tablet with a regular Google play store which the game wasn\'t even on there when I searched it up only this came up. This could be better. Please do something about this like have it available in all play stores. I spent nearly an hour trying to figure this out plus I have no computer. Please just fix this, I\'m very unsatisfied, this wasn\'t pleasant.',
       'I used to love playing just dance, now I hate this stupid game and regret buying it and the Xbox one. Horrible. Can\'t even get the wire to connect a kinect to it so this is useless. This game is the only reason I even bought a console. Seriously wish I could get my money back!',
       'Update-It started disconnecting a lot.  Now I can\'t connect at all making this a $60 waste of disk space.  Please fix!!! Very buggy.  Only app that despite being on same network reqquires I reboot the pjone each time to play.   Can\'t just work.',
       'Ever since I got this game we had no problems playing with the android phones as controllers and now since last week the game keeps disconnecting both phones no matter how many times we reset. So sad as wanted to own this game for so long only to have to deal with these problems now! üò¢üò¢' ,

Please fix for a 5 star.....if not I\'ll change to a 1 star and uninstal. Thanks  They never fixed it. Don\'t bother if you want a game you can complete! Last five levels will not load. So hurting!

      'Best horror game series in all eternity Super fun. Creepy too. Its really challenging because when toy bonnie moves, I cant find him on any camera after he moves from cam 3, so I put on my mask the whole time and then Puppetmaster gets 2 me. Hard and scary! I\'d give it 6 stars if I could!',
       'Sucks. Ok,so I installed it,started it,and it kicked me off! pls make a new update so where it won\'t glitch and kick people off the game that\'s how u lose people and ur game becomes a lost cause. ..anyway,pls fix and I\'ll give five stars.(btw I can\'t even last through the phone call without getting kicked out of the game.)üò°üò≥üò°',
       'Very spooooooooky Great this game is great but you should really try doing an update about the purple guy cause it makes no sense that in SL at the end some one stares at a mirror and purple eyes cone out and the purple guy is the only one in the game who is purple! I don\'t know if that makes sense plus the mini games don\'t match because purple guys death was I n fnaf 3 so who is that person in the mirror? I know I mite be Mike or William Afton William Afton is the purple guy but Mike would make more sense cause  the scooper',
       'So scary. Good game. Look this game will scare you until you pee on yourself aka if your 11 and under like me should play if your not scared but,this game is good. I give it 5 stars no doubt. Lol but hurry up and come out with part 3 already plz!üòÄüòÄüòÄ F.Y.I always wind up the music box',
       'Advice to get u passed N1 in DEMO and real version 1. NEVER turn ur flashlight on in Cam 9. 2. Dont go crazy with ur flashlight battery 3. When u see Freddy wait 10 - 12 secs and THEN flick ur flashlight 4. Bonny and Chica don\'t do anything to u 5. Bonny goes to only 2 cams 6. Chika stays at the Main Hall 7. Freddy wont come out if u stay in Show Stage 8. If Freddy comes out and the music box needs winding do it quick *no rush tho 9. 6 A.M. will come soon 10. Night 5 will as well come soon',
       'Best Game Ever! I love this game because the animated animatronics like toy Bonnie he trys his best to hug you. Example: mum is that you? Mum I love you!  The chicken is so weird she has a beak on the stage but when she is at cam 7 in the hallway she has no beak, why is that? Toy Freddie is quite scary but he kind of looks like a stuffed teddy bear instead of an animatronic. Well I love this game thanks for the game Scott Cawthon!' ,

      'The algorithm of the AI mode of the worms is somehow amazing. It seems like a game which is not really amusing your eyes but actually has a good algorithm and programming instead. Rather than the usual games that we play, i recommend you to play this and figure out the algorithm. It maybe easy but sounds exciting if you can find it out',
       'How does one finish speedrunner 1? I tried purchasing a few upgrades as possible. I purchased 2 money upgrades for Jofu, a speed and money upgrade for Cula and Byldo and the 2 fruit teirs. I can\'t obtain Ony before 11 minutes. Maybe one should set the objective as unlock Byldo in 5 minutes instead.',
       'Oh man, this has held my attention almost as long as cookie clicker. It has plenty of extra stuff to keep the gsme fresh, like the challenge mode or golden fruit achievements. Really looking forward to any other additions the developers are planning. Especislly the animated worms, the movement is so smooth.',
       'Cool game, my only complaint is the camera. I would like a more birds eye view of the game. To me it seems like its a slight sideview of the game, making it hard for me to guess when it will end the game by eating its tail',
       'Great little snake idle game! Only downside is the gui does not scale with the screen. Makes text really hard to read. Ithwr then that, snakes on a farm, play old style snake eat game by choosing your farm. Your oqn upgrades up the difficulty. And each farm can have an ai that can auto control the eating process.',
       'I love how it\'s different when compared to other clicker games, but I feel like it progresses too slow. I wait a whole day just to get almost enough progress to gain 1% increase from stage reached or achievements making worms sell for higher? That\'s too slow, I\'m starting to lose interest already. Also, no Google play achievements makes it worse.' ,

      '-Achievements for golden fruits can now be obtained, even if the golden fruit Upgrade has been purchased',
       '-Golden fruits now add a visual indicator to the fruits',
       '-The interface can now be enlarged in the main menu (only for devices with problematic resolutions)' ,

      'Very realistic and nice game. Missions and descriptions are entertaining. Controls are also great.   Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!',
       'Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!',
       'Great game but more issues to address.  The longer flight durations are a real waste of time,  make them more challenging rather than waiting for the destination. Also add more controls as the ones we have are not effective. How do you tell me to slow down yet i don\'t have the option for that?',
       'What is this. I was on level 1 and i just got to the last checkpoint and when I had to land it crashed when it took so much effort into going through them checkpoints. I recommend you do not get this game unless you are good with airplanes and have experience (which I do but this game just ruined it). I shall see this development soon.',
       'Its quite good but a little bit of fixing will do. The part "Slow Down thing" can you please please place that where it can not block the view of the player. It is very difficult to see whats behind it so it causes us players to crash. T.Y',
       'Why the hell they add brake when we cannot see the brake option even after landing which forces us to crash. Total stupidity do not waste time in downloading. Previously was better when there were no brakes just reverse it and stop or keep brake button always active.' ,

       'My son loves doing the missions but i wish there was more to do so he does not get bored. My son does love the game but i believe more projects such as the fires and oil spills. Perhaps there could be passengers to pick up and drop off. Also another area where they can build like houses or schools and put little people so they can pick up get rides to school, work, shopping or like ice cream. More backgrounds besides just the one track area. Other than that he plays it until he does everything then wants to do more but no other levels. Thanks hope to see more levels and different projects :)',
       'I bought this app for my son because he was in love with it, and to get ride of the "Unlock" message that kept popping up ever 30sec. After purchasing the game, I thought the ads would stop, but they haven\'t, and I keep finding my son in the play store downloading new games Cuggington has recommended. Incredibly irritating.',

      'The mini golf is great! I\'ve had a ton of fun playing and you don\'t need the in app purchases to win as long as you\'re meticulous with your shots. The ads are a necessary evil I guess. My only big complaint is that lining up shots with the button controlls. They need to have some sort of sensitivity changer so that shots can be fine tuned. All in all though, great game! Good job.',
       'Worst challenges ever, setup terribly to make it harder to win, always end up in a corner or another bad angle. Ball speed is so touchy, the smallest amount makes it from "to slow" to "over shot", really needs to have better increments.. usually it takes a while for me to dislike a game but this one had me agrivated pretty quick.',
       'It\'s ok in terms of mini gilf on mobile. Biggest issue is how the ball moves. To slow and clunky. Should bounce off walls more and not stop so quickly,especially after going down a hill. Mini golf is about being able to go for that hole in one. It\'s fun and challenging. If I want to take forever to get from point A to B..ill play regular golf.',
       'I think the game was terrible.  When you take a shot on target it rebounded up and missed the whole  Also I think they could in prove by making the controls better',

      'UPDATE- STILL NO MORE LEVELS ONCE I\'VE GOTTEN TO 1190.. IF THIS IS THE END PLEASE LET ME KNOW SO I CAN DELETE APP AND MY HUSBAND CAN STOP WASTING HIS TIME PLAYING IT!!! ITS BEEN COUPLE WEEKS AND NO NEW LEVELS HAVE BEEN ADDED, SO RATING IS NOW GOING DOWN. FIX THIS PLEASE! I love this game but I\'m on level 1190 and there is not another level after this. It did this before on a lower level and after a few days there were more levels. I shouldn\'t have to wait for levels to load up or the game itself reload levels.... my husband is going to catch up to me!!! Fix this please!',
       'I\'m not trying to be a hard ass, but I take issue when games like yours automatically goes into a tutorial mode instead of offering it as a choice. It drives me crazy. If your game gave the user the choice of either to use the tutorial or not my ratings would be between 4 & 5 stars.',
       'It was exactly what I was wanting to play.  Also unlike other previews, yours is what you show right away not after a bunch of other games that are not worth playing to get to the game you thought you had downloaded.',
       'Does what it says on the label. Airplane mode takes care of the ads. Happy to make a purchase to remove them though. Good time wasting game. Thanks guys for a great app!',
       'Forcing you to watch timed adds even after you win a level is bs. Its jarring, pulls you out of the game and makes the whole thing suck',
       'Maybe you could start the game off with a little more on how to play before we down load it. Over all my 3 year old grandson likes it' ,

       'I like the different ice creams and backgrounds,  and the streaks and accessories.',
       'It\'s controls suck it doesn\'t work at all',
