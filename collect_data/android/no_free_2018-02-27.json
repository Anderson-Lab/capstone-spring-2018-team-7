And after your first touch you get another ad that is very difficult not to open. I should have known, it\'s made by ketchapp. Very unsatisfied. They make so much money and adds and put so many so they annoy you into paying them money for less adds. Greedy.',
       'Deleted all my data with no reason. Had a bunch of Legendaries and Rares that have now been deleted. I put a lot of time into this game, and even bought the ad-free package. If you don\'t want a load of wasted time, don\'t download this app.  Edit- Updated the app and levelled up a bit. The game crashes every time I get a free revive. Still a massive waste of time.',
       'I hope you take the time to read.   This game is amazing, and it just keeps getting better. I do wish you would change the video knives to apples or video. Now I have nothing to spend apples on.  But here is what i really wanted to say i really like this company and the games you put out to your users. I\'m newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me. I own alot of your games and have spent alot trying to help. I wish I had more to unlock things in time. But Thank you very much.',
       'Ads interrupt gameplay and are extremely aggravating. The video that you have to watch to continue your gameplay never works. The game crashes when xp increases. I personally dislike this game, and it would be better if these issues were resolved. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this review.',
       'The game sucks it\'s alwful. It\'s gliching non stop for your bad. There are ADS everywhere! Ketchapp you getting worse and worse. There are ads of stupid games everywhere. What a game maker will pay to another game to show them in ADS! That makes the game in the ad even worse. Please ketchapp I was a big fan of you but you made your games so STUPIT. PLEASE FIX YOUR GAMES!',
       'The game was amazing! There was only 1 problem. Sometimes when i  started a game in the middle of it, it would just show an ad and it would make me lose. Unless you fix this my rating will be 4 stars. Fix this and the rate will be 5 stars' ],

     [ 'I love it very much. I also have some sugjestons to make. I think you should make categories for Thu pictures (animals,people,food,ect) and also have a daily challenge where you have to finish a picture (that you say) and we have to finish it. You would get a prize of a amount of coins and you could save them up to buy new pictures or tools like the bomb. But i really like this game. So even if you don\'t do my sugjestons I will still love it. ❤❤❤',
       'In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it\'s just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.',
       'AMAZING GAME! I am SOOOOOO HAPPY with this game! ITS SOO ADDICTIVE TO PLAY! SOOO MANY PICTURES TO CHOOSE FROM! THERE\'S EVEN A TRUMP ONE(which is EXTREMELY funny)! THIS IS THE-BEST-GAME-EVER THAT I HAVE PLAYED!I LOVE THIS GAME SOOO MUCH THAT YOU, YES YOU, SHOULD GO DOWNLOAD PIXEL  ART RIGHT NOW! YES RIGHT NOW! SO GO AHEAD AND DOWNLOAD IT!!! (also this is the longest thing i have EVER typed on my phone!)',
       'I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It\'s kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.☺',
       'I love this game and both myself n my grandbabies love doing the pics. It would b awsome to have n categories or level of pic. Didn\'t know about the bomb and other help. I would also suggest to move or when u r doing pic for the back button n save button to hide . I\'m always intrupting my pic by hitting the by accident . N also to b able to open the pic at a spot by touches instead of expanding pic. Expecially for more detailed pics. Love it Ty .',
       'Awesome app, its oddly satisfying and can either be really challenging ir really easy. Its constantly update with new pictures to do, and already contains probably hundreds lol, if dont 75+ and in saving the really detailed ones for last. If there even is such a thing. But, i think a counter for how many blocks of each color are left would be a really awesome alteration. There are many strategies to use when you do a color by number. So a counter for how many blocks of the selected number are left, it would be such a life save.this game has taken enough of my life already as is lmao' ],

As long as they don\'t affect app stability',
       'To everyone complaining about the ads, quit being so cheap and give the $2.49 to buy the game and remove them. Once the ads are removed, it\'s addictive and fun to keep getting the ball further. Fun concept and well executed. I\'ve already gotten more than my $2.49 worth of fun out of this game, and continue to play it.',
       'Too easy of a game. Once u upgrade ur strength to 30 plus you have to take into account of the angles. You never want to hit the ball perfect because it\'s  Impossible to hit the ball flush that it aligns with the dotted lane. Oh yeah for those saying ads, turn off the Wi-Fi and play.',
       'It\'s ok...not something I am going to keep. Good for like 5 min then the adds getting a bit much after every other at bat. I understand making revenue but a bit much after 1 or 2 hits. Plus I don\'t know if it was my device but the only sound I got from this game was the adds. No hit sounds or music or even hearing the sound of the ball hitting anything. Good concept, could have been designed and presented better.',
       'The concept is great and it\'s very addictive. I don\'t like the fact that hitting a ball just outside the "Perfect" range will actually make it much further than it does when you get a perfect hit. It also doesn\'t make sense that the ball bounces keeps rolling on water but as soon at you hit the leaves of a tree you bounce backwards. Also the ads.. way too many ads.',
       'Way too many adds. The game its self looks rather fun. But after 5 minutes in the game, and spending 3  minutes of them watching ads it was time to delete. I have no issues in watching a couple of ads to help the developers, but this was way over the top. Other than the ad frequency though, looks like it could be fun.' ],

     [ 'I love decorating the rooms but I am having to pay too much to get enough points to do it.   I also don\'t like that each room requires more points to do the tasks than the previous room.  I have changed my rating to low because you end up spending too much of your own money to get powerful to get your stars to complete the tasks.  They also lose your purchases.  I bought a desk chair yesterday and now it is missing and the task is gone too.  Rip off.',
       'Its a nice game! But it just takes forever to open a new level. Sometimes your on one for days. That\'s just to long. That\'s why I pay farm inland. You can play for hours with out bring stopped no lives. . I want a game that\'s fun and relaxing. No hard or extra hard ones. I really like cleaning and fixing thing. Be nice if you could do more area and less puzzle.',
       'Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it\'s advertised too much, but it\'s definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That\'s slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.',
       'Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I\'ll be playing this for a long time! I\'m working on the living room right now, getting close to level 600. Can\'t wait to see what the new character, Jerry, has in store for us! Thank you Playrix!',
       'I really like this Game so Far. I will play for awhile to See how it Works & If I like it. Absolutely Love Your Game. Play it ALL THE TIME!!! I Must Admit that I Really Do enjoy this Game! Sometimes I find myself Having a Hard Time With Certain Levels. I Could be On that Level for Days or a Few Weeks. I think with Some Improvement that Would make People Play. This Game More. But I Must Say Hat\'s Off to The Developers',
       'Love it! It just needs some adjustments. Too many levels that are way too hard, that takes you 50 tries to beat when you only have 5 lives in the first place. And it should only be beat one level to unlock one task instead of needed to beat two levels to unlock one task. If it\'s going to take 2 stars to unlock a task it should be something big not 2 stars for unlocking a task for cleaning up a little mess!' ],

    description: 'Six! is the latest game from Gram Games, makers of global smash hits 1010! and Merged!. This game is challenging, exciting and infuriating at times. As with all great puzzlers, Six! is great in one minute bursts or hours of emotive fun.In the game you are challenged to interact with a tower block of varying shaped bricks upon which rests a hexagonal block. The aim is to get the hexagon down the tower block to earn points.  You do this by tapping the bricks to make them disappear bringing the hexagon down into the space cleared underneath.It sounds easy, but when the hexagon starts to roll or the tower tilts, and with pressure of high scores you’ll find it’s not as easy as you originally thought. If the removal of the blocks topples the tower  or the hexagon gains momentum and rolls off the screen, then it’s game over and you have to start all over again.  Challenging, emotive and blissfully simple to play. Six! will have you hooked on getting as far down the tower as possible. In keeping with Gram Games’ hits, playing this game is simple and fun, but claiming a spot on the leaderboard and bettering your friends is challenging and rewarding.Key Features●    Easy to learn and fun to master gameplay●    Challenge your friend’s high scores, challenge the world.●    Fun and engaging graphics.●    Engaging and addictive.●    Play for a few minutes or hours at a time.',

     [ 'I love this game and would have rated it a 5 but suddenly the pause feature isn\'t working and I lost a game that was over 8000 points because I had a phone call. After I unpaused it set me back to zero. So aggravating. Also the 30 second ad for 30 stars doesn\'t show up anymore. Not sure what happened to this game in the last 2 weeks.',
       'This used to be an awesome game. I played it every day! But after the latest update, the ads at the top cause the game to lag terribly and make the ball fall very slowly and the pieces disappear slowly.  I can\'t adjust as needed due to the lag. I\'m unable to play due to this lag. Interestingly enough, when I turn on Airplane Mode thereby disabling the ads across the top, everything runs smoothly like it used to!! I am all for ads to support the developers  but this type they currently have causes severe lag which has rendered the game useless.',
       'Sadly, it could\'ve been a fun game if I could actually tap where I wanted to. The tap is off by like a few mm or something. I have to tap above the try again button to actually try again, or else I end up hitting challenges... So during the game play the exact same thing would happen, which makes the game unplayable.',
       'There are way too many advertisements every time I start a game or lose or win a game I instantly get an 30 second ad which I have to waste my time on to skip it until I am finally done. Overall except for the advertisements it is a great game controls and game play is brilliant I recommend this game but you will get a lot of ads. Suggestion: Lower the amount of ads showen',
       'I have paid £2.99 to remove ads and in still getting them. I emailed the developer two weeks ago and have still not had a response. You are forced to watch ads so often the game becomes unplayable and paying the money to remove them does not work. Save your time and do not bother even installing it. If you do install it do not pay the money to remove ads as it does not work!!!',
       'I love it but ever since I installed it ads kept popping up all over my phone. I don\'t know if it was because of this app. I want to uninstall to see if that\'s it but it\'s really addictive and fun.' ],

There is no in between you either win or you finish 14th or lower. You have 30 pts lead in front of number 2. after 1st round, you slightly fail your 2nd jump, guess what? 18th place for you! If you jump for example 120m on a K90 in Q, you finish first because everyone jumped 20m less, sudennly in 1st round you need 130m to secure your first place because everone managed to jump extra 30m.

     [ 'So nice to sit and enjoy a game of challenge. Almost as much fun as chess, but easier to carry. Great way to relax while waiting for the zombie apocalypse or the bus to come. Thank-you and keep up the awesome work.  *UPDATE* 17 FEB 2018.  Have started my friends and family trying to get Top Score. No one is really trying as they are all enjoying playing the app to care. Brought a tear to my eye. Once again, "Thank-you"  for a truly  wonderful game.',
       'Simple tile game with a nice learning curve. Easy enough to be able to relax while playing and challenging enough to not be boring.  Instant gratification for finishing levels, packs, and difficulty ratings.  There are \'rolling points\' that I haven\'t figured out the use for yet. Coins to purchase hints and other stuff. The ball can have different \'skins\' that you unlock as you complete grpups of packs.  TLDR?  I\'m having fun. Maybe you can too.',
       'Great game. Starts easy so you can get your eye in and then gets harder. Fun to play and not so difficult that you give up and uninstal. Ads are over fairly quickly and I like that you can choose to watch some to get extra coins.',

     [ 'I like this game a lot. There was a problem with one particular ad causing the game to have to be restarted, but they seem to have gotten rid of it.  Developer responded to my unhappiness.  Isn\'t that a good Developer? I think so.  Their game, Idle Factory Tycoon is really good also.',
       'I usually don\'t write reviews but I\'ll make an exception this time. I really hate when there aren\'t videos available I\'ve checked the settings recently and I was not connected to Google for some reason. I did not disconnect myself, why the game disconnect me from Google Play Store I\'m very disappointed.',
       'There is a bug with Mine 3 on the Mainland. At sharft number 23 it stops taking the crystals but it shows the action of taking them. The total does not drop down to 0 and it keeps adding to the total. Could you please fix that bug. Really enjoying this game too.',
       'Great game until you hit an ucloseable ad, or ads dont load.  also, the legendary chest is a rip off. I have bought 4 and they say 50% chance of legemdary item.  Nope, the only 1 I have gotten came from a common.  So spend your premium currency on something more productive.',
       'The game doesn\'t keep cloud saved data.  Had this game linked to Google and Facebook. My phone broke and it took me awhile to get a new one and now that I\'m on my new phone went to download this game and I\'m having to start all over.  Thanks for all those months deleted. Won\'t be playing this again.',
       'Game is fun but after opening 3 mines and prestiged 1, I mean it\'s always the same. They don\'t give tool for kickstarting mines when you start over. Its kind of boring to start over thousand times. So game is fun but gets boring quickly to me.' ],

     [ 'Awesome Game!! Really I like this game. I dont even have words to describe it. Totally Fantastic... Whatever you say, this is totally cool. But I have a request...please add a column of legendary bikes. Like there is Common, Rares, Epics, and Specials , there should be a column of legendary. Waiting eagerly for the next update. Thanks a lot of making this fabulous game. And I would also like to appreciate the colours and graphics of this game. Thanks to the team for making this game. I advice this game to those who are looking for cool new games. Please install it and have FUN!!!! Dont just look at the pics, install and you\'ll be amazed.',
       'Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death',
       'Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I\'ll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.',
       'This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can\'t seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn\'t be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it\'s not something you have to add, it\'s just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven\'t seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it\'s an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘',
       'This game would be great if it wasn\'t so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn\'t slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.',
       'The game is great fun. I have been playing it for a few months and actually still play it. The only problem i seem to have with it. Is the laggish performance when i am connected to internet. The moment the internet is off then game runs more smoothly other than that. Still enjoy playing it. Though I must say it would be nice if there was a gem counter for each ride so i know how many I have collected. Otherwise great game' ],

Want to take a break from your mind numbing job? This is equally mind numbing....but hey, play on your bosses time. When you see a picture you can\'t figure out, lower your mental ability to where it makes an amoeba seem like Einstein......from there you will get every puzzle. Enjoy',

The coins you win are miniscule compared with how many you need when you use the Help function (even bumping it up to 5 coins for each correct answer would be better) & the other thing...I get that you need ads to keep these games free but does there need to be an ad after EVERY SINGLE PUZZLE??',

     [ 'So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I\'ll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It\'s in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I\'ve ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍',
       'The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn\'t make it better at controlling. I don\'t know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌',
       'this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It\'s so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It\'s just so addicting and I can\'t get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the \'play online\' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊',
       'I\'ve recently upgraded from cubot to galaxy s7 and unfortunately the game is not working properly like it did on the old cubot phone. The screen gets stopping and it\'s impossible to play. I\'ve tried uninstalling and changing Wi-Fi settings but nothing worked. Other than that the game is sick! Love it,my kids love it and it\'s fun to play.',
       'Should allow us to be able to control the speed with a bar level instead of the button. Should make online controllers like offlines. Faster and more sensitive to move. And add a special rare star that floats around the screen rarely that doubles your size by eating it. No matter how big you are. That would be interesting.',
       'This is better than the browser version for multiple reasons. 1) It doesn\'t lag as much. I played a few rounds a noticed a little bit of lag, but it\'s better than the browser version.  2) You can play against AI if you don\'t want to play against people. I like this because I actually had a chance to win and was able to kill some. 3) You can create your own custom skin, which is awesome. All of this is free as well. I love this version of Slither.io.' ],

And thank you so so so so much.But I saw one mistake you were making that was if a player just tap a white tile you would make it out . So don\'t make the player out. Give it at least 5 chances. So that he can make his or her best high score. Please try to make it more interesting . And also when we reach higher you make it faster and faster. Otherwise this game is the best of all games.',

I\'m already making lots of gold with automating potatoes. Potatoes give away so much gold! Good update.  Keep up the good work. Thanks, Idle Farming Empire. What a good replacement for Farm Away.  Idle Farming Empire is like the best simulation for farming. I gave the game 4 stars for a reason. I liked the game! Look under the review! There\'re many people rating the game 5 stars. It should really be rated 4 stars.  Over 97,800 people rated 4 and 5 stars. I like this game. Thanks for everything.',
       'This "game" is like empty calories. I ingested it ate it up and left hungry.  There is no goal whatsoever to this game. It is a glorified add campaign intended to keep you going on and on with a false feeling of accomplishment in order push ads on you or make you buy perks. Want to double your earnings for 20 seconds? Watch a 30 second ad. Want to improve earnings for four hours. Watch an ad. You get the point. Of course you can buy these perks but why do any of this? The "game" never really does anything whatsoever. No milestones, no real goals, no anything. Well after about 3 hours of game time and the equivalent of add watching time I am off to ingest something with more substance.',
       'AMAZING! I love this game. It is so addicting and a great way to pass time and boredom. I think though for one small improvement you could add a thing where there are like \'mini games\' and you earn coins for that. Using those coins earend in the mini games you spend it on things like watering cans, fences for live stock and more! This was only some suggestions for a bigger game if you can have or make a new game called like farm life or something like that....LOVE IT...',

Again, I love this game and I would recommend this game to EVERYONE because it\'s for all ages (unless u are a very serious person) JK LOL! :D',
       'Like so far But, 2 issues. 1- I don\'t Facebook or do any social media so needs to be a way other than ads for those bonuses. 2- daily rewards Don\'t happen. Shows that they were collected but will not activate unless I have enough diamonds. Please fix. Play offline on tablet and hotspot to get daily reward.',
       'Great and addicting game, but with one major bug. I went to collect my idle money and I watched a video too double it (46 billion total). But when I hit the button to collect it, I never got it. All the money dissapeared and I got nothing. What\'s the point of an idle game, if you don\'t get anything for being idle?' ],

     [ 'Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!',
       'Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm\'s Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!',
       'Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I\'m just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it\'s going to be good.  We\'ll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!',
       'This game is awesome!! Just one thing... You might want to fix Power Trip, because if you miss the gravity pad in the robot part it\'s pretty much an insta-win. I don\'t know if it was meant to be there but if it wasn\'t, you should probably put some spikes there or something.',
       'This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10',
       'I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.' ],

     [ 'Me and my son have had fun with this game and made an attempt to collect all characters. The game is set up so you can not earn all of the characters but have to buy the last couple in a cash grab. It would be fine if they we\'re only available for real money but the game gives the illusion that you can win them in a chest. One that we have spun over 50 times without success',
       'Great timewaster! There are a lot of characters to earn and you don\'t need to spend real money to get them, so that\'s a plus. However, rated it a 3 cuz there are sooooo many ads. I get that ads generate the revenue to keep a good game free but an ad populates for literally every action. Win a game=ad, lose a game=ad, go to the settings=ad, change the volume=ad... ok the last one is fictitious but it really seems like that\'s how it works',
       'Love the game, its fun, addictive, and challenging. It makes you actually think before you do anything. The ads really are a bit much, being that after every single round in a tournament there is one. Also, one major thing, keep up with the updates. IOS users seems to have gotten an update with new characters and pvp mode even but not android',
       'The game is simple to immediately start playing and fun. I shouldn\'t rate a game based off of this but, these pop up adds are tremendously common. Adds are essential so that the app can support itself but to have an add after every single play and then have an add to open a chest? Really? That\'s a bit much, especially, when the adds are not easily skippable and even force you to the download screen of the add. The game is simple, fun, and has witty, silly, and quirky characters. But the adds are a bit much.',
       'The game is amazing, and the ads help them make money, if you made a game this good would just want to let people play it? No, you would want a reward. The only things I don\'t like is that the land is sometimes unfair, my phone randomly mutes, and on my old phone I had this and there were more characters but not now on this phone',
       'The game itself is enjoyable and the controls are quite simple. Very intuitive. But Jesus Christ on a frosty log, the ads are way to much. After every round, ad, want your prize? Ad. Wanna do anything in the game? Enjoy the ad. Jesus guys, I don\'t mind ads and I understand that\'s how you make money, but you shouldn\'t have to watch an ad to get your prize for winning...

     [ 'I was trying to take advantage of the first time deal. I purchased a deal and for some reason Google play didn\'t allow me to complete the charge. The next day I look in my bank account and I have been charged for what Google play said I couldn\'t do and I was charged another $4 when I didn\'t even click on anything. I want my money back. That is real shady that you would charge someone for a service that didn\'t even go through. And where did a $4 charge come from. And there is no way to ask through support to get that back so I\'m taking this here where others can see. Don\'t spend money here or there will be random charged in your bank account.',
       'Definitely not worth it. Was fun at first, but after the updated quests, the game took a serious nosedive in quality. Now you HAVE to beat the opponent in order to get anything, otherwise you\'re out 1000 gold. Before, you would get something just for playing. The new PvP just sucks.',
       'The forced ads are so frequent and annoying. Pvp either freezes and steals your coins or you win and lose coins. Probably over 100,000 coins lost this way. Game has potential and is fun, but company took this fun game and made it not worth playing',
       'Pretty decent game, shame you need to pay gems for the second last ship. The PvP is fun but half the time reduces my gold when I win. Cannot see the devs replying to any messages so unsure if they care',
       'Th game is fun and addicting. Way to many ads!!! Ahhhh My gold counter doesnt always register after endless mode is over. Gives me dble gold if i watch ad but doesnt register after endless battle sometimes. Would gave better review but that sux when it happens. Fix!!!!',
       'its frustrating on the pvp. you get disconnected and automatically lose. and sometimes they put you against someone who has better ships and level. they need to make it even and offer each player the same ships and same power ups at the same time. sometimes I get no power ups until round 3 and my opponent is already on level 7 because he gets better ships and power ups.' ],

     [ 'I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It\'s pricey but we\'ll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn\'t need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get',
       'Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn\'t need to have the internet on. Don\'t know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.',
       'This game is an amazing way to pass the time! I love all the upgrades and different levels, especially the events. The game gets more challenging as you go along, and the events I previoisly mentioned make it just that much better. My only complaint is how hard it is to get the special currency of the game, being diamonds. Other than that, it is a great game overall and I am looking forward to future updates.',
       'I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.',
       'It would be nice for updated casino with new slot machine games and also some new restaurants.  Last one was quite sometime ago?  Are you still actively developing the game or you called it quits like some other games I had to uninstall because there was nothing left to do in them.  Just curious.....',
       'This game is a bit boring at first since it is really hard to serve your burgers because they take ages to cook.  I, after 1 day,  got totally addicted to it as it gets really fun and especially when it lets you purchase the automatic cooker for just 10 gems it is easy and cool! You will see what I mean when you hopefully download the app as I would definitely recommend it! Thank you for making a fun, addictive app that I enjoy. 😄' ],

     [ 'Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I\'m 32 and play this often so it\'s not just for kids . Give it a try it\'s very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen 😉',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.',
       'Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can\'t do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!',
       'I Loooove Fishdom!!!😁 I\'m absolutely addicted to this wonderfully fun & challenging game. The graphics are very cute & entertaining. The only issue i have is that I\'m up in levels 180+ & there\'s just NO way to make the amount of coins to purchase ALL the decos/plants i earn. Most are priced too high.',
       'I love this game, its very challenging. The only thing I don\'t like is that your aquariums end up way overcrowded with stuff before you can move to the next aquarium. Of course you can move on to the next one as soon as its unlocked, but I won\'t move on until I have all 3 stars. So honestly, I guess this is just my issue. I probably should have given it 5 stars, because my issue is the only reason I didn\'t.',
       'So far I like it. But not on a very high level well see how this progresses. Well now I\'m on a level that I keep losing  by one  or ten mainly bcuz all the graphics  are stationed in the exact space so. And while it\'s true u don\'t need WiFi to play u do need it for ur daily prize which u really need.' ],

Also on YT thanks for...   !!!! 2 SUBSCRIBERS!!!!  I know its not alot but I am rlly happy and I\'m thankfully to who subscribed to me on YT :)  My name was galaxy DJ but now..  Its AngelPlayz I haven\'t even uploaded any videos yet 😂😂 but thanks for the support!  I might be making new videos about roleplays bloxburg builds and games to enturtain u guys to not be bored!!   I LIKE TACCCCOOOOSSSSSSSSS.....  🍍🍍🍍 .. This is so long lol...   Sorry how this is so long 😂😂😂😂 Well yeah that\'s all I got to say..!!?  Cya peace GUYS🍍🍍',
       'Well, I admit, I\'m addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn\'t be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can\'t Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍',
       'The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won\'t annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie',
       'It\'s a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it\'s super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.',
       'Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it\'s fun because it\'s challenging and there\'s super fun things in GD except hacking because that\'s no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I\'m super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂',
       'Awesome Game. Been playing for a while, and just downloaded again and got back in to it.  I beat the first few levels, but I get ads mid level.  This basically means dying and having to restart.  It\'s obnoxious,  and gave lost many times to it.' ],

     [ 'It\'s fun and addictive. Aiming is relatively easy, and upgrades are relatively cheap, so you can level up your weapon quick. The graphics are simple, but considering everything else, it\'s nothing to complain about. This is on a phone after all, not a PS4. However, nearly all weapons besides the hunting rifle, though possible to attain, require an insane amount of in game currency. So unless you like micro transactions, or have an insane amount of free time, you\'ll probably only ever have the hunting rifle. 8.5/10',
       'There\'s too many disconnection playing online when you have to watch a video to earn to Diamonds for free sometimes it does not play you lose that opportunity. They need to upgrade a little better quality on the connection situation. Is it worth investing your real money into this game the answer is no. Unless they fix the situation',
       'Don\'t care for the fact that most the "targets" are of brown skin. Just going to show exactly how prejudice ya really are? Disgusting and immoral! I thought all lives matter, not just the alt right, or white supremacy. Fix and the game could be great. It\'s always a white man shooting a black and this is why there\'s a problem.',
       'Good graphics but the character movements are clunky.  I\'m a hardcore FPS gamer and I like to test the limitations of a game.  So tried shooting a shoulder and the bullet went for a headshot instead whereas I clearly know my aim would miss. Glitchy.  Clunky and not so realistic unfortunately.  So not sure why the high ratings.',
       'Still full of annoying bugs. The worst game I ever played. Earnings are exactly layed out so that you can\'t level up as you should and in a way that you should spend a lot of money... 👎 Graphic & other bugs, really not fluid etc. 👎 Full of annoying ads 👎 Some can shoot through walls; but you can\'t. Some can see you behind walls, but you can\'t. Starting pvp, you get placed on the map with the back to the others. Your oponents have 10x stronger weapons... Fairplay 👎 Nothing is balanced fairly in pvp 👎',

     [ 'This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!',
       'Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don\'t like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option',
       'Great game, I totally love it. I don\'t mind the ad but I get annoyed of too many questions of Selena Gomez/Taylor Swift/Beyonce/Ariana Grande etc top hits. How about the legends..like David Bowie, Prince, Foo fighters, Guns n roses, Smashing pumpkins.. other than that, u all admins really rock!!  Edit: So I finally get questions like hits by David Bowie, Oasis..so cool. Well done fight list!! And they do consider our suggested answers!!❤❤❤',
       'Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it\'s good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can\'t take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren\'t recognised either. I\'d enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.',
       'Kind Of Likke Family Fued! U Can Play Aqainst Facebook Friends Or Randon Players & Go On A Streakk! Messaqeinq & Help Buttons, Earn Extra Tiime & Fill iN Answers For 30 COINS 🤗 Poll If The Questiion iS Fun Or Nott & Suqqest New Answers! Adds Afzer Rounds Butt Most U Can Skip After A Few Sec. Lovee It!',
       'Great game. Really fun buy id love to be able to play without having to wait for someone to challenge me or vice versa. A single player option would be fun. Also i payed 3.69$ to have no ads but i sometimes still grt the very long ad videos which i find a little annoying since i payed for no ads... But other then that great game 😊' ],

       'One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.',

     [ 'The game is designed to force you to spend money unnecessary money they\'ve already made millions of it you don\'t think of me to do stuff for free. The game is rigged so you cannot win 90 percent of the time. Ots a fun great game but the developers are selfish and very greed y at this point. Game 5 stars. Cheating 1 star.  Developers OVER priced items and greedyness earn another 1 star.',
       'I was so upset that i deleted this game!I had no idea how much i missed it! I was a big candy crush fan and still am today! Im glad i cleared up space to instal it! I recomend this game to everyone, i realy love that you can play it offline and with other players! Even if the gamers at school say this ias a stupid game, i think it is fantastic!.I live that you get candy powerups everyday instead of using your gold too!',
       'Where did owl game go😩😩😩,was in 2127 n now am brought back to 2125 dat i ve played ,so so annoying,I ll stop playing this game if u don\'t stop taking my boosters n taking me back to levels I ve played before. pls sort ur technical issues.',
       'I don\'t like the bombs especially when they blew up so quickly. So the game gives you 48 chances & the bombs blow up by the time you reach 18 chances to clear the board. That does not make any sense. Someone was not paying attention when developed  game # 191. I refuse to spend money to pass this one. I haven\'t spent 1 cent on Candy Saga. Not making $$$$ on me.',
       'Getting close to level 900 n have never hit the jackpot on the wheel n I don\'t know anyone who has! I\'ve spent so much money on this I would be better off at a casino at least there is a chance to win money back! Spend money here n you buy aggravation..',

       'how awful. need to buy building upgrades. building upgrades do nothing. buildings do nothing. literally do nothing. how do you get money? spin a slot machine. Thats the only way. There is no actual game here. And what happens when you run out of spins and realize you still need millions more money to upgrade worthless buildings? give them real money. this game is so lazy it might as well be classified as a scam.',
       'I love the game. It is hard to complete each village as a beginner but i\'v been told that it gets easier. I hope it does. The gold cards should be tradable as all my sets are missing them. And the shelds should be saved when u get more than 3',
       'Game requires you purchase junk to proceed. There comes a point where the casual gameplay is passed by the amount required to progress further; either watching hundreds of adds to collect enough coins to move on, or simply emptying your wallet. Good for a few levels, that is it.',
       'The bonus spin is wriged. It never stop on any prizes higher 500k. Also, The options to unlock the cards chests are limited.  The food and pet potions claims are not enough.. It takes too many spins and lost and raids to advance.. Need more rewards and more interactive games',
       'Honestly use to love this app. Made in app purchases that I never received and it\'s been over a month since I emailed support (now emailed 3 times) with no answer. They essentially took my money and now not answering me when I have proof of purchase that I sent with no answer.' ],

Why play Classic, Zen or Arcade for Starfruit when you could just watch ads.',

The fact I don\'t have a life means I can take time on the game,the graphics are great I can clearly see what and how I\'m doing. So the game play is good. I know what controls to use, what to do, and it\'s a good. But I can\'t get over the fact that there is not a lot of color. There is only red and black. So I think they should be color.  Good game otherwise',

My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I\'m not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr',
       'Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I\'m paying £9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn\'t make it worth the price being asked.',
       'I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',
       'This would have got 5 stars had I been able to share it with my 2 kids via family share. I refuse to pay £30 for all 3 of us to have access to all the levels.  Great game though. Fun, quick and easy to play. Many hours spent between us. So many levels too.',
       'Super Mario run is a great smartphone game it has the very addicting toad rally and remix ten and the simple, but very rewarding controls. The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars',
       'I beat world 1, and I have to pay for the rest of the game? Really? This is stupid.. If you\'re going to have a game you need to pay for, market it as such, not the ol bait and switch.

Now, in addition, each new element of the game that has been released in recent weeks requires cash to unlock. I can only use about half of the games features now. Bummer. If you\'re willing to pay, have a blast with this game. Otherwise leave it alone!',
       'I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.',
       'This game has potential to be fun but it\'s completely ruined because IT\'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don\'t get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it\'s full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it\'s a complete money bucket!',
       'This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.',
       'The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it\'s free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15' ],

Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can\'t join my sister and were only five levels apart.',
       'Ok It said Hey wanna play? Update your game..... Then when I come to update it it said it\'s updated AND IT IS..Pg2d u r bassically restricting me from playing the multiplayer battles. re u serious rn? Icant play cause i have to update the game when i already did.... Bassically waist of my money to buy new weopons when i cant use them.',
       'This game is the best I have ever played on a phone tons of maps, game modes, hundreds of guns, different tools, gear, and lots of skins. There is just so many things you can do. I also like it because it is a challenge something I would play. That\'s why I rated this game 5 stars.',
       'It\'s fun because I  git to play with school friends, and the gaming is amazing so keep up the good work! But I hate the new update with levels to upgrade you wepons! On upgrade costs more than the gun! Not   every one in the game is rich you know!',
       'This game is great! Even though you have to constantly farm for wins, but it does pay off. I\'m a level 12 in Ruby rank with 👌 guns. I used to have a candy cane baton that killed instantly upon impact, but it\'s not as effective against gold armor. R. I. P. Strategy',
       'I really like it. It\'s fun and entertaining, a highly suggested game in my opinion. Although i would like it if the sandbox mini game had more maps, and more freedom to choose those maps as well. It would also be very appreciated if we could play games with lower leveled players because i really wanna play co-op games with my friend, but she just started the game and it says insufficient levels. It would also be nice if the options of private servers were back in sandbox and you could choose what teams you wanna join in team fight. But otherwise, it\'s really great and easy to play 😄' ],

       'Please have more legendary raid events with gen 1 and 2 Pokemon for new and returning players who want to collect everything. With regards to using GPS and joystick cheats you guys actually benefit by getting more players from rural areas or dangerous areas playing and spending money. Besides you still have to do all the hard work minus the walking so it technically isn\'t that unfair to others especially since everyone is level 40 these days with legendary Pokemon. The game is already balanced just needs more events. Please consider a premium service to pay for where we can use a joystick in game. We can pay monthly or something so everyone benefits.',
       'thx for niantic that always listened our sugesttion, but i wish we can trade or battling with other player around the world by staying at poke center or else... - and btw you should update the new gym and new pokestop... since when i was on holiday in Indonesia theres not so much pokestop and gym around :( even there are many landmark in there - another suggestion plz maked some item that can be used to summon legendary/raid battle in location that we want, so its much easier  for the communities to do raid battle in specific location',
       'I love pokemon go and always get pulled back into playing it. I\'m still getting use to the updates after not playing for a while and am disapointed in the gyms. While I love being able to use them like pokestops, I wish to recall my pokeon from the gym. I love I a rural area and my poor Vaporeon has been at a gym for 13 days. THIRTEEN. I want my pokemon to come back please.',
       'The game has been majorly revamped and has benefited from it. It\'s so much better to see that content and events are happening more often. Hopefully we\'ll see the first wave of gen 4 by April or May and a nice egg event will happen to get a higher chance of a baby Pokemon from gen 4. Keep up the great work only downside is legendaries. I can\'t get them as not enough people in my area play Pokemon go and I\'m not travelling for a Pokemon. Can we have a legendary event for one week you can get 3* legendary raids? That would make it easier.',
       'The game is very addictive and can be fun, especially for fans of the original games. It\'s a nice way to get out and explore your local area. It is a bit limited if you don\'t love in a large community/city or have time to walk around during the day.' ],

And some items I\'ve purchased don\'t work it gives a message saying they couldn\'t find it in the warehouse. But the game never gave me my gems back and of money. NEED TO FIX IT',
       'I love this game!! "it helps a lot" with my shopping addiction because I feel like I\'m buying real merchandise. I really enjoy the updates and how you guys added more room to be designed!!!! Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))',
       'I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.',
       'Great application. Very enjoyable. Only complaint wish app had more international design furniture to match the themes and settings. Also need to fix the bug so that the design loading screen appears.  This is the only app that I have to reset my tablet to get my results, since the last update I have had this issue. I have made an inquiry adressing this issue and it still has not been fixed. I have changed my rating because of this issue, once it has been addressed and fixed I may change my opinion.',
       'Entertaining, enjoyable and inspiring! Brings out  your creativity in utilizing your available resources and in maximizing your limited funds. The game makes you travel around the globe.  Hope to seeing homes from less popular countries. Sad to note that there are times that free diamonds don\'t add up after watching the videos and there are items not found in the warehouse.',
       'I really love this game! It surely brings out my passion in interior designing, nourish my mind as i see others works, getting inspired also to continue want i really love in life, which is designing/art. And it does help me to chill or relax whenever im depressed bcoz it makes me think what to design, and helps me get out of the stress that life brings. It indeed help me with my mental and emotional instability. 5 stars for this! Number 1 app for me. Never failed my expectations. LOVE IT!' ],

       'Great game. The games are more fun than Candy crush and much more fair. For example, they let you make moves you can\'t play in Candy crush and timed rounds don\'t start until you touch the screen. Also, while some of the games are really challenging, you don\'t get stuck on them for days and days.  There are no gems or gold bars, etc. You don\'t have to slowly earn some kind of premium currency or pay real money to get special prizes.',
       'This is my favorite game. Absolutely love playing it whenever I can. However, why did the the flower growing from beating levels suddenly switch from starting on Friday, so we can enjoy it over the weekend to starting during the beginning of the week. Did not get to use my 6 hours of unlimited lives like I have been since this started. I would very much like if it could be switched back to the original timeline. Enjoy unlimited lives and contests over the weekend when it\'s more likely more users will have the time.',
       'I think that we should get more  coins for winning the levels. I find that the game can cost me money that I don\'t have, so I will spend less time playing your game. I love this game alot but why play if you are not getting enjoyment because it costs to much to play. (Otherwise I love the game) I also never got my horse, please give me my horse, I really need that horse btw. I already had a name for her to. I was going to call her daisy. The name goes great with the garden theme. (If you hadnt realized thst already) Please please send me daisy, I love her already. Peace.',
       'Playrix games are all generally the same.. They\'re good. But well designed to ensure and encourage the use of real money to play. Think of old arcade machine style of game mechanics and you\'ve got a general idea of what you can expect from any of their titles.  The only thing truely different is how quickly each game decides it wants to dig for your wallet.  Disappointing.',
       'It was a lot of fun the first few "days" but got very hard very fast. Don\'t bother with power-ups as it doesn\'t really make a difference. The only way to win is to get lucky with a big bomb. That\'s it. It\'s a shame because the game is nice, I just progress way too slowly now for it to be worth playing.' ],

Given a legendary atrandom at start a,nd a random rare in chest would be cool was expecting that..but no just normal cards.hope I get  cool legendary one day.like. the chest idea hope you bring in armour card add on.like spear guy could have ice spear or flames.plus that\'s cool extract cards to collect to make your cards even better and unique. Thank you my supercell friend.this game oh almost,st forgot.bbbbbbbeest 2 v 2 game on mobile,!!!!!',
       'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'Well after playing it for so many months. It now has not let me play for about a  week out of no where, it loads to 50% and then it asks to try again later I have uninstalled it many times and retried time after time. All of my other games work just not this one. Don\'t really know what to do. It sucks because this is my favorite game too.',
       'This is  the best game ever. And supercell, can u add google + sign in so that people who don\'t use facebook can also have friends.. Also I have like 8 leggie right now and I am so happy. And the new clan battle is awesome, it is the best. I wish it is permanent. Anyways clan battle is so fun to play and who ever created it.. U r awesome. Keep up the good work Supercell. Love you so much and ur games.😙😙😙❤❤❤❤😀😁😁😊😊😊',
       'Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn\'t one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you\'re better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖' ],

     [ 'Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I\'m 20 just..😉😉 I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I\'m in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️',
       'Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there\'s nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.',
       'I\'ve noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don\'t think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying.',
       'I really like this game. But here is why I gave it 2 stars.  I completed all of the challenges but still don\'t have have enough score to finish ranking up.  The 5 day to secret ball never works for me. It resets after 2 days even though I play everyday.  There should be a counter for how many times you switch lanes. Some of the challenges were impossible because you had to switch lanes exactly x amount.  Also I don\'t think you should have challenges that make you avoid getting the coins, because the whole point of the game is to win spheres and lanes...',
       'Fun little time killer. My only problem is that daily rewards fail to show up most days. It could be a problem on my end, but I don\'t know, and it\'s a pretty small issue so I don\'t really care.',
       'Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn\'t respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I\'m willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.' ],

It\'s nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don\'t want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad.

     [ 'This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!',
       'This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you\'re willing to go broke',
       'Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.',
       'Its the best game I have ever played. The things you can build are amazing and it\'s great that you can build your own to. The controls and graphics are unbelievably amazing. Great animal sounds to, they actually sound exactly the same as a real animal. Its also great that you can have villager\'s and your own pets. Only problem is the packs you have to use diamonds and if I don\'t have enough then I have pay for the diamonds and I\'m just a kid and my mom says no so please make the packs and the things in them cheaper. But other than that, this game is so AWESOME. 😃',
       'Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses.',
       'I have a significant concern with how easy it is to accidentally spend the gems. It has happened at least once, though I\'m assuming it happened a second time while I was quickly clicking building a building, since fifteen gems are now unaccounted for. I cannot feel comfortable with this game if at any given moment, all my gems might get spent because of one misclick.' ],

I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I\'m making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.',
       'I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!',
       'I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn\'t show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.',
       'So far it\'s o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It\'s not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game',
       'The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.',

     [ 'I\'m 11 and i love it so much.I have some Ideas for a toca kitchen 3. You can be able to make sandwiches and soups or stews. And more ingredients, more people. And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.',
       'I want YOU to read this Toca Boca I love it! But I have to ask, Why is there bread if you can\'t make a sandwich? Also can you make there a way to make soup? I really like your games but I am only 10,how do you expect me to pay for the games. At make 5 free like this!',
       'I like how I can give the guests disgusting drinks and food a see and hear their really funny reaction! Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!😆😆 I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!',
       'Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I\'m sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP',
       'I LOVE this app! And I\'m so glad it\'s free! Everyone is like \'it\'s the same thing over and over again\' but they\'re not actually getting into this game. They\'re are tons of different options to choose from and like Toca Boca says cook it your way. I LOVE TOCA BOCA!!!',
       'I\'m giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won\'t make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least' ],

If you bought it you should be allowed to switch back and forth as you wish.    It\'s a really zen pass time  game :) also cute and interactive.',
       'This would totally be worth 5 stars if it weren\'t for the ADS. I get it\'s a free game, but its one thing to put an ad on the top or side of the screen. It\'s one thing to optionally watch ads for coins and prizes. But its another thing when full screen videos pop-up, pausing your game and wasting your time. I was honestly thinking about giving this 3 stars just b/c of how annoying that is alone.',

     [ 'simple, fun, addictive gameplay, good graphic with unique animations, great events that keep players active which is good, have great potential. dark adventure loading still takes too long, i already dead when the loading is finished. crashing and some bugs in event tab. talking about awaken system, man atleast dont downgrade the stars or reduce the percentage of downgrade, finding awaken item is already damn hard. this great game need new character and more feature but not p2w. keep the good work barbarq !!',
       'I dont know why you chosen Retro style graphic and i hope for a change. There is a lot of IRANIAN players but PING is over 250ms and too much delay. Add iran flag. Google play sign-in is not working. Add more skins. Events are just bunch of objectives and prizes, add more artworks and stuff for events. Other things are good for now. Thanks for the revolutionary IO game. Congratulation on 10million downloads 💝',
       'YOU GUYS ACTUALLY LISTENED!!! Im so happy right now because when I saw theres a new update, I immediately downloaded it to see if I can play it without crashing. I can actually play it now with my friends! A little bit of framrate drop but still... I can play this wonderful game. Im going to totally recommend this game to my friends. The devs of this game are the best devs in the Google Play Store. Again, Im truely greatful and I thank you guys. :D',
       'It is the best game I\'ve ever played! With simple graphics and gameplays, you won\'t notice how long you\'ve played! Generous with presents daily and very recommended to spend time. However with the new update, I can\'t connect and it stayed on connecting. Tried to change internet source, but to no avail it\'s still there.  I would like to ask the developers, to reply as soon  as possible, on what should I do to get rid of this problem.',
       'Hello! I\'ve seen this game many times from the ads and I tried installing it and later found that this game was really intertaining and fun. Anyways, I am having problems with the game\'s connectivity to the internet. I am using 4G in playing the game and it seems that it does not connect very well, other online games connect well to the internet. I think that is the only issue I have in mind. Just hoping for more smoothness though.. But I love the game, it is worth the time playing. Thank you!!',
       'Feels like lots of players are AI bots. I\'ve won my first 10 matches with a 10+ holyshit mega kill every time. Looks a bit pay to win as a champ you must buy has a very OP skill. The amount of awakening to hit 5 and get the extra skill is astronomical and will require money to be spent. Also, not one person is speaking English. It\'s all Spanish/Portuguese.' ],

       'Mixed feelings on the changes since early access closed. Mostly good changes, but it is so heavy Pay-To-Win now I am a bit disgusted. It is an overall decent attempt at a PVP TD game, but some basic stuff was left out to balance the pvp. Basic stuff like a partial refund when destroying towers during an active match, no refund at all means a very limited tower deployment or upgrade strategy. The style of PVP is a bit forced and is suffering already from P2W. The graphics and mechanics are very good but the limitations are not balancing it out.' ],

       'It\'s honestly a pretty good game, it\'s fun, even though there\'s no real end goal and a lack of side quests. Although many improvements can be made to the game, the worst part is the ads, it\'s really bad, and it\'s insulting as a player that they try to milk this much out of us. You have constant random ads that take over your game at any moment. 5 ads per chest you craft to unlock each slot, ads when you switch to the map, floating treasure chests that require ads to open, even more pointless ads at every crafting bench, and the list goes on. I would gladly even pay to play an ad free version, but this is just ridiculous.',
       'When will there be quests?  I\'m up to level 10 and have a badass raft but there is nothing to do and I can\'t build the chemistry table. I have no way to get mortar and pedestal.',

     [ 'This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don\'t worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you\'ll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!',
       'This game is honestly a great time-killer and even has it\'s challenging parts, but from what I\'ve noticed as you get to the higher tier songs they just get slower and slower and are just flat with barely any challenge. I expected more of a challenge with a higher level but now this game is getting horribly boring.',
       'Great game. Played to level 120 and have over 500 gems but then I switched devices. This requires a Facebook account which I did not have. It worked for a little bit until Facebook disabled my account for doing nothing. They need to fix the method they use to sync progress. Now I am level 3 with 17 gems.',
       'I\'m in love with this game. It\'s challenging, you don\'t have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks.',
       'I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who\'s better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn\'t seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don\'t think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.',
       'Amazing!  It\'s very time consuming and very musical, interesting, and you get to play with people from around the world.   One of the reasons it\'s so good is that there are no ads. (That is if you click on something that involves an ad) Amazing 5 STARS ALL TIME' ],

Brilliant wicked. Excellent. Top one digit game. 👆 Great. Can\'t stop playing the game. Bravo. Thanks again. Wicked. Great. Funtastic. Brilliant',

Which in my opinion more new stuff or improvements to come later on ; as the game gets older and people keep playing. Which has been proven in more then one occasion.',

     [ 'Love this game! Very entertaining, never boring. My only complaint is with some of the collecting events. You have to do certain things to obtain the necessary items to put together, but for some reason with the current one you don\'t get enough of one item, and too much of another. It would be great if you could trade within your alliance for things like this.',
       'I played Game of War for appx 3 years.  The game started out great, everyone was on a somewhat even playing field. The game advanced to quick and left thousands of players behind. Other Players and I felt we could never keep up.  I hope this game advances at much more slower rate.  We all spend money to enjoy the game!    Don\'t be gready like GOW.  Thank you in advance.  Kirk',
       'Overall great game, however to play and be competitive ait is important to spend. In fact just to unlock some features you must spend at least .99 which is fine by me since I love to spend on this game anyways. I have been playing koa from the start and when this game came out I jumped on the bandwagon in the first 50 kingdom servers. So with that said yes it is LOTS of fun, I love my GoG family and definitely addicting LOL see you on the burning war field ;)',
       'It is a fun game and is the most indepth game I\'ve ever played. That all being said, unless you have a ton of money and a lot of time there is no way this game is worth it. I\'ve spend over $100 and play multiple times per day and I still find it hard to level up my estate. Even in an alliance unless they\'re all very high level it isn\'t much help. I\'m sure they\'re are much better games in this genre then Guns of Glory. To me it seems like a game for wealthy people and made by a company to just make money.',
       'What a great game!  Need to have introductory levels for newcomers, though.  You build your kingdom up and larger kingdom\'s just rush in and destroy you.  When you recover, they come right back.  Level into the attack mode, so people will enjoy the game more.  I am uninstalling after 6 weeks of running an Alliance, because it\'s just not worth the trouble.  Great concept, fantastic graphics!',
       'ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE GAME!!  Been playing for about 3 1/2 months now and I\'m addicted. You do NOT have to spend money to play and to level up., unlike some of the others I\'ve played where you can\'t level up unless you use cash money.  Love that there are moderator\'s to make sure people are acting right too.  Thank you Guns of Glory for keeping me happy everyday ☺🙂☺🙄❤❤❤' ],

       'PRACTICALLY AMAZING!!!!! THE BESTEST COCO GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!!! I have played many coco games, (almost all of them) but this one is the bestest of them all (if that\'s a word 😜) mainly because A LOT is unlocked including the SPA!!! (Crazy, right?!?!?!) and there are so many things to do. Plus it also reminds me of subway surfers..... The one thing I love besides the spa, is the restaurant. As far as I know, only fitness girl has that..... So definetly, it\'s a plus..... 👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍😋',

     [ 'Let\'s be honest. This game is very similar to every other choice game. You have to wait 3 hrs for another ticket and I don\'t mind that BUT the storylines are CHEESY! Like damn, I don\'t even feel  the chemistry between the characters, you all should work on that. Also, the why you all draw the Black characters is simply awful. Work on the way you color the lips and draw the face. I hate to say it, but overall, this game is basic. It\'s a work in progress, READ your reviews and actually listen to what they are saying.',
       'It\'s pretty good. I am going to save this application for now. Right now I am reading the Campus hacker story. I really do like the humor in it but I kind of find the characters rude LOL. I\'m only on the first book so I don\'t want to give up yet. I have four other reading applications and this one honestly is my least favorite as of right now but I would definitely recommend it and give it a shot.',
       'I think this and most of the game since choices came out are all rip offs of episode choose your story. Now I\'m not saying they are bad apps or stories I just wish some of these people knew about episode. Though I have to admit this game is pretty fun.',
       'In the past I loved my shelf, now I kinda like it. Untold Darkness was amazing... Then I read Untold Darkness 2, I was very unhappy about it. I had hoped it was a continuation of the first, but it restarted just like the first. One of the things that got me upset was that it changed things, like not knowing Eugene, and Eddie, also I disliked how I had to meet everyone else again.  I really think there shoud be a continuation of the first Untold Darkness though, it\'s my favorite.',
       'I kinda liked it. I finished untold darkness book 1 before giving up. I also started reading a couple others to be fair. I didn\'t really like untold darkness until later on in the book, and was eager to start the second but very disappointed in the second one. I felt like my choices didn\'t really effect the outcome.',
       'This is so much better than any other of these types of games,there is no lagging at all. I love the graphics, there so life like. I am currently reading untold darkness book 1,and I can\'t wait to find out what happens next. Really glad that I downloaded it.' ],

     [ 'I really like this game, kind of wish the progression system was a bit quicker though, other than that, the tight controls, open world and variety of creatures you can eat make it a solid game. The special sharks look really cool, and I even considered buying one until I saw the 50$ price tag.   On a side note, what\'s the difference between this app and the Hungry Shark World?',
       'i would rate 5 stars... but.. something with the cloud save broke, i used to have the megalodon, without any cheats.. but now i have the mako. could you fix this somehow? And do i email the support team? Im not good with all the emailing stuff.',
       'I thought it was SUPER DUPER AMAZING. Keep that game like this and don\'t change it. But whenever I would eat like a lot, then I don\'t get bigger and it said the more you eat the more bigger you get. So I think you should make that better. If u wouldn\'t have done that then I would be impressed by the game.',
       'Amazing game. I completed this game in 48 minutes Hahaha! Because I used luckypatcher :) I downloaded the luckypatcher in Googlechrome But it can harm your Device..... And the last shark is Moby dick His baby is as big as Megalodon.',
       'The is the most intense game ever.When you think you\'ve got it ,it\'s gone. Can\'t figure out how to boost. Controls aren\'t the best.Rhis game could improve. Oth er than that it\'s fine I guess.Too many pop up ads. Really frustrating. I want to play the game not look at ads. Sometimes  you can\'t back out of the ad.',
       'My apologies for the negative review lately. But to be honest, I have to use VPN just to log-in in Google Play and enable cloud sync or else, I wouldn\'t be able to sync my progress. Just a little request, can you make the gameplay smoother for lower end devices, such as devices with 1GB RAM? It lags frequently during gameplay. Thanks a lot!' ],

The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.',

     [ 'I like this game. I purchased it because it deserves, also I want to remove ads. 3,50 € and ads are not removed completely. I\'m disappointed, expecially for the "restore purchase" button that not works. Despite this I think that as a game is fun but monotonous in the long run, defect of 90% of apps of this kind. I hope developers will add something with updates that are not other challenges that ofter go to luck (and waiting time should e removed also). Sometimes there are some bugs but irrilevant for gameplay. The development house has made other interesting apps too. Sorry for errors, is not my first language.',
       'At first, the game was good. But after time passed, there is a little gameplay between advertisements.  The game has been sold to advertisements where ads even come in between while you are playing. Very annoying.  Disappointed.   Uninstalling.',

I suppose it is quite addictive but I lost interest after a few goes. It wasn\'t my cup of tea so to speak. I hope this review was helpful and remember to give it a big thumbs up!!!

COULD do little better on the mechanic of the game but nothing to major. Would like to have a better money earn system like small amout per kill or something. This game is well dont. Ive played almsot all games on gogole play and when i say this game is fun I MEAN IT!!..',
       'I like the game, but I have a few things I would like added. One thing is instead of joystick controls maybe there could be an option that allows you to have buttons to move like in vehicle mode where you can switch from the gas pedal to the four buttons. Also I would love a first person mode, I think that would make the game so much cooler and better, just a new way of playing. And Maybe a mode like a TDM would be cool. Just some suggestions, thanks for reading love the game!',
       'It was a good game till there is alot of cheater. Please ban all those hacker@cheater. I have been killed by so many cheater. They can shoot through wall n walk through it. How the fuck am i suppose to win a game like this. Sadly it was a good game till you guys stop doing the job n enjoy all the money from people who buy diamond n do not ban all those cheater.',
       'Thank you for constantly improving the game. Id say at this point not to add more but to fix and adjust what you already have. Fine tuning before more additions would be great. Optimizing sounds, movements, vehicles, rendering, scoping, responses, all that good stuff would be great. Its a little laggy but thats just what you get for a giant game and 100 million+ players. Love it either way.',
       'Fun game, especially since it\'s free. But I saw that this game supports controllers so I tried to use my pro switch controller with it and so far only 2 buttons seem to work, as well as a huge delay from input to actual action. And I can\'t seem to customize the controller layout, so I\'m just stuck with the Ability to walk and crouch/lay down with said controller. Can\'t aim or shoot.',
       'The game has so much potential they just need to make it easier to see other players and easier to shoot people close to you. Also the game doesn\'t need to look realistic they should make it more like fortnite graphics and gameplay wise.  My main point is that it is too hard to see others in the game. still a good game though' ],

I love all the different tribes and take no issue with shelling out a few $ to check the all out. Of course playing the free tribes leaves little to be desired if u can\'t afford the extras. Best game I\'ve come across in a WHILE.',
       'Fantastic mobile game. It\'s a great pocket sized Civilization-style game. Quick games with the depth and variation to keep you immersed.  Unfortunately, the multiplayer update doesn\'t seem to be functioning very stably at the moment. My friend (Verizon iPhone) and myself (Sprint Android) have been trying to play some matches, but we keep getting turns where we can\'t move our units, or gain resource points to spend. As it\'s an indie-developed game, I understand it\'s tough to test every permutation of devices and connections. I\'m hopeful and looking forward to subsequent updates and bugfixes. Keep up the great work!',
       'I really like it, turn based strategy, probably one of the best games I had on this phone yet. There are a few fun tribes you can buy (or rather should buy) and I think spending a few bucks for a game like this is absolutely fine. Just keep an eye on the time, half an hour flies away if you don\'t pay attention ^^',

The \'modes\' list is a little sparse, however, and it would be great if you would plan some modes as a side project or something. Not that it is easy making a new mode. Well nonetheless, god job',
       'Love game, but why the auto start, in my opinion, no app should auto start, app should only be turned on when in use, fix this or I uninstall. GEEZ, all you developers think your app is only one used, get a clue! Then why do I keep getting a "Poytopia has stopped" message every time I start a session on my tablet, even though I did not play Polytopia during last session.',
       'I love this game hence the 5 star. But the multiplayer needs some work, if I wanna play a game with a friend in 1 sitting I have to reload the map each turn. If the turns could progress without reloading the game that would be awesome. Also, I had a bug that made me replay a turn a few times in multiplayer for some reason after I returned to the game.' ],

     [ 'It\'s OK I love to play the game when I\'m bored and it helps me to be settled back and have a good time. But these all happens when I\'m offline. But when I\'m connected to Wi-Fi there\'s too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you\'ll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I\'m playing the game??!! It\'s too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.',
       'Well before I say my review, I would like to clear out a few of the negative reviews. There are not very many ads at all, in fact I barely ever even get any. Second, the controls don\'t suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.',
       'I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don\'t you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?',
       'It\'s stupid. It\'s really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn\'t turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked.',
       'I dont know why people are rating Ketchapp games below 4 stars... I agree games are difficult but one of the unique one\'s in every launch. Their creativity is awesome... Love to play each of their games. Kind of more chanlenging and unique ones',
       'This is an amazing game! But there\'s a tiny problem with the controls: they are hard to be used. In addition, there are so many advertisments and that\'s the only reason I gave 4/5 Stars' ],

     [ 'l was enjoying the game a lot and would have given it 5 stars. l spent a long time to get enough bricks to  build a level 7 home so dragons only needed 7 mins sleep.. NOW    only  the same 5 of my 30 dragons get out and this is making collecting bricks and healing power very slow. l have not seen all my green dragons and moon dragons( the hardest workers) for 2 days now. developers please help or l will stop playing. TY.',
       'Love this game. Graphics are great and so much to do. Keeps me going for ages. Main concern and the reason I\'ve not rated 5 star is the time it takes to get each token. When some levels take 7 and it takes half a day to fill up it\'s a major pain. Then you do a level that needs 4 and the next also 4 it takes the p*ss. Would be great to have a higher limit without getting charged or for them to fill up quicker. If this was done I would rate 5 star all round.',
       'I would love to give this game 5 stars but 99% of the ground I\'ve uncovered is covered by "treasure chests" and there\'s no way to get rid of them or contact the game makers for help. I\'ve completely run out of space and can\'t play anymore. The chests should disappear after 3 - 5 days if they\'re not opened.',
       'I really want to love this game but the time mechanics in it are just too much. An hour for one game token and most of the maps after the tutorials cost more than one token to play. I have to wait 3 hours to play one round? I really like this game, the merging mechanics are addicting and fun! I find my self between kicking myself for popping something early and getting excited for getting close to going just one more level up, but I almost have to literally forget about the game in order to get any sort of meaningful play time out of this game.',
       'I really loved this game when I first started playing it. But you are making me hate it by making the challenges way too difficult to complete in the time frame period or forcing me to spend money to buy gems to help me defeat the challenge levels but then I still can\'t beat them. Yes, most people like a challenge but when you make the challenge so difficult that it takes you days or weeks to get through it, it loses its hold on you and you start getting frustrated and angry instead of wanting to play the game.',
       'Reason I changed from 5 star rating to 4 stars is before a recent update, you only needed 1 dragon chalice to play any level. Got changed to needing more than 1 on most levels, which wouldn\'t be so bad if they didn\'t make you wait 1 hour to get 1 dragon chalice back. Used to only be a 15 minute wait between chalice\'s. If it goes back to old way......5 stars again! Still a great game' ],

     [ 'Nice game. I like the concept of rebuilding but this game was meant to kill time, I hope so. Keep adding characters and what we require is a hell lot of mini games so that they may keep coming and coming and coming. I do not intend to harass you but try to add more and more mini games after each update. I\'m sure that in the course of  time you may be able to compete with the best games ever created but do not make the game larger than DWTD 2. Add more new locations too otherwise we will not be able to consume the tokens. The game is nice because you do not have to consume money for characters and get them through gifts instead. It is also nice because tokens can be collected easily. Please think about my opinions. I❤ this game.',
       'The character models are cute and all, but the games are getting a bit repetitive. WAY too many ads. Like, ridiculously too many. The app forces a couple right after you finish some of the minigames. You have enough to offer us - forcing even more ads on top of that is tiresome. Get rid of them.',
       'Dumb ways to die 3 gets 3 stars. No, seriously, I loved the first 2, but this one is not good. Only 4 minigames, not really different each from another. Remember FASTER FASTER FASTER ? It disappeared (I miss it), and is now ADS ADS ADS. The goal here is just to use money and play as often as you can for ADS ADS ADS. The main thing here ? Minigames ? Nooooo, just getting (or buying) tokens and use them to repair houses (no impact on gameplay). Why would this game be nice ? The graphics are still good. Yes, that\'s all. Have a nice day. ADS ADS ADS',
       'Best game of all time I mean you have to try this or else your life could be boring and lonely the 1st and 2nd are also really good check em out and you can\'t live with out this game. My point is best game ever',
       'To be honest, I don\'t think this game updated at ALL. Dumb ways to die 1 and 2 were GREAT but this one... not so GREAT.  First of all,  there are only for games that you could play.  Second,  it\'s not as creative as the other ones. And third,  the only good thing about it is that for ME there are no ads.  The list goes on but that\'s for you to find out and for me to uninstall. 😐😐😐😐😟😟😟😟😢😭   Im VERY disappointed',

Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven\'t tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.',

Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.',
       'It\'s my favorite app. I love it a lot. My only issue is that it doesn\'t quite accurately update my stats especially my highest score without using a \'save me,\' longest run, most coins & gems. I would really like the developers to look into that but otherwise it\'s a brilliant game.',
       'I love this game, very addicting. And I love that it has the daily, weekly and global challenges. As well as objectives and the daily chest challenges. Lots of things to work for and win. Makes the game more fun. Plus, so far, I haven\'t come across anything that I\'ve had to spend money on in order to advance in the game' ],

     [ 'Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn\'t hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv',

And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add "Edit and changing names"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱',
       '"Cusion shot on 8 ball" games are great, woukd be cool if one was created at a lower buy-in though.  I think its currently like 8 million needed to play a bank the 8ball game.  I personally like the No Guidline 9ball games,but would love a cheaper bank the 8 game.    Also, well done on adding the upgrade-able cue sticks.  That alone, i think, has made this game much much better.',
       'I realize y\'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don\'t pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I\'m pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It\'s a pretty good app and I\'ve sent many people to download your app.',
       '8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don\'t win any games until those coins are over and I\'m only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don\'t know why this is happening but it sucks because it\'s putting me off the game.. it\'s like 8 ball is making sure I\'m losing hence the rate 3',
       'Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don\'t decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don\'t mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don\'t actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.' ],

     [ 'Good game but be warned to really get any good characters you\'re either going to have to pay lots of real money or you\'ll find yourself grinding forever the same nodes to upgrade the characters that you have. With that said this game is a big improvement over heroes of dragon age of which in many ways this game is modeled after . It seems very clear that some of the devs from that game migrated to this game to start it up. The last update at 02-26-18 freezes at loading screen and then force closes come on devs get on this!',
       'I love this game but an issue im having since the newest update os why im giving 2 stars at the moment. Ever since the update the game will not load. Says "loading cantina" then closes the app completely. Im gonna end up getting kicked out of my guild...please fix this! Soon as its fixed it will return it to 5 stars bc the overall game is badass!',
       'I played this on and off since it started but now I am back full-time and it has always been improving and growing. Big star wars fan and can\'t get enough of it? This is the next best thing. The game is very complex so I suggest if you are only starting out, check out starter guides on youtube on how to have the best head start  and enjoy! 🎉',
       'My game had been freezing after last update. I ended up turning wifi off and using mobile data once it got to the update it asjed if i wanted to switch back to wifi. I did this turned off mobile data and it has worked now. On android hope this helps some other people out',
       'Some aspects of the game are very balanced and competitive, other areas (CLS, Jedi Rey) are just for the pay2play. The best way to enjoy this game is with a great guild. There are now a fair amount of ways to do that. It would be nice if the gear bottlenecks were fixed and also add another way to help support lower level players,they just get overwhelmed...Maybe donations that increase drop rates, splicing gear or smuggler runs. Bounty Hunts, that award credits or gear. There are endless ways to improve this game and it does happen, little by little, over years. The only way to play this game is with patients, even if you are will to drop tons of money on this game you will not be competitive in a day, week or month.',
       'I used to love this game, even gave 5 stars. I\'ve played this game almost everyday for over a yr but now it no longer works. Doesn\'t matter what i do, the app just closes in the loading screen now. I have no idea what you have done to this game but it needs fixed and it needs fixed now or I\'m deleting it and moving on.' ],

     [ 'This game was great until about 5 days ago, that is when it started to take 4 to 5 minutes loading time for each game mode to start. Now my attention span prevents me from waiting that long to play one game. What happened game developers?.... !!UPDATE!! Okay it must have just been the servers. Because they\'re back up and running at 32 seconds loading time for a war. This game is great. I can dig it can you dig it',
       'They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It\'s definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you\'ll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.',
       'Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don\'t be fooled. This is a pay to win game.',
       'A great game that brings back the old Mech warrior days. One of the few good theme fps shooters on this platform that is "FREE". You can pay to win but it will cost you alot. Investing afew tens to smoother the growth? But you can still have plenty of fun without spending a dime.  Until it slowly draws you in deeper.....',
       'I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that\'s cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!',
       'Game plays fine. No ability to choose mode is a major letdown. I did the $20 test to see if you can actually buy anything valuable. The answer is no. The game is geared towards the have money people. Update 2/23/2018  The queing is under 10 seconds. After Lunar New Year update you can earn upgrades better.  Discounts on purchase items is better.' ],

Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It\'s a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It\'s very competitive!!! I swear my husband can\'t beat my score no one has lol',
       'It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone\'s or tablets I find it hard to control I don\'t know if anyone else thinks so but that\'s my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company',
       'It\'s good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it\'s my opinion so don\'t get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don\'t have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn\'t play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀',
       'Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface',
       'Worst game played ever . Too irritating , so many adds . Very disappointed . I was just seeing the ratings and I thought it will be good but after that I got very much angry. PLEASE NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. Slither.io is much better game than this one. Worst game controls',
       'Addictive When my internet is streaming I can\'t play as the lag is too bad. The adverts are a little irritating but out of peak times are few and far between. Other than that I freaking love this game : )' ],

Even uninstalling and reinstalling did not fix the problem. I hope you eventually get it fixed it would be worth downloading again.',

       'Would give this a better review, but there are so many glitches. You can only upgrade a booster once, then you have to close the app and open it again so you can keep upgrading. Loved the game before this started happening. And the tap boost should be longer than 60 seconds, how about 30 minutes like the speed boost.',

Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!',

You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can\'t advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it\'s basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.',
       'This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said "add break". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them.',
       'The game desparately needs to offer more coins as skill level increases.  The frequency of coins remains the same while the skill level demands more and more coins (in the thousands).  Watching ads helps, but the player finds themselves doing that exclusively, which defeats the purpose of the game.  Physics, graphics and gameplay are good.',
       'One Of My Favorite Games  So. Let me start of by saying I LOVE it! So I like very few games, in fact nearly no games. But this  game is epic! It\'s interactive, fun, motivate and time killing. But there is one problem and that\'s there are to many adds and most of them are inappropriate' ],

       'After I posted my recent comment, there were some angry comments pointed out at me. I apologise for that. I mean, this game in great! There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars. For someone who says "too many notifications", go to the settings and turn off that notifications button. Thank you for those hate critics you guys made. It really teached me a lesson.',

It\'s really fun to play when you need some time to get away from problems or just when your bored. Although I do have to say I don\'t personally like how every time you want to color faster it makes your phone vibrate because I might be trying to use my phone without anyone knowing or something 😂. But overall really good app I love it😊.',

     [ 'Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?',
       'This game is pretty good, for the most part. The only problem is the bots you go upagainst are  way to hard. I can never win. I would have gave them 5 stars but I gave them 4 stars because of the bots. And the game is kinda hard to control. When I move backwords on a veichel it goes up.',
       'This Game is really fun but the Spicky car is really stupid because it\'s so easy to die... really stupid... but other than that, the games awesome and I got the fist car thing but when I want to use it I can\'t find it 😑... the games the b💣mb. But the update I don\'t have so you should probably not get the update because people are complaining about it. AND ALSO ...CARS KEEP SPAWNING ON TOP OF MY CAR KILLING ME!!',
       'Ok. I admit this game is pretty fun. But the missions, especially the hardcore ones, are ridiculously hard. So if you want a challenge, I recommend this game. But if you rage over really dumb things like me, then I definitely do not recommend it.',
       'I hate this game it makes me so stressed and the AI is rigged also the David and Goliath mission i try to win they win 5 out of 5 of the first 5 matches and I\'m afk they win 4 out of the first 5 matches this is f@#$ing stupid P.S impossible to get new cars the machines just gobble up your coins like the game where you try to grab a plush toy but it always fails because it\'s rigged',
       'The physics is very hard to grasp leading to many fails and the bots often drive backwards and forwards until they can drive up onto my head. There\'s also no start timer, leading to the bot ramming into me before I can figure out what\'s happening. Great with human opponents, however single player makes me want to throw my phone out of my window. Great concept, horrible execution.' ],

No matter where you put the contact spot on the cue it is always maximum front spin or back spin, there is no diagonal spin or English, and no gentle spin of any kind. Fix this and you have a perfect pool game.',

     [ 'This is a very good game and I highly recommend it but there are two small changes I would make.    1) I would make it so that you can move the object in your village i.e. trees, rocks as there are afew seasonal decoration that I would like to keep but they are getting in the way of my village.    2) I would also make it so that you can put more then 1 builder on a construction to cut down its time or add more builder.    But other then them 2 changes I think it\'s a great game and I\'ve had lots of fun with it.',
       'The heroes should be for all players from the lower level. They can make their own choice to choose the hero or switch them. If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy? It\'s the strategy game, not for only the big or strong players. Thanks!!...',
       'It is a good family game and it is a way to play with lots of friends and even make some new friends in your clan. It does not take lots of money to complete they game it only takes skill and dedication. I have played this game for years and have had many different accounts on it, but you just have to dedicate your self to one on those accounts to get a good high level account',
       'What happened to the game I used to enjoy? Now everything is turning into a spam fest. Strategy has been consistently removed from the game with each update. BH still has a bunch of AI issues. For the first time ever (as a max 11 and misc other accounts) I can honestly say uninstalling has crossed my mind.',
       'Coc is on the first place in my games list. It is very addictive and enjoyable. I am looking forward till the day town hall 12 comes. I am not much happy with SUPERCELL ID thing. Because it is not much easy to use. I recommend using the normal GOOGLE PLAY sign in method because it is much more appropriate for me. Overall COC have become my life. I also recoomend to have a time limit for coc, like coc automatically switch off if the user plays coc more than 1 hour. Long Live COC!',
       'Its an awesome game. The new concept of supercell id is cool but switching is little time taking. I Would request you guys to make it easier or add some shortcut to switch accounts. Because it is really difficult to change if you are in poor network zone. Plz consider this. Otherwise the concept is really good it saves RAM of phone as u dnt need play games and services updated. 😀' ],

What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven\'t listened to this game\'s. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I\'m entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.',
       'I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it\'s meant to be "skillfull" but thats harder than skillfull, you can\'t even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don\'t care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.',

However, the advertising is a horrible and annoying part of the app, and probably borderlining app guidelines. When the advertisement is on between rounds, they block your entire UI, and there\'s nothing you can do to shut it down. They will frequently stream video, which can easily consume your entire allowed data from your telephone company. This is NOT how you should provide games, free or not.',

     [ 'This is all I needed: another Criminal Case game to take up my free time! I love the whole four of them. The the hidden objects tease my brain to no end. Each game  is intriguing with an original story line. I do have my favorite crime scenes,  and plenty of friends(all over the world) whom play as often as they can too!',
       'It would be nice if you level up and get full energy but your energy had some if not all left before you got it restored that you just increased by the full amount, the way it is now I lose energy when levelling up because it doesnt add any more to the 110 that is standard. I dont think it is fair to those of us who play daily. I never know when my pet will find that last batch of XP and cause the level up to happen. If I am over the 110 already, I don\'t even see the new energy. Some concessions need to be made for this. I love the game though, it is fun and challenging.',
       'I love this game. I have all of the criminal case games & love them all. The only things that I don\'t like is that when when ur energy gets refilled, it only adds to what u have, instead of adding an extra 110 to what u have. The other thing is that u can\'t buy none of the hamburgers, orange juice, chips or anything with ur tokens',
       'Love Criminal Case and a True Fan!! One thing I think should change is that whatever score you have when you level up, the 110 should be added to it. We deserve it  because we Earned it and the only reward we get is to share juice with other players. Give us a Happy Meal and 110 pts.!!',
       '4th instalment of the Criminal Case games. I love playing them all excellent time wasters intriguing story lines. I\'m well & truly hooked on the whole series. Gainsborough, Pacific Bay, Save The World & now this Mysteries Of The Past........ all brilliant',
       'I was over the moon when they put Mysteries of the past on. I hope they can do the same with The conspiracy as well. All 4 games are a must have. You\'ll never find another game like these. I love playing them because they\'re brilliant & addictive, I hope they continue to make more.' ],

     [ 'Very addictive game.  Next version here are some thoughts:  show some flames on re-entry.  Docking clamps so you can put fuel into orbit and pickup additional fuel so you can go to Venus and return to earth.  Put the rest of the planet\'s in there.  Make it so you can take cargo such as rocket parts to moons and other so you can build a rocket there that can go further due to low gravity at launch.  I really liked this game and a lot could be done with it.',
       'I love this game, i\'ve been landed surface in every celestial object few times, included Sun. I also recommendation to other friends in forum to play it.  But, I want suggest to add some simulation like : - Rotation planet. - Perihelion/Aphelion. - Perigee/Apogee.  And also some feature : - List for delete few space trash like empty booster in orbit. - Name rocket every launch (it make fun & realistic).  Thank You',
       'I am so addicted to this game. I love everything about it. I just wish there was a place to donate to you (developer). Also, I would love it if there were more rocket parts. Also, I wish there was a thermosphere you had to get through to get on planets. All in all, I love it! Can\'t get enough!  Edit: Thank you so much for the reply. I\'m sorry I wasn\'t clear on the thermosphere part, but i think the reentry effect would be lovely. I just can\'t stop playing. And I\'m SOOOO excited about rovers and things! Thank you so much again! :)',
       'Bee looking for a game like for my entire years ! this is the best rocket game, I have ever seen in my life travelling to space , I like the sound system , formation of building materials is compatible ,graphics are excellent to the 2D platform . I like the physics of the game. Please keep it , ur the best Space programmer of all times (GOAT). Is it possible to add a space shuttle and moon rover ?    Regards. Please fix up batrrey issues . my phone heats up a lot .',
       'I absolutely love this game, but I keep having a bug where either the close up or the tragectory map goes completely black so I can\'t see or control what I\'m doing. It started  becoming more frequent after a few days and even after uninstalling and downloading again the problem persists. Please fix this! Everything else is amazing: the gameplay, the allowed creativity and the ease with which one can learn new techniques.',
       'Trajectory in orbit I really love this game you made. It would be cool if you could make the rocket face the direction of it\'s trajectory during orbit. Edit: Can you add re-entry effects when going to other planets? It would be more realistic. Also add heat shields for re entry situations. And when is docking gonna come? Hopefully in the next update.' ],

       'I think if you could add a few extra spaces for more ninja then everybody would be happy .the reason I\'m giving this app a 4 star rating is because you can only have up to five ninja on a mission including your own .if anybody would like that to happen then give this review a thumbs up.',

     [ 'I can\'t say I love it,maybe I can. But any way, this would have to be in one of top hundred games😀. There are a few things I would like added though. Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed this😀😁😀😁😀😁.',
       'I think you guys have messed up your game in the past few updates. Seems like there is some memory leak or something. After a while the steering wheel lags so much. Only the input. Graphics don\'t lag at all. Please fix. Also would be great if you could add some button to start and stop a timer in free mode so we can set time challenges for ourselves. I like the game but it is unplayable after a few minutes after the recent updates',
       'What you should improve is that YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ADD\'s I MEAN SERIOUSLY I WATCH MORE ADDS THAN THE GAMEPLAY. I ONLY PLAY FOR A LITTLE THEN MOST OF ADDS SHOW UP. I WQ5CH ADDS THAN PLAY8NG THE GAME FOR CRYING OT LOUD!!',
       'This has to be like, my 5th or 6th reinstallment of this game since there\'s no ingame reset, but darn well worth the data(little bytes). I usually like more realistic car games, but even the "extreme" warp in physics in the gameplay doesn\'t distract from the fun. These are the cars you\'d want if you\'re trying to beat the traffic, run from the cops, or solve a parking dillemma. Great fun time killer! One thing though, the other reviewers are correct in their complaints about how often and when ads pop up. That shouldn\'t happen smack dab in the middle of a maneuver.',
       'This game was just really really good! But please please make the exact same game but instead, if you do something illegal like crash into another car, the cops start chasing you. If you do do this I will comment on every single game that comes up on the adds. But, there is a tiny bit to much adds. Anyways, AMAZING fame!!!😊',
       'The cars are totally good and pls add some more. The traffic is really bad. Because they are inconsiderate and doesn\'t care about other cars. How come some of your games has the traffic considerate, Axesinmotion?🤔🤔 In other words, I hope u will do the things above that is mentioned.' ],

     [ 'Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I\'ll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily "less than 20 coins" reward. Sooooooo cheap!',
       'It\'s just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that\'s a good question.',
       'Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don\'t terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.',
       'Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don\'t ever plan to, but here you also don\'t really need to. I\'ve won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you\'re not forced to watch them. It\'s not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.',
       'Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don\'t even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.',
       'Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn\'t be putting people in the "club" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this "club" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they\'re INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game' ],

       'I just bought the level 4 crates. Some were delivered, then it reverted to level 3. I have a screen shot showing that I already had level 4. I cannot find a bug report feature in this game. Please fix this in my account. Otherwise, I love the game. Remember to buy something to fix the ads.  Edit: I sent customer support an email with a screen shot a month ago. There has been no response.',
       'Stay away unless you plan on paying money.  The devs force ads in almost everything you do, and I\'m pretty sure they aren\'t vetted as one of them seemed to take control of my screen. Great potential way to serve up malware to your customers.',
       'I like merging games, but this one has a huge ad issue that makes the game somewhat frustraiting to play. I\'ll click the store to buy a house and it will auto start an ad video. It\'s lacking a bit in the story line department too. For a base merging game it\'s simple and fun, but definitely needs some work.',
       'Nice mindless game, fun for when you want to just chill out. Would have given more stars,  but it seems upgrades are temporary. I won\'t be wasting my money getting better boxes,  the one I bought didn\'t even last 5 minutes! Such a waste of $4.',
       'Ever wanted to be Mayor? Ever wanted to run a town, develop the land, and see a metropolis grow? Well, look no further than Animal Crossing cuz this game does none of those things. You just merge buildings into better buildings. It is fun, if you spend money so that you\'re not bombarded with ads. But then you run the risk of being unable to watch ads when you want to to do things like double your earnings or unlock a better building from the mystery box.' ],

You should be matched on games played not trophies. Otherwise the good players who go up the trophies quickly always play people with better clubs. The game goes easy on you if you\'re not good at it which defeats the point of getting good',

I can\'t believed I play with unknown character with 200 some games total but I have total game of 4000s but is he\'s in yellow color level and he controlled high hail wind on me so he could beat me right on the spot.. I don\'t know why they do this  horrible play on me I spend more than 100 of Dollars to purchase chest and other stuffs to become great player but they turn against my happiness in this wonderful game I love so much, Oh well no more buy chest this time no matter what..

You will not have the accuracy or the power to be successfully even though you are using the same clubs and balls as your opponent. This is a free app that if you let it will turn into e real RIP OFF.',

It keeps me entertained while I am bored or when I am on the bus on my way to school. But there are way to many ads and I hope u guys please fix that. 💜',

Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don\'t get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don\'t mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!',
       'This game is AWFUL!! There is no tutorial and every time I fail an unimportant ad comes up. What is wrong with you making games like this? Close this game down it is terrible. Just learn. Who would want to play a game like this you stupid idiot',
       'It\'s honestly a fun game, and I\'d love to use it as a stimulating activity (ah, who am I kidding, it\'s just a great time killer), but it makes my head hurt-- and that\'s a problem. I\'m not even the type of person that is negatively affected by fast-paced graphics or rapidly changing colors. It\'d be five stars if it didn\'t give me headaches, but, for now, it gets three; good graphics, smooth gameplay, but no matter how great the app, it isn\'t worth physical discomfort. (Note: if you are looking for something similar, try "Run". It has the same sort of concept, but without the advertisements and headaches.)' ],

It\'s not identical to other games of this type, as the challenges are similar yet different. The scenario of the game is basic with the others. I have a variety when it comes to games, this one has similar sound affects to other games that I, personally, downloaded. (But they\'re also from the same makers.) This game is over all.... Good so far.. I would recommend, linked my account to this game and invited friends and family. (I only do so, if the game/app is worthy. I\'m a picky bull!!!!) Overall, you\'ll have fun! Cute toys and  unique power ups, with a slightly (10%) twist.',

Probably better that way, one (read: I) should pace themselves when playing....',

Of course, I suppose that\'s by design so I spend money. Which I won\'t do. I just want some "bubblegum" to past the time.  Now, it\'s making my blood pressure rise...  Also amazing how many 5 ⭐ ratings they get in one day without the user giving explanations on why. Seems suspicious...',

Can you please make changes',

Sometime when I run the game it\'s not response (all animation are moving, but it isn\'t resopnse when I press the screen) , so I have to close it and run it again many times till it response.

There should be some research option in every guild or either there should be some Commander talent points by which we can increase some of the tactics of team & player.  Main Idea :  I think there should be some event in which 2 guilds can fight with each other & there should be option of ally & others.  I know it\'s kinda different game but it will make fun to game.   Overall this game is best and addictive,  Thanks for making this game.  Great effort by dev team.  Love you.',
       'Hi,there my players name is cammanderDJR and I won death match like 3 times even though my level is 9 and I have no experience in survival games but this is like the best game I\'ve ever played. I still have a few idea\'s on how to make it better and that\'s the graphics please improve it. Love the game way better than Rules of Survival.',
       'This is a great game. My friends and I love it and it\'s probably the closest thing to PUBG that will ever be made. One thing though.. How do I add people to my guild. 😂😂😂  And considering improvements, maybe you could expand the map a bit, get it to 100 people on the map at a time but that\'s not exactly an issue, maybe something to work towards. Also, maybe add a chat room for guild members and not just the voice chat.',
       'This game is good fun but pls can u stop peoee from running u over as when 8 get in top 3 some keeps running me over. It\'s still and amazing games but when people run u over its boring and wish u could stop people from doing this   is th8nkthere u should maybe be able to drive places but when u want to fight they have to get out and shoot and have a proper gun fight . Overall this is a great game my favourite mobile game and it\'s really enjoyable. But pls can u make people not being able to do this. Thankyou',

This is really annoying. Close combats are pretty impossible. I\'ve checked everything. My network is fine. I get a better ping in other online games which I play. My friends have been facing this issue as well. So, it has become harder to play squad and duo matches as well. Please do something about this Garena. I would definitely drop a 5 star then.',
       'great game!  i love the game, its a great game to pass time, with epic moments like a random dancing gun and etc. I have played other games like this on my phond i still prefer FF. BG, the update was also good love the addition of the grenade. 1 thing that would be good to add is a chat box when players are still in lobby. I would have given this 5 star but There are still bugs and glitches' ],

My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn\'t there but now it\'s forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.',
       'Seems like controls tend to be problematic, and synchronisation has to be adjusted for every song. However the game is wonderful, precise, compelling and worth spending time on! Everything is well thought, new levels and lines are frequently added. So far my favourite app ever, looking forward to playing some new levels and the match option.',

       'Good songs. That\'s about it. The hitbox detection and lag spikes are horrific, the checkpoint system is a blatant cash grab, and what annoys the most is that the timing of music+taps (the core mechanic of the game) is completely broken. It is significantly easier to play the game with audio off, so that you don\'t get distracted by the miss timed turns. Doesn\'t even fulfill it\'s most basic selling point. Atrocious.' ],

     [ 'Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.',
       'Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I\'ve progressed it\'s just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I\'m not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!',
       'I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I\'ve already dumped into this game and the devs didn\'t give me my in game rewards. I\'ve submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.',
       'Wasn\'t sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to "farm gold,xp,mats". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it\'s an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don\'t be jealous, just play your game and have fun.',
       'Honestly gameplay and all is good but the game is so p2w it\'s not funny, it would cost u over a hundred dollars just to complete every reward for new Valentine\'s event. If you like this game play private server instead this version is a giant cash grab. Not competitive for f2p at all',
       'Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an "annoying add". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It\'s simple, it\'s fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend.' ],

     [ 'It\'s a fun game but the developers have made it difficult to advance high level characters unless you want to buy "chances" to get the necessary items to advance.  When I first started playing the game the items were easier to get, now the items are VERY rare to get and more difficult to get. Most of the reward items are basic items you get just from playing the basic levels.  There\'s no real incentive to getting the treasures chests because they don\'t give valuable items.',
       'It feel like developer tries to cash is as much as possible. You can\'t develop without paying. You saving crystals just to get 3* hero to feed it to your 4*. Game don\'t stop when you receive phone call so you easily can loose alliance energy without doing any attack.',
       'It\'s a fun game. The challenges and levels are interesting and keep getting harder. But if you resource well and plan your strategies, you can play a lot smoother.   Only thing I don\'t like is the recent update... I now cannot play my regular levels. I can only do the Titan challenge and the raids... please fix ♡',
       'I really enjoy this game. Being in a powerful alliance really helps. What frustrates me the most is the inability to obtain 6 star characters. I have tried paying for epic summons, nope. Upgraded my Castle and training yard to level 20. Nothing but 3 stat and an occasional (duplicate) 4 star character. I feel like I should be at endgame status by now. I lose Raids often because in the Platinum tier, most people already have all 5 star characters. What\'s the incentive to keep playing?? Tap Sports Baseball 17, for example, give random gifts of high level players that encourages players to continue playing their game.  Please allow us easier access to top tier 5 star characters!!!',
       'You totally ruined the raids.  Now it always puts you against higher players and gives them massive turns.  You messed it up it your newest update. No way to win and totally unbalanced.  You waste massive food never to get anyone your level and lose massive trophies. Bad bad bad',
       'I\'ve been playing for a couple months now, and at least for the last month or so the game has definitely plateaued. All of my heroes are near max level, and I need some four stars to progress, so I\'m stuck just training over and over hoping for the best, with a two day wait between draws, and a sub 5% chance of success.   Really fun for the beginning, but like all mobile games, it relies on you paying to access higher level content.' ],

It looks like it connected to a Facebook account and loaded an old game but I don\'t gave the option to disconnect. So frustrated!',
       'I love the game and have played it for almost 5 years now but for some reason it will not connect to facebook. Not sure what happened in the last update. Hopefully it gets fixed soon. I would hate if my phone got messed up and my progress is not saved',

Recently my phone was stole and had to get a new phone.  Familyfarm helped me recover my farm within a couple of days.  Their services were quick and resourceful.',
       'Fun game, but...What happened?  Don\'t like the snow,  it lightened all the colors of everything, they are not as vivid as they usually are.. With cataracts,  too hard on eyes,  all print got really small and can\'t read anymore.  Will have to quit til eyes get fixed.',
       'PLEASE HELP,  my pet is somehow stuck & I can\'t get him free. Makes it harder not being able to move paths or his home whiles he\'s out or I could get him unstuck.   Please make an update where you can move these things while pets are out, or get my pet unstuck for me. Otherwise I won\'t be able to continue the game due the the inconvenience it\'s making.   (other then that the game is real fun & would like to continue it.)',

     [ 'Awsome game. Completed all levels without any hack jzt waited  for hope   ( the lives ) evrbdy shld try this. Sry i gonna uninstall this app only bcoz i finished all levels. Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.',
       'The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don\'t get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new "enemies". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you\'ve lost some lives. But that\'s not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.',
       'I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It\'s more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.',
       'Remember the old days when platformers taught you through trial and error how to interact with new game mechanics? If you don\'t like that, you\'ll hate this game. So much fun, so creative, and once you start to get down one of the new features, it ramps it up and keeps you learning creatively how to beat the level. I love this game, it\'s a fantastic platformer that will challenge you to learn as you go instead of giving you a tutorial every time something new comes up.',
       'Completed all but just couldn\'t get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I\'ve ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.',
       'I love this game 😍😍 it is my favourite but.... I don\'t like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it\'s a great idea😋😋 btw i loved it 😍😍😍 ill give it 5 stars then😊😊' ],

     [ 'I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I\'d end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!',
       'Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It\'s reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series\' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis\'s and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I\'m offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,',
       'I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It\'s fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn\'t want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.',
       'Game it self is great and a ton of fun.   But, the system for showing ads is so annoying.  It\'s not just your normal video ad no, they make you watch 3 different ads and a min of 16 or 11 sec each.  After you have watched the minimum time, you have to hit next and repeat again',
       'Quite addicting. But does have partial microtransaction walls where it\'s extremely difficult to get past certain parts without forking over real money. Other than that it\'s nice. I only have two things that I think could make this game better: 1) boss battles and 2) ability to sort through parts by specific type, rather than just their standard class.',
       'I want to report a glitch. I betted 3 parts, titan, drill, and a repulse. I lost on thd bet, and guess what? The titan car still had that tick on on it, then i got those stickers on the car unlimited. It took me 5 minutes to get back to normal. Please dont use this peopole.' ],

Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels "fixed" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.',
       'This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.',
       'I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn\'t really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don\'t know how many more points you need.',
       'This game has many issues! It continually freezes and shuts me down. I can no longer play on my tablet, which I purchased just for games, and have to use my phone. I don\'t like using my phone because it drains my battery. I am so ready to quit this game and return to candy crush instead. Latest updates have rendered JP and other perks useless.',
       'Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the "boards" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it\'s addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It\'s becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.',
       'I really liked playing as mindless entertainment despite what I consider to be unreasonable costs of the games as you advance in levels  and even tolerated the forced ads when they began. Unfortunately 2 days ago   it refused to load and continues to ask to retry or restart.  My connections are optimal and no updates pending.   Have tried to contact support to no avail. Disappointing.' ],

Also could you have one year vip less expensive plz thanks!',
       'I like playing this game although i find that male characters do not have many long hair/ girl hair options available to buy unless you are vip or have diamonds. I think i speak for many people when i say that boys and girls should have more hair options from the opposite sex, for starcoins, as some people may take offense if they are strictly only allowed "boys hair"/ "girls hair" unlsss they are paying for it. I think you could inmprove further by making it easier to earn starcoins and another way to earn diamonds because many people do not want to/ cannot afford to BUY items in a fictional world.. Overall, i think this is a well rounded game, with a few improvement points, however i enjoy being able to have my own unique style in a virtual world :)',

So when the most recent (3) babies were available for purchase I bought them, but now those babies don\'t work!.... I\'ll give five stars when you get them to work. In the meantime, I think I should get a refund on my money.',
       'Downloaded this game for my daughter and we never got to play because the game will not load. It gets stuck on the bottle screen and then has a black screen after that. She has Nabi tablet, so I will keep the app for now and just disable it. Please fix soon!!!',
       'My daughter loves this game and plays it all the time. I just bought her all of the last babies today for her to have them all and the bottle freezes and she can\'t play with her new babies. If someone could fix this for me or refund me that would be great. I just got 6 new babies and she can\'t use any of them which is ashame cause she loves this game.',
       'Bought the game early on, then after an update with new babies they mixed the new babies in.  So you are left with a child constantly wanting the new babies.  A horrible money grab.  Otherwise a fun game.  Shoyld not show the locked babies mixed in with purchased ones.',
       'Dang, I wish the purchases I made on 6 more babies for my daughter would just work! She loves the app, but gets frustrated that the whole app freezes when she clicks to play one of the other babies. Wouldn\'t recommend this app because of that... it\'s just stealing my money..',
       'Like the others have mentioned - good game, daughter loves it but bought the 3 new babies and now itnjust freezes any time she tries to select them. Waste of £1.59 or however much they were and no means of refund or correcting it.' ],

     [ 'This game needs the ability to gain more township cash. I have spent way too much real money to buy township cash and im not doing so again at this rate. Farmville isnt this bad and hard to expand.  You cant expand the barn without waiting on products by train or paying in township cash to expand. And that costs over a couple hundred township cash for each expansion. Getting a dollar or two here and there takes forever to collect. Plus the expansion makes small expansions so it doesnt help much.   If something dont change i may quit the game. I enjoy it and would like to continue but at this rate i dont see much point. I cant afford to pay more money to play.',
       'The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen',
       'RSYFJH Great game very addictive, and I don\'t know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats\'s kind of ridiculous. That\'s the only bad thing I have to say about this game.',
       'BEST GAME EVER! It\'s my biggest game but even though I have an old phone the game still runs really smoothly. There\'s always something to do, it never gets boring. I\'ve been playing for 8 months. Super easy to use and learn. It\'s addictive. You also don\'t feel pressured to make purchases like other games.',
       'I love this game. Amazing sound effects, graphics. You guys did a great job that\'s for sure! But still couldn\'t give it a five star because of the lastest update. The entire screen goes black after playing the game for 5-6 minutes. That\'s pretty irritating not to mention how much slower the phone gets as well. Didn\'t have these issues with the last update. Fix it please!',
       'I think this game is really great and addictive, especially when you start playing tge regetta. I  love my coop members, they are a great team.  I just wish they would let us cancel orders in factories, because often you order stuff but then a train arrives and your priorities change...' ],

     [ 'lnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'I love the game play and graphics. But I payed for adidas female clothing and an aquarium previously on the game, and then when I restarted, they have gone. I spend £3 on it in total and I actually spent more money on other things that didn\'t come back in the next game, but it\'s understandable because they were lifestyle points and you know it\'s currency not clothing or furniture. I uninstall sims sometimes a bit of always go back and before my items were there, but now they\'re not and that really frustrated me. I actually ended up in 2017 spending  £10 on sims freeplay and that\'s the only money I think I will ever spend on ot now because if you restart,  you don\'t get anything you wanted. Please fix this because I spent that money and I could\'ve bought something else with it but I didn\'t because I like sims.',
       'First, I don\'t like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don\'t like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you\'re just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!',
       'Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools "playable",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it\'d be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.',
       'Love it addictive,if u like the sims on the pc you will like this.If you are a patient person you don\'t need to spend money either. Update it has lost stars as I don\'t want to spend money and now you need vip to get to the next stages of things. Disappointed with this. If you didn\'t have to pay for anything it would be 5 stars.',
       'im not sure what\'s the cause of the problem but what i know is the sims\' act a lil bit freaky. i just redownloaded this game bcs i cant log in this game before bcs i just updated it. before this, the sims is ok, but now they act really awkward. when they\'re walking, they legs dont even move! it\'s like they\'re flying, plus when they\'re doing any action like "clean the dishes", they dont move, they just stand still in front of the sink. this is freaky. please reply to my review bcs i really want to know more about this. i really like this game except what i said above. this game is really addicting:).' ],

And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.',

       'Got all the way to the end,  and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow,  and ended up having to restart all of the levels,  fix this,  it doesn\'t happen with the other geometry dash games,  just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted...  Fix then 5 stars',
       'When I heard that this was out, I rushed to the Play Store, freed up my storage and installed this app. This is fantastic, as I had been craving for 2.1. I finally have a little sneak peek, although…                                           A) No Spider in main levels (Challenge excused) B) Ads…ugh                                                        C) No Account Loading (2.1 fixed)                                      D) Levels too easy and short                               It’s still great!' ],

     [ 'This game is amazing! Everyone needs to play this. I would\'ve given a fifth star however you need to not only buy all XXL sharks to unlock the "!!" Sharks but max them out. Definitely download this, just one tip. Don\'t delete when you have progress. I\'ve downloaded, played, got bored, and deleted 3 times. Now I\'m never deleting it. I have so much progress, if I never deleted it the first time I would have everything in the game',
       'Finally! For the the longest time I\'ve been waited, the gaming performance has been improved! No more annoying lag and the gameplay feel a lot smoother now and I am so happy about it. But the graphics still needs to be improved because it doesn\'t look too good and some minor bug needs to be fixed.',
       'Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it\'s so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I\'ve had to start all over again... but the fun continues!',
       'This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don\'t play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don\'t make us wait foreverrrr!',
       'It\'s a fun game and I\'m enjoying it. However, I\'ve come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.',
       'Everything is lagging. From exploring the sea to chomping down the humans and fishes. It was great before but it is getting very very lagging. For example, Swimming towards a school of fish but instead of eating them, shark just swam through them. All sharks are lagging. Glitching here and there. Please fix this!' ],

     [ 'I played it a long time ago and i stopted like 5 months ago. Then now i reinstalled it and:  1. I could not enter my acc  2. I could not connect to facebook or google play.  3. I had to pay each time i danced wich sucks.  Till that update this game was the best game/app ever. It was so fun and so great that I just wanted to play nonstop.  I mean before this big update u payed for a song and u could dance on it as much as you liked. Now it just ain\'t fun anymore.   Please return to the classic game or your gonna lose much much more players like me.',
       'Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren\'t enough. And one of them didn\'t work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.',
       'I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.',
       'It\'s fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I\'m bored. I love the songs and dance moves it\'s awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it\'s awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don\'t know how to dance then you should download this game it\'s perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.',
       'Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn\'t have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!',
       'I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn\'t make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun.' ],

Also the ad bar is right below the numbers so you accidentally hit it when you play. Pretty sure that\'s intentional to get extra clicks, but super annoying.',
       'having lots of fun with the game, especially the daily challenges. But  ads that cannot be skipped pops up way too often, and its quite irritating. Also it would b good if u can ad d something like automatically mark (diff cotour, shade out) the numbers thats already been fully filled so we dont have to check it manually.',

It\'s not a game a advertising app, isn\'t this too much hance i know you developers make money on the game but just because of this much ennoying adds when people uninstall this app you won\'t be able to make anything out of your effort can you???',
       'Graphics are awesome, but the game itself is very monotonous. You can fall asleep waiting for something to change and make it more exciting. When a change such as an added bonus does come (bomb or a rainbow bubble) you realize that it wasn\'t worth the 20 or 30 levels you just wasted your time on. Progressive enticing events need to happen more quickly.',
       'On level 19 I scored three stars bit it shows only two. Aside from that, no other complaints... YET. I will say thank you, though, for not aggressively pushing ads, pushing to pay to extend the aim line. So far, its amusing😁',
       'This is a really fun game but my  my concerns are that when I have no balls left, for me it doesn\'t have the option to play a video to earn more but for my brother it does therefore it makes me start all over again. The other concern is that when I use a bomb for the chest it takes away a ball for example I have 12 balls when I use the bomb from the chest, I get 11 balls left which it doesn\'t do that for my brother. I hope you can fix this.',
       'I thought the levels would be more difficult by now I\'m on 143 at the moment. I enjoy the game but I\'m getting a bit bored with the easiest of challenges and without having to use the help button . I hope the game will  get more challenging soon.   Grandson aged 5 will like playing this game.',

     [ 'This game is highly addictive. The challenges are hard but not impossible. You need patience...and planning. The Chinese new year\'s event made me used to the shortened energy usage, now that it\'s back to normal, just doesn\'t seem to be enough. But maybe that\'s where the patience comes in. Great game overall, really enjoying it.',
       'Overall great game. Not really a fan of buying Lottery type tems in the shop ( I won\'t spend money on a CHANCE to get something good). Also I think items that you purchase are a little high in price due to the fact that they break so quickly ( Keep it a little cheaper and people will buy more). I think the food and water need is a little on the extreme side. You\'re constantly eating and drinking to stay alive. I think they should make food that is crafted last longer than something you just picked up and eat same with water versus drinks that are made. Love the fact that there is no save. It really makes it feel like a survival game. If you make a mistake you lose your stuff. Also like the fact that you can go and recover items if you die in an event or a bunker. I don\'t think I would play if you lost everything every time. With a few little tweaks to the game this could be one of the best ever.',
       'Its awesome... The thrill of building from the scratch in such tense situation... everyone should play once .  But since the last update I face one problem, every 5 minutes I am asked to update the game, which I already have. Since there is no close button on that, I have to restart the game every 5 minutes. I don\'t loose items but I loose time. Please check to it.',
       'Proably one of the better mobile games I\'ve played. A nice break from the predominant base build resource auto generator \'tap to collect\' skinner box games that everyone else does. Yes this is a base builder, and you have to collect resources, but the difference is that you actually have to GO OUT and collect. There is actually a skill factor involved for once! Suggestions for improvement: equipment repair needs to be a thing. Leveling should do more to improve your character beyond just building more advanced stuff. Undead should catch fire! :) Good job dev team. Keep showing those other devs that a mobile game can be more than an idiot icon tapper.',

Video game adaptations of anime are still, at there core, anime. Leave those out of these kinds of apps.',

Gear ratios and n02 pushezes and grip are all good but let\'s envelop.  I know I would play more if I could truly express my kickass whip that represents  me that I have to drive!  You have a clean and immersive game. Less is more.  Thank you',
       'Customer support has won me over. They have literally provided the best resolution can think of for the game removing all my fusion parts.

       'Best Drag racing game in Google play store. If you have a addictive personality don\'t play it. I do suffer from that first race was on Dec 312017 as of Feb 22, 2018 I have 208 hrs on the track 23 in the garage own 22 cars and spent over a Benjamin on it in less than a month. Ya gotta have some smarts to play and win. Money helps with extras. Only time I\'ve had a issue with it was this morning a season ended I was upgrading a Tier 5 car and paid with game money and didn\'t receive part. Still a 10 star game... Great job Developers!!',
       'Game is really great! Amazing graphics, amazing cars, lots of continuous fun! A few bugs and connection issues which can be frustrating at times especially when your team depends on you for points. Though I believe they\'ll eventually fix these issues as this is the BEST racing game out there and it\'s only getting BETTER!',
       'Love the new updates where you can carry on the trials without having to go back to the garage. It would be nice to able to trade up your keys i.e 500 bronze for 10 silver or 100 silver for 1 gold. And the stage 6 upgrades be not double up or get stage 6 upgrades relevant to the cars you have.',
       'I love this game! It\'s really addicting quick. Since it has an online feature, there is basically no end to how much fun you can have with it. I think it would be much better if you could add your own body upgrades. As in body kits, spoilers, etc. It would allow the players to have very personalized vehicles.' ],

It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven\'t bothered to update this in years.',
       'After only playing a few short but addicting levels, I am already having a blast! The game may not look spectacular on a technical level. But the gameplay is so freaking fun! And the controls aren\'t too complicated either. Recommended for everyone!',
       'It\'s a fun little game at first, but has many, many flaws. You have to link it to your Facebook account if you wanna play all maps. There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can\'t play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That\'s just ridiculous. Not to mention it\'s very buggy. Sometimes you\'re racing someone who\'s in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it\'s just stupid.',
       'Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you\'re racing friends.',

Also, I hate that everybody has auto sight and auto fire on, so that people cant enjoy that much fun because you basically just would get killed instantly just because of people who let the game play for them.',

I gave this game a 5 star rating cuz its sup awesome and also me and my brother play it at school if this had a 10 star rating you know i would give it a 10 star rating and also can you add a minigun and also i hope this game never dies and i hope to remember it when i grow up',

But pls do more like the balance beam and vault because this game is just right for me the cool thing about this is pretty much everything but pls do the balance beam and the vault becuase im liking this! All the features are really working well but when you spin the gymnast to get a little look it is like lagging😣 but i love this game totally 5 stars! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟! Who ever made this app its so great keep on the updates! And pls pls PLS tell me if theres an update of the balance beam and the vault!',

I\'m not trying to be mean but maybe there could be some other leotards and the update and some more hair dues because all of those buns and people may not like that\'s just buns people may want the braids that you always have in your other games. I mean the French braids and they keep going down into a braid, all those things would be nice!',

Some of the controls are a little difficult like the one where you have to tap 1 or tap 2 when she\'s practicing. And its fun. Some of it I like a lot."   This is from me, "the app is annoying until you buy it. It downloaded a ton of icons (ads for other games) to my picture gallery without informing me. My daughter likes the game a lot and it\'s fun, but a bit intrusive with the free version. The gameplay is good overall."',
       'It is the best game i ever had!!!...the reviews says ut has so many ads..i had just a simple solution: just turn off your wifi or mobile data..and then u can play this without an ad...the problem i am interfering was just the purchasing item..u have to buy ut first...welp...this is the best!!!',
       'I downloaded this game for my little sister and the first thing she said was that there are way too many adverts and I agree because whenever she clicked on say the dress up or nail salon or gym and adverts would always come up. The game also lags too much even though she has a brand new IPad. However at this time I would not recommend this game. My sister said that she would play the game again if you reduce and have a limited amount of adverts. As well as the advert problems the game keeps telling me to buy everything and it pops up every time I think when you press the \'X\' button it shouldn\'t show again. Please fix this now.

     [ 'Enjoyable game. Don\'t have to spend money on diamonds unless you\'re after a top look. Best played when linked to FB which means you can borrow from friends\' closets. Would rate 5 stars but recently I am having issues opening results in my in box. Every time I receive a result the page opens halfway then I have to exit the game and reload. Playing on an Asus ZenPad, anyone having the same issue or have a solution pls?',
       'I have been playing Covet for 4 yrs every single day! Being in the fashion industry I find it so interesting that the products you dress your models in are real items you can buy in real life. They have a great collection of brands but Im excited to see more.   And contrary to popular belief you dont have to spend a dime to play. My strategy for this is I play the daily challenge with either past seasonal clothes or i borrow from my fashion house. If your vision and outfit is great you will win the free item regardless of whether it is in season or not. By doing this you save $500 a day and i wait till a covet series comes along and play it till my heart and imagination is content.   Take it from a Covet junkie, you will be hooked for years!',
       'Loved the game when I first started to play. Beautiful clothes. Great model looks,  a LOT of fun. Until you get further in. Everything is so expensive and what you get for diamonds in a day is very little. It was disappointing to say the least. I had a few friends who played and could borrow from their closets but none of them play anymore. Probably for the same reason I am about to stop playing myself.Give better incentives and give better prizes and maybe I will play again. Bummed out, the game has great potential',
       'Great pass time and fun to play. For a while I do nothing just for the daily diamonds but I don\'t mind because the game is just overall fun to play! Maybe it would be better ifyou earned more cash for entering style challenges but... STILL FUN😉',
       'In the beginning, I absolutely loved this game, but now, I do admit that it get\'s a bit boring and frustrating after a while because getting cash and diamonds without paying real money is incredibly difficult and time consuming. I do like that they fixed the reaction time for voting because it used to be sooo slow. But overall, I highly recommend this game for any kind of fashion lover who is willing to have the patience to play it.',
       'They really just want your money. Can\'t try on multiple things at the same time, Rewards are pathetic for the challenge requirements being so high, levelling up takes ages , definitely not beginner friendly. Pretty to look at gets boring really quickly and can\'t be moved to SD storage, overall it gets more frustrating as you realise you can\'t afford anything and can\'t enter challenges.' ],

     [ 'Just updated the game to it latest version  like an hour ago it\'s having problems keeps on crashing in middle of a fight, it also crash sometimes when i open it. Please fix this issue.   Other then that the game is quite amazing wish it had more fighter\'s though hopefully in the next updates new fighters will be added in the game.',
       'They app wont even stay up and running the ammount of times the app crashes is insane. Controls wise its a pretty typical fighting game. Idk much past that sonce the app refuses to stay open. In its current state the game is unplayable. If theres any change then ill change my review but for now dont bother',
       'I\'d lost my progress in before the bug fix, even purchased the gems. But now started over. Game is smoother than before. The loading time, the packs opening time, also the time for matches could be trimmed. Also there should be the replay of finishing attack. On Snapdragon 835 adreno 540, it\'s really fluid fast. Sometimes the splash screen in the start freezes, and the screen smudges for a while till loading. Also if you are opening the dojo vault, and you get daily login gift. Both get stuck and not able to retrieve any. There should be tab for daily bonus and time remaining for next gift.',
       'Jst upset that cant give it a zero. The game is pretty good, and is interesting to play but after the latest update , that is v1.0.2 it keeps crashing and I\'ve to reopen it. Seriously dont provide updates if you guys are unable to make it worthwhile.',
       'Honestly, I am so tired of pay to win games, I downloaded this game and unistalled it minutes later. I would pay 10 bucks for this game for it to be like normal tekken. not this level up, skill, and wait to play for your fighters to get H.P back or spend money on health packs. Waste of space. I had such high hopes for this when I saw it :/ incredibly disappointed that such a good franchise would go pay to win.',

     [ 'Great solitaire game! If you want to play on and on, you need to buy extra credits, which I did because I could not wait+their CS is amazing!! Games are fun to play and challenging... You could still play without buying credits,,, it would just be slower. Highly recommended,! So grateful for fantastic customer service',
       'If you like solitaire you will hate this game. This isnt a game of skill or strategy. Its a sort of a matching game and it becomes clear quick that they are going to drain you of your seed currency quick so you can start spending real money. You will just pull card after card that you dont need.',
       'Its great game love that I don\'t need Wi-Fi to play it. But some of levels just get so impossible to beat you spend four day on one level. Make the crops pay out more and levels make them a bit easier make the challenges be the hard ones.',
       'Great game concept, great graphics, however it really sucks that the amount of coins required to play  increases too much and you don\'t get enough coins. I wish it didn\'t cost so much to play, it seems like they just want you to actually buy more coins. No thanks. Will be deleting.',
       'I really like the concept of this game. Unfortunately I am not prepared to even give it one star as it doesn\'t take you long to realize that the only aim from this game is to extract money from all who wish to play. Pitiful really as there are many similar games available which you don\'t have to feel pressure to buy',

Maybe there are too many characters on one board and server has difficulty tracking everyone.',

     [ 'It\'s nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it\'s not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It\'s just not fair.',
       'A lot of Numberlink programs have "fake" puzzles - they have multiple solutions unless additional non-standard "rules" are followed... which are NEVER fun. This app doesn\'t do that. These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.',
       'I have now completed a 365 day streak... During this past year of playing this game daily, I\'ve had an idea. What if once you hit a certain amount of streak days you unlock a new something? Like a new pack or flow color? That would be nice so that you are working towards something. :)',
       'I loved flow free from a young age. I\'ve played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I\'ve tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs',
       'Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.',
       'Fantastic game. Real addiction game I\'d say. It\'s an awesome time killer. Different types of levels never make the game boring. Graphics is okay. Number of ads for a free to play game is less compared to other games out in the market which is a relief.Overall I would give 4.5/5' ],

The only down side is that the spins cost alot of coins and those coins can be hard to earn. So 4.5 stars i would rate it is that was a option but its not so i rate it a a big fat 5',
       'I love this game a lot. The only problem is that when you do the Dailey spin, you only get like coins. And then with the coins you can buy another spin which is what I do. And I get even more coins. It\'s really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and',
       'this game is the bomb. it is stupid that they asked you is this game beautiful, of course not, people die, and crack their necks, backs, and shoulder blades. This game all in all soooooooo fun and you should totally get it. just say no if you want to write a reaport on this game because it will ask you is this game is beautiful which it is not. GOOD LUCK, good  night, new york city. at late night talk show with stephen colebert......jk',
       'Would rate give starts, but the amount of ads is absolutely ridiculous. I\'m actually thinking about uninstalling please fix that. I know you want players to pay but in all actuality, it\'s quite stupid. Anyway, I do believe the game is quite fun',
       'I  am still going to keep this game but it definitely need a new update like Flip Master which is way better. On Flip Master you can upgrade your characters  So they are better and have more skill but on here they stay the same. The last time I got the game it was fun but this time the characters are stiff and you can hardly do any flips. Definitely keeping Flip Master as my favourite!  Fun game for people who: Want to mess around Need a game that doesn\'t take to much skill Need a game to to pass five minutes  Everyone who likes this game should definitely get Flip Master because overall it is so much better! Hope my advice helped for future updates',

     [ 'I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there\'s only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can\'t beat them! Keep making more awesome games!',
       'This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn\'t always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing',
       'I can\'t help but love a mobile game that doesn\'t constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it\'s tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.',
       'I really like the game. But there\'s one thing that annoys me: when I don\'t play this game for a few hours and then I do another battle in dungeon, the game crashes after killing last monster in that battle.  I found out that if I switch on mobile data it works. So I wanted to asked why is that. EDIT: now all works just fine. 5 stars',
       'Gameplay isn\'t disrupted by ads unless you want some free coins once and awhile. They aren\'t throwing the loot boxes in your face either.  The coins per hour/minute seems to be while playing only. Not sure if that\'s a glitch or how it is meant to be.',

       'As football based game it is superb, in terms of gameplay, graphics etc. But the biggest idiotic part of this game is that if freezes like magic. The whole game main screen becomes unresponsive and stays like that no matters the game is restarted or the damn phone is. Get this thing sorted out Miniclip. You have a reputation to maintain or not?',

Best move I ever made for an app! This game is just flat out addicting, fun and challenging.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much fun it is and that there is, most of the time, something new.  Chalkenign friends and new people always makes for a challenging and fun time waster. Even if I don\'t have the time to play, I still make time!! Haha',

It says it failed because I would not allow them access to my friends list. Something doesn\'t seem right about that. Never had a game NOT allow me to login, after denying access to my friends list. Sorry, would prefer you not send messages to all my friends with my name tagged on it.',

     [ 'I never had to pay a single cent for this game, and it\'s working out perfectly fine for me. Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don\'t like my non-responsive faction members and I\'m worried once I leave my faction I couldn\'t join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.',
       'Game is really good! Currently level 10 & I am doing pretty good. (For what I think) It\'s a fun game to play you can get free coins which makes it more fun and fair for players that can\'t pay for anything, except patience. I do wish it\'ll be easier to level up characters. But it\'s pretty easy. Just so difficult to get more characters to pay for level ups.',
       'This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn\'t make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!',
       'Awesome game based on the comics. The only set back is that I can\'t seem to be able to download the content for the third chapter on the story map. It goes so far into the download and then stops.   I have already uninstalled and reinstalled the game three times. And I have even deleted unused/unwanted files from my phone to free up some extra space, and it hasn\'t made any difference.   I don\'t know what else I can do.',
       'Do not waste your time and/or money on this game. Scopely has presented you with a pay to win nightmare. Only the top 2% of spenders get catered to in terms of toons and weapons, and top factions band together to destroy the experience for everyone else. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!',
       'No one from the support team will respond. My game was unistalled and reinstall and I lost 2 years worth of data. Can\'t remember sync it and I know scopely can do it for me. I\'ve provided everything they need and still nothing via email or in-game support. Will change my rating if this is sorted' ],

Please fix this as soon as possible because I really enjoy this game.',

If you need help in any of those subjects (or you just like a bit of fun ) I would dwfinately say this is the game for you.',

THIS game, however, has only ONE ad at the start of each game, and allows you to mute the sound "once" for all future ads. It\'s simple to click the ad off before the game commences. *wink* The background is lovely and the graphics are wonderful! So relaxing. The happy little "card dance" animation after each win is nice, as well. Thank You!',

I listen to a lot of music, all the time and if this app can\'t work my life, I can\'t work with this app.  Also too many adds.  I understand that some one needs to pay for the development and what not... Just make me buy the damn app.',

Awesome😒 Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don\'t reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie\'s handling. You killed it, literally. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.',
       'Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I\'ve never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.',

The final upgrades for the fourth car on all sets are far too expensive. It requires an insane amount of grinding to unlock the last cars. The prices of supercharged upgrades are all over the place. Why do all of Haulinator\'s cost 100 coins while Dune It Up\'s cost 1000-2000?',

If my son was able to lose his progress and the money we sunk in the game because he was using multiple devices and didn\'t know what Cloud and Local meant which cause him to lose his progress then mabe this game shouldn\'t be labeled E for Everyone. Change the rating to Teen if they have to know what cloud means or risk losing there in app purchases.  Google change the rating on this game.',

     [ 'I hate this game cause one, you can\'t even change the decorations or visitors. Two, you can\'t even get coins for completing a level and the daily wheel is rigged cause you can\'t get anything good. Three, if you watch a video for a reward or life, it never gives you anything. And four, they don\'t give you enough moves for each level, there are too many ads and everything\'s so overpriced. Hate this bullcrap game😡',
       'A great game, but WAAAAY  too many ads. Its the same thing after each level: AN AD. The game is fun, but its hard to enjoy when you\'re watching ads every second. And Im getting the same ads over and over! I want to rate five stars, I really do, but I cant if there\'s going to be this many ads in a game I think everyone would enjoy. 💛💛💛💛♡ (( pretend the hearts are stars )) I\'ll download the game again once I see less ads in your games, like My Talking Angela, which also has way too many ads. Please take this into consideration! Thank you!',
       'I am so disappointed in this game due to the fact my 3 year old somehow bypassed my password and spent 79.99 on coins!!! I sent a message immediately to Google play and the developer and I was told it doesn\'t meet the refund requirements. WTH?!! So frustrating! 😡',
       'This game would be a whole lot of fun IF there weren\'t so many ads! My niece is not patient enough to wait for stupid ads to finish, and u can\'t play the game until the ad is finished! Very disappointed!',
       'Love this game. Super fun but how do you get rid of ads? I paid for coins yet i still have ads. This is highly annoying especially if i can\'t skip them. Still love the game just not the ads :(',
       'Ahh I think it\'s a pretty good game. This is the 1 st time I\'m giving my review. I loved the game.I\'m.now in lvl 179 this game is fantastic but the lvl r so hard as we increase our lvl. This game have a good graphics, game, control n plz make more this kind of games' ],

     [ 'I love Beat the Boss 4! But there are some things that I would like to be fixed. For example, when naming your custom boss, the name duplicates. The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can\'t go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.',
       'Game is now unplayable due to ads and KIIP rewards popups. The ads bring up my status bar so I can\'t X out of the ad, and the app hangs when trying to load the KIIP program. I have no interest in trying to play something that shovels ads in your face more often than you can actually play.',
       'I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i\'m asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting',
       'I really love this app it is so fun to play but there is a glitch that happened to me and my brother when we were playing, the friend thing didn\'t work and we were logged into our accounts and the loading screen was just black outlines and Joe\'s face. I\'m pretty sure it didn\'t load like that before but over all, 5 stars! Have a good day/Night!',
       'I\'d happily purchase this game but that doesn\'t seem like an option. Tge ads, especially the LOUD BLOW UP EXPLOSIONS game that go on for 30 seconds are especially annoying. I\'ll gladly buy it, if only to not deal with Fing ads all the Fing time!!',
       'Seems to be quite a few issues with many of the weapons causing either major lag or strange bugs, like two bosses or a second mini-boss. I miss being able to ragdoll the boss around the room and throw them against walls, in this version it seems to do little damage if any at all. Playing an ad after everytime the boss dies quickly becomes irritating.' ],

       'Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it\'s only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that\'s bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it\'s a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I\'ll rate 5 star$',
       'Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn\'t really feel like you\'re getting anywhere.',
       'For a shoot \'em up racing android game it\'s really addictive. I\'m always playing it. It\'s fun. My only complaint is the time it takes for the fuel to charge, 30 mins? Come on! Otherwise very challenging. Challenge accepted!',
       'For as repetitive as it is I can\'t seem to put it down, it\'s seriously addictive. Maybe it\'s the great graphics or the fact it reminds me of one of my old favs arcade game  Spyhunter. A few small things I would fix are; needs a running diamond total during race to see how many you\'ve picked up. A better garage showing a side angle of your car so you can see the paint jobs and rims better and the most needed item is when you click on your profile pick there NEEDS to be a experience total! Just having the circle showing your experience isn\'t enough, I\'d like an actual number total. Also another mode to think about is maybe a side scrolling mode or overhead track mode like Grand Prix 2. All in all great graphics, music and replayability!',
       'Money trap. They don\'t even offer the option to watch videos to recharge the fuel to be able to play. So unless you spend money on this game you\'ll be stuck and having to wait hours to be able to play again. Such a shame given the game is so much fun.

     [ 'Dear EA Sports: We really want to get the icon Ronaldinho but its changed and its very hard. Before we were required to have an 89 ovr+ team with atleast 5 Brazilian players but now it has completely changed. Now we are required to have a 98 ovr+ team with atleast 6 Brazilian players. I hope you make the icons a bit more easier. Thanks☺',
       'Fut can not be developed with this building team. Football is one of the most attractive games but how this fut goes? In Vs attack mode, what the hell meaning do chances have? Players must creat chances by themselves not the game. You must let them play whole game and create the chances by themselves. EA is a big builder in football games and develop a lot but have you ever thought how your fut only stands at this place?',
       'The game is nice for every football fan.... Nice controls and good graphics...events are awesome... There r different game modes.. the only thing that I don\'t like after the recent update is that while playing campaign mode there are many stages which requires u to be in certain lvl in VS mode.... I think both the modes should be independent.. otherwise it\'s a fabulous game... The most awesome football game in play store right now.',
       'overall its an awesome game great experience. but Its hard for free to play players to complete and go through the events..... the icons are too difficult to get please make them a bit earlier to get, it will be awesome to have them in the team.... its difficult to get elite players in a pack of 500 fp totw pack n few others packs too... the vs attack mode is great.... EA please make sure that the free to play players to get a good experience of getting new and better players....',
       'Very good game , addictive..I love to play this game.. Events are fun.. But not at all happy with the team hero, if you play for 3 month also you won\'t be able to proceed further.. Very very slow process, icons are very much hard to get It will be much better if individual player stats added like goals, passes. It will be more fun if you guys fix it',
       'Fifa mobile is a soccer game that lets you be a manager and manage the best team. This game have well made graphics and gameplay. The events are fun, campaigns are exciting and attack vs attack are addicting but, no games are perfect in this case it is hard for free to player to complete the team hero event and daily microtransaction are needed. I hope EA will adress this issue.' ],

First, if you could upgrade the cars more and you didn\'t have to use the cards. Like us money to upgrade engine parts, buy body kits, etc. And there\'s some kind of a sound glitch. The sound stays on for just a few races and then all of a sudden it stops working but I can still play the game.' ],

Please reply or just update. Thank you.',
       'Great game to pass time. Adverts are frustrating but necessary unless you want to pay to stop, BUT very annoying when they pop up as you just lifted a puzzle piece and because of advert it just drops randomly. Also being able to rotate pieces would be handy, granted not as challenging however.',
       'Your English is so bad it is insulting.    You need to hire someone to proof read before you post requests for ratings.  A definite turn off to the game which is actually quite fun and challenging.    Requires strategic planning.',

       'My absolute all time favorite game! I used to have the woodblock version and would play that one ALL the time. The only thing I didn\'t like about it was that I couldn\'t get anything higher than 300 most of the time for the score, no matter what I did. The only time I did was the first time I installed it and played, I easily reached 1,500 points, but anytime I played after I could never come anywhere close, so I decided to look for a different game with the same concept and found this one. Instantly loved it! It\'s got more block room (so easier to get more points), love the sound effects, I don\'t feel cheated or set up like the other one, and it\'s a good way to get your mind working if you\'re someone like me who likes to think it through and plans for future possible block pieces c: plus the colors and looks is a bonus!^-^',
       'My four year old likes it and I feel like it helps him on making decisions. I can actually see him thinking what going to be him next move. I like this game and I love playing with my son. Only thing I hate is that it does have to many ads 😒' ],

     [ 'I really enjoy this game, but I have found a flaw in the design. The game speeds up as you go and after a point it doesn\'t go faster, but after around 10,000 you notice the ball start to move forward on the screen and after about 20,000 you don\'t even have to move the ball to not die. It just misses the spikes. I know you might be thinking Its not on the leaderboards, but that\'s my next complaint. Im currently 6 on the leaderboards, but I\'ve gotten a better score and it won\'t update. I quite frankly destroyed that score and it doesn\'t show up. Thank you for your time and I hope this helped',
       'I HATE the vibration when u die I almost uninstalled the app bcuz of that. I also have a problem with pop up ads. I really like the game though',
       'Game is great, far too many ads, after each level AND major issues with the videos giving rewards. I watched 4 and only received 1 reward which makes the game unfair and not worth playing.',
       'Fun game, but occasionally an ad will pop up while I\'m playing, causing me to mess up and die. I was having a really great run when an ad popped up. Not cool.',
       'I think this game is very addictive. To all the people that say u have to many adds well i dont i can actually play the game without getting interrupted',
       'Defiently would recommend this to everyone i only have one complaint im trying to play games during the night and have fun and i like this game so addictive but it makes a vibrate sound everytime i die if u could remove that sound i would give this app a 5 star' ],

     [ 'I\'m really fond of this game and love the gameplay and quick paced matches. The new update is AMAZING!   There are a few things that would make this game extra perfect for me!   Must have character customisation. This would be of big amazing to me. Char customisation makes me bind more to certain characters. The rings we get don\'t have much value to them except for upgrading the characters.  Could have non-ranked matches. I would love the option to play/practice against rivals or my own friends.   Should have quick chat responses. Would like to communicate before and after the match with simple reactions. Like Good luck and I win, tee-hee!',
       'This is one of the best mobile games I have played I a while. I probobly have a bias sense I love Sonic so much. However, if one thing could be added I would say it should be a converter for the Red Star rings to normal rings. Unless you want them to be payed for. I don\'t really care either way I\'ll just buy the Red Star rings but I brought up that idea because I currently have 23,000 rings just kinda waiting to be spent. Maybe incorporate phone backgrounds or some customizations for the game that cost extra rings? Thankyou so much for the new update and if anyone I\'d debating on installing it just get it. You\'ll have fun, trust me.',
       'To many ads unless you make some kind of purchase. Loading screens seem to take longer than I\'d like. You can\'t at this time play with friends as Opponents are automatically chosen. There is still some characters ability noise in the game even if you have music and sound off. I\'d like to see characters abilities not to be so similar, but it isn\'t taking away from the game at the moment for me. With all that said though the graphics are great, the game is fun, and it\'s worth the $1.99 purchase I made.',
       'A fun premise ruined by a horrendous match making system,  ridiculous  unlocking time gates, and obvious pay to win incentives.  You\'ll be constantly matched with players with levels far higher than your own and the rewards are minimal for the all the effort.  The constant ads that play after every match is beyond irritating.',
       'This game is if Sonic Dash mixed with Racing. And I LOVE IT!!! One suggestion I have that I don\'t think many online multiplayer games have, add some sort of singleplayer mode. Otherwise, great game! I like that it\'s free with ads being removable via in game purchases (which I did), controls, graphics, and soundtrack are outstanding, overall, I love the game, and I look forward to more updates in the future.',
       'Love the game, but there\'s something wrong.. Well... I think Cream is kinda rigged. Her items are a bit OP for the other players which makes it an easy stage into a extremely hard stage. And also, the deduction of trophies in 4th place is too much! Please make it lower (like maybe at around 5 or 8) and change the deduction of trophies in 3rd place 0 (These are all just suggestions I have). If you read this SEGA, your games are great and keep up the good work!' ],

     [ 'AMAZING! The graphics are stunning and the story lines are so good! Just 2 things I would improve to make the game even better:      •Less time to wait for more keys (4 hours is quite long).      •The diamond cost is really high considering the fact we get one diamond after every story chapter we play and having to wait so long for keys.  Other than that...AMAZING JOB WELL DONE!',
       'The stories are great but to enjoy them properly, you have to spend diamonds. Free diamonds at the beginning is way too less (25 diamonds). And you earn 1 diamond per chapter, which is less because to make premium choices you have to spend so much more diamonds (min. 12 diamonds for a choice). And you have to make at least one premium choice per chapter. Buying the diamonds is way too expensive. I think the developers should allow users to earn more diamonds in the game. Maybe make them watch a video to earn free diamonds. That would certainly help...',
       'Really fun but I wish you gave us more than 2 keys. I\'m not going to spend actual money on a short story but I\'m sure a lot of others will, which is great for you but I think 2 keys is a little low since there are numerous chapters to play and many stories to choose from. Would be cool if you would match most other games and give us 5 keys for gameplay.',
       'Love the story lines, the graphics, all of it. Would have liked to seen something that can be done to regenerate the diamonds or do something to earn more diamonds other than finishing a new chapter earns you only one. Did experience my diamonds disappearing and the timer of keys along with the keys reach zero and not returning. Hope this issue will be resolved. Other than these issues really enjoyed the game, it\'s highly addictive.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a few days, so here\'s my review. I enjoy the stories even though they use a lot of archetypes, and I don\'t mind waiting for keys. The biggest issue I have is with the gems and premium choices: not only do the premium choices cost an unreasonably high amount of gems, but every time there are choice options with at least one premium choice, the premium choices are always presented as the better ones. This is less like making my own choices and more like reaffirming my assumption that the premium choices are always the better ones. I\'ve come to the conclusion that I would rather pay once to have this app installed rather than install it for free and pay money for gems just so I could pick the premium choices.',
       'i really love this game. but all of my saved games are gone and u still hasn\'t respond to my message. although i\'ve bought diamonds so many times. can u retrieve my account? \'cause i used the same one but now it\'s just all gone. and for the game i don\'t mind waiting 2 hours to get keys but i don\'t want to always spend my diamonds when it\'s so hard to get. like, we\'re just playing 1 chap and we only get 1 diamond, but we have to spend 20/25/30 to just pick one choice? like, what? i have to play 25 chap first just so i can choose 1 answer? and when i restart a story, we don\'t get a diamonds at all? but we have to spend 1 key to play it again? i think it isn\'t fair. \'cause i played all of the stories, and i need a diamonds but i don\'t get a diamonds when i restart a stories. please, make it easier for us who really loved this game to get diamonds. i really like this game tho. amazing script, amazing scene. i\'m giving u 2 \'cause i really wanted to play this game again but my saved in my account\'s all gone.' ],

       'Way too many advertisements. I actually downloaded this game because subway surfer makes start over everytime you download it but after my next tech upgrade I\'m going back to that, atleast the game not flooded with ads.',
       'Ads are back. I paid for a red ring bundle, which did remove them for a while, but they\'re back. The only reason I made a real purchase was so that I wouldn\'t have ads, so can someone please remove the ads from my account. On another note, I really like this, and nice to see Shadow playable again.',
       'The responsiveness of the controls I  this game make it unplayable... it\'s slightly more responsive than the original sonic dash but it\'s still no where near good enough for such a fast paced game.  I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it\'s the same on all of them',
       'I would give it 5 stars, I made an in app purchase to remove ads, but after the game updated non Sega ads started showing again and it asked me to make another purchase in order to remove the non Sega ads AGAIN... love the game, hate the ads...',
       'The game is great but the ads are so intrusive, immersion-breaking, and so annoying that I\'m giving the game 3 stars. Please, I understand that ads are necessary to make money for a free game but make it so that they are not so persistent that an ad automatically opens after a single run. A shame really, this would be such a great game if this would be fixed.' ],

     [ 'If you\'ve liked the first game you\'re probably gonna enjoy this one. It\'s more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it\'s built around microtransactions so if you\'re feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don\'t understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it\'s likely you\'re going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren\'t aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don\'t expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!',
       'I love this game! One thing though, I believe that there are too many plants that cost real money to get. Could you please make some more plants that you can get them by being able to unlock them by playing the game, instead of ones where you have to use real money. Besides that, this is a really great game!',
       'Free to play games are always the same formula: Starts off addictive, gets more challenging, starts encouraging you to buy gem equivalent, forces you to buy gem equivalent. At least most other games are fair with it though, giving you a chance. PVZ 2 does not. Levels go quickly from fun to I\'m done, and become impossible. I\'d love to see developers or game testers try to complete later levels without gems, especially Big Wave Beach. It\'s a shame, as the first game remains a classic. Buy the first game and Garden Warfare if you like it. Leaf this game alone, it\'s a sprout at best. Oh and remember, if zombies try to break into your house, throw your money at them.',
       'Love this game so much! I am a huge PVZ fan anyway and I love playing this. You do need some boosters to get past levels, which feels a bit like cheating sometimes, but you can earn plenty of coins. There is always a new quest to play so even when I\'m stuck on the other levels I can still play. This is a great game, well done devs!',

On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.',

     [ 'I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance',
       'Great simple game with AMAZING colours❤ I love this...dead simple and fun. It took me ages to work out how to unlock the new skins...click on the banner that has the amount of diamonds you\'ve collected and what looks like 3 sheets on top of one another  (it comes up before you press the start key...)',
       'A Great Game For When You\'re Dumpin\'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin\' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I\'m in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren\'t too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I\'m happy to say that. I don\'t like to stay too long. Great game!',
       'So,  basically it\'s a pretty fun app to play when you\'re bored. It\'s a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It\'s a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don\'t really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!',
       'Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn\'t have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic.',
       'Good, with a major flaw I\'ve ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I\'ll tap, and the game won\'t register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I\'m on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I\'ve closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It\'s an issue I\'d like to see fixed.' ],

It\'s pretty quick to load back so it\'s still playable but it\'s definitely frustrating to have the restart the app constantly. One Plus 3',

Only one thing is not there, once you complete a level, you can\'t play that level again. It\'s a humble request to the developers that there should be a feature of playing previously played levels.',

       'There are far too many ads in game that you have to deal with, and game limitations basically force you to purchase stuff in order to even approach something resembling actual progress. What makes things worse is that there really isn\'t much of an actual game to be played here, just spin once, wait for the ad, spin again, wait for an ad, repeat until you uninstall the game permanently. I\'d only recommend this game to someone looking for an actively painful experience.',
       'The amount of ads is truly ridiculous. And if you intend to actually make any money at all with this game you will have to play for probably over a year to make 1 dollar. don\'t waste your time',

     [ 'I know a lot of people seem to not like this game but I actually really enjoy it the only thing I don\'t like is the lack of sound.   It would be nice if there was background music of some kind and a glass breaking sound effect when you went through each barrier something pleasing to the ears  Oh and shorter ads would also probably be good.  It could also use more roads and balls and barriers to work towards. I feel like this game has a lot of potential though hope it keeps being updated.',
       'This is a very addictive game. I don\'t understand why people don\'t like it. Fast paced. As for the adds, you people should turn your internet off and play. It will help.. ##VOODOO## Would you accept a video from me? You can use it for advertising purposes. I thought it might be of great help for you.  Please get back to me by replying. I would be happy to email the video to you..',
       'The game is a challenge within itself. I normally prefer to play game games that are satisfactory. But this game is very wonderful. As it comprisses of a rolling ball that is running over  an uneven path. So basically there can be competition between the bro who travelled the most distance. It also requires a good solid attention power along with patience.. So i would say its anice game. As of gameplay the is no ending or starting in the game it directly starts and that makes it more interesting. But at the same time also boring. But i would say that if u download this game u will definitely uninstall it after almost a month. Good game and waiting for an update ✌️',
       'Maybe you could add coins, for example each gate you go through could +1 Coin and you need like 290 Coins to upgrade your airtime by a few seconds or milliseconds, although the sound is not very good due to no sound at all. Very good game although!',
       'The game is fine. But OMG the ads....they make you watch an ad every few seconds until you pay for the premium version. This is just sick. I mean games do have ads but the number of ads in this game are unbearable. Very frustrating . So if you are looking for a free game THIS IS NOT IT.',
       'Hey Developer! This is Great Job!. But, if there are other players who have the disease "Afraid of Heights", this game will not be suitable for him. You make players Cringe (Afraid), because there is no music. This game like a Dark Theme Games.' ],

     [ 'I have only had this game for a few days, so I can\'t write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it\'s up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.',
       'Man i love this game!!! So much better than wolfquest!!! I do hope tht this game soon be added new things like more animal to play as, better in performance. The ad free guys...keep it up!!! Just wondering if there\'s a add as mate system in multiplayer in the future? Anyways....this is the best wolf game tht i played!!! Do hope tht you guys one day add more animals to play as (like a snow leopard for example)',
       'Love it but pleeeeeaaaase make it possible to play as a boar or a rabbit or deer. Also I think it would be really nice to have a hunger and thirst bar because there is no real point in drinking. That way if you dont have enough food or water you start to lose health.  Also I don\'t think we really need stamina from the food we eat.  These are just suggestions but I really really love this game.  Best simulator out there.',
       'It just lags now. The new update made it to where my chat, my character, and my animations won\'t work. I run about as fast as a turtle, and I am not pregnant. Please fix!!!! I love this game. I have a few questions if you don\'t mind... Can you guys add in multi-player mode, like single player mode, that we can pick up our pups, it would be cool to add that option in the top left menu. Thank you guys so much!! Love the games!!',
       'Most realistic wolf sim I have found out there, with the ability to get a mate, have cubs and your own den in which you can invite players into. There are also multiplayer game servers and an ability to create your own public or private game. You can also play as a wolf, fox or lynx and customize eyes, pelts and add masks/hats and scars/clothing. Its just AMAZING! Also saying that you don\'t have to pay to play and in-game currency is easy to get.',
       'On one of the quest, I think 11. There ia a syrange new animal and I went to the game menu for information and there wasn\'t any. It looks like a brown rabbit, I tried killing Rabbits squirrels and deer, but It wasn\'t the right animal! Is it in the snow biome?  Anyways hope you can help me and otger quest 11 users. It\'ll be great that when you get the same animal twice it counts as duplicate. For example "Wolf Common Duplicate +(however acorns). Thanks and the update is great!' ],

     [ 'Was an awesome game Very addictive game! Was well done.. until the update. Needs more pens and new themes as I have thousands of coins but nothing left to unlock. Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don\'t register as pineapple hits for the counters. There\'s a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it',
       'Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.',
       'Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.',
       'Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.',
       'BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn\'t have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What\'s bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I\'m not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game.',

     [ 'Really liked this when I first started playing. Honestly,there is no point me keeping it now. Can\'t perform my operations,as don\'t have bought staff and ward not on the appropriate level. I can\'t get any new staff,as I don\'t have enough hearts,and once you are at a standstill like this it take FOREVER to earn hearts back. Have loads of cash but nothing to do with it!! Game seems to be designed around getting people hooked initially (as performing operations etc is really fun), but then can\'t continue or progress without purchasing hearts!! Not wasting my time with it any longer.',
       'Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I\'ll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx',
       'Your new update will not let me, or several people it looks like,  get into the game. I am currently doing the 12 day event and am on level 17 please fix it ASAP! I refuse to lose all my progress. This is the best game I\'ve had on my phone in a very long time.',
       'I\'ve played this game a few days now, all of a sudden it freezes and crashes. This file has corrupted my new SD card, has uninstalled it\'s self along with any memory on my sd card.... I even downloaded it again as I expected everything is gone... Gone! Great game just not worth the bugs!',
       'Awesome game but fix recruitment. I keep doing gold recruitment and i have almost all the characters but I only have 5 doctors. I keep getting duplucates. It is like it will not give me a new doctor. You should be able to choose whether you are purchasing a doctor, nurse, surgeon, etc. It is not fair always getting nurses. Thanks. Oh, p.s. I have spent a bunch of money. This game is addictive and hearts should be more readily available.',
       'I will give 4 stars to the game out of 5. It\'s a pretty good game among the others. But the main problem is that I can\'t unlock more departments even if I have money or hearts. I am on 29th level and have a good amount of cash but the departments are locked. So a bit disappointed. Please fix this...' ],

I highly recommend getting the starter pack bundle for $1.99 USD if you think you are going to keep playing. It\'s a one time offer that goes away after 24 hours. It includes a sniper rifle that does triple the damage that the starter sniper does, as well as 250k cash and 100 gold and a ton of tokens.',

And why do you Have to watch an ad to get free revives, get some tokens, refill the Battery for the special Mission and to open the green and blue prize pod AND to Double bananas you collect? GREAT GAME I JUST HATE THE ADS.',
       'I have a Xiaomi Redmi 4 mobile with 3 GB RAM, 1.4 GHz Octa Core. Still Game hangs, Speed enhanced with a jerk every time and then it dies. I have reset my mobile and reinstalled it but the problem still there. It\'s very annoying. Otherwise I love this game. It\'s very addictive.',
       'The game used to be fun, but not anymore.  More than that, after i did a factory reset on my phone, I\'ve reinstalled the game, but surprise... I couldn\'t sync the game to my Google account. All my progress in game was lost. All the money invested in this game was lost. I have sent them emails, tickets about it but no answer what so ever. The result is ---&gt; uninstall',
       'I like this game but there\'s so much cheating going on. It doesn\'t resister some of the moves you make or it\'s lagging and when you smash the minions they should fly away and not stick to the screen for ten seconds so you can\'t see what\'s coming next. Just stop cheating! Don\'t take 20hours to give the necessary tools when doing a double task in the jelly lab.',
       'This game is awesome and funny I guess. I\'m trying to think of something to complain about (I love complaining) but I can\'t!! Oh wait........... You could make things like characters and stuff less expensive. It\'s  Ike....I go on SHOP and it says stuff like (random minion) 1234 tokens!!  Dats 2many bro!',

       '"Not Addictive" A typical scam game which you can tell just by looking at in game item costs. 0.99-$95 per item. Every scam game has those same prices. Like 99% of mobile games, its a super expensive pay to play scam. It also completely sucks otherwise.',
       'One of the best FPS on android. Take it from a guy who\'s played more than a hundred. If you love fps and you love killing zombies, have to try the game. If only there were no limiters such as fuel, (when they already have crate systems to earn money) I would say it was perfect.',
       'Great game both as a concept and its graphics. The only problem is the lack of energy. You only have energy for like 6-7 battles and then you have to wait or use gold. Make it at least 10 battles at low levels and keep increasing it.',
       'I love this game but apart from 3 gold, 500 money and 1 hero and 1 weapon crates, I never get any other in the casino spin even though I\'ve been playing with gold. Used around 170 gold just to spin and did not even get any other. Kind of pissed off actually but still playing.',
       'Energy goes way too fast. You can spend it all in a matter of a few minutes. Rewards feel miniscule compared to other games. Grenade recharge is too long when early missions require it for objectives. Game has potential but I can\'t recommend it right now as it barely qualifies as playable when energy depletes so fast' ],

     [ 'This so freaking awesome, a woo hoo maker! I kept mumbling awesome, awesome, when i passed a car. And this is first time i\'m very exited when i managed to finish a level, even after that, i repeat again till i can surpass it perfectly. Even i haven\'t sleep for 2 days, felt like an alien or zombie, etc. But this game cheers me up alot. Recommended ? Yes! Good job dev, just download it guys. Lu pasti hepi dah! Keren!',
       'Wow... as I was writing this review it suddenly all disappeared as it said unfortunately traffic rider has stopped. Wow.. nice. I cannot even open the game without freezing up my tablet. Real nice. And tbh I love this game! On my phone it works..... 😥😣😈👹',
       'Pretty cool..It was actually a little more than i expected.  The bikes are cool. They seem to be modeled after actual bikes, but perhaps didnt want to pay 4 the licensing to use actual manufacturer names.',
       'One of the best motorcycle game to date, weather conditions are great, bikes are great and handling is great, but the bad ai on higher difficulty level a few times are ridiculous and messes up everything.  Sometimes a truck speeds up to 150km/h just to close off that small gap, where you could slip through, but next time all cars in all lane slow down at once, so you can\'t pass anywhere, even though there\'s nothing in front of them. This is really annoying, when every second counts and there\'s no way to pass them for 4-7 seconds. Apart from this the game is great. The keep changing weather conditions is great too.',
       'Gave one star less because the missons lack mathematical accuracy There was this level to travel 8 kms in 130s and it was showing it an easy mission with a bike of top speed 172 kph 😂 The graphics and gameplay are superb I like the game',
       'There are some idiot missions such as combo overheading. I would give this game 5 stars if not those missions.' ],

     [ 'This is an updated comment. I already loved the game just thought it needed better controls. Have to say after the update I gave it a perfect score. It\'s sleek smooth and just all around fun. It\'s very clear they took consumer complaints into consideration and it\'s good to see. Highly recommend if you love GOT and these style of games. Only negative is the farther you advance into the game the more I get the feel of a page of wind kind of situation which is sad but it\'s still worth it.',
       'The game is super sluggish gets very annoying. The rss are way to low and not able to be gotten and when you do farm you get almost nothing total waste of time. There needs to be a system to see where\'re you and your guild ranks in your world.and the basic rss your own keep gives you are way to low for a game of this type 12 hours should not produce only 6k wood at lvl 20',
       'Had issues as of 22/02/18 again. World and War room access constantly loading. Before then, the tool bar on the right flashing and lagging. Since update at 18:00 on 22/02/18 have not been able to log back on. I have submitted tickets about this issue before and the reply via email is that the ticket has been closed. Go to support via website and forum and tired every step and more. No help.',

       'Game glitches constantly. People in k63 are using bots to cheat. WB won\'t do anything about the cheating! Forces people to spend huge sums of real money to be able to gain power to play the game. Features are placed in the game but not active; some are no longer listed as "under development" but still don\'t work. Game should have undergone a lot more work before being released. Upgrade requirements for resources are impossible to meet without buying them. Resource nodes only go up to 130k and requirements for upgrades are in the millions. Poor to little planning went into this game.',
       'I\'m very sad with how close this game to being a great game, and then.... its just another oh to win... I tried so hard to stay active and fight but in the end you cannot fight people pumping 500$ into the game opening week.  The absolute worst part for me is they promote pay to win more than any other rtg. Pay for win packs during kill events which make normal people just farms. They could have built a great game. But the 1 million downloads you see are just GoT fans trying it out. There are no more than a few thousand people on. Already massive dead servers.' ],

A neighbour of mine has also paid £1.79 but still having to watch 30 second videos, she is 75years. I have looked through the reviews & I have found numerous other people who are complaining about paying money for nothing. A few have even mentioned the word ripoff. How right they are. Still waiting to see if the Play Store replies to my email, for I sent 3 emails to the developers without reply.

The program component can be a standard score from the AI judges yet will be under review by fans (other players who can add to the overall score, max 4 points only). Lastly, there should be a season that features state, regional, national, world, and finally olympic competition based on the current judging system for the short program and free skate [150-164 meh, 165-174 is okay, 175-189 is very good, 190-199 is excellent, and 200+ is "strictly Russian" (Weir, NBC 2018 Winter Olympics)]!

       'So It\'s a good game and all but after I reached 1687 fans my coach keeps saying after each round "let\'s make me the best skater ever!" Shouldn\'t it be changing up? And also should it be me saying that instead of the coach??',

       'LOVE this game!! Literally, I don\'t think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it\'s just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜',
       'this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates',
       'Yes really great and addictive game. Whats with the hints? The great challenge is to work out how to do it without the hints. You lie awake at night trying to think of new ways and have to get up early to try something you havent tried before..',
       'A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it\'s really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it.',
       'The game is addictive. Mediocre ratings are because there is a bug. On all games on all levels I\'m getting a network error and I\'m not connected to a network viewing a hint. I have been connected to numerous networks and reset the phone. This needs to be sorted.' ],

For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....',
       'Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!',

It\'s less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed.',

     [ 'A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it\'s a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you\'ve done them and reached level 10 on both, there\'s really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.',
       'Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON\'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!',
       'The game itself is awesome, really awesome. But my god, there is too many ads, It is okay to have ads in a free game, I totally understand, the dev has worked to build a game so it is fair to receive money back for the work.  But here there are too many ads, there is ad in game, there is ad when you lose a match and there are the famous win coins for watching a video.  Couldn\'t find an option to buy the game and remove the ads, hope the developer improve this, because the is really awesome...',
       'Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I\'ve basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I\'ve got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.',
       'Be cool if there is boosts. Example if you get 3 perfect you get a free auto perfect boost or something. Also plz add a line of code to stop people from the date/time bug abuse - save current time to file. Player won\'t get money till that last input time has passed.  Also be cool to spend the coins on boosts',
       'Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot\'s more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn\'t bother me that much. 5 stars for the team' ],

Ill be getting up a good tapping speed and it will jist ruin it by popping up with no option to click off. If i want to explore the game further, i will, at my own pace. I dont need you to hold my hand. Its really spammy and ruining the game play. Tutorial based gaming is a waste and a headache. Also its laggy. Please fix this. I LOVE this game and i want to play but the spammy monkey is a deal breaker.  Rant over',

       'I like the game very much. I bought the starter pack for a dollar 99 and removed ads. After the update came out, the one that and the ability to watch a video to double your rewards, your offline rewards, I click to watch the video and then the game sends me to the store to buy a gem pack. I click off of that and then it says the video is not available. I assume it wants me to buy another gem pack in order to enable that feature. I will not be doing that as that is ridiculous. I already bought the starter pack. Please fix this as the game is very fun and addictive.',

Do not download this intrusive app. Also I get a migraine with the annoying "Ready? Let\'s go!" voice when the sound is on.',
       'Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.',
       'Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you\'re given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.',

    description: 'Scooby-Doo and The Gang have discovered a hidden treasure map and a mysterious LEGO key that can be built to unlock any door! Play as Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, or Fred, and help Scooby-Doo find the missing pieces of the LEGO key, recover the lost treasures, unmask the villains, and solve the many mysteries of Haunted Isle.Who is your favourite character?Shaggy might be the hungriest, goofiest, most-fearful member of the group, but the bond he shares with Scooby-Doo sees him through thick and thin. He might run at the first sign of danger, but when it comes to helping his friends, he’s always ready to step in! Fred is the glue that keeps Mystery Inc. together, and his mind is always two or three steps ahead of the monster they’re after. He sees mysteries as a chess match, and nothing makes him happier than planning genius and elaborate traps to catch ghosts, vampires, bogeymen and more!Brave, beautiful and brainy, Daphne is the most enthusiastic member of Mystery Inc. She never leaves home without her camera and her notebook because someday she wants to be either a famous mystery writer or an investigative journalist. Velma is the resident smart kid of Mystery Inc. Her hyper-analytical mind deciphers clues almost as fast as she can say “Jinkies!” Although the group tries to stick together, Velma often ends up wandering off by herself, searching for the next clue. A Great Dane with an even greater appetite, Scooby-Doo reluctantly chases ghosts and ghouls with the rest of Mystery Inc. Although Scooby-Doo is always up for an adventure, he prefers activities that end with an all-you-can-eat buffet. When his friends need him, Scooby-Doo will run to the rescue! His best friend in the whole world is Shaggy, and you can usually find the two of them running away from a monster or snacking on double-decker sandwiches in the back of the Mystery Machine.For app support contact LEGO Consumer Service.

     [ 'Maybe the reason people think its boring. It\'s probably because they are boring and lame. I beat the first level without a problem, they didn\'t because they feel like everything should be easy and they shouldn\'t have to work hard for anything. The game is challenging and fun if you like a challenge. If your a lame, whinny, expect nothing to be hard, and can\'t handle a challenge as tough as making toast, then this game isn\'t for you.',
       'These other reviewers are jerks! Lol. The game is awesome! And my 4 year old can even play it well!  I like it so much, I\'m downloading it onto my phone (4 yr old plays it on my old phone)  just to see how far I can get lol',
       'I would get to the title page and that was it. It won\'t let me go further. I have turned my phone off and back on and I have uninstalled it twice and installed it 3 times. Please fix.',
       'The game controls are very annoying. The character won\'t go where you want him to. During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don\'t want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn\'t want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.',
       'It\'s an disaster game. It doesn\'t even open on my phone...it just stuck all the time.',

     [ 'Think about playing all day Ridiculously good graphics for a mobile game, excellent soundtrack that matches the intensity of each level, and never gets boring. The free version makes you restart from the beginning instead of checkpoints, but I don\'t even mind because it\'s still challenging and fun with each replay. I do wish I could play in a different mode for free though. This would be an awesome Zen game.',
       'The gameplay is unique and challenging and fun but this game feels like a demo as all the other game modes (PvP , co-op etc) are locked for free users. And you can\'t even use checkpoints without paying them( like SERIOUSLY?!) So once the game is over you have to start all over again if you are a free user. Apart from that this game definitely deserves a try from people looking for casual , relaxing yet challenging gameplay.',
       'Great game This is a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing aesthetics and highly addictive. Totally worth the $2 for the premium version. I do have one problem though: even though I am pretty decent at the game, Google Play won\'t give me any achievements even though I\'m sure I have earned some. It won\'t even let me open achievements or leaderboard pages. Is anybody else having this issue?',
       'So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn\'t save where I\'m at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won\'t be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!',
       'I am going crazy for this game. Great time killer and stress reliever. Graphics, music, and everything else is completely superb. I am totally enthusiastic about purchasing the premium version, however, I could not buy it because I do not have any credit or debit card. Can someone please tell me if there is other ways to purchase, like deducting the fee directly from my SIM balance, perhaps?',
       'BEST GAME EVER... Love this game,  a must have on every phone.. Well worth the price, amazing graphics.. Also bought the VR version truly unbelievable. Just 1 wee problem... When you reach infinity there is not a lot of glass to smash for extra balls which is a must have especially when it goes super fast.  Thankyou and keep up the great work..' ],

I see that everyone else is complaining about the same thing. So Delete the ads Please. And please make all of the Ponies free. Some of the levels required a different pony but you have to buy them. Drag and drop is broken. Please fix it.',

One at the end of each level would be fine, but this 4-5 inside the level is overkill. And they play upside down. She spends more time trying to exit the ad than playing the game.',

     [ 'Very simple. Gives me a lot of nostalgia. Two things though, it seriously needs music maybe some Celtic tunes or shanties. And secondly it needs more stuff to do. When I first saw a whale I was excited about doing some whaling but nope. The whales do absolutely nothing. Maybe even some treasure hunting puzzles or something. Good game just needs a little more content.',
       'Good game however, once you\'ve taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world\'s and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.',
       'Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.',
       'Great game in all honesty I can actually see myself playing this game for weeks to months. Everything about it is perfect and I  love how it is not based on a story.   Note devs: for some reason after playing for 10 min strait my boat gets to the point where it can\'t hit a single shot so I have to restart the game.',
       'This game is great overall and you have a great sense of progression as your ship gets bigger and faster. The problem is the controls themselves. I found it very hard( I noticed this when I reached HP or ship level 6 ) and sometimes close to impossible to fire at other ship even at point blank range. The game has a very hard time trying to focus on one ship and would often shoot at where the enemy was 3 seconds ago especially when there is more than 3 ships at once which often happens. I would recommend a fire button option to compliment the controls and the gameplay experience. As I said before, it is indeed a very amusing game and would be even more enjoyable with this added feature.',
       'please, please, please. update more maps or make it more challenging, ive already conquered all the islands and there\'s not much i can do anymore. so please, either more maps, or let others conquer my islands and let me reclaim it. i know you guys can still add up to this already amazing game. also, improve the controls, really cant see much when im steering. but over all, its a really fun, relaxing game. ;) thank you.' ],

As a result it\'s been removed. Apps and games need to sort out their permissions for what it needs to do. If it\'s not required I\'m not installing it. Other than that complaint it\'s actually a nice game for a quick 5 minute time waster.',

It is a big deal to me since I enjoy playing games with a purpose to achieve something haha btw GREAT GAME!',

     [ 'I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I\'m a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events.',
       'I love the game. From its cute and addictive style to its unique and original dress up gameplay, it turned me from a dress up hater to lover. But I feel like there\'s a Paywall especially during events, and diamonds are forced to be bought, but they can be earned, which is good. But so far, you seem to have listened to feedback, from the skin tones to the bug fixes. But I love it still.',
       'In depth in both gameplay and attention to details of awarded items. Continuous hours not required but with once a day of incentive activities. Controls are  sometimes unstable. If a glitch does happen, its fixed fast and your also awarded for time spent. Very happy customer. Enjoyed the best dress up game I\'ve played so far. Thank you makers!',
       'Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted',
       'I never write reviews, but this game really deserves a high one. I got this game because my friend Emily adores it, and I have been playing NON STOP. It\'s so beautiful and high quality for just a dress up game. It\'s absolutely wonderful. My favorite thing is that you can really enjoy the game without having to use real money on in app purchases. Yeah, you can if you want to, but your experience isn\'t less if you don\'t. A high quality and fun game. I adore it',
       'I had seen many ads for it and was kind of interested, but I didn\'t think a dress-up game could be that fun. One day I couldn\'t find any games I wanted to play, so I decided to give it a shot. To my surprise, I am really enjoying it! So if you\'ve had any inkling of interest in this game, give it a shot. You might enjoying as much as I have.' ],

     [ 'Bingo Blitz rigs games in boost levels. If certain power ups are in play and you have boosted cards the game is stacked against you. Will will not get a bingo with a 2x power up playing in legendary boost. The company knows, this was brought to their attention. They resolved it by blocking everyone from commenting on their FB page who publicly spoke out about the rigging. Do not buy credits, do not get sucked into this game. You will regret it.',

       'I thought I was going to continue to playn but I have a serious problem with having to wait 24 hours for bingo chips plus when it\'s time to refresh your money it only gives you 18 that\'s not even enough to play but one card, then when you play the free bingo game it doesn\'t even pay you for your bingo games you won. Then it freezing all the time. I\'ve lost a lot of money cause it. freezes up think I have to uninstall sorry. Tonight I was playing the game and it keeps freezing up and all these ads keep popping up in the middle of the game. I have to uninstall it again and then you have to wait to long for your refill and then you don\'t get enough to even play several times I\'m done',
       'It\'s Bingo.  How intense can bingo possibly get? Lol but a fun game never the less.',
       'While I really do enjoy playing this game, I am quite displeased with several things. Namely, when the app gets frozen MID GAME  (for whatever reason), the system doesn\'t provide you the credits you\'ve earned, which feels like you\'re being short changed.  Also, what purpose does the cash value serve, if you\'re not allowed to use them for purchasing game credits? In addition, why are their limits to how many daily credits earned, no matter how many "level ups" one achieves? It would really be a better experience if these "quirks" could be modified. 2/25/18, still experiencing hiccups and the system is neglecting to replenish credits that are being lost repeatedly when the game freezes up for no reason.  You click on the number of cards you wish to play, it seems to accept, yet once the round starts you\'re not allowed in (while you\'re still able to hear the 5 balls drop, so it isn\'t technically "frozen".  So it\'s stealing your credits now.  REALLY BB?! There\'s nothing FUN about being cheated, even in a free game.  Get it together and credit your players accordingly!  Integrity speaks VOLUMES!',

     [ 'This game is perfect for anyone who loves magic, fantasy, collecting, and a whole new level of adorable! Dragonvale takes everything to the next level! I highly recommend it, as it is a amazing game, my most played, and I hope everyone else enjoys it just as much as I do. Five stars! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Edit 2: I was re-organizing my islands by Element the other day, and I had just finished the Plant Island. I put down a Oversized Oak Tree, and immediately, a image flashed through my mind: a young girl, sitting on a branch of the oak tree, a book in one hand, a baby Plant dragon sitting next to her. Stretched out in front of them was my Plant Island, the dragons freely soaring, the other islands in the distance. And that sparked a inspiration in my head. I just wanted to ask; can I write a Dragonvale book, which takes place at my park? Please let me know !  :)',
       'Cmon Backflip! Okay look I love Dragonvale, I\'ve been playing it forever. First off I lost my amazing park a while back and that really sucked. But now I am restarting and I go to buy the beginners pack for 9.99 and it says there was an error and i wont be charged...come to find out it did charge me and i didnt receive anything! Please help',
       'I have been playing for a while. After events you get a day to turn in your event specific currency for the prizes, even though the event has ended. Well for Gardenia\'s event, it turned in all my roses before I could exchange them. I had over 25,000 and was so pumped to get the new dragons. Now I don\'t have any roses and 25,000,000 extra coins i don\'t need. Please help. This is a very frustrating bug.',
       'I really love collecting all of the dragons and the fact that you can theme/decorate your park too. But the amount of types of decorations are unbalanced, the majority that you can currently buy in the market are just plant and earth type while there are very few decorations of the other types (such as air, cold, etc).',
       'When I first had it it was super fun. Then I saw a game I wanted so I deleted it I did that before and got it back I could log into facebook and go to my old island. But this time I could not. I was so far and looking forward to seeimg my dragons but it did not let me go to my old island. It left me im tears that I had to do what I did all over again. So I deleted this stupid game and gave this. If I could rate 0 I would',
       'its ok, and you might think you cant li e without it, but trust me.... after a while year of playing, which is what i have waited to wrote this review, the game play becomes very repetitive. sure try it out, its fun, but not something for the rest of your life. dont put money into it, you will regret ir later.' ],

Also, why does the Apple version have stars and the android version doesn\'t? I was trying so hard to earn enough stars to buy the colour packs on my iPod, and I got quite disappointed that I can\'t do that on android. I guess I\'ll just delete the game off android since there\'s really no goal to the game now.',
       'Very fun and addicting but nice calm relaxing game. Ads only happen after each round and not a big deal. If you want to keep playing this game FREE then add up with the package. Quiet whinning about ads. Someonbe has to pay the creators for this game including the upkeep and updates. How else will the creator make his money? 2 choices, either gets ads or charge to download. So I can deal with the ads. It\'s a FREE APP.',
       'Way too many ads. I just need something for my fingers to do while listening to podcasts but this constantly interrupts my listening pretty much after every round. I really liked the game but I have had it with thw ads and am uninstalling. It\'s just not worth it.',
       'I really like the game but as many others have said their are too many ads. Ads after every round and sometimes in the middle of the round which makes you start over and that gets annoying. Too many of thr same ads. I also agree their needs to be a redo button. It does get a bit pintle after you hit the goal but still fun.',
       'Too many adds, and it makes me restart every time an add plays, I\'ve only had this app for 1 min, and have already played 50 rounds... Not. Cool. I would be okay with the adds if I could at least pick up on where I last left off.',
       'I\'m not quite sure what\'s happened to this game. It\'s very straightforward and strangely addictive. However, just today after Android\'s OS update, it performs much worse. Where before when you pick up a block, it is elevated slightly above your finger so you can see where it\'s going, now it\'s just under your finger, making this game frustratingly impossible. If this is due to an interaction with the OS update, then 1010 is due for it\'s own update.' ],

It\'s a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that\'s it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame',

Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn\'t came in two years it probably isn\'t. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don\'t pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges.',

After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.',

You can\'t do that. but, I still think that this game is very cool!!!! I give this game a 5 star even though my review is about the 3d camera.',
       'Happy, then let down. I loved the app. It\'s exactly like minecraft. However, After about an hour of game play it kept freezing up every 5 minutes or so. Every time it froze up I would have to exit to my home screen then re-enter.',
       'It\'s okay but... Why cant you put more skins than just that one skin, or make an avatar editor in the game. The character seems too dull for me and aome people may want a female character. Other than that it\'s a good game.',
       'It\'s gr8 and all, but there are some things that I want. First is crouching, it\'s impossible to build bridges if I\'m always falling, Second is sound FX, for me it\'s too quiet and the fact of footsteps and moos and oinks and clucks is very good. Last IS everyone\'s game enemy, ADS, ads pop up in a few seconds and when building my first house you can forget what part you were on. PLEASE ADD OR FIX THESE THINGS!!!',
       'It is really a bit of minecraft even the seeds on minecraft you can put them there im so glad I knewd this game',

Sent off request to support a number of times with proof and no reply, and after a week still no reward.   So if you are downloading this to get reward from another app don\'t bother as you won\'t get it',
       'I like the game but it is hard for players who can\'t buy a lot of packs. Some slight tweaks to make it not so slanted towards big spenders.  Maybe make some exchange rate for silver to gold without changing the silver availability or price. Someway that gold can be acquired beside the little in the ground. I understand the game has to make a profit and so you should but more people would continue to play instead of giving up Anyway just a couple of thoughts. Got plenty more on just general gameplay  that I think would be useful. Again, not hating as I like and play the game.',
       'Still got trouble with the game, as it still freezing up somtimes and cannot attack other jarls like this. The game is no good like this as if I uninstall it I will loose all that I have achieved. Doing this review, texting this mail is smooth running but when I go into the game it starts to freeze up. Can you please help me as other people in my clan are let down by me.  I did rate the game, as very good when first downloaded but now it is rubbish.',
       'Waste of time. I started playing the game as an offer to get points for another game. Vikings is not a bad game on itself but I feel cheated when I\'m promised something and IronSource does not honor their part of the bargain. IronSource said the Plarium did not verify my completion of the offer, so I won\'t play it anymore nor try other Plarium content nor IronSource advertised games. The actual content is fine, but the business practices are deplorable.',
       'Great time killer, I love the interaction and concept of the game. It can get a bit laggy at times and at it\'s worst, it will crash on you. The wait times are unbearable though. No ads at all since the first time I played too!',
       'The game itself is great. Zero complaints there. But the fact that it I am unable to ever log in is infuriating. I\'ve literally been zeroed out because the app won\'t let me log in... multiple times. It\'s absolutely ridiculous. Needs to be fixed.' ],

     [ 'The game is good and i like it..  But after every fight you must connect to internet,, honestly this sucks.. Fighting game needs much comfort ability but every being online its really boring and it eventually slows which makes the game awful Please fix this up  Shadow Fight 2 is more portable and nice thought this will be better than two but for this update Shadow Fight 2 Is the best...',
       'This game made me rage. Insane difficulty is literally impossible.The loot is trash, upgrading armor and weapons is better. In the fighting system, when you get cornered, your basically screwed. I miss the mechanics in Shadow Fight 2 where you cant hit him when he fell on the ground. It a really good mechanic to give your opponent a chance. But thus game, there is no mercy at all. You still get hit when on the ground which sucks. C\'mon developers, you gotta fix this!',
       'This game is annoyingly unfair to the point if you keep playing you will Introduce your phone to the nearest wall. You simply cannot win unless you pay and the rewards for winning in duel and other play modes are less than minimum wage in s$&t hole countries can\'t buy anything useful.',
       'Classical pay per win game. Once you advance (e.g. lv 4-5), winning against the computer in the main quest is only possible after several days of waiting for free cards and random levelling of the weapons via chests (gained via duels). Glitches in skills usage are also observed.',
       'Great game in terms of graphic and gameplay. The only thing that sucks are the paywall in this game. Almost impossible to pass the story mode with weak weapon that we are given. The box drop rate also terrible. The only way to level up is by completing the main story. I will uninstall this game till they fixed this system. Really bad system.',
       '5 out of 10. Only graphics are good on this game, but lacks in other areas. Event weapon sucks. Controls are half broken when getting the right attack move. Worst of all is opponent\'s rare weapon, where player have only dual short sword Vs a Guan Yu blade staff or the flying dagger. Additionally the campaign mission are getter ridiculously tougher than the last, the sense of strong armed into micro-transaction.' ],

Only problem is that friend invitations are limited, which means you can\'t add new guild members as you play longer...

     [ 'This now a prize example of a freemium game that needs a premium option. I would gladly pay £10 as a one off purchase to do away with the need to say for lives. In the past games worthy of a one-off fee would offer it and this issue such game that should consider it. I will never pay for any in app purchases on any game and I am sure I am not alone. This has 5* written all over it but the long wait times and exorbitant cost of energy replenishing means this doesn\'t get anything higher than average.',
       'Loved the game but if the life was free this waiting for minutes to play again is not cool. Also noticed if you have to score more than 1 goal and you make a mistake you have to start from the same goal you already scored. If we can get the requirements before each challenge that would make it much more fun otherwise I love this game a lot keep updating for more seasons. Thank you. I am on Level 560 with 1257 stars I am awaiting Season 29. If you can also create a full football game with same concept. This is a Great game!!! Thank you developers keep developing Great games like these!!!',
       'Wonderful! Game by first touch   But I can\'t wait till the hearts 💚 are filled!  So Reduce the time. Improve this game more and more and create a new exciting games.  I have finished 390 levels. And I have a doubt what is the last level and what happens after it? All the best for ur future and I\'m a biiiiiiig fans of u guys!!  Hands off',
       'SCORE  HERO RULES This game is so sick dudes. It so cool that this gives us idea that how to play soccer or football. Gameplay is so smooth . They players show us some epic skills . It has an commentary. The worst part was the heart. I can\'t wait till it get refilled ❤❤❤❤❤ this. Graphics are great . Just reduce the time of refilling the energy . Overall this game cool. Thanks for the game FTG.',
       'Great game! I enjoyed it alot. Finished the whole game (540 matches, over 1400🌟) in 1 month without spending any $.   3 more months: got ALL 1680🌟 not spending any $.  Gameplay improvement required: after missing a shot off the woodwork or a penalty kick the player should go for the rebound , not stop!',
       'Great game. It is just like Fifa the journey!😃😃😃😁 please fix the lives because when I am on lives it goes down from 5 to 0 in 1 turn. I only lost it once and it took all my lives. Please reduce the time to get lives back as well. Its ridiculous' ],

       'Found a game called "Infinite Balls" on my friend\'s iPhone, we loved it. This is the best Android alternative we could find, but it\'s not quite as satisfying. Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls. Would be nice to turn off the help lines, too.',

     [ 'Graphics were generic until now for x86 devices. Thanks for that update. And that moving data to sd card, it is really appreciable since now a days even 32 gb  not sufficient. Hope other game developers get inspiration from this. And downloading just updated part is also an improvement instead of downloading whole data again. 4 stars because this game just wont allow to play older version once it finds out new version is present.',
       'Asphalt 8 airborne is a very exciting game to play. The addition of bikes is mind blowing. Wish all time limited events could be on mobile data rather than wifi. Thumbs up gameloft for an exciting game. After the recent update of this app it keeps crashing with a pop-up message "unfortunately asphalt 8 has stopped working". Please fix this issue.',
       'I\'m addicted to this game, I love it. And with this new story mode update  I\'ve got more excited, I won all the starting races and now waiting for the refill. Only one thing that is negative, it is the upgrades are too much expensive and takes a huge time to gather coins versus the escalating events and this is depressing. I hope that game developers will fix this problem and make it fair enough.',
       'Munich update completely ruined what was previously the best driving experience on mobile. EDIT: Fall Out Boy update basically makes me unable to play the game altogether, with the game constantly freezing at the Gameloft splash screen. Talk about letting the junior devs do all the work unsupervised...',
       'This fallout boy update really sucks. Two stars for past glory but this needs fixed. Wont load multiplayer and takes several tries to launch the app at all. Either a white screen or gameloft logo hanging endlessly. And tbh I dont like the blurry nitro thing. I get it, but hope it goes away in the next update.',
       'As racing games go, this is probably the best. The graphics, sound, gameplay are excellent. Race solo, against friends or the world. The variety of ways to race is big. The selection of cars and now bikes, keeps getting bigger. The only down side is buying something from the shop or on offer. I purchased a special offer and never got it. They got my money, I never got the goods. Trying to get in contact with them is a joke. All replies to my emails were automated responses telling me to do the same thing over and over again.' ],

Good game four a you get crowd I think I because it\'s not really a strategy cooking game where you have to time manage and things. It had a decorating feature that I think kids would enjoy. Also, with that feature, a tablet would be better. Or if on a mobile, a stylis.',

Pls guys pls,pls I want u to make it nonautomatic so that we can play it properly .that\'s all I want to say about this game and most and things are locked these r the two things which I did not like about this game. So guys pls make it properly. Then I will rate it 5 stars for sure. One of the best game I have ever played. Thank u so much',
       'Good game but too many things locked and that makes it 3 star from 5 star. Please coco tab tale unlock the whole game. In competitions always I am third because things are locked. You know money is very precious can\'t spend on a game. Please please please please unlock things. Ok bakeries we will do but others you. And yes when I have not reached that bakery then the orders come in which they can be completed in other bakery only?😟😞',
       'Nice game... everyone who love cooking should download it. But there is only one problem that the things which are the main are locked and we have to pay the real money or watch s 40 ad. For ex:- In the doll cake we don\'t have the doll so how are we going to bake it.Please fix this problem, otherwise the game is nice.',
       'At first, I was pleasantly suprised this came from TabTales. The lack of pay walls at the beginning is wonderful for their games. Though I\'m not very creative, the game demands it for making food. The graphics look great, gameplay is realistic. I was sad to see a paywal at the princess cake though. If you have 10 dollars and a young girl who loves to cook and bake, by all means buy it for her.',
       'This game is awesome!!!! It makes me go hungry every time I play it!!! The graphics are awesome and very realistic. I luv the fact that it is automatic so you don\'t have to waste your time in perfection... Please keep it automatic like this forever. P.S, for those who are worried about unlocking other stuff like the princess cake, etc. Well, don\'t be, you will get a chance to play it when you unlock the other new bakeries and when you also compete in the competitions.... 😉' ],

Is it possible to fix this issue?',

     [ 'If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It\'s by far the best maze game app I\'ve come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I\'ve tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It\'s the only maze puzzle app I\'ve found worth playing! 😀💜',
       'Time killer. B&W colors are a bit hard on the eyes after awhile. I wish the controls weren\'t so touchy. Even if I\'m using my stylus it\'s easy to move into a wrong corner by accident when you know it\'s not the right direction.',
       'Sublime controls, varying but very original and fun game modes, and an online leaderboard for the ones interested..!  I\'d easily rate this 5 stars if the white-on-grey theme didn\'t give me a headache! For the love of whatever God is out there, at least give the choice between a light and dark theme, PLEASE?!',
       'I\'m not far into it, but it\'s fun so far. My eyesight could be why it\'s not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It\'s still a very good game though.',
       'I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven\'t played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I\'ll have to download a separate kid version for her.',
       '5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes' ],

This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can\'t without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.',
       'First up the images used as what the game looks like are fakes. I saw too many polygons.... (Shudder) Secondly there is no start menu. NOPE! Just some fancy loading screen and boom you\'re in the game without a chance to look at the controls. Plus your first mission is ruined by the tutorial at the worst places on the track.   Bad game knockoff. If you download this just delete it. This game is [EXPLICATIVE]',
       'Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that\'s excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.',
       'Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?',
       'It would br better if you could exchange coins for diamonds, not just diamonds for coins. I also have a screen shot which shows that I should be the 1 place, yet another car which was behind me and crossed the line 1 sec later got the first place :/',
       'The controls is very floaty like your car is late responding when tilted and i really like that this game is very fun and time wasting but it lacks car selection very small but i know it will add soon. And i thought the pic is real but it is not even the same on the game for its originality that all thanks' ],

     [ 'I like it a lot but I hate how the drawings are so linked with pokemon go. I hate pokemon go!!!!! The graphics are okay but I wish they were a bit better quality. It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn\'t like how easy the drawings were and I don\'t think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn\'t recommend this game if you don\'t like colouring. It\'s ok!!!!',
       'I love this app! It\'s sooo good. And its brilliant for when your bored. But its a little hard sometimes to go over the lines with our fingers as the lines are so thin. But overall I think it\'s a fantastic app!',
       'I think there should be more cartoons to draw and color. And it should not always be right colors to trace it in. Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn\'t color the whole background, because what if you didn\'t want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!',
       'It\'s a great app however it keeps crashing and I have to start the drawing all over again. The whole app stops and my drawing starts over and it\'s really annoying. If this gets fixed I will definitely rate 5 stars',
       'I love this game but i don\'t like the characters tho .but it\'s fine . I like the way you can colour it in and then do the glow pen around it and at the end it looks amazing . You just colour and then press the pencil button ontop of the rubber in the pictures right bottom corner and then do the glow pen thing . Some people may don\'t know so that\'s why they don\'t like it . It\'s good when your travelling or when your bored . O THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!I like it',
       '(My comment is long so Tap! it) It\'s cool but I give it 3 stars because YOU need to add some Pokemon as Pikachu is my favorite but I\'m NOT CALLED "ABC marble", I\'m called "abcmarble" OR "SpiralWalk". I\'m gonna wait for you to add them. Best regards, abcmarble' ],

     [ 'I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn\'t have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn\'t get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren\'t vigilant of their customers and don\'t take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.',
       'I love this game so much. I have been looking for a good shooting game for years and I never found one until I came across this. This is perfect. Me and my friend would spend hours on this game. I have been playing this for about 6 months now. It\'s perfect. I think the best thing about this game is how organized everything is. It is very self explanatory. I found everything and it was easy to do so. I also love how they update this game very often. Great game. I haven\'t had any problems with it. I can\'t wait for updates later on to come.',
       'Game is really tooo gud, graphics also nice n smooth controls but u guys released only one game mode(Team death match), but in lot of fps games they provided free for all, bomb mode, Flag capture n many more modes.. If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games 😀 n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area.',
       'The best shooting game ever. Lobed each and every single thing about this game but there a little suggestion that we can see the player if they are online or not but how is this if we can see there live going on matches? That concept will be great and games lag sometimes so if you can fix this and add my suggestion in guns of boom that will be hell great!! #the best game',
       'I was loving it and have spent alot of money but this update made it to where i can\'t even open it back up. Please fix because i loved this game and have invested time and money and if i don\'t get to play it anymore sometime soon I\'m not coming today back. Please fix very soon i was trying earn a special gun but I\'m not sure if that\'ll be an option if an when it gets fixed',
       'Played this game on my old 6S and S7 edge without any problems. Now that I have a Pixel 2 XL, controls have a major glitch. Seems to go nuts on its own or sticks too one side of the screen. Happens every match, almost unplayable. Very disappointing!' ],

The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)',
       'I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn\'t have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it\'s Definitely Not a game you\'d wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!',
       'Fastest uninstall ever. 15 seconds of gameplay, then 15 seconds of timed add. Can anyone spot the fake reviews? Really developer?, ya cant wait a tad longer to stop the game and make us stare at a cat puzzle? The worst. I didnt even play it long enough to appteciate the poor controlls. Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.',

    description: 'Children\'s doctor - we all love when people around us smile. We become well and happy when someone on the street gives us a smile. But for a smile to be beautiful, you need to take good care of your teeth. This applies to your pets, because in childhood they were for every kid. Like people, they also sometimes need to treat their teeth. This can be done by a special doctor - dentist. We present to your attention an exciting game for children - a dentist (vet clinic). In this entertaining game, your child is a real dentist, under the guidance of which there is a hospital for animals. The kid is entrusted with a very important and responsible task - the treatment of teeth of his four-footed pups, whose teeth began to ache heavily because of their love for sweets. You have to treat them in a real dental office, use various medical instruments, such as tongs, scalpels, Burmashin and many others, to clean your four-legged friends of teeth from plaque, align them, do operations, remove cavities and fill them. After all, they all just need your help. For her, the animals will be grateful to you and very grateful. Developing games for children, such as a veterinarian, contribute to the overall development of your child. They help to develop fine motor skills, coordination of movements, visual perception, attentiveness and observation, will show the baby how to treat animals, take care of them. Our games for kids, such as a dentist, will teach them not only to treat their pets with love and care, but also to protect their own teeth, do not forget to clean them several times a day, because going to the dentist is not the most pleasant pastime. For the purpose of comprehensive development of the child, we create applications and educational games for children that are aimed to help boys and girls develop basic motor and other skills, and also have fun, fun and useful to spend their free time. All you need is to download games, install and start playing, and in the future your child can choose one of the most needed professions in the world - the dentist Be sure to visit our http://yovogames.com and also we are at:Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZruadkJJTuD4Bgb1F6pa3ATwitter: https://twitter.com/YOVOstudioFacebook: https://facebook.com/yovogames',

     [ 'To anyone saying the magnometer should be free; no, it shouldn\'t.  You guys are requesting it be free because it is in demand, which is exactly why it is for sale.  Parents don\'t let you buy things on the app?  Good. The magnometer is something EXTRA that is absolutely not necessary for the app to function.  Sure, it can help make the right move; that\'s why you have to pay for it... Without the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app.  With the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app and paying for it to help analyze your moves.  You are not entitled to a free move analyzer to help guide you simply because you want it to be free.  That\'s not how economics works, hate to break it to you.  There are many, many ways to analyze moves, positions, and get better at chess; the Magnometer is not and will never be the best way to do so. It is simply an added convenience that you can choose to pay for to help you find or analyze a move/position.',
       'Feels great to have a simulated match with a Magnus-like computer AI opponent. Will definitely destroy you even at the lower age levels. The only thing I don\'t like in the app is the gray color graphics of the board and the chess pieces. The upside about this is you can surely change that setting if you got the appropriate in-game currency to purchase a different color scheme, with some playthroughs that are needed first to be able to get them.',
       'Good job It seems like that you are not paying this app any attention anykmore. I dont understand what was the need of another Magnus Trainer app. You coukd have very well integrated the same fuctionality here. You closely missed the opportunity to create the best chess app in the world. Alas....',
       'This chess game is very good, I would give it five stars except for an internal error that will not post my record of wins, losses and ties against Magnus. Maybe I fried the memory with all my losses...😁',
       'Sound effects and graphics are distractingly poor. Missing basic features like turn confirmation. You can see a video on YouTube of Magnus himself making a mistake in placing a piece using this app.',
       'Love the idea behind it. Well executed and a really fun feel to the game. Wish there was a 3d board option- have always found flat 2d chess board graphics frustrating to read.' ],

     [ 'The game is awesome. It is funny, has some challenges, it\'s community is friendly and you can collect familiars. Also you can use your equipment as costumes if you like a specific item\'s look. =D And I didn\'t even talk about the way the game looks like... It\'s the best pixel art I have seen in a while. =) So stop reading and start playing, have fun and thanks for making this game Developers! =D ( The only thing I miss is more coop gameplay =\'D )',
       'Great game and a lot of fun but... waiting for energy REALLY kills this game for me. I really don\'t feel energy limitations should be part of of a dungeon crawler where the object of the game is to run random dungeons for the chance of better loot.  I for one will never spend money on refreshing my energy in a game like this and the energy refresh costs are pretty high.   I feel like it be playing this game none stop if it weren\'t for the energy restrictions.   Otherwise good game and very enjoyable - when I can play.',
       'The perfect MMO RPG for your phone in my personal opinion. If you\'re a fan of dungeon games then this is the game for you. With its cute design, simple combat systems, dungeon patterns and loot systems, you\'ll find yourself easily sucked into the MMORPG world of Bit Heroes. Fight your way through the dungeons and gear up to strike fear imto the creatures who dwell within as well as the other players in challenging PvP matches.',
       'Spent over £200 in game and no legendary pet or accessory. This game uses RNG and it\'s extremely low you can\'t advance past a certain level unless you spend lots of money and even then you have to be extremely lucky to get legendary pet or accessory. Guilds won\'t take you without legendary pet or accessory. Don\'t waste your time on this PAY 2 PLAY game',
       'The game overall is brilliant! I love the pixelated graphics. The equipment is epic for a pixel game. It\'s an easy game to play, but is strategic as well! Also...it doesn\'t require much space! My down sides would be the controls. I have had them glitch on me before, but...that won\'t lower my rating at all! If I had to suggest one thing...it would be to add more customization for your character. I was looking for a long braid for hair, but wasn\'t there. So, some more choices would be an up. But, as I said, all in all...a perfect 5 star game.',
       'Perfect, very close to the perfect ultimate bit adventure rpg! I look forward to expanded versions. For this one the only issue i have is when i accept or decline a friend request, and i think duels, the request text lingers above for white someone even tho i already accepted/declined. Great work tho! I love this game!' ],

I\'m giving it a bad rating because gems are insanely expensive and they have so many buttons to hit to "use 200 gems to remove 3 lines" as one example or another to lose 200 by placing the button right above the back button on a phone. Super lame move on devs to intentionally take insanely expensive gems from us by mistake. No confirmation or anything, just boom, gone. Lacks ethics to say the least rinow',
       'Such a shame. The game is great, really enjoyed the concept however it is a prime example of how monetisation strategy can ruin a game. Gems too difficult to earn without buying them, and purposely easy to accidentally spend them. Too many ads too. I\'d rather have paid for the game. Deleted it after a  day or so.',
       'Not What It Used To Be  The second to last update I did for this app switched the aim of the ball to slightly off from where you point it. So now have to compensate (guess a bit) when you\'re aiming which makes play more challenging.  Likewise, levels beyond about 440 are becoming impossible to beat w/o saving like a weeks with of bonuses to use on each level. Beating one level a week is hardly fun anymore! I may be uninstalling this app soon.',

I just got a new phone and was bummed to have to start all over (had gotten to level 360) but my new phone came with an updated/better version so now I\'m stoked on it all over again.

     [ 'The 30 host cap immediately becomes pretty difficult to work around, especially when you need to have duplicates of the  hosts to increase their max level cap/attribute score as well as duplicates of hosts for hat colours. I\'m hoping there\'s a way to increase this later in the game. Also, synthblood is incredibly difficult to obtain especially when you need more to fix higher level hosts. Overall though, the game is pretty generous with currency, so I don\'t think I\'ve ever ran into a hard building wall that made me think I had to spend money on it to progress further. So far, I\'m enjoying the game and looking forward to the updates',
       'Pros: 1. Good design and SFX 2. Balanced currency and gameplay 3. Detailed and reasonably complex  Cons: 1. Unnecessary level cap (level 25). I noticed that after reaching level 25, no additional exp is received for doing stuff.  I hope this level cap is removed, as there are still Escalante missions that require level 30, 35,..., 50 to take part in.  I feel like I am wasting my time and effort by catering on hosts when my supposed XP for those actions are neglected simply because the limit is at level 25 right now, when it should be at 50.  Please fix this, I really like playing this game. But because of this premature level capping, I\'m afraid this would significantly lessen my motivation in playing and spending on the game. Thanks.',
       'Great game and pretty entertaining.',
       'So far so good. Few glitches but its fine.',
       'im stuck on the loading screen and im at level 13. overall its a pretty good game. but it lacks something. may i suggest: trait inheritance of a target host. sending gift/social points shouldnt restart from the top. warehouse to an inactive host human worker characters hard swipe to change location/map delos room upgrades',

     [ 'Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can\'t play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.',
       'One of the few games that I don\'t mind spending a bit i.e. $10+ every month. Requires team guild effort to achieve stuffs together definitely gives a good feeling. Event is weekly and community is lively. Card\'s artwork feels like Rage of Bahamut but using matching puzzle style to deal damage. Skills of card matter as well increasing the complexity and fun. Only thing to improve would be cheaper ingame currency to encourage more people to have better decks thus higher activity rates.',
       'It\'s a lot other games of this type. I haven\'t been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you\'re looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn\'t find any more connections, that would be great!',
       'Hey love the game and clearly has lots of effort pit into it. I can\'t say anything bad about it but I\'m having trouble with a high server load and I wasn\'t able to get on after multiple attempts. Would love for clarification for my problem and if I\'m the only one experiencing it',
       'My big complain is that I cannot enable notifications, I\'m on a pixel phone and it is no where to be found in the settings menu, I just uninstall and reinstall the game to see if it shows up. It\'s really inconvenient as a guild leader to not be able to get notifications. Thank you',

     [ 'This is the best life simulator game by far. Instead of just focusing on getting rich this game has many other focuses like love, nationality, jobs, kids etc. The one thing that isn\'t at all necessary but I kind of want to see is a avatar for the character you\'re playing as. Perfect game. 😁👍  EDIT: hi just reporting on a glitch in the game. There\'s an option to transition your gender bit even though my character is over 18 they can\'t do it. Otherwise still a perfect game.',
       'I think it\'s incredible and I am hooked. Although I do hope for more such as, instead of just instagram famous, perhaps become a famed scientist, actor, writer, astronaut or business person OR be known as beloved (or not so) Educator/Teacher etc. A bit more drama added with partner/children good and not so good. Varying reactions to their dilemmas, perhaps even a child dating, married, having a child (grandkids) and other random child updates with or without the option to react accordingly. Overall, addictive and thoughtful game.',
       'Hi - playing this game for a few months now and a big fan. I suggested during beta phase that there should be an option of money management as well. We can be a millionaire but dont know what to do with all that liquid. We should be able to invest in moveable and immoveble assets. Should be able to open a company/business and invest in other company\'s stocks etc. This game will be even more interesting that way. Hope we will see these features soon. Thanks.',
       'I have been playing through the beta phase, and am completely hooked. You can pick it up and play whenever the mood strikes. It is easy to grasp, every new life is different, and it is engrossing without being addictive. Once you\'re done with a life you can create a new one or close the app and move on with your real one. There is no waiting for something to build or happen, there are very few ads and most are by choice to gain something. There are no in-app purchases to enhance game play, its all there from the beginning. The developers have done an incredible job with a simple concept.',
       'First of all, congratulations on the full release! I\'ve been playing this game for a few months now and I\'m absolutely hooked. Whenever I\'m bored or don\'t want to use my phone\'s data, I just play this game. There are a few things that I think would be cool to add in or go more in depth with, but other than that, this game is borderline perfect! I reccomend downloading',
       'It\'s simple in design and gameplay but not boring. Much better than other life simulator games.  I\'ve been playing this since while it was in beta and enjoyed it more with each improvement and update. I\'m looking forward to what else they add.  My only problem with it is job selection is boring and there is no way to save the current life you\'re in in case you want to come back to it at a later time.' ],

     [ 'Several times I have tried to use a hint and it  wouldn\'t take it off and it was difficult and easy. When I type in the logo it would tell me I\'m wrong then I hit solve and it was the same thing I wrote also and if people don\'t know some of the logos what is the point of the game.',
       'Love testing my knowledge but I recommend a change. Upon entering the last letter you should have the option to view before the answer is submitted. My big fingers cause me to select the incorrect letter occasionally and then I get the wrong answer and my streak is reset. Please correct this.',
       'Several times now I\'ve tried to type in a logo name and the app has told me I got it wrong but I thought it was right and couldn\'t see why I was being told I was wrong. So I hit "solve" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I\'ve recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you\'ve ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?',
       'First Level at Barbie and Twitter, even if type the words correct, the app tells me that there\'s a mistake. Solve shows me exactly the same word I\'ve typed in before',
       'It\'s too easy to amass a huge number of hints and use them. I\'d like not to be able to complete every level without doing some online searches.',
       'This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further.' ],

     [ 'The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I\'d like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.',
       'Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It\'s very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again',
       'Thanks for new upgrade . Even when the game was slow i didn\'t stop playing. I love this game. It\'s not only a game for me...i am a President of my club and i have to lead my members... in less than one year i reached level 50 and almost all land expanded...just  you have to understand how to play... be smart... some advice for beginners  start participate in mayor competition...this way you will grow faster',
       'I absolutely love this game. I play it all throughout the day. I\'ve made really good friends with the people in my club, and we are all over the somewhat new "club wars" feature. There was a lag, but it was recently fixed. There\'s always something to do in this game, and you can play at your own pace. You don\'t have to spend real money to play the game, but I\'ll admit that I spend a dollar every now and then for the 30 days of green buck income. I love this game so much that I\'ve even started a second city on another device with my other email.',
       'The more stuff is added the lagier it gets. Game freezes when buying items, when going over your city, with the chat, loading the flobsl trade, travelling to other cities and basicly everything nowadays. Requires multiple restarts of the game and reboots of my phone regularly to keep jt playable nowadays. It used to be really good and smooth, but it only gets worse each update and no improvement in sight. I only play now because I made some good friends in my club, but the actual fun is long gone. :(',
       'Game is basic in its features. The worst part of the game is the trade hq. Rather than letting you buy directly off the hq menue you have to load the other players city. If your phone doesnt load it as fast as someone else they can snipe the goods you need to buy.' ],

And addictive including this one it\'s fun and ever since the first play I\'ve been hooked there are barely any adds and the graphics are phenomenal. I play it all the time plz don\'t change this, if u do your going to loose my five stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟.',
       'Most of my apps are from Ketchapp. Their creativity and style of games have just been wanting me to download more and more! Right now, Ketchapp is one of my most favourite game groups ever! Keep making more! I don\'t have any improvements, which means that their games are top notch!',
       'Patheitc. Being such a fast paced game you cannot have the blocks starting to move a split second before you\'re going to pass it. Makes the game pretty impossible from the first level. For something that was supposed to be fun, is more frustrating. You need severe luck on your side to get a win. Recommended do not download',
       'Its a good concept, but you need to update it, and make sure the blocks no longer move. Right now, it is by far the most luck based skill game. It is impossible to dodge the moving blocks, so if they are to move, they should move much slower',
       'Good, but difficulty is a bit tough. Unless I was a Jedi, it feels like I\'m starting on what should be a hard level. The AI is way too slow as well. I wish you could could change the color of your ball and race online with others in real time.',
       'I think it is a great way for amiee to get design for her Xbox 360 and help her get over with her anger with her sister and to help her to figure out what\'s the matter but what is the most important thing is to be a fantastic family together but why are we so lonely.... Well i think it is a great opportunity to make new friends to life' ],

Love your company :-) but can you add a roleplay mode that would be great DO MORE:-) but now on my new tablet it won\'t let me play it please fix that and reply',
       'Good. However, the apple versioned platform overwhelms us by many advantages: They can earn coins and cash quicker n easier. They get options on what currency they use to purchase things. They get to higher leagues easier. Their weapon description overpasses ours as ours literally gives us damage and capacity whereas theirs comes with fire rate, trait etc.',
       'I love this game but I have a couple of requests 1st. Could you add u YouTuber skin back like boy,girl,animal then YouTuber 2nd. Could you add a button that you can press that alows you to make your own custom paint job for any vehicle that would be amazing 3rd. Can you make and road that ends come back into the city at the other side example the road behind the hospital 4th. Could add like 5 houses around the city that you can go into 5th. More vehicles   If you agree with what I have sead in this comment like so the developer can see!',
       'I love this game. But for the next update, u should give each skin there own special ability. Like the flash and hulk skins. Give the flash super speed, give hulk super strength and etc. So that everyone can get a different type of advantage. Plz make this happen next update also make a goku skin. So u can turn super saiyan. And have other transformation. So can u plz have every skin to have different abilities that match the skin',
       'I have been playing the game for 6 or 5 years and it has been the best game i have played. So, i  think you have to make this game better in the next update.Here r my suggestions 1 make the graphics better. 2 day and night shift. 3police attacks bandit in adventure mode.4 add a clan.  I hope u will add these in the next update.Also too many players that hacked their health so plz fix it.Thx',

By the why does the game close when it\'s not even lag  it says unfortunately block city wars I sent responding when it\'s working just fine. And extend  the single mission map because when you compleate all the missions you can\'t do them anymore so once you complete the mission what\'s the point of single mission?' ],

     [ 'I love this game, it\'s simple and sweet. However, there was a middle row in the item-picking menu in which I had invested many coins into to help me level up faster. Today, when I logged in, the row simply disappeared without a trace. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the backgrounding of my app, but nothing seemed to fix it. Now I only have the Training row and the Fun stuff row. It took me quite a while to get those coins and I\'d really appreciate it if you brought the row back or gave me a solution to get it back. If it helps, you should also know that the \'I\' on every icon which used to let you see how an item was used has also vanished. Please fix this, thank you.',
       'I wish I could give this game 10 stars. It\'s amazing all around.  It\'s adorable and fun. The graphics are amazing too without any glitches so far. Haven\'t noticed any bugs either. The developer\'s done amazing. It does get repetitive after a while but so far by the time it happens something new unlocks so it\'s still fun. Can\'t wait to see what else you guys do to improve the game play since everything else has been flawless so far. Great job, keep up the great work!',
       'This game is super cute! I love my lil ninja friend! Lol. Nice story, and plenty to do to keep you busy. Will def take time to master, but it def has the potential to keep you interested in playing. Even got my wife playing it, and she usually only keeps games for a day or 2, cuz she gets bored with them. I think she\'ll play this one a little longer than most of the other games she\'s tried. I\'m really happy i found this game!!',
       'This one is probably my favourite, with minecraft and clash of clans. If you don\'t have this Virtual Friend game, then it is you who is missing out. Install and enjoy. There\'s nothing bad about this game, and if Naturalmotion do want me to suggest an add-on, then maybe enable me to link the game with a new device. I was LVL 52 once but I lost it. Now I\'m level 17. Hope you liked the suggestion. :)',
       'I really love this game, but if you don\'t put an update on Clumsy Ninja I\'m going to uninstall this awesome game. In the next update will you please fix the part when you touch the story book then it tells you the pictures are still locked? If you put this in the new update anytime, I will start to love this game like I did before. One more thing.... If this helps.... I really really really love this app!!!',
       'You should add a dog and a cat wearing ninja suit they can be like the chicken and the squirrel the dog can run around you and bark and find bones and sell them for coins and the cat can find fish and sell it for coins. It just sounds like a good idea  the dog should be a husky or a smaller dog like a beagle so it is small like the other animals and it can sleep with the ninja the cat can just be a cat please look into this *^* looking forward to this' ],

     [ 'Yes this is addictive, yes it\'s fun, and it\'s great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don\'t have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it\'s not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it\'s clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.',
       'Way way WAYYY too laggy. It\'s an easy casual game though. I wouldn\'t say it\'s "fun" but it does pass the time and make you want to achieve the little goals. Only goal, make more money in game. That\'s it and you achieve that by not even playing the game so there\'s no challenge whatsoever. Uninstalled after first day reaching about 500 Trillion and force closing 100 times.',
       'This game is enjoyable, but like many have said, it drains battery life. Moreover, it hangs too long when switching planets. I suspect, like many areas of technology, performance testing new updates with older devices is not even a consideration. If it runs smooth on the latest and greatest then it is ready to ship.  Like many mobile games this is a casino. It\'s main existence is to make money. I do not have a problem with this so much, but the events give rewards based on leaderboards. Unfortunately, they are pay to win. You are bombarded with options to pay cash. Making the top charts without spending money is not likely to happen.  This game is a time and battery killer, so keep you charger close by.',
       'It\'s okay, but now that I think about it, it really takes up your free time and battery, to me it is eh no use but adddictive! If I had a choice to choose between a milla-seccond or a minute, I would choose a milla-seccond but technichly, you could just go offline while you are waiting. Cool game! 3 stars.',
       'Earth dollar = moon dollar.. the exchange rate is 1:1 when converting to the megabuck not like you grinded to jus redo earth play in the moon or anything. Events are unfairly calculated as well. If you do not pay $$$ you will not tier above 7-8 tiered rewards, if that even.  Youd think in a capitalist game you would be allowed to have choice over portrait lock. But the game overrides system settings I guess.  Game lags hard when it cant figure out portrait or not.',
       'You should be connected to facebook. So when people change from iPhone to android, we can keep our levels. I just had to restart again and I had 6800 lemons and not much longer to complete the game. What an accomplishment I\'m going to try to receive this time' ],

So you have to decide if you want to play or wait the hrs. You can free up those chests by using your gold that you have but if you run out then you have to buy more with real money.',
       'The one star is due to their challenge a friend. If the friend is not online when you challenge then you cannot play against them.  When you challenge a friend you should be able to play the level if they do not respond to challenge after the timeout.   In this event the hit opponent ball will do nothing, and mystery boxes will only benefit the collector instead of opposition actions on opponent you challenged.',
       'It always seems that luck favors your opponent and gold is extremely hard to come by. Wind totally inconsistent, almost like it screws you purposely.  It would be nice if they gave you gold rewards for achievements but that\'s where their money grab is. Some courses have bugs and it\'s extremely frustrating, Win or lose money always seems to be pretty tight.',

       'Game is garbage, you have to bid alot of coins to get into a match with people who have lucky shots with no real shot control. All thos companies games are like that, tried the bowling and thats garbage and so is this. When you are out of coins is when you have yo offer up real money.',

       'Good but buggy Good but buggy, one can earn infinite money in no time then u can upgrade ur vehicle to the max in the very first level. That destroys the fun of the game. Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.',
       'I really like this game and its one that I can play continuously, my only problem is that I can only play once a day.. the game will work for as long as I play but as soon as I exit I can\'t back on until the following day. It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can\'t just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...',
       'Yesss. I complete this game in 7 days. I can\'t understand the ending why that cantenar shake. It\'s mean the zombie are in the cantenar? It\'s mean part 3 will exist? Awesome game. I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don\'t read it before. I can\'t find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....',
       'Fun game but janky/sketchy ads. The ads will unmute your device and turn up the volume before they play, over and over again, so you can\'t​ play the game anywhere quiet. The "x" button on the ads is not in the right position, so tapping it doesn\'t close the ad and you have to hunt for the hidden close button. Bunch of the ads never load and just show a empty gray screen.',

       'I am not sure that having umpteen levels is really such a good thing. Once you have done the first 20 they all feel the same. Given how easy they are I would have wanted a timer to add some challenge to it. Also, while I fully understand that devs need to get paid, this game has way too many ads for enjoyment',
       'Great game. Fun way to pass the time. My only issue is with the ad placement. When the banner pops up, it blocks the controls at the bottom of the screen, so i can\'t restart or select a different puzzle.',
       'The game was okay. I felt like the puzzles were pretty easy to solve, even on the advanced levels. Also, there were a LOT of ads, which got in the way of the game. If you\'re looking to just kill time though, it\'s a simple app!',

     [ 'Great game if you wanna run low graphics for a smoother gameplay on your phone. 40 instead of 100 is great for mobile games as well. Maybe make the controls a tad bit larger for default size. Otherwise really fun. Maybe add a first person mode? Unless I haven\'t found out how to haha. Great game. I seemed to like this one out of all the others tbh.',
       'Well I love the potential. Has a lot of bugs. Dual or quad mode doesn\'t work and overall it takes too long to wait. I waited 10 minutes for quad and then it just stopped and put me back to choosing game modes. I think thi s game can be the best if it had more work put into it.',
       'Good game, but after the last update the game game is riddled with bugs and glitches, making the game next to unplayable. Will often come up with queue error and kick me from the game and the screen constantly freezes. I can move, but I can\'t pick anything up and my teammate position is also frozen. Pls fix or I will uninstall. Also, you got rid of the aim button which sucks. Was way better before the update. You\'ve ruined the game for me😭😭😭',
       'The game is great. It has awsome graphic depending on your setting. It run really smoothly but i think u should add voice chat when playing in duos because my friend always die because i dont know if there is enemy near him so if there was voice chat i could talk with him tell him if there is enemys nearby',
       'This game is good and very challenging but i dont like the new update. My overall Stats have stopped working and im still dyeing even when im in circle and the aim button needs to come back it is so hard to play without it.  But overall a good game it just needs a few adjustments.',
       'I love this game but a few problems 1 don\'t drive cars in this game i was driving a car and just died out of no were and the cause of death was getting run over by a car. 2 sometimes the lag gets real bad and some players have a massive advantage over others and that makes it a bit unfair if these problems are fixed i would rate 5 ⛤' ],

     [ 'Other than a few of the "encouraging" phrases being the opposite of calming ("buck up"? Really? How is that helpful when I\'m depressed?) its a pretty great game. I like the feature of being able to change time of day and weather. In general pretty calming and I gave 5 stars. But about half the messages just make me feel worse or make me roll my eyes. I tend to ignore them. The rest of the game is fantastic.',
       'Love the game but with the latest update one of the songs I love has been lost. Since hearing it been trying to find it and now I can\'t even listen to it while relaxing on my oasis. Please bring Sogaksgak, Tell you something. Or if it can\'t be brought back can the dev team let me know how to find it please it\'s such a lovely song and I keep coming across deadends trying to find it.',
       'I like this game but there are some aspects of it that confuse me. I don\'t understand the point of resetting the Oasis if I\'m just going to lose everything I worked hard to earn and upgrade. Is resetting the only way to play in the other worlds? Also I reset and am now in the star world and none of my blessings stayed like the game said they should. Please explain the full point to resetting the Oasis, other then remembrance shards.',
       'This is a really nice game! But I find the controls a bit wierd it always relaxes me...I\'ve not been able to stop playing ever since I got it! My Oasis reminds me of Abyss Rium relaxing and the graphics are very similiar and same with the gameplay c; It doesn\'t make me rage this relaxes me I reccomend this if your ok with loads of ads coming up and guaranteeing rewards -_- yeah I don\'t like that part :^ But this still is really nice game',
       'This is a good game for those which are wanting to become more mindful and less stressed. It is very relaxing and calming. I think that the game would be a lot better if it were slightly more complicated and if there were more controls. For example being able to zoom in further,being able to look at the animals up close,being able to walk on the oasis. Etc. Overall It a good game that I can get repetitive.',
       'In a nutshell it\'s an oasis full of ads. Every task requires watching an ad. It\'s an ad sanctuary. O_o Takes forever to gain points, build and get to new levels. I\'ll be honest it wasn\'t what I was expecting at all. Not really relaxing...more so time consuming than anything. I also wouldn\'t call it a "game". It\'s more like an endless tap/trap to watch ads app.' ],

       'The game is very good but the thing is that when merlok is like "hmm, not sure if Ava gog all the bugs out..." and it tells me to go on the Nexo scan thing (it\'s the only thing i can do anyway because its forcing me to) and it plays the nexo scan sound with the screen dark at the same time and then it suddenly goes all quiet with the music stops playing and it does NOTHING!!!! ITS REALLY FRUSTRATING!!! FIX.   IT.    NOW!!!',

They try to make it all sound good but it\'s not. They also changed the customer service on here where it\'s hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!',

IN order to even play you will need to Start with chips over 5 Billion chips.( which you don\'t get) Otherwise you will never even have a fighting chance, as you will be betting low and never gaining.... Or get high.. lose all quick. And then quit.. Or You can Pay out of your pocket.. over and over....',

Graphics are on point, better than 2nd Gen consoles, lesser than 3rd gen. If this game came out in the age of the PS2 I would have bought it. Also, buy a box because this game couldn\'t have been cheap to make. This game should cost like $25.',

     [ 'Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it\'s just my phone. Also I\'m not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)',
       'I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the "mine" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it\'s nicely done!',
       'I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.',
       'Overall the app is really great. It\'s the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you\'re not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.',
       'Input delays keep getting me killed. Instead of marking a bomb my input sets it off. I\'d prefer two different inputs for marking or removing tiles.  I\'m using a stylus too so I know it\'s not an issue of accidentally hitting the wrong tile.',
       'excellent game & one of the best minesweeper apps on the market EXCEPT there\'s no zoom in feature! makes it impossible to play harder modes on a phone cuz you keep accidentally tapping mines when you\'re trying to clear the spot next to it :(' ],

     [ 'I\'ve been playing this game for only a total of 10 minutes, but so far, it has been enjoyable. The game delivers on exactly what it presents to be. It is a crisp, clean, smooth running, first person target shooting game. It is simple in design and very easy to play. Touch your screen, drag to aim, align your sight on target, and release to fire. The sound of the rifle firing is very enjoyable, as are the "hit target" sounds, the reward/level up music, and the "successful stage" jingles. If my opinion changes after further examination, I will be certain to edit this review accordingly.',
       'First higher stakes multiplayer and it appeared that the opponent cheated. The time ran out for them to shoot but the game then froze. I was able to change guns, sent emotes, etc. and I was connected to a stable internet connection. I waited 20 minutes until finally sending the game yo the background so I could google if it was a cheat. Low behold I instantly lost all of my coins. Dont waste your time with this game, poorly made and cheaters will take all of your coins in multiplayer.',
       'Lots of fun. Simple yet difficult to master. I play everyday. I like the variety of targets. Purchasing option doesnt work. I tried to buy $4.99 of coins in the app. It took my money  but it never added the coins to my score. Google Play credited the amount back to me. Good app overall.',
       'I suppose I need a stylus for this bc using my finger makes it too hard to get the accuracy right... However, it\'s a really fun game. I\'d suggest lowering the amount of drift a little bit. Thanks mobrix for a enjoyable shooting Sim!!!',
       'Uninstalled after 10 mins. Too many pop ups for other games plus the lengthy ads that you can\'t get out of. Great game otherwise.',
       'It is about slowly balancing your gun to release and take the shot within a set time limit but not quite as easy when you actually try. This makes it a challenge to perfect hand eye coordination so that makes for a good game.' ],

     [ 'To many ads, even if they make the game free.. Pathetic. Conflicts with game when trying to back out of them and even crashes. Inconsistent game play, twitchy controls at times. Unplayable shots where one number on power scale is to hard the next one down is to soft.  Multi player has a feel of being rigged at times.  Potential for a good game but not yet in my books.',
       'Super fun game, but WAY TOO MANY crashes. I\'ve been struggling with a level several times only for the game to crash mid-level and I lose all my progress getting booted back to the beginning. Infuriating!',
       'Some observations: ball does not rebound off rails as they should, especially the back and side rails near the hole, where the ball hits the rail and stops dead. Part of miniature golf mastery is using the rails but not in this game. And when the ball is against a rail a shot is allowed as if the rail was not present. After a shot the screen should automatically rotate close to what the next shot would be expected so as to minimize manual rotation. I was making a long swipe to rotate almost 180° and my finger hit the power slide and an errant shot was made. Most hills are not smoothly sloped but instead very angular. Hitting the bottom of the slope causes the ball to jump in ways unanticipated rather than roll. This is golf, not basketball. I uninstalled the game because it just wasn\'t as fun and realistic as I had hoped.',

     [ 'Alright, so the game is pretty good. All I ask for is more tricks, and the ability to upgrade some bonuses (coin magnet, feather hover thing, and the third one that I haven\'t grabbed yet.) All in all, if you could do that, it\'d make the game so much greater. Apart from skipping missions and revives there\'s no use for coins.',
       'The thing that makes this game great is the visuals and the audio. It is absulutley beautiful and the art style works so well with the type of game. Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I\'d very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there\'s a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style',
       'First off, I\'d like to give a big thank you to the developers for this game. It\'s amazing.  However, I\'ve been encountering quite a few bugs lately. One day, picking up a hover feather crashed the game. Today, I can\'t pick up llama horns, and the background blur that happens when you go into the workshop stayed into an actual run. I took this as a challenge and continued playing. I\'m on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 9.7 running Android Marshmallow.  This is just to tip you guys off on some bugs.',
       'Good graphics, but can get boring after only like 3 minutes. Also the makers of the game should add a another different mode where your running away from a villager/camper and see how far you can get. You could improve or modify this mode that i have made if you want',
       'The game is addictive, but i cannot play it more than 10 minutes at a time, because it gets boring. The awful part is that since 1 week, i dunno why, it crashes while i\'m playing.. Anyway, it\'s addictive because after you start playing, you start thinking about it while you\'re not playing',
       'Was really enjoying it until the most recent update. You guys broke the ad version. Now no ads play to get a revive. Disappointing as it was working fine. Why oh why did I say yes to the update? It\'s as if you wanted to force free players to buy the paid version.' ],

     [ '+ Improved the Premium Alto\'s Adventure experience! To get back into the action faster, Premium users now receive one revive for free per run.',

The rooftop stage is unfair, you cannot avoid obstacles because either the controls don\'t work or because you don\'t have enough reaction time. And restarting from the beginning gets very boring very quickly.',

When you are playing a game where responsive controls matter, having them fail about every 20th swipe is unacceptable.  The other disappointing thing is that Batman is the only one that says anything.  I worked my way to get Robin and when he didn\'t say anything, I was completely turned off from the game.' ],

The only thing is that I was hoping for some sort of introduction to the game, to tell me how to play etc. Also, I was hoping to be able to choose what kind of ball i use, the black one is plain and kind of boring. But overall its an amazing game!!',

     [ 'Great game. Loving it. I noticed when you go into the Alter, there is a note telling you your capacity limit at the bottom but in the Mana gem screen it doesn\'t tell you. Are you able to add this feature? I can never remember my mana creating limit.  If you make more mana than can fit in your mana storage line, you lose the excess.',
       'AWESOME!!! Originally, I was very reluctant to download this becuase I though it was going to be where you just sit and watch your character do everything for you. I HATE those types of games... This however is actually how I was really hoping it would turn out to be! You can move freely! The levels are linear and its not very open, but thats okay! You see each piece of equipment on your character when you wear it, which is absolutely essential to me! I will not play a game where my appearance does not change, so this has all in all met my expectations! Another RPG worthy of my collection! Thank you!!!',
       'What started out a 5 star wonderful game has dropped to a prime example of how Not to treat loyal players and followers. With the latest update to "rebalance" which stripped long time players of attack powers, levels and hit points the developers should take notice of how many people no longer spend valuable time on their offerings. This is sadly another one for the uninstall button because after months of grinding to improve my character to now basically start over isnt worth it',
       'It was bad enough what the update did to players characters.......but after your patch to supposedly take into account players objections about how their characters statistics were lowered,  my character lost another power level and 2 million in power after the patch. Absolutely pathetic how you have treated the players who have played this game. Perhaps I should contact some of my friends that are Bratva to represent me and voice my complaints. Have a nice day!',
       'Result of your update, invisible walls,  player getting stuck running like a idiot, you created a algorithm for a headless chicken, good thing I advised my friends NOT to download it, if it ain\'t broke don\'t fix it, g___dy b___s__t artist. I bet all the good reviews you got were done in your offices, shed or bedrooms, back to ye olde ps4.',
       'I am uninstalling this game unless you give me back my power and previous level before the update. You reduced my power, but all levels are at the same difficulty level. That is not adjusting difficulty, that is infuriating.' ],

The cloths aren\'t that bad, but they can be a little more pretty. They should make it for boys and girls, so you can dress up boys, and maybe the boys can take a girl on a date so, they could get married and then they can have children but, it would be a life cycle! They would start out as babies and grow on and get married!!! Hope you like my feedback!! P.S. Plz update the game!!!',

But first time I see it\'s logo I think it is borring. But this time I am really surprised to see it. This is the best game in world for girls. When I do all comments for other games they are not really good. But this game is the best. If you install it you like too. If you have any quari in this you can write and I will  check it. Thanks for reading this.',
       'I really like this game but when I played it, it froze up.  It froze up so bad that it wouldn\'t turn off and when it did, it wouln\'t turn on.  We actually had to get a new phone. I\'m sorry I gave you 3 stars but we had to actually buy a whole new phone.',
       'Well the game is good obvi, also I LOVE how you can acually talk to your contestants (srry if I spelt it wrong, I\'m 9) and it\'s just a great game, people keep saying the clothes are innapropriate but I think they look nice, and everyone is so nice on this game. There\'s just to much that this comment will be to long to read! XD THIS GAME IS AWESOME! 😍',
       'I like the game but 3 of the places are locked like all the other coco games i got, and im only 10 this is my mums phone its cracked so she gave it to me. i Gave the 4 out of 5 because its a good game please like.',
       'Ok. 1 star because kids play this. I\'m a kid. And we shouldn\'t be seeing cloths that show this much skin, it\'s a bad influence. Coco is going to get banned for being like this... A \'hot\' new look for some 8 yr olds. Please shut up,  give little kids something other than an app for future prostitutes, and fix all of your Inappropriate games. girls will start getting bad images of them self. You may be thinking this is just a game but really... Uninstall this from any child\'s device. And any other coco games.',
       'It is a good game but it has TOO MANY ADS and almost everything is locked. Seriously? HOW DO YOU THINK I CAN HAVE FUN IF I CAN\'T EVEN DO THE FUN PART OF THE GAME?Please let me ACTUALLY have fun.😢' ],

     [ 'I think this game is super awesome! And I LOVE how you can change the hair colors! the reason I didn\'t rate this game all of its stars is because, I can\'t find the pictures of the girls I made and saved, and you can\'t change the girls outfits, but don\'t let that stop you from getting this game because it\'s great!',
       'I I like it a little bit. but it needs more choices of the hat. I like changing  the hare. it is a very short game. so I am a little sad.',

     [ 'This is the most addictive flight simulator I have ever played. The game is fairly easy to progress through without having to spend any money. If I had to find one fault it would be that you can\'t reverse when on a runway which means some times you have no option but to crash your plane as there is very little room to turn around.',
       'So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game',
       'I\'ve been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn\'t force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game\'s development! :)',
       'Pretty cool app. I\'d like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it\'s pretty cool so far.',
       'A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job \'fun games for free\' 👏👌🖒☺',
       'Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you\'re having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.' ],

In the beginning it was working well, but after some time it would not work. It shows as you can get for free, but even if I click on it many times it would not show an ad, and so does not unlock. My mobile data is  working properly. Plz kaka sure to check on this.Besides, it is one of my favorite games. I absolutely love it. And thnx in advance.',
       'This game is so stupid I watched a video for a new song and it messed up my hairand my makeup. My hair was three colors but the main color was blue and then it was purple and I put on some makeup and then after the video I didn\'t even have any make up on.So would give this game one star.This game should be better.',
       'Can Coco games stop being so racist and steriotypical? What ever happened to diversity? Its always the main character as some white girl with blonde hair! My baby sister loves the games but always wants to choose what her character will look! Where are the asians, colored people etc?! Please fix this CoCo!',
       'Why do we have to pay to get everything? Tbh the game is not all that I ain\'t trying to waste my money. It gets so boring with the little choice of everything we have. I\'m sure a lot of people agree with me I mean come on...If you can make these games better I\'ll give a 5 star but rn its a 3 star sorry.' ],

     [ 'Definitely a game for car buffs. It requires using your "mind" to win. I\'m not to sure about my rating yet. But, will definitely change if needed. It\'s unlike any game I\'ve played & I like it! Someone wrote a review that this is a lazy person\'s game... LMAØ, I wish they would show me the games they play while they are running, swimming & mountain climbing "while" they play, smh HAHA!',
       'Incredible game. Awesome concept. Two complaints to developers. High speed loop-when you win, it starts detracting points. And also certain mph based drag races,I run out of road but the challenging car gets like 60 miles of road. Besides these, fantastic game.',
       'I think this game is amazing! And is perfectly good in every way!! I can\'t stop playing and look forward to getting new cars. There is just one tiny error that bugs me a bit but I can cope with it. The error is the color of the Ford fiesta xr2. When you race someone else and they have this vehicle on the card the car is black with a tiny red trim on the side but when it\'s on the track it is completely red. I do hope you can will fix this small mistake but apart from that this game is great!!! Thanks for reading :)',
       'I love the concept and it\'s been great to see how far this game has come, but I\'ve been playing since beta and nearly every update wipes my save data and forces me to restart. Luckily, I don\'t get too far into the game each time, but it is frustrating and enough of a buzz kill for me to drop two stars. If there was a cloud system implemented for saves this game would be a five star in my book',
       'Multiplayer is not fair. Have the same car with lower 0-60 time better traction, and higher mph but still lose. Match play is getting worse. I either have to spend a boatload of money or always come in last place.',
       'This is an amazing game and I think Hutch Games did an amazing job putting the collecting and racing features of the game together. Buying packs is very expensive, but in some ways it is a nice challenge to work hard to get the thrill of opening a pack. I love being able to collect and race so many real cars. For a suggestion however, I think it would add a lot to the game if Hutch Games made it so there was a section where you could put the cars that your keeping only for collecting. It would just be easier to get them away from the cards that your using to race.' ],

The game could include a shop to buy things such as powerups or different colours and styles of jetski and some more creative adventures could get the game into a very interesting zone!',
       'Very fun, I love it In this game you can choose your players, Tom or Angela. Then you can ride and you try to get as far as you can throughout the obstacles and challenges. You also try to collect stars along the way. However many stars you collect determines your score. This app will keep your scores and will let you know if you get a high score. When you run into something you have the option to keep going if you watch an advertisement. This app is not boring at all. It works great and doesn\'t take up much space.',

     [ 'Great, but really needs "sell all" function for dealing with store house and "pecial buildings" components.This is a really quality game, looks amazing, works well and has good timed construction projects. However, as others mention it takes SOOOOOOO long to accrue the assets for construction and the mega bucks for expansion. You have to be VERY patient if you are not willing to part with actual cash. An idea might be to offer a conversion of coins to megabuck, maybe get 1 buck in excahge for eg 5,000,000 coins?',
       'lnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'I love this game. Just like other reviews say, it is addicting and because there are constant tasks to complete. Plus!..unlike other games, there is no way you ruin out of coins/money. The cities bring in alot. I can\'t agree with one reviewer that megabucks are hard not come by.  I began with 25 I believe (now at 32) and some of the tasks to complete give megabucks without spending actual money to even purchase some.  All in all, try this game and you won\'t run bored of it.',
       'The new update is great! Really appreciate the chat system. But it could be better... maybe add some functionality to the capital buildings and states.... maybe bonuses to taxes nd pop, loans, and coop science and military missions. The prices of capital building materials is ridiculous. Fixing these will make the state system look more complete.',
       'Best game!! Very addictive, Been playing this game for over a year.. although, there are still alot to improve!  I hope the developers will include edit mode in the next update so that the players can rearrange their city..Also, I hope they will also include a 360 rotation of the city and add factories that can also create materials needed in the game like the railroad materials and steels. I am looking forward with this updates!!',
       'Been playing for more than 3 years, i lost count. But this is a wonderful game which encourages teamwork and neighbor support. There are barely any paywalls in this game and  if you have hundreds of facebook friends who have this game you can easily get the materials you need to expand your city. No limits so far.

     [ 'So I\'m changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it\'s a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I\'d rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!',
       'GAME CODE reveals ROLLS ARE NOT RANDOM - they\'re pulled from a table of predertirmined outcomes, designed to MILK YOU FOR MONEY at a set rate, based on PvP, reg. Game, Event, Boss, etc.  Just like slot machines & video poker (which i programme).  You must \'assemble\' high scoring games, like a puzzle, with majority of yahtzees sitting after 4 or 8 rolls (1 or 7 bonus \'dice\'(money) spent)... Like a choose your own adventure book that can cost Hundreds of Dollars.',
       'Scopely is the most greedy, disgusting company I have ever seen. The ads they have littered into the game play literally crash the game at least 4 times during a match. You will see about 10 ads on top of the crashing per game; you could be in mid roll and the ad will ruin it. So desperate for money.. Don\'t support scopelys terrible practices.',
       'This game cheats! Don\'t get me wrong, I love it and am going to keep playing. But WAY more often than it should, it tallies up your opponents score wrong to make you lose. I count and take screen shots. If you get upset at things like that, it isn\'t for you. But if you don\'t care that much, like me, it\'s absolute fun! Adorable names given! Awesome dice to win! Very entertaining! Battle real people or the game! Just don\'t be a sore loser even when mathematically your a winner!',
       'Horrible game, stupid graphics looks like a preschooler did it, games are definitely rigged you hardly ever beat the house. To much stuff going on on this board you have no clue where to go to get to anything. The old game was easier to navigate. You should give people the option to keep the old game.',
       'Too many ads, basically requires you to buy dice. Literally the only way to ensure a win is to have dice for re-rolls. This wouldn\'t be a problem except you\'ll hardly ever win dice with the scratchers, and when you do it\'ll be one.  It\'s all a cash grab, and the ads every 3 or 4 rolls are intrusive, frequently locked in, and always very annoying. Gameplay itself is simple but just way too many ads.' ],

     [ 'I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.',
       'I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn\'t work.  So I pressed the \'X\' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I\'m pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE \'X\'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I\'m triggered.  Please fix that.',
       'I really, really love this game, but, I keep losing my ball count and I don\'t understand why this is happening. For instance, I have 90 balls and I\'m supposed to have 92, I don\'t get the 92. I will give 5 stars until the bug is fixed. The ads I don\'t care about because that only happens at the end of each game which is ok. Please fix this so I can give you 5 stars.  Update- I figured out why I keep losing my count with my balls. Everytime I get the balls by the number blocks, it wouldn\'t count them😐 I could get a lot further if this was fixed. If this keeps on happening, I\'m going to uninstall this game. I hope it doesn\'t come to that because I really love this game. Please fix asap!!',
       'If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.',
       'It\'s good at first but you\'ll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.',
       'Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I\'m not spoiling it, but I will tell you it\'s a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don\'t know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.' ],

Had to close out of the game every time so I just quit playing. Typo many similar more challenging games out there to try and work with this one.',

       'I thought the new scenario was a free-trial only like the simian flu. (At least you can unlock it after being a brutal pro at the game) I\'m gonna enjoy playing this a good few times and unlock even MORE scenarios. Keep up the good work! I wanted to make a suggestion, but I just can\'t remember now. Oh well...',
       'Fun game. I wish the rate of death was more consistent. 37,000,000 a day at one point, but waiting 6 months for 100,000 to die towards the end. The disease didn\'t change, the rate of death shouldn\'t decrease just because there are fewer people. Good game otherwise',
       'The game is addictive but when you get to a certain point the cure kicks in and it stops giving away DNA points and it makes it hard to advance in the game. I have read the hints in the news it gives, but I still can\'t manage to beat the game. I want to delete the game. Butim going to continue to try. I just wanted to mention it idk if its the game or just me. I won\'t tell others about the game only because its frustrating to play. These games are not good for people to play that has any type of mental issue unless they want to buy a new phone.',

     [ 'This game is great, it\'s a lot of fun. Until it decides that you\'re not allowed to pass the loading screen.  Then there\'s the premium store. The pricing is pretty outrageous for a mobile game. $35 for a t5? I paid less than that for my Matilda IV on WOT. Please address this issue. So we can actually show you our patronage. You occupy our spare 15 minutes. Not hours daily. Think of where this is played and charge accordinly. That\'s all I have to say.',
       'Haifuri brought me here I am sure this will be a pretty interesting game. I heard hsf harekaze and hsf spee is going to be here cant wait for it....  I encountered a game bug.. I was using a destroyer class ship and the steering wheel won\'t turned after I  pressed the left steer the ship just went on spinning left...please resolve this issue\'s',
       'I do like this game. The support team is good and are helpful when they can be. But the silver and points awarded are much too low in my opinion, when in comparison to the costs of modules and supplies consumed during battles. Also the supply crates could stand to be better. The ships are pretty awesome and are very well rendered. Very good graphics. Everything runs smoothly with no lag or server issues.',
       'Connection issues. Don\'t bother with playing on hotel Wi-Fi. The mcDs or the coffee shop. Forget about it on 3G. Because you need to have a full wired connection just to not hop around the map with the superb lag spikes. Spending tons of time shooting and hitting the enemy getting zero registry. In short good looking game spent hundreds of hours on the desktop version. But this doesn\'t seem keenly executed. Not connected to my desktop account? Why bother?',
       'This is a great game!!.  Yes, computers have issues, yes its short then the PC version.  This is not a PC.  This is a great 5 minute break.  I play the PC game too.  Its flipping fantastic.  The programmers at WOW are brilliant  and they care about the product.  If you love histroy, Warships, strategic games pitting you against other human players.  GET THIS YOUR GAME.  There are other warship games.  None get it more right then WOW.',
       'The games mechanics and controls need an overhaul. The secondary weapons should be automated as fast firing ships operating in touch screen controls requires immense micro management. Second, the post battle screen graphs extremely limited battle details and the UI is equally as lacking in features and navigation. Finally, the battle time is far to short and the majority of battles are ended with ships still in action on both teams. Potential to be a 5 star rating when the mechanics become as user friendly as they they are on PC.' ],

It looks like someone spray painted their hair gold and then glued jewels on it. I also wish there could be more types of zombies. The idea of endless is cool but please add the zombies to the campaign.',

       'I play real poker and do pretty well. This game is clearly made to force you to lose your chips and buy chips. They are obvious bots, and the amount of time I have a great hand on a turned and get called by absolutely  nothing but lose on the river is just unreal. I understand it happens, but it happens way too often in this. I have spent alot of real money on thia game in the past, and now I just remembered why I actually stopped playing it',
       'I would like the game very much never had to spend it on time kind of addictive. I can figure the game out sometimes very easily other times not. You can usually tell whether you\'re going to be lucky (those are the times to hit the slot machine while you\'re playing). Sometimes the hardest part e dealing with it dummies who think it\'s bingo. And sometimes I got to admit how you had enough time and I\'ll play that way too but that\'s usually when the game teaches you a lesson at other times it\'s very predictable and I know that I\'m going to get that hand but it\'s fun',
       'Fun game. Most of what I know about this game, I\'ve actually learned by playing it on this app. And yes, it\'s very addictive!! And yes, anyone with negative comments???...they haven\'t taken the time to REALLY know & learn the game & it\'s rules. Just because ya lose...doesn\'t make it a bad game!! LEARN THE GAME & ITS RULES, SPEND A LITTLE TIME ACTUALLY PLAYING, (WITH GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP)...AND YOU\'LL LOVE IT. The more ya play, the better it gets!!',
       'More ad pushes and Facebook posting than anything I\'ve over downloaded. Posts without asking and you can\'t play a single game without 20 notifications asking you to spend money or share it with friends. Popular game but can\'t do anything for 10 minutes after opening app until you sift through all the nonsense they throw at you.' ],

There\'s ads constantly, any time you resume playing from the screen going to sleep, or if you wreck there\'s one right across the middle of the screen!

If I was waiting for it to load an ad in the first place, I have to watch that one first, then a second one as punishment for the screen time out. 😒😒 Not cool Loading times plus ad videos constantly, equates to more than time spent playing. It\'s miserable. LG V20 on Tmo and 100Mbps wifi',

     [ 'This is a very entertaining game that is simple to play. It has provided me with hours of fun! The only thing is that I wish there were more combinations, there are things I\'ve tried that you\'d think would make something but don\'t. For example, Crayon (or Pencil, or Charcoal, or Paint) + Paper does not make Art.',
       'The interface is not so good. Big icons are not convenient, we have to scroll down long everytime, I could only imagine how much effort would it take if I had 500 items discovered. Please make icons small or a different tab just for icons or just make it like little alchemy one.',
       'This game is pretty addicting. I get stuck sometimes but I always find something new.  Small issue though, I it won\'t let me pull rust out onto the screen for some reason. I\'ve used it before, but now it won\'t let me use it anymore. Perhaps it is an issue with my phone rather than a glitch in the app.',
       'This is leagues better than the original alchemy game. There were a lot of bugs but they\'ve all more or less been patched out. It took me 2 months of playing everyday to get all of the items and combinations cleared.',
       'I love this game so much. I\'m stuck on trying to make life but it\'s not frustrating it\'s challenging and I like it. Also, for all the people getting pissed off because the items disappear and you cant \'use\' them anymore it\'s because you can\'t combine them with anything anymore so it is put in your encyclopedia so that doesn\'t waste space for the things you can use, it\'s actually a very smart game mechanic. I\'m pretty sure it even says that in the tutorial. I also like how they didn\'t take the same combination formulas from the first game and instead added new ways to achieve the same product in a more realistic way, also there is so many items to create! So I think that this is an all around great game. Good job developers. Good job indeed.',
       'Its a cool game. If you press the hint button it gives you a choice to watch a ad for help. I am not seeing in-app purchases so far and I have had this game for a while!

     [ 'It\'s fun for the first two weeks. Then the talk show personality starts to get annoying with the same lines and it just gets repetitive. And not to mention the game starts to really lag when they get over 600k players (take in mind it seems they always wait for the game to start until they get 1 million players). Again fun at first but it soon looses it\'s shine not long after. This is an app to come and go. Cool thing is it\'s free and it\'s trivia questions that are really hard and random. Good luck!',
       'Great and addicting fun. You might not win at first but once you do it\'s so satisfying, making you want to come back for more. My only gripe is the lives as you have very little, but if you do want a guaranteed one use my code: Michlale',
       'Game is fun but almost every time I play the app freezes at some point and I get eliminated in the time it takes to catch back up or restart the app. I have a pixel 2 so phone speed shouldn\'t be an issue. At this current state there isn\'t much point going for the prize when the app will physically present me from progressing',
       'The game used to be fun and challenging. But now that I\'ve been streamed into the European game rather than the American game I hardly know any answers. We may write the Queen\'s English in Canada, but we usually have no idea what is common culture in the UK. We watch American programming. Switch us Canucks back. SITUATION FIXED',
       'I\'ve been playing since the beginning of February, but have yet to win. It\'s beginning to lose its appeal, but when I always try to play when it\'s on.  I have recently lost a life though, for some reason, although I have not asked to use a life, which is annoying. This is another thing that detracts me from using this app',
       'Game has lag time bad. Tonight I couldn\'t see the question until after the answer was read, eliminating me. I have a great phone,  Samsung s7, problem is on their end... too much traffic for their servers I believe. Need ways to get more lives too. I referred someone but never got a life. System should be smooth as silk when there are over a million players.' ],

     [ 'It was undoubtedly one of a kind and perfect game at the time of it\'s release. Everything from balancing to controls and gameplay was perfect. Until.....until developers thought of this "awesome" idea of putting it on steam and allowing PC community to play it. The game that was originally designed for mobile users now overwhelmed with PC users. I mean how devs thought that\'s a good idea to compare PC to mobile??? PC players are right now literally annihilating every mobile gamer. We have no chance against them they\'re better in everything from controls to aiming shooting. Once beloved game now lays in ruins conquered by PC community.',
       'I would like to have the game on my phone that way i can spend money on the game instead of on tablet as it is more comfortable. The game costs over 3gb! My phone has that but with all the apps that come with the phone that you cannot remove. I have only over 1gb. Sorry wargaming the game costs too much data. Once that is fixed ill change rating given and review. I would play the game if it costed one gigabyte.',
       'This game has great graphics, great controls, great features. Why only 3 stars then? It seems to be so heavily rigged and winning is almost never. With premium account you will advance quicker but i don\'t believe i am alone with my opinion that you will quit this game frustration winning. Since writing and thinking 3 was fair i have now reduced to a 1 as the email sent to the developing team bounced because their mail box is full. Wonder why!',
       'This game is completely pay to win and has a life supply of broken tanks that you need to buy and it\'s still 1s and 0s in the end. I also hate the fact it lacks modern tanks. Can they at least do a survey to see what the players want? Don\'t play this game it full with a bunch of idoits.',
       'This game is great in my opinion. Once you understand how everything works and the techniques while playing, winning becomes more common. My only little complaint is that since the last update i dont always recieve my 10 pieces of gold. Ill watch the 5 ads a day but only recieve 30 or 40 gold total. It would be nice if we got paid the 10 gold after every ad like how it used to be. Not everyone has the money or is willing to spend the money on gold. It would be great if this could get fixed. Thanks',
       'Before update it was easy to play on 100 to 150 ping. It was smooth. But after 4.6 ... It cant be smooth like before. It lags alot...and cant defend myself properly. Barely i cant shot someone with laggy gameplay because of ping. My normal ping is just b/w 100 to 180 ....and i cant get lesser than this. Plz do smthing. #wargaming' ],

     [ 'Very realistic and nice game. Missions and descriptions are entertaining. Controls are also great.   Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!',
       'Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!',
       'Its quite good but a little bit of fixing will do. The part "Slow Down thing" can you please please place that where it can not block the view of the player. It is very difficult to see whats behind it so it causes us players to crash. T.Y',
       'What is this. I was on level 1 and i just got to the last checkpoint and when I had to land it crashed when it took so much effort into going through them checkpoints. I recommend you do not get this game unless you are good with airplanes and have experience (which I do but this game just ruined it). I shall see this development soon.',
       'Why the hell they add brake when we cannot see the brake option even after landing which forces us to crash. Total stupidity do not waste time in downloading. Previously was better when there were no brakes just reverse it and stop or keep brake button always active.',
       'This game is horrible. THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS GAME HAD ONE JOB IT WAS TO MAKE A GOOD GAME AND THEY FAILED!!!!!! Don\'t download this game. The controls are horrible, the background is horrible and, the landings are not possible because of the background and the controls.

And the very last part is when i do a crime, huge police hordes coming after! I forced to mute my phone beacause i cant handle the p0lice weeooo wweeeeoooo!🚔🚓🚓🚔🚔 ROCK N ROLLL',
       'Great game but more like a sandbox game. The way you are looking will go off in random directions. Few glitches. Wish the sniper rifle had a scope. Wish there was different shooting mechanics. A little lag and too many damn ads there is even an ad for no ads.',

       'I love it! Except, when I blow up a police car while it\'s parked, it respawns and about 18 police cars are after me! Although, when that happens, I get killed and spawn on top of the tower with the helicopter and when I do, the police car that I blew up is driving around, crashing into walls, blowing up and then going back! I couldn\'t stop laughing. So... Nothing wrong (except for the load of police after me when I blow up that car), I love it, C ya!',
       'I loved it because you can get into people\'s car and then get out again then kill them because they are trying to kill you so kill them. and there is a tank and a helicopter in this game and I like it so you could kill people walking and get money or there bullets and wepends. that is why I love this game.',

But if you like games like guitar hero from the 2000\'s only without the weird hippies and nicer music, then this is the game for you. In my opinion the game is okay, not very interesting but a definite time burner. To many ads but if you dont mins that, then its fine.',

     [ 'Awesome game!  Earning money is easy especially with online play and watching ads.  ONLY downfall is earning gold can be a pain,  seem like the only way to get gold is by beating a boss, buying gold with real cash and levelling up which can take some time.  Other then that it\'s a very addictive game if you love BMX that is.  Folloq me on instagram @evans_customz',
       'Very good game but I wish there was a better way of getting gold without having to pay out of your hard working money. Since when did games start asking for cash? I would pay to buy the game but buying gold is stupid as hell.. either way very good game',
       'Stats are meaningless. I was getting beat consistently by a bike with lesser stats. My bike speed was rated at 16 and the other bike was 10 and I got no separation whatsoever. The stats are misleading and only serve to get you to spend real money.',
       'Great game that I would really enjoy putting some time in but it constantly starts to shutter and the frame rate slow way down and makes it impossible to hit your marks. I had a subscription but decided to cancel it because the game is unplayable. Please fix and Its a 5 star game and worth the subscription. (Galaxy Note8)',
       'THIS GAME WAS OK... I did not like this game because you battled people that was not your level so you never have a chance to win. The game is slow with the controls not much upgrades you can do either. I do not like this game and I\'m deleting this from my phone',
       'Cool little game with very few ads. The only downside is you have to buy gold to upgrade your bicycles so if you don\'t pay to win that\'s just a great time killer.' ],

     [ 'Love playing but have 2 suggestions. We need another mill.  When we have large orders to fill it takes forever to complete those orders because the mull is tied up all the time. Maybe every 40 levels add a mill purchase option. When selling on the market, we need an option for a blind add or a neighborhood only sell or trade.. make these upgrades and so far game would be perfect!',
       'It\'s great to be able to buy from other farms in theory. But there are WAY too many times that you click on something and it\'s either sold or not even in the roadside stand at all. The for sale paper needs to update quicker.  Also, it\'s very hard to accumulate any \'west bucks\' in this game and you need them to do almost anything, so the game is a big money suck too. I\'m deleting it.',
       'Update......I have learned there is a chat feature AND a neighborhood group you can create.....so excited to get to level 19!!!! Would give it a solid 5 stars if we could have an actual chat option with friends. Looking for a new game to get away from FV2, but can\'t find one with the same chat availability.  Add this and I am hooked!',
       'I love these type of games just like hayday. I have noticed it freezes and takes ages to load the newspaper. Also would be helpful if it could tell you who needs help in the newspaper would help filling orders quicker. Also I have noticed alot of people selling the same parts and harder to get others and it\'s extremely rare to get the land parts without paying',
       'The game doesnt give enough case vs things to buy or fix.  Also have issues with getting product into the alloted spaces.  I thought it was my screen but had it cleaned thoroughly and it still happens.  It takes several attempts!!!  The story is cute.  The graphics are cute as well.  Ive noticed it has a couple of choices from other games Ive played on older phones. I would suggest the game to others but get the issues fixed and itll be a 5star game.',
       'I love playing these games. I\'m not sure why we are rating gameplay they offer apps not a game. It\'s crazy how they ask us to rate game at the beginning of game. We haven\'t learned the bad points. This game makes us pay for treasure chest instead of giving us to them free like most games. Which means we have to pay for everything. Totally not fair. Takes the fun out of game.' ],

The second I get home I get undressed and play me some paper toss.  Thanks you guys over at paper Toss you really know how to have a great time. If you guys would like to hang out some time and toss some paper I\'d be down. hit me up some time',

I really enjoy using different objects to throw in place of the paper ball, which is actually my favorite. The fact that each object is affected differently by the fan makes this game flavorful. Really great job with this!!',

     [ 'It\'s a fun relaxing game. Its so addictive that every device I have, must have this game. I have it on my phone, ipad and tablet. Except my laptop cuz then I would get no work done. About the ads, one pops out each time you finish a game, so I\'m not to bothered by it. Also, theres no videos too watch in order to earn coins or diamonds because none are needed. I just love it. Its stress free.',
       'I really enjoy playing this game. It helps me to relax while I am watching TV, or even using in split mode while watching a video or something. It\'s a bit different then the way I originally used to play Klondike, but still a great game and easy to get used to quickly! I don\'t mind the 5 second or so ads between games. It\'s the price you pay to get a good, free game. It\'s not like they play constantly and during a game there is usually an ad on the bottom screen but it will quickly move if you go to start a new game or need to access the other options.',
       'I would have scored higher except there is suddenly super annoying music being played that there is no option to turn off. The ads also now autoplay loud music. I agree with another poster who said it starting to seem like you lose more so you see more ads. I liked this because it was good for a quick game while getting ready to sleep. The music ruins this. I\'m going to try another app now.',
       'I love the game solitaire played it on many different computers over the years. Downloaded three other version on my phone. All of which I deleted almost straight away because they were finicky and I didn\'t like the format. This one is easy to use and no glitches. So far so good.',
       'Terrible ads. So bad they hid the menu bar behind an ad banner so you click the ads just to access settings. Pretty sure they recently increased losing deal rate to make more ad videos play. So many other solitaire aps available so skip this one.',
       'I play solitaire to look busy in public. My brow furrows a bit so it probably looks important. I have social anxiety. I was informed that a 5* review would let me bypass ads, which are sometimes loud and totally give away the fact that I\'m doing something useless.' ],

Pull this app now!!',
       'Ads are everywhere in this game. For a 2 year old who doesn\'t understand  how to exit out of the ad is frustrating. Ya, you have the ad free option for $2.99 but when I searched for "free apps for 2 year olds" this shouldn\'t come up in the search. Apps for toddlers should never have ads in them.',

There\'s about 9 categories I think so it doesn\'t ever get boring- you can choose from many different shapes. The only complaint is the ads are getting worse -  it used to be just at the bottom where my son could accidently press it, but now they actually appear overriding the game and you have to watch for 30 sec and can\'t exit... Hard for a child to understand he has to wait to get back to his game. If it gets any worse my rating will go down.',
       'This app almost hits the mark, but could use a few tweaks to make it better for toddlers. My not-quite-2yo goddaughter gets the concept and likes the idea of matching shapes, but she gets frustrated because when she drags a shape over to its match, unless it is situated *exactly* over it, it won\'t drop into place. It requires a level of precision and dexterity that I think is a little beyond a 2yo. She then loses interest and backs out of the app. Would it be possible to increase the boundaries of the drop area?',
       'Wayyyyyyy too many adds. Game is great but literally after every puzzle which takes 3 mins or less to do for a 2yr old there are 2- 3 ads!!!' ],

The only issue I have is in survival mode there doesn\'t seem to be enough cows, and I have only managed to make some shoe armor. But then again, there\'s a lot I haven\'t figured out yet, but it\'s been fun learning.',
       'YAY! FINALLY A GAME LIKE MINECRAFT!!!!!!! Except it doesn\'t have stuff like the animals, buckets, iron doors eg. But what is the Nether react core? It is just a made up block. But please add stuff like levers, iron doors, animals, Redstone, Buttons, iron trapdoors, texture packs, adventure mode,  Redstone torch\'s, Hoppers, Ripeters, dimensions like the Nether and The End, And other stuff from the game, "Minecraft". Also, add skin packs and make it like people can see there hand, and add mobs like dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, and foxes. Dogs, Man\'s best friend. Cats, Always cute. Birds, Watch them well you build. Rabbits, See them jump. Foxes. See one on an adventure. Please Also pay for Minecraft if you want it for stuff like Creepers. Also, add farm animals like chickens, sheep, cows, And other stuff like that. But plz do it. Also, add all paintings, pictures from Minecraft, and caves. I will Enjoy the game more if you do. Bye!',
       'Love the game! My only problem is that for some reason, when I grow wheat and try to get a cow to follow me, well they just ignore me. I haven\'t been able to find carrots for the pigs either. Frankly, I would like to be able breed animals pure and simple. Otherwise good job',
       'It is a nice game but it is just shot of (some) things.. e.g animals, red stone ,pail (can contain milk ,water and lava or it can be empty) , red stone torch, paintings (diffirent sizes),mobs. Also, it would be nice if you can label the items that we picked so that it would be easier for us to pick the item that we want. I hope you can add some more items into the game.it will be more thrilling to play. Thanks' ],

     [ 'Your game is cool and addictive. Just what i was looking for. Nice graphics,decent gameplay,fun racing and awesome rewards. It\'s my favourite game, i play it everyday. But only one problem, everytime it asks to download additional files. I had already downloaded it but still i recive this pop up message. Is this game online ?? If it is then please make it offline..plzzzzz.',
       'Its an overall addictive game but instructions wise it needs to be more giving. You dont really understand whats our task sometimes. Also i think there is a problem with the sensor or something. I mean i do swipe my finger across the screen but the car doesnt move. I have to literally do that twice or thrice sometimes. This makes me lose out. Its not really my phone as everything else works fine.',
       'The update has killed what was a great game. You now can\'t pass a level unless you get 3 stars. Meeting the objectives for 1 or 2 stars causes a glitch, where it tells you you\'re out of time, offers you the opportunity to buy more time (fuel?), or recommends you upgrade your car. The daily log-in prizes don\'t worry either. Please fix it, you broke something that was very enjoyable.',
       'It\'s a nice game to play, i always play with my son.  But do u hv new update on this game? Ive reached lvl100 and my cars were fully upgtaded few months ago.. and it start getting bored already if there\'re no new lvl',
       'The tracks have unnecessary curves that makes the whole game very disorienting when at high speeds. Also, the app seems to not sensing my finger and never switch tracks at the right time. Hope you can improve.',
       'Good for 5 minutes but no more. I was sad enough to get to level 99 but it\'s impossible to complete this game. The final boss is too fast for me having a fully upgraded lightning McQueen.' ],

     [ 'Amazing game, great time-killer. I discovered a game breaker: if you go into the settings after you die, the number of coins you got in that level, [the number in the brackets] becomes equal to the total number of coins. Keep going back and forth into the settings, and the game will eventually ask if you want to triple the coins by watching a video. Instead of tripling the number of coins you got in that level, the number of total coins you have gets tripled.  Instantly triple your wallet every run.  I want the devs to see this and see if they can patch it because I really like this game and I want the coins I earn to be legit.  Thanks for your time, Mike C.',
       'It has a progression system, but it\'s completely worthless. The only reason to try to win belts is to get weapons that serve no purpose. You can win most of them by paying 200 coins and getting a random one, but you can, for some odd reason, get duplicates. Not to mention the fact that coin combos actually do nothing, not even useless cosmetic items, nothing. I think adding function to the weapons (e.g. Making long swords slightly longer range or making small weapons quicker) could add more depth and more of a reason to play the game. Overall: It\'s a good timekiller.',
       'Great game. Best for killing time. Great concept. Need to add a  counter for counting the number of people killed, otherwise awesome. Also there is not much incentive to play to win belts. Make playing with boss again free. Add new opponents (not bosses but the minions) . Make the game a little less challenging. Also remove the brief stun completely',
       'Really fun game. Nice graphics and simple controls. More depth to combat system would be nice. There is no point in achieving coin combos. It does not affect the amount of coins won. Add a multiplier for coin combos, as well as a score multiplier for chaining combos together without missing enemies or coins. Don\'t allow duplicate items to be won. Very annoying to grind and grind for coins, only to get a duplicate you can\'t do anything with. Lastly, an option to pay to disable ads would be nice.',
       'Good game. Though it could be better. Make range on weapons and protection when you have armor on. Then you should be able to unlock new settings besides the train. Multiplayer would be cool. Another (and the last) thing you could implement is a way for you to go back and beat the bosses you defeated already to earn money. Despite all the flaws I\'ve stated, it\'s a good game and time killer.',
       'The game gives you an unskippable mission to get kills with a certain type of weapon and then will never give you that weapon. I\'ve opened over 100 chests and never got a two handed sword, so my options are pay real money for the the weapon (what they want) or delete this cancer app. I get you have to make money but there are better ways than stopping all progression and ruining the fun. Overall good game 6.7/10' ],

       'The game itself is very fun to play and very entertaining, however, the points system is a bit off. The reason for that is it not about the distant (which I like about) it about how many overtake you can take in a single game. That is what I dislike about this game. Also the cars... Not a lot of cars (need more). Few questions: Will there be such thing as upgrade speed or car customization?

    description: 'Put your engineering skills, intuition and smarts to test in this brand new Bridge Construction Simulator puzzle game. You will become a constructor who is required to improvise and – most of all – adapt to the task at hand. Use your resources to construct structures able to hold the weight of a car. Try to become a good builder as fast as you can - things will get hard. You won\'t be racing against the time, so be a careful and thoughtful constructor.You will design and construct increasingly elaborate bridges across four varied locations. Each one is a different logic puzzle for a thoughtful builder. Things may seem easy when you start out in a city, but once you move to the canyon, valley and finally mountains it will get hard. The task is never impossible, but the size and resilience of your structures will have to increase substantially if you don\'t want to be responsible for a car crash. Use your logic and skill to become a master bridge builder and break some records along the way!In addition to the normal mode Bridge Construction Simulator offers an easy (for an increased budget and more flexibility) or hard one (for an ultimate, seemingly impossible puzzle challenge that will be able to break even the best builder). There is something for a constructor of every skill level. If you find yourself in a tight spot, a hint system will help guide you to the solution and help you build your skill as a builder. Use the help provided to construct bridges that will not break.The game is a simulator that makes extensive use of realistic physics. As the car drives through the construction you\'ve built you will see it stretch and bend. That way even if you fail you can see the weak points of your construction and use your logic to improve it. Build with your brain and you will be good.Realistic and detailed graphics make every level of Bridge Construction Simulator come to life and even offer a slight consolation when you fail as a constructor. Because when your bridge collapses and the car falls down, you can at least expect a spectacular crash! Just enjoy it and don\'t let it break you - muster your skill and try again! Nothing is ever impossible for an ambitious constructor. Play and become a legendary bridge builder!Game features:- Superb physics - a true simulator - Multiple addictive levels across four different worlds- State of the art realistic graphics- Fantastic, varied and detailed environments - you won\'t get bored as you build - Spectacular special effects- Mind bending, challenging puzzles requiring the use of thought and logic - Varying skill levels for increased challenge or more relaxed gameplay - something for every constructor - Built-in hint system helps you build your skill',

       'Love it !!! Caught my eye when I saw "pick 2" vs. pick 3. I\'m a stay at home mom kids in school 6 days week that gives me time to burn   (lol) They did a couple small tweeks which  made the "typical pick 3 concept"a thing of the past (FINALLY) BUT WAS ENOUGH change to make it a keeper',
       'A truly fun, interesting & free game. A good game for any age. If you need to do something relaxing, this is a good way. You\'ll get hooked!!! I\'m in the 500\'s & it\'s still fun! The ads only require 1 more touch on the screen than you have been doing. Well worth it.',
       'I really like this game but newer version I have updated to after 3 months and I see the Hooray Sound in the end and some more sounds in between has been changed to Ticking kind of sound.   I seriously and kindly request to the developer to restore those sounds which were there in old versions because I seriously loved it. I wish those sounds can come back which makes the game more amazing.   And ofcourse I still continue to play this and have hope for those sounds to be back.',
       'I love playing games like this to relax, but on other similar games I can\'t stop myself from buying the stupid in app purchases all the time which makes me more stressed! This game is perfect because it\'s not so difficult that it\'s not fun and I don\'t have to worry about wasting my money on imaginary things!',
       'Not a clue if there\'s a story line, how the power ups work, the difference between the levels or what the deal with the chest is BUT it a cute fun game to pass the time with and relax with. It\'s challenging but I\'ve yet to get completely and frustratingly stuck. This feels like a game designed for fun not to make money though "buying lives"' ],

     [ 'Uninstalling. The controls are imprecise (ball would slip off the desired direction occasionally) and the order of the colours would make it impossible to win on occasion. I can forgive the first thing (muscle) but making it impossible to win is not forgivable.  Work on the algorithm.',
       'The game is alright, but I  have some frustrations with it. For one, sometimes when you release the ball, the aim will move suddenly and cause it to hit off of your intend target. Also, it isn\'t cool when you start a new level and you have no available moves (you can\'t pop any bubbles! ), Sometimes for a number of turns, sometimes in the middle or at the end of the level. Usually it is manageable enough. Still frustrating tho. Maybe it is an international challenge of the game..  Overall a decent game',
       'Games really nice good mind challenge, great for color match making if color blind. You may not know what colors your matching however, ever since i started playing i\'ve also been getting better at matching my clothes and random day to day organising of colored items. Love the game however the ball simetimes seems to go where it wants to instead of where you released it... I noticed this a few times i would aim let go and the line would randomly jump to a new spot and the ball shots almost a completely diffrent location',
       'Good for killing a bit of time.  Too many adverts and the sequence of colours appearing make levels impossible without playing lots of times. Used all the gained coins buying 20 extra balls for 1 level and still only had balls of a colour I couldn\'t hit... Ice balls make current level close to impossible. Just swapping where ice is without removing anything dozens of tries and not got even close to finishing.',
       'It was great at first. Addicting. I was really looking forward to more levels but they suck. Too many kinds of bubbles. Why did the update change old levels too? Major disappointment.  Edit 2/19/18: it was back to being great when they took away all the extra kinds of bubbles. But after a few hundred levels...they\'re back. Balls with three locks, slime, water bubbles or whatever that is. Lured people back in and then disappointed again.',

     [ 'I think this game is pretty cool! Also they added more houses to play in. I love multi-player because I like to see all the scores and I don\'t like the office because their\'s spiders and I hate spiders. I beat the Christmas level and I\'m trying to beat the other levels too. But when you start the game, it says choose cat and press it and there\'s a skinny cat with the ears    down. I choose the kitten. But I LOVE the garden level because you go on the slides and you can go in the house and go out of it and go on the carousel and more! But on the picture when you download the game, the cat is in the washer and in the fridge. But you can\'t do that in the game. I tried too. Its boring at first but it\'s fun! I also don\'t know where the cats house is. Is it in the first house? I TOTALLY love it.😀😀😀😀😀😀😁😁😁😁😺😺😺😺😺😺😸😸😸😸😸😸😻😻',
       'Its amazing also umm can u add like cat ears pierced plz it would be cool,amazing,cool xD Lol...AND SUB 2 BendallBunch',
       'It\'s an alright app I just think u should make it little bit better',
       'I love that I can destroy things. Thanks for letting me play the game. I think I look adorable as a kitten.',

    description: 'This is by far the most flexible word search app on the market. Multiple configuration options create a game that exactly corresponds to your device and your expertise.Play with an English word list or choose one of 23 other languages.Designed for fun games from the smallest mobile phones up to the largest tablets.Bored of seeing the same words appear repeatedly? Frustrated at looking for bizarre words that are not even English? Struggled with grids that are inappropriate for your device or difficult to read? Word Search Ultimate solves all these problems. You can configure:1) Grid size    Specify exactly how many columns and rows to use (from 3 to 20). Even non square grids (e.g. 12x15) are possible.2) Screen layout    Choose how much screen space for the grid and how much for the word list, using our unique movable split bar.3) Difficulty of the game    Specify approximate proportion of words that are written diagonally, backwards or vertically (e.g. allow no diagonal or backwards words, ideal for introducing children to Word Search).4) Difficulty of the words    Specify the size of the dictionary to generate a game, from the 500 most common words (good for kids and language students), up to 80,000 words.5) Maximum # of words    Choose the maximum number of words to find in one game, from 1 to 150. This will provide enough words to fill a 20x20 grid.6) Minimum & Maximum word length    This helps avoid searching for many small words (a common problem in word apps). Also useful for specifying really difficult games (e.g. set both minimum and maximum word length to three).7) Highlighting    Mark the already found words, or keep the grid unmarked and easy to read.8) Word list layout    The word list can be arranged in columns for easy reading, or close to each other to minimize screen space.9) Language    Choose the language of the word list, from a large range of downloadable dictionaries.  24 languages are currently available (see below).10) Orientation    Can be played in portrait or landscape mode. Just rotate your device and the display adjusts automatically.11) Word categories    Choose the words to find from a range of categories; e.g. animals, food etc.This app gives you the ultimate power to play the game just the way you want.Each game is assigned a difficulty level from 0 (easy) to 9 (very hard). The difficulty level is determined by the settings. Each difficulty level maintains the high scores (measured by fastest time to complete the game). The game displays the best 20 scores for each difficulty level.Compare your high scores with others around the world by using Google Play\'s "Game Services".Other features unique to this app:1) Two methods of selecting words: (i) the classic swipe (ii) by touching the first and last letter of the word from the grid.2) Game aid if you are having difficulty. You can choose to reveal a word that you cannot find.3) View the definition of the word from an online source (e.g. Wiktionary), optimized for viewing on a small screen.4) When you play with a word list in a foreign language, the word definition will (where possible) be in your own language. This is great for language learning!Additional Features planned for a future version of this app:1) Blind mode.  The word list is hidden. Instead you must find the words within the grid. Useful in combination with word categories.2) Play against others.3) Give us feedback on other features you would like to see.Dictionaries available are English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, French, German, Italian, Indonesian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Serbian(Latin), Serbian(Cyrillic), Slovak, Slovene, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian and more coming later',

     [ 'Enjoyable game, lots of freebies.  I now need to change up my review.i had made a purchase in the game during a "Spin and Win" promotion, that purchase stated that I would receive 10m chips for every 2k league points, at end of promotion, I did not receive any of my chips as promised per promotion advertising. I followed the process of getting in touch with Huuuge Casino and was told once that someone would be in touch with me, as of this listing I still have not heard back from anyone.',
       'I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won\'t give up.. And I\'m not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won\'t put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I\'ll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.',
       'So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em\' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.',
       'DO NOT BOTHER  playing this game. IT IS PAY TO PLAY. It used to be a really great game. Have met some really great people. Huge makes constant updates and each time they do, they pay less. People are leaving in droves to go to other games. YOU BLEW IT HUUGE!!',
       'I really enjoyed playing early on , payouts were nice and I really like the club I\'m in. Lately I\'ve noticed I don\'t get paid for all my winning spins, sometimes they would have been big payouts. Hit the same exact thing a few spins later and it will pay so I have to wind up buying more chips. Just like a real casino I don\'t expect to always win, but if I do hit something even a real casino pays so that needs t o be addressed.',
       'I buy tickets then I win that day have a good time I\'m spending over a thousand dollars each time on tickets. After midnight I can\'t win anything .... it happens every time! I\'m all excited from winning that don\'t want to stop so I blow thru the chips without thinking rationally because the adrenaline is pumping but afterwards I regret it because I remember how much I just spent on the tickets. I always thought I could build up my account ONE TIME and it would stay that way...I had that idea MANY months ago... the chips never last. I probably haven\'t been making the best decisions.' ],

The only bad thing is that there is kind of a lot of ads.But, that\'s fine! Its SUPER satisfying to me, and my sister! So, as you think, you should download this app.',

I want to stop deforestation and you need to , too! Hope this helped to put a stop to deforestation and to download this game  Bye😀',
       'I was forced to view 10   DIFFERENT ADS before ever even getting into this game.  I refuse to support money grubbers.  They (including Google) lack integrity are ruining this country.',
       'This is pretty sweet.  Its a great way to make stylized graphics  A lot of reviewers were complaining that it has a ton of ads tho, but you can get rid of them for 99 cents.  If you like this, dont whine just pay the piper or play something else.  Develepers have to eat, ya know???  If you want a free alternative, (or if you are curious about how this stuff works) i suggest looking into the open processing language.  You can learn to make your own cool stuff like this by finding a couple of algorithms online   Also, if you have a good graphics card in your pc/mac and you are interested in this stuff  check out touch designer.  You can make some really amazing realtime art  But seriously, support these developers if you like the program.  Its that simple.  99 cents is not much money!!  Ok luvya byebye',

     [ 'Awesome game I have basically mastered this game. Got a high score of 2,892,204. I made the highest tile which is 131,072. This game is amazing and requires intense focus. I lost focus for a second and a 4 appeared and I didn\'t notice. Messed me up when I was about to make the 65k tile',
       'best beain adict game. but 9 grid stage doesnt fulfill. not enough grid box. the Creator cheated. i m going to lodge a complaint against you. you ve to answer my brain😀 anyway superr game excellent',
       'The game is great, but the leaderboards are seriously messed up.  The top high scores are literally orders of magnitude higher than it is physically possible to get.  I would assume that they have been "hacked" somehow to display these fake scores.  The developer should cap the high score at the number that is literally the highest possible score (based on the size of the board)',
       'I enjoy 2048 alot. I play it alot and I would consider myself pretty good, my high score is 250,000. When i was building on that high score, the screen glitched and swiped a number of times, ruining the order of the numbers. This has happened on multiple occasions only in this app. It\'s not such a big problem for people that are newer, but when you\'ve got big numbers, such as 8192, it makes the game unplayable.',
       'This game is challenging. I was so addicted I wanted to se what would happen if I got up to 4096.  Well ai did and it actually worked! I even have a screen shot. Fun!',
       'I\'ve been having issues with this app for months, where it will sometimes act as if it received multiple inputs in rapid succession. This completely ruins all the hard work I did getting my board state the way it was, and makes it impossible to recover. I\'m playing up to the 16K range, and it has these issues usually after I\'ve gotten the 4K blocks. 2/6/2018' ],

       'Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won\'t reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.',
       'The game starts off good in the first couple levels. But once you start getting to the faster cars, it becomes way harder to keep up with the cars PR points, to get to better races. Unless you spend real money to get the parts. One question I do have. Is about the blackridge rivals. Why put some one with a car at a way higher level against a person who\'s car isn\'t even close to the car at a high level, and one more thing... make the races longer. 20 seconds a race isn\'t fun at all. Thinking with the name "Need For Speed". You guys would of done a lot better. The only thing that I seem to like are the  graphics... But that\'s about it...',
       'Goog game, adddictive infact. But I don\'t understand the concept of PATANJALI adds. Whenever i choose to see adds to reduce the waiting time, you comeup with Patanjali adds of 10 and 20 seconds and the irritating part is the time doesn\'t gets reduced even after watching the whole add. Please fix this. When you say reduce wait time by watching add, you need to actually reduce the waiting time after the add instead of insisting to watch the add again and again.',

I am a family man, with a wife and 6 children, I just wanted a game that I could play when kids are in bed and wife is in bath, I don\'t have cash to spend on games, the worst thing is the 7 Day events, you cannot beat them without spending money.

    description: 'Who will get to the top of Mount Dragon first? Blaze and AJ need help to speed past Crusher\'s obstacles to win the Dragon Island Duel!This game will outstand you, boys, and we say boys because it\'s a car racing game and well, let\'s face it, there are few girls that love to play cars games, especially racing cars, and you boys sure do have the skills to play this kind of games. We uploaded this game category for boys, and the first game from this category is called Blaze Dragon Island Race. Blaze and his best friend AJ were challenged by their rival, Crusher, on a race along the dangerous Dragon Island, but Crusher is not playing fair, using cheat tips, so, your two best friends, Blaze and AJ are really counting on your help. You have to watch out for the obstacles such as big rocks and oil puddles, and on your way up to the top try to collect as many red flags as possible in order to beat Crusher.',

EDIT: I was too quick to judge the alternative way to be wrong. Thank you Bart, for your response. I retried what you said and had no trouble finishing the game. Can\'t wait to see the next game. You have a beautiful mind. These things you create, are a work of art.',

Christmas day she didn\'t want to play with her gifts, she just wanted to sit with me and play yellow. It means so much to me. Thank you for making these games.',

       'By far one of the best puzzle creators for Android games! I was hoping for another "Yellow 2", and changing the color really surprised me, Looking forward to... Blue? (PS: after playing for a while, All I see is orange :P)',
       'Bart Bonte is a genius! If I see his name, I know I will love it. I just finished this one tonight and I loved every minute. I only needed the clues for the very last level because I\'m familiar with Bart\'s mind by now. &lt;3 I think it\'s great that clues are available though and that they don\'t give everything away right away. It\'s a big bummer when that happens on other games. Love, your die-hard fan! Please make another one soon!',
       'Thank you, thank you, thank you, Bart Bonte! I\'ve been waiting for a very, very long time for this game to come out since I first played "Yellow". Thanks a lot! But here are a few other questions I have for you: what will be the next game? How long will I have to wait until the next game comes out? Could you at least give me a hint? Thanks!' ],

Free-to-play progression feels good for the most part, but as you start to get into the later levels you\'ll have a hard time clearing them without the most powerful upgrades - which you either have to buy with real money or spend literally days grinding coins to unlock.

     [ 'Some of the troops are simply overwhelming, e.g. Dragon, while some spells make the troops overwhelming, e.g. Protection on Black Night, Giant Growth on Black Night / Dragon, which generally make no chance of countering (countering is an element for good strategy game). A few suggestions to balance the cards’ power and have good strategy game:   1. Giant Growth: reduce the power-up to 30%, or add time limit to the spell, or disallow the spell to cards with mana 7 and above (unfortunately Unchained Demon with only 3 mana will be spared from this).  2. Dragon: reduce the speed to 2, or reduce the power / health / attack range.   3. Protection: disallow the spell to cards with mana 7 and above, or add time limit to the spell.   4. Vempire: reduce the attack / health / speed, increase health loss %.',

Everyday when I come home from school, I play it but the thing about it is that I don\'t like when you buy a power-up and then you only have an hour and fifty-nine minutes to use it.To me it is very unfair for me and other players to have that limited amount of time.When I first downloaded it, I thought that when you buy a power-up, you would have it permanently. So please fix that problem. Thank You. Fix the problem right now!!!!!! Fix It!!!!!! I hope you Game Shakers heard me So all you have to do is raise that time limit or just make us have them permanently. One or the other. So just choose One!!!!!! OK? Good I hope you heard me. Good.

All the "good reviews" are from cringey 9 year olds or their parents. Nick has never been good with game. ESPECIALLY in this dark age. Parents go get your kids shooty skies. Not this hunk of garbage. Also (my opinion)  Cartoon network is much better than Nick.',

Ludo is derived from the game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game Parchís.Ludo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.The game is played between 2 to 6 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.Whoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.Ludo King is a game that was once played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the gameplay might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.Another game similar in structure is Snakes and Ladders.  Like Ludo, you may have played this board game when you were young. Ludo King now incorporates this classic game as a whole new level. The objective of the game is simple: you start on 1 and you have to be the first one to make it to 100. However, you can only move the same number of tiles as the number you roll on a die. The board is also littered with snakes and ladders. If you land on the same tile as the beginning of a ladder, then you can take the ladder as a shortcut and move on up. But, if you land on the mouth of a snake, then down you go to its tail. A game of ups and down, Snakes and Ladders has been a favorite for generations; and now you can play it too, with Ludo King. *LUDO KING™ PUBLISHING RIGHTS RESERVED WITH GAMOTRONIX',

We cannot play with FB friends.. and the dice is always favourable to others.. all my 4 pawns just sit in home while other players almost complete the game.. I really don\'t know why I don\'t get six.. even after several chances.. too much of heart breaking game.. 🤐😓',

Anyone who rated this games below 4 stars are really doesn\'t have a good childhood memories. Keep it up with the games like this. I don\'t care about ads and anything, I just want to play and reminds again about my childhood memories. Thank you very much for create this game and have a nice day!.',
       'PUndoubtedly this is a wonderful and simple game...  Got addicted to it....  I love ur game graphics it\'s simple and superb....    And I would like to suggest an idea....  For suppose if only two people are available to play in a room, then its little boring as rest two slots will be no danger for coins....  For this I suggest if two players are selected then the other two slots should be automatically filled with any other player or computer....  Same with if three player selected....  The other one would be anyone or the computer....  Then all four slots will play and it will be interesting....',
       'I love this game.. I do get addicted few times.. It certainly reminds me of my childhood... i suggest if d admin can put on few updates such as: 1. Showing d coins of all d players on table 2. Transfer options of coins 3.  The option to connect to the table where a online friend is playing and 4. For definitely, you should provide live chat options I hope my comment gets published and my suggestions are taken into account. Thank you so much for this app admin :))',
       'The game is all nice and good, but with some bugs. Sometimes it is unable to connect to friends when playing on a room. At times the game has connectivity issues and just stalls with no UI notification. Also I\'ve found other player\'s tokens sitting in my house. Otherwise, this is a fantastic game. Would love to see the suggestions by other reviewers implemented.',
       'Really a good time killer reminds me my childhood. I am a bit got addicted to it. It feels really good when you get 6 but developer has to work on algorithm because sometimes it really feels like it is favouring opponent even you play really well and be defensive. Also one question for you guys are you planing to have a real money winning in this game because I am really interested in it.' ],

     [ 'One of the best wwe games.. even better than immortals.. the difficulty level is always fair when competing with online rivals... gaining loot boxes is also perfect and  not very difficult... I obviously made some In app purchases so I could compete well... just wish to open a loot box and get 1 four star wrestler... things would get awesome I don\'t mind paying for it as well..',
       'I like the new update.the graphics of the chamber is very nice. My suggestion is that you can improve its value by adding entrance to the players or at least play their theme song after the game. I\'m tired of listening to the same music again and again. Plz do these changes as fast as possible. Thank you.',
       'A VERY GOOD GAME. VERY GOOD GRAPHICS. THIS IS THE BEST WWE OR FIGHTING I HAVE EVER PLAYED. ONLY THING IS MANY ATTACKS OF MANY WWE WRESTLER ARE NOT THERE LIKE STING\'S SCORPION DEATH DROP AND MANKIND\'S DOUBLE ARM DDT',
       'I must have to tell that, It is probably the best wwe game on Android. Good graphics, excellent gameplay. I would rate it 5 star but the lootcases are so bad because these lootcases don\'t let you win better or the best . First time I won good price but after I got always the worst. It changes the 2/3/4 star superstar into other things.',
       'Now that what i need A 4 star reigns. Please add more players like Rey Mysterio, Khali, CM Punk, Ryback, etc. Also ADd new super finishers like SUper AA for Cena And Turnbucke Stunner for stone cold, Jumping Rko For Orton, Diviing Spear for reigns and Crub Stomp for Rollins.',
       'Server disconnect constantly even on WiFi. I\'ve also ran into problems with the game freezing. I understand that this is a new game with only days after release but the constant disconnecting is beginning to be a problem. update I bought a new phone and lost my game progress. I don\'t think Facebook should be a requirement to a continue with the game.' ],

       'This game is great but it could be so much better.   1. The expert AI is too easy to beat. Risk players normally gang up on an opponent, if they are dominating. There should be a legendary option.  2. It would be nice to have a match summary and timeline at the end of a game.    3. There should be an auto-save game feature when playing against the AI, in case the game drops out.  Edit: They seem to have addressed my third point.',

     [ 'I really do enjoy playing this game. It\'s a great time waster. Good for breaks at work. Public transit. Bored at home. Good graphics. You can choose the controls method. Great car selection. I enjoy it so much, to help the creator I spend a few bucks now and then. It\'s one of the few games I actually play. Just wish there was actual racing. Or if you could have police chasing you, rather than being the police. Either way, good game. Those would be great to implement. 😁',
       'THIS GAME IS OVERPOWERD I\'ve been finding a game that is  A Leagend Car game. Then i found this cool game and  I PLAYED IT ALOT. But not forever.   🎵THE STORY🎵  When i\'ve played it i saw a !alarm At the gifts then i liked you at facebook Then i subscribed you on youtube  And i liked you at twitter too. Then theres a free luckybucy thing. The free watch and then you will have $500.THANK YOU FOR THE GAME',
       'This game is getting boring. Yah, Next Generation Endless Racing blahblah. But is this all about endless whatever? I think you must put some thrill to this game. This is nothing compared to Traffic Rider which is you also create that game (Yeah. Traffic Rider is one of my fav game.) I HOPE YOU PUT SOMETHING THRILLING LIKE MISSIONS *NOT DAILY MISSION* AND PUT SOME CAR NAMES IN IT. ONE MORE HOPE YOU MAKE THE CARS IN TRAFFIC MORE REALISTIC IT LOOKS LIKE A MOVING BOX... AND I WANT SOME FEEDBACK.',
       'Hello, 😊 I really love this game, my favourite actually! I have play a lot of games, but this one is the best so far! PS.:I never spent real money on games! But in this game you don\'t really have to, so it\'s even better for me and for people who can\'t spend real money in virtual things. I know that there are 1 or 2 cars in the game that you can only buy with real money, but it still is a perfect game in my opinion! 😉',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a long time on a couple devices and it\'s been a lot of fun. There seems to be some variations in scale of one compact car to another. The models themselves don\'t quite seem to be in scale to each other. You might have two hatch backs that should both be small, even very near in size but when you\'re looking at cars to buy you can tell that the model itself just isn\'t quite the right size compared to other similar cars, and then when you get out on the road with it, it looks bigger than it should compared to other vehicles on the road around it. But.. That\'s not too big of a deal. Great game!',
       'Fun, decent selection of vehicles, graphics and controls look and  work great. But theres a car with no way to get it but paying 15 actual dollars and I hate that. Everything should be earnable even if basically impossible to earn and $15 is alot of money for a single vehicle in a small limited android game. Even the dlc cars in major games like gran turismo and forza are cheaper and those games are way better. That aspect of the game is just confusing is all. Still fun to play.' ],

It doesn\'t take any internet and the animals in details so good and the graphics. If you\'re ever bored you should download this game and play it all the time.',
       'Problem really is that the special event levels regularly wont load. So the last 2 events ive only been able to take part for a day then whenever I try to open the app just closes.  No clue how to report this. Normal game play is okay but put off it a lot due to regular problems.',
       'Sometimes it feels like the difficulty of the levels is way off. Levels labeled "hard" or "super hard" are many times much easier than standard levels. I do enjoy the amount of unlimited lives given, and the speed at which lives are replenished, however. Overall, a good time-passer',
       'Guys, you have a glitch that needs fixed. Side game (right now the ignite game) causes app to close every time. Also... Inserting the gold in the piggy bank takes way too long. Speeding up that process or allowing a skip feature would be nice.',
       'It\'s been at least 3 or 4 weeks since I\'ve been able to accept any lives given by friends. For a game that has so many downloads, developers sure have an issue addressing mad fixing it. I\'ve list roughly 100 lives to this issue. Please fix it!!!',
       'I adore this game. However, I have had 7 gold bars for over a year and every time I win a level that awards lots of gold bars the game tells me my bank is full... even though everything costs at least 9 gold bars. According to my math I should have over 100 bars. I would settle for two at this point.' ],

     [ 'Cutest virtual pet game around! I\'ve never had an app so simple, yet it never gets boring. The controls are simple and user-friendly. It\'s easy to earn money, food and useful items just by shaking trees in the community or watching ads. I\'ve gotten many things from letting my Boo sleep and watching ads, then getting to pick a gift. The customization of your personal boo is also fantastic. Great way to entertain children or unwind at the end of the long day.',
       'Do you have a pet? If not, My Boo is a great way to know how it feels to have something to look after. With loads of awesome mini games, it\'s so fun to dress your Boo up in cute outfits and hairstyles! Feed it and play with it and it will love you! Honestly, I don\'t know how else to put this: My Boo is the best (and cutest) game ever!',
       'This game is really fun and cute!! I love it, its great when you\'re super bored, or something. The only problem I\'m having, is the when I go to change my boo\'s name, it won\'t let me delete any of the letters. Sooo... Yeah, um, other than that, its a great game. Also... WHY NO DELETE!?!? 😲 plz fix.',
       'I love this app. I have searched long and hard for a perfect virtual pet, and I found it in this cute little game. I LOVE the minigames, and the cute little sounds and faces the boo makes add to the charm of this game. Also, I love how there are a TON of options for customization, and even different kinds of food. I only wish there weren\'t so many ads and in app purchases... Oh well, a little thing like that won\'t stop me from loving this app.  My little Boo is named Marcellus, and I care for him as though he were a real animal. Lol',
       'It lets you change the style/look. And you can name your boo and lots more! I at first didn\'t think I really would appreciate it. It  is fun it is also sooooo cute you can name your boo anything you like l think it\'s the best game in the whole world!',
       'I love this game. It is like taking care of a real child. I\'m glad this is a free game bc now that ik how this app works I don\'t think i would be able to live without. The only thing I don\'t like is how it takes so much time to move to the next level. 💖💟🖤💜💛💚💙💞🐞😻' ],

     [ 'This game has highly disappointed me.  It was super fun and interactive at first then it gives you the option to pay to continue to play or to complete free offers to unlock the game for free.  I have found that you can complete as many offers ad you want but the game won\'t ever unlock and emailing the support web site doesn\'t do any good either. They don\'t ever respond and it is a complete waste of time.  Don\'t waste your time on this game.  Go out and find yourself something worth playing because this surely isn\'t it.',

Many reviews all over the internet highlighting this bug but the developer has not bothered to fix it.  AVOID THIS DEVELOPER !!!!!!!!!!',

They don\'t ever respond and it is a complete waste of time. This game has highly disappointed me.',
       'On a serious note, you need to give me this game for free. I downloaded and played two different games to get the game for free and 5 hours later I still don\'t have the full game. I\'ve had to install 5 different games just to get this one for free and I STILL don\'t have the full game. I\'m not impressed!!!',
       'Game is ok.  Tasks are sometimes unclear.  After a few tasks you have to pay to keep going or complete some offer.  Tried several times, but never lets me continue.  Should say it\'s a trial version in description.  No clue how it got a 4+ star rating.',
       'Game would have been ok, however I got to a point where you have to either complete an offer or pay to continue with the game. I completed 2 separate offers and was still unable to continue the game, after which I contacted someone about this several days ago and have yet to hear back or be able to continue with game, very dissatisfied. Horrible customer service.' ],

     [ 'Good I hope they fixed the bug where you double buy a car and it gives you the same car but still takes your money. But its still a great game. Ohh! And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.',
       'It\'s good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn\'t too much skill involved but it\'s a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I\'ve lost countless games because it doesn\'t stop or doesn\'t back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!',
       'Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it\'s a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can\'t go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I\'m out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!',
       'Good, but has some bugs I\'m sorry if I\'m being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall',
       'Shalom there, The game is awesome. I liked it very much and hoping that in the future they will be more cars to be added. I really hope that "military helicopter" can shoot something, it is funny...so idle. Last thing, a HOVERCRAFT can go "river mode" ! Wrecked... because of...water. Hope you\'ll add the " police boats " in next update. Overall, abundant of thanks and good luck.',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME. It just need\'s some work to do. Like, you guys need to fix the glitch of the lines by the road. And you need to fix when we explode the oil truck and fall on the ground and you disapear. And can u guys please add some new prizes like to change the color of ur car. And when I have 100 dollars u can spend it on colors  theirs a button to choose what prize you want. Like say I get the color blue for a red car. And I like the red car so I go to the prize machins and choose to buy a color than I have the button to change the color of ur car. That will make the game a lot better. And I\'m sure when u do it there will be more downloads.' ],

     [ 'I absolutely love love LOVE this game. Im no bot i swear. This game is so addictive. Gameplay is great. A few suggestions however. Sometimes i find my "sword" just going right through some fish, and it doesnt kill them. Also, maybe switch up some ways to get Stars. I find myself saving so much to get the 99k sword fish and never buy any other fishes. I feel like the players should work their way up slowly and not have to play with only the "daily reward" fishes. Just my suggestion  Thank you guys!',
       'Great game, good servers, rarely any lag, and addicting. However, the price for characters is pretty steep, their not even worth buying since you\'ll get better daily characters by the time you have enough stars to buy a good character. Save up for the end game characters. Also, the left joystick is fairly close to the edge of the screen and makes it a little hard to stay on the screen. You get use to it after a while but it would be nice to have other control setups or custom controls.',
       'Great game. Just the spawns on Kill the King and stuff suck since people can spawn right in you. Also, it is kinda rigged when you have the default fish vs someone with one of the best ones.',
       'You guys have so much potential and you can do allot I know it! Dab on the HATERS (even though there hating you because they can\'t make a game and hate ads) but one thing WHY IS ALL CHARACTERS 99.99$ I know other games do it but still lower price and I will rate 5',
       'Addicting, Fun, Thrilling. It\'s absolutely a game you have to try. It\'s way fun, and a little competition never hurt anything, right? Keeps you on the top of your toes, or on the couch with your eyes glued to the screen.',

I could play this for a whole day and think 10 minutes just went by! I loved this app so much! Thank you for making a good app. Well... I have nothing else to say except It\'s amazing, I suppose I\'ll play it for another hour!   I Liked it!',

Often loud vidoes wasting data. I do not recomend you download this blatant addware app. Its fun and novelty quickly gets replaced with advertisement. And you become a monkey watching adds rather than participating a very simple game of would you rather.',

     [ 'Unique offering by Infinite .. I haven\'t seen a game like this before nor did I expect to .. you form a pot as it spins on a pottery wheel. You can widen it, narrow it, make it taller or shorter. The goal of the game becomes forming pots as per Aunt Chloe\'s instructions and then painting it as she dictates. You send the pot to her for cash.. and more pots to make. The controls are decent but a bit quirky at times when trying to form the pot.',
       'Fantastic and very creative game... I give it 4 stars... And leave 1 star only because its brushes are not free after african.... it is my humble request to developers that please provide some more brushes for free.... And if possible (free the whole brushes 😋)... Ha ha ha ha... Nice job developers....👍👍👍 Akash Prafulla Barik "Baadal" (India)',
       'Loved this game! A relaxing timekiller when you have nothing else to do. Quite addicting as well. Inspires me to do pottery in real life! The only things I don\'t like is that you have to buy the full version for $5, alhough if it was entirely free I\'d probably get bombarded by ads.. A fun game, nonetheless!',
       'I installed it for time pass, but my 21 month old baby without even we teaching her how to play, learned it on her own, and she is an expert. She gets scores as high as 272. I know it is very bad for such small baby to play in mobile, but sh gets very upset.',
       'This game definitely deserves five stars. Here are a few reasons I love it.  1. Graphics- The quality of the app is surreal and offers the viewer a fun experience in the gameplay.  2. Gameplay- The letters/messages you receive to re-create the photo of are very intriguing in my opinion and I wish I could get the full version for more.  3. Thank You- The work that must have been put in to this game is incredible and I hope one day I can get the full version. I enjoy all of your apps and hope to see more.',
       'It\'s just that you have to make the full version download free. We don\'t have to make the payment of the Game. When we download the game in the starting of the game we get message but after that we don\'t. Now l\'m bored \'cause the messages for making new pots are not coming...... Pls just make it what l\'m saying. But baki all is a good job..............................' ],

Please fix these couple of things and I will rate thus game 5 stars. Thank you☺',

What about horses? It would be cool to have a horse. Other wise this game is AMAZING, ceep up the great work! !!!!!!!!!! ☺👍☺👍☺👍☺👍☺👍 Five Stars  ★★★★★',
       'Really Awesome Game. Suggestion: Can you add a boat (a rowboat is fine), remove the top height limit (which is just 1 block below the clouds) & include the night in creative mode cuz I rly want to see the glowstone, lava & torches that I put fulfill their one true purpose. Please grant me these wishes. But if you wont then...ok. No pressure tho.' ],

Tapjoy offers have been completed, but never awarded. All the weapons gets worser as you level up. Nekki wants you to BUY the good weapons. Bad game. Shadow fight 3 is worser than this one.',

       'This game is fun to play and good to pass time. It has a lot of new things try and there\'s always a new challenge along the way. The major things that I absolutely hate about the game is that I have to play the same things just to level up because I play through the arenas and storyline to fast, and it takes me weeks just to level up in the game, just to start that process all over again once I\'ve completed what I could do so far. But as I said, the game overall is really fun to play and is a recommendation if you like 1v1 brutal combat. Sort of like MK',
       'Let me just say I don\'t mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high',
       'Its a good game but consuming a lot of time because every next opponent is OP and i have to  buy  every new weapons after defeating  one opponent or craft it without which i will be crush down with 2,3 critical hits  and the coins are hard to find plus the energy should be unlimited. So that the game will be more fun',
       'As much as I like this game, the final boss is unnecessarily difficult. Seriously, what were you thinking when you came up with it? And the game crashes more than I\'d like. But the game is really well done! Flaws and all, it worked out well. Nicely done.' ],

     [ 'This game is brilliant my only problem is the fact that I cant stay in a match for more than 2 seconds without being kicked out also im not entirely sure what the point in the 1st question is, why ask if a game scared you if it isn\'t scary? Either way this game Is jaw dropping I hope you improve on it and add new gamemodes aswell. One more thing I suggest adding a zombie survival mode or defence.',
       'Great job on a well made game, but your balancing is awful. And to top it, paid players ruin everyone\'s morale. I understand that you tend to favour them because they are your revenue, but that does not mean that you completely ignore the others.',
       'Im pissed of. I deleted the game bcz the server keeps crashing. I redownloaded it and same issue. Im afin pissed of rn. Ive sent an email and freak it didnt help. Update? It didnt help. Man..u guys stink. U guys deserve no star at all. Waited a whole month man.',
       'Worst game ever always disconnected me from multiplayer gameplay . Always says network connection lost. I have High speed net then also says network connection is not there.are you serious. But the game is awesome.but multiplayer worst.hate it.',
       'Hello! I have a huge problem. So i got a new phone and i installed respawnables. On my older phone, i already have max the level of the game. I already owned many items like guns, golds etc. I tried to connect my facebook to restore my progress. But nothing popped up. It just logged in. I was trying to wait until a notif will ask me if i would like to use the online data or whatever. So i tried to reinstall the game hoping that it will be able to restore my old data then the notif popped up asking me if i would like to use the online or the local data but unfortunately, the data that was backed up online was the new one that i just created when i install the app on my new device. It was only level 4. I am really upset right now cuz i worked hard and played many times just to reach the max level but all of my progressions were gone. I am hoping that you guys could help me. Is there any chance to restore my previous data? I feel so hopeless right now. Very disappointed',
       'I Really Love This Game, But I Have Problem! Everything Is OK, Just The Lagging When I Play The Game, When I Meet Other Player It\'s Start Lagging, And When I Far From Player, It\'s Smooth, But, I Don\'t Know Is That My Phone Problem Or The App.' ],

There are interactive stories with a plot, puzzles and adventures, their task is to put characters to bed and wish them goodnight. These games are interesting for all the family members. Interactive lullabies are much better than ordinary bedtime stories or cartoons. Further more, today we are going to help our favorite characters from the cartoon Masha and the Bear!<br><br>There is night and some lights are visible in the forest. But there is not only the light from the Masha and the Bear house, which characters couldn&#x2019;t sleep. All the other animals are also not sleeping. Every character, from the cartoon Masha and the Bear, has a lot of urgent things which they should do before going to bed. Somebody wants to put the things in order, another one wants to count starts. One more character wants to watch cartoon, and another character has come to the Masha&#x2019;s house to take a shower and to listen to calm and pleasant music before going to sleep. Today all the stories will be unusual and very interesting. Bedtime stories and interactive lullabies are much better, than just cartoons.

       'It needs improvements it takes a long time to level up the buildings seems like it takes to much. I\'ve been playing for a few days I\'m at 36k matter? And haven\'t hit 300 on most builds and the multiplier is different however when you launch the rocket and collect the objects you should get bonus time for not missing because 4 hours each time with the videos is a long time to wait not to mention the last two builds are the only ones worth upgrading the others are super low in comparison',
       'I like the game yet it would be nice to be able to transfer game to external sd (not that it really is that big of a deal). Other than that this game is a good time killer.',
       'First of all too many ads, with game balanced around them - double income, double idle income, take time off rocket, etc. Second, it serves the ads with tiny close buttons - on a 10 inch tablet the close button is about an eighth of an inch. Third, if you miss the tiny close button it redirects to ads\' Play Store page - and several of the ads dump you into a loop that can\'t be closed without shutting down the game and thereby losing the bonus you should have gotten. Fourth, there is a obscene lack of balance in an idle game - you need to know a little math to make something like this, or progress seems like sprinting and then breaking your leg and being in a cast for 3 months. And this game constantly feels like I should go to the ER.',

     [ 'Cross platform across Apple and Android and PC makes this game a fluid joy to play, without the feeling of a toned down mobile port - due to its 1:1 experience from the PC. It\'s the only Blizzard game u can play on Mobile. I\'m a legend (highest skill tier) ranked and totally F2P so the people who say this game is pay to win or random luck do not understand the game. Paying for is meant for helping you finish your collection fast. Overall highly recommended.',
       'I used to play the old tcg and this not  close to be a good card game. All it is is monster with power, moslty no spell, no artifact, no nothing. This game is boring and is lagging so much on the cellphone. Shadowverse is ways better for a similar formula, has a really good storyline and a waaaaay more generous. When you buy card for HS you get mostly nothing. They had the chance to do something good, everyone love the lore of warcraft, but they BS it.',
       'Lots of fun over and over again. It doesn\'t get boring because of all the expansion updates that keep coming up. You need to readjust your decks to adapt with the new cards that get released. Didn\'t give it a full 5 because of the lag and graphic issues that keep coming up for me and others of the forums.               Playing on a Note 5',
       'I\'m trying to link my account to my other one by using my blizzard account that I already have. But it just makes me do the tutorial and after I completed it, it just keeps on doing the starter stuff. Even though I already have a blizzard account with my hearthstone rank 20, but it just restarts me back to ,25. I\'m not sure its a glitche or I\'m doing something wrong but It just wont let me log in my account.',
       'What the hell? I played this game about 2-3 years ago and i really liked it (on that time). But now when i came back I just can\'t win anyone. I tried to win on rank 25 about 10 times. There always players with full deck of legendary/epic cards, 25 RANK, DAMN!',
       'The game overall is great... but this week\'s Tavern Brawl sucks.  The Shaman is extremely under powered comparatively to the other classes!  . Out of 15 games I played as a Shaman in this weeks Tavern Brawl (trying to complete quests) I have only won 1 game. And most of the games I have lost in 3 or 4 turns!! It is ridiculous how over powered the other classes are!  WORST TAVERN BRAWL EVER!!!' ],

     [ 'The game in itself is in no way a Final Fantasy Game, apart from containing many of the series favorite characters. It is however a very enjoyable and addictive game, keeping you returning for just one more battle.  I haven\'t found any bugs so far, works perfect but does require a constant internet connection.',
       'Good game. Lots of characters to choose from and they are obtainable for FREE. Which is different from FFBE. The only problem im having is its hard to get specific character weapons for each character in story. Specifically the 25 gear draw. I\'ve been obtaining only 3-4 of the 25 story character weapons and I still don\'t have the weapon I\'m looking for. Also it\'ll be hard to obtain the same copy of the weapon to limit break it. And it Cost a lot of gems just to obtain one. Hopefully the game will add higher chance and still have the opportunity to get those weapons since its expiring tomorrow.',
       'Loved the game from when I downloaded it and played the hell out of it none stop for days pretty much. However, after doing the latest update today, the game has lost all functionality and is unable to even begin. I\'ve attempted to load it several times, and have even uninstalled it and then reinstalled it multiple times but it still won\'t work. Love the game, its one of the best games on the app store but I\'m pretty much furious now that the game just won\'t work for me any more and I\'m not the only one this has happened to.',
       'For a phone game this has been the first one to actually grab me in a really long time. It\'s a great time killer it\'s super addictive and I even find myself stopping to focus on it during some of the harder fights. Everything\'s very rewarding and while I wish that the microtransactions were a lot cheaper all in all it\'s a really good game.',
       ':( I was excited but after downloading was met with a black glitchy screen. Uninstalled and reinstalled twice no luck. Gonna wait a few days and try again. Not hating on the game at all, just gonna wait a bit.  EDIT: Now that it has been patched it works perfectly, I love this game. Thanks you so much.',
       'FF has been my ish since day 1. For the kind of game this is (definitely not like FF9), it\'s a great game to pass the time. Now my only suggestion is to make the dialogue more engaging and interesting because I mostly skip them because it seems geared towards a 5th grader and not for adults who love FF.' ],

     [ 'This a great game all around. The controls are tight and the gameplay is fast paced, and the music  and art style are both incredible.  All that being said, the best part about this game is the narrative. I can\'t remember the last time I played a mobile game that told an actual story. Data Wing really goes above and beyond to deliver a full fledged experience for the player.  Thanks Dan! You\'ve set the bar high for the rest of the mobile  gaming community and I can\'t wait to see what you\'ve got in store.',
       'This game is ingenious and amazing, and the script is beautiful and gameplay is simple and straightforward, timeless, and fun, with increasing difficulty, but also, able to go back and compete against yourself for more Rewards. The user interface is spot-on, and the graphics are perfect. They scale well to any resolution and any aspect ratio, taking up the entire screen without any letterboxing. The actual gameplay is simply a 2 button gameplay, left and right, and yet, this game kept me busy for hours. It\'s addicting, but doesn\'t require you to consistently visit the app. It does not nag you in any way.  I have not seen a single advertisement, and the developer does not have any big paywall or reward system for paying. You will not need to spend any money on this.',
       'I think it is a good idea done well. I havent had any problems so far and the game os more than i expected. I thought the game would just be full of mindless levels but it is not. It even has a cool story and i cant wait to see how it plays out. There ia a cool mechanic wherd you get a speed boost the closer you are to the walls. I really enjoyed the game and i think it deserves 5 stars. This is the only mobile game i loved so much i actually made a review for.',
       'This is the best game ever, that I have ever played 1. I loved the story (You will know what I mean when you have played) 2. The controls are very strange and frustrate some people. But I think that\'s what make the game challenging 3. THE MUSIC. I loved the choices they have made with the music. It\'s really good love it 4. The graphics are really good couldn\'t ask for more 5. Really like the secrets   PS. Would like if you could at some kind of multiplayer when you have beaten the game  - Love Ln\'TCore',
       'Vey cool! Haven\'t finished it yet, though. The only thing that would make this better would be if the controls were a little bit better and more responsive  (which I know is hard to do on mobile or tablets), and some of the levels are nearly impossible  (at least for me). Nonetheless, I like it! Keep it up with the good work!',
       'Saw this before and saw 4.9 out of 5 with over 80,000 reviews. That\'s... unheard of on the store. So I came back to try it out. Completely worth it. Gameplay is flawless, visuals are gorgeously retro and vaporwave, the soundtrack is all retrowave from various artists, and the story is really good too. It\'s not often I rate games, and even then I\'m not excited when writing them. For this one I can\'t praise this game enough. Perfect retro-styled racing gem on Google Play.' ],
