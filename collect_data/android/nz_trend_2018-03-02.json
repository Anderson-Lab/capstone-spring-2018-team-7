There is at least two ads per game. Some of the ads go landscape to further increase game play pleasure, X one out and Bam! Bonus round go straight to the app store to see the ad you X\'ed out available for download. Go back and BAM try the X again YOU GO BACK TO THE SAME PLACE. Good times were had played ten games and uninstalled. ADWARE ten millions downloaded how many kept it longer than twenty minutes.',
       'It\'s so fun with all the different types of patterns.im telling you its the best game you will play in your life.When I die it\'s actually quite good, because the last time I did had 100 to spend and when I had passed the next 4 rounds I had 10,000 to spend so you should realy get this game,and Change your life people.Plus the new thing is the star block makes you invincible for a short amount of time for example I was going when I had 93 and I went in 24 star and I Could go through 100 and 123,000 for 1 minute. Anyway great game if you liked my review go onto Episode to see that review. Hope you love the game. Oh and I forgot to tell you a list of all the patterns we have purple, green,rainbow,pink,🍔,💵,🚗 and grey.',
       'Nice concept, nice controls, the problem is that is too much randomnes and less skill. It forces me in corners where I\'m definitely dead or the good boxes are in corners where i can\'t go because of the walls and that also means im dead. Please make it less random or ar least make that if i comith to a path and because of the game i cant chage is, at least dont make the first mistake ista death.',
       'Love it, just love it if got addicted to the game in less than 1 second! But, try adding more ways of playing like championships or vs computer or against all over the planet! It might get you into the top of top 5 best games in the universe! Just sayin\'',
       'Guys this game is the best offline game I have ever played as it is toooooo much addictive. U would not believe me, firstly u would die very easily but as u play on then it would be easy to create high score. It also makes your reflexes more faster. The creators have done a great work. And people who are saying there are lots of adds are talking rubbish.  Play it!!!!!',
       'It\'s to many ads like beyond the amount I\'ve seen on any other app. You lose a life then there a 30 sec ad after every time you lose a life. When the ads over you jump right back into the game. Making it difficult to play because it doesn\'t give you enough time to make your next move. If they remove the ads may it would be a better game.' ],

     [ 'Dear SEGA,  can you see if you can release sonic 3 and sonic and knuckles? I love seeing Sonic return in his classic form. I loved Sonic 1 and Sonic 2. This game, Sonic CD had me excited for getting. I hope you love the journey of the original Sonic The Hedgehog  games. I never was around when Sonic came, but after playing his first act, I had to play ALL the games. Thank you. P.S. why did you put the Sonic killing himself secret in Sonic CD? Kids are playing him! Not teens! What age were you aiming him at? 11+?!',
       'I think its good they brought back Sonic CD for androind and I think its a great game but I have noticed some issues with the audio. It would sometimes make a static noise when i spindash,jump,collect rings,hitting the goal post,ect. I have also noticed that some objects were in walls mainly rings. Please fix this and I will give you that 5☆ rating.   P.S. A feture i think should be in the game is the option to control the size and transparency of the buttons. Lastly i think its kinda dumb that we need a wifi connection to play this. If you could change these that will make this game perfect.',
       'One of the best Sonic games with some cool new features added. It\'s even better then ever with the glitches fixed. (Thanks Sega/Whitehead!) It\'s very playable with a phone touchscreen, and plays like the original.  Could use the custom touchscreen control options that Sonic 1 & 2 had, but the controls work just as good as those regardless. Kinda wish it had Knuckles unlockable though. Still, great remake, time trial mode is great, and offers plenty of unlockables. It\'s especially worth buying "no ads" for offline play.',
       'Question: After buying ad-free, the game will be able to run offline, no? Wanted to make sure.   Also, there\'s still a bug here: in Palmtree Panic act 3, after the boss is defeated, if you slide to the left corner of the screen after destroying the egglookin thing it gets stuck in there.',
       'So glad I have the old version purchased and archived. Audio distortion, Immersion haptics removed. Yes it is nice the nav bar is gone, but I\'m keeping the old version for dear life. Have a feeling I may be using that copy years from now on Fuschia OS.',
       'One of the best classic sonic games I\'ve ever played. But...where\'s my sonic 3 and knuckles Port? ;-; also amazing port of sonic cd! There are minor glitches I\'ve encountered traveling to the past and future though.' ],

     [ 'The game is awesome. It is funny, has some challenges, it\'s community is friendly and you can collect familiars. Also you can use your equipment as costumes if you like a specific item\'s look. =D And I didn\'t even talk about the way the game looks like... It\'s the best pixel art I have seen in a while. =) So stop reading and start playing, have fun and thanks for making this game Developers! =D ( The only thing I miss is more coop gameplay =\'D )',
       'Great game and a lot of fun but... waiting for energy REALLY kills this game for me. I really don\'t feel energy limitations should be part of of a dungeon crawler where the object of the game is to run random dungeons for the chance of better loot.  I for one will never spend money on refreshing my energy in a game like this and the energy refresh costs are pretty high.   I feel like it be playing this game none stop if it weren\'t for the energy restrictions.   Otherwise good game and very enjoyable - when I can play.',
       'The perfect MMO RPG for your phone in my personal opinion. If you\'re a fan of dungeon games then this is the game for you. With its cute design, simple combat systems, dungeon patterns and loot systems, you\'ll find yourself easily sucked into the MMORPG world of Bit Heroes. Fight your way through the dungeons and gear up to strike fear imto the creatures who dwell within as well as the other players in challenging PvP matches.',
       'Spent over £200 in game and no legendary pet or accessory. This game uses RNG and it\'s extremely low you can\'t advance past a certain level unless you spend lots of money and even then you have to be extremely lucky to get legendary pet or accessory. Guilds won\'t take you without legendary pet or accessory. Don\'t waste your time on this PAY 2 PLAY game',
       'The game overall is brilliant! I love the pixelated graphics. The equipment is epic for a pixel game. It\'s an easy game to play, but is strategic as well! Also...it doesn\'t require much space! My down sides would be the controls. I have had them glitch on me before, but...that won\'t lower my rating at all! If I had to suggest one thing...it would be to add more customization for your character. I was looking for a long braid for hair, but wasn\'t there. So, some more choices would be an up. But, as I said, all in all...a perfect 5 star game.',
       'Perfect, very close to the perfect ultimate bit adventure rpg! I look forward to expanded versions. For this one the only issue i have is when i accept or decline a friend request, and i think duels, the request text lingers above for white someone even tho i already accepted/declined.

     [ 'This game is very nice, especially if you suffer with anxiety or have anger problems, it helps me calm down quickly, with the calming music as well. It would be nice if there were more power-ups or characters but even so! The game was nicely made & has many challenges, resulting in it not being repetitive!! Would recommend☆',
       'I like the design of this game; it\'s super relaxing & unique. I just really wish you had more possibilities eg more characters, other things to jump on (besides this tree kind of thing), or different lvs with a changing background depending on how high you get. otherwise this gets kind of boring after a while',
       'When I tap and it doesn\'t jump for no discernible reason, it\'s a reeeeeeaaaallly bad sign. There\'s nothing that can redeem a game that has controls that don\'t work. The controls are so simple, I have no idea how they even messed it up like this.',
       'I think everything about this game is great especially the music, it\'s so peaceful & relaxing. The only thing I wish was in the game were objectives, it gets a bit boring after awhile just continuous jumping without any objective.',
       'I really like the game but there s a glitch/bug where the sound and music are the same. If I turn off the sound the music stops as well. If I turn off the music, the sound stops as well. I\'m trying to play the game without the jumping sound effect which is extremely annoying when you\'re trying to listen to the calming music. Please fix!',
       'The game\'s main objective is to climb as high as you can, collecting "fireflies" and "fern flowers" along the way, and that\'s it, there is no story to your ascension, so the actual gameplay can get boring very quickly. The art style of the game is similar to that of Alto\'s Adventure which makes it aesthetically quite appealing, but a bit unoriginal and overused. The controls are probably the worst part of the game. When they are actually working the way they are supposed to, the game is fun and oddly relaxing, but when they don\'t work, the game quickly gets frustrating. Overall the game isn\'t bad, but it has some flaws.' ],

     [ 'It\'s a good game. I like the concept. Immediately had me addicted. One flaw I can spot is that I can\'t seem to remove buildings that I\'ve placed. But the enemy seems to be able to remove theirs. Could be a bug, but nothing in tutorial about how to remove buildings either. It means sometimes if you place a building blocking a path, you can never build there again. Means you have to sometimes quit because you can\'t make your way to the enemy. This is the only reason it\'s not 5 star, because actually it\'s a really good game. Nice concept and nicely made as well. Feels very smooth to play, a perfect example of what it is. Good job 😊',
       'Love it. Great and simple game. It\'s challenging , fun to play and has NO ANNOYING ADS! Best game I\'ve downloaded so far. I\'d give it 6 stars if I could.  Edit: I\'ve seen that you guys have added new levels (and I\'ve already finished them 😅) I\'d there any possibility to donate to your company? Because I truly enjoy your game(s) and would very much like to support you in any way I can.',
       'This is one of the best strategy games I\'ve played in my life. Didn\'t expect such a gem. It\'s very immersive, the graphics are primitive just enough to give room for imagination, like in the old times. It feels a bit like Wesnoth, HoMM or civ2 (in different ways, hard to even define). It\'s also unique. I guess it\'s based on a board game, never played it, but it has the atmosphere of one. I\'d only ask to polish the graphics a bit. Please keep the level of detail, but maybe experiment with outlines because they can be somewhat ugly when you zoom in/out. It\'s not important at all though. Thank you so much for the excellent game! Also, no ads... Incredible. :)',
       'First I should have wrote this a long time ago.  I\'m not sure when I first started playing this game, but I immediately enjoyed the game, and also that there are no ads, or anything trying to get your money.  Not only is it free but he continues to add new levels to the campaign. I cannot say enough about how awesome the creator is.  After a year or two of playing this, i would gladly offer some cash to support him for offering me many hours of entertainment.   As far as the game, it\'s the only game on my phone  I keep going back to.  I love the simple game play, the undo button is a life saver.  It\'s simple but still offers really great strategy and resource management.   I love it!  Thank you for this game. I get excited every time I see new campaign levels ro complete.',
       'Great game, won all 100 levels. Hoping for more one day until then been making my own. Random map generator makes the maps way too easy even set to hardest difficulty. If can make the random map difficulty harder that would be awesome!  Also if there is a donate or buy option I would be happy to contribute.  Great work!',
       'I love it! A minimalistic strategy game, but that is why it is so good! Simple but hard to master, a bit like chess. The AI is also good, but now after i finally finished the campaign and tried to make some harder maps, perhaps i should try pvp. Free and no ads makes the already well recommended game a perfect game on the go! This game is the proof there is hope in gaming (many games nowadays are pretty but s**t and get bored of them after a day). Thank you for making this game!' ],

Games drains the battery very quickly, some sort of calibration is required to make it more user friendly.  Online open version which will have random users on the table across the world.',

Thank you for reading this review, and have a great day',
       'Many improvements needed. The game should give a notification about when all players are ready or they have answered. Also when a player takes too long to respond, the game should give a timer of 30 secs and then kick that player. Loading times should be reduced. Game feels too saggy and dated. Improvements like these are needed in the game. Then I will definitely give a 5. Although the concept is fantastic. 🙂',

     [ 'Great game, the controls are simple and smooth but a quick suggestion. Have you ever thought about adding some kind of story/survival mode? It would work like this every day you have a certain number of hours to scavenge for food and supplies or weapons. When scavenging you will have to clear out the building before being able to receive your rewards. When the scavenging stage is complete you will then have to defend your base from the night horde.',
       'Super addictive and a great time killer if you\'re waiting for something. I would love to see some new weapons. As well as new modes. Also I would love to see an online mode..How would the online mode work? Well...I was thinking that two players should be on top of two separate buildings, killing zombies and racking up money and using the money to buy new weapons after every round. But if one of the two players die by a zombie then the whole game ends. It can be endless rounds and it would be really cool if this was in the game because it would increase my love I have towards this game because it\'s already addicting enough and adding  a online mode would just make it even more addictive :D',
       'The best, the best game ever and it never gets boring even you still play training, so my request is..... I want a friend/rebel should be good at the beginning of a mission, training, defence and corridors/doors soo..... Read this and don\'t forget, in the next update hope you add the friendlies!!! So excited to wait.....!!        EDIT 25 SEPT 2017 : Wow! New update! They add defence mode and dual pistol !! Keep going!! EDIT 9 OCTOBER 2017: Nice!... Added Scar-L  and new game mode.. cool, i request to add more melee weapons! (I hope) and a two way defense! That must be hard and fun!! I know you work hard, keel going! : ).      EDIT 16 FEB 2018 : so it\'s been a long time and the updates were so slow, but finally we got the updates! Thank you so much for your work!,and happy new year (its too late to say it) yes, i know, thank you.',
       'Really love this game but it\'s missing so many things! add turrets for like $4000. Also on normal corridor add sandbags for $1000 and make it upgradable. Needs more than one explosion type weapon. Lastly just make the purchased lives go up in cost to increase difficulty e.g.  $1000 $2000 $3000',
       'It\'s a fun game with a great variety of weapons. I like the way when you shoot a zombie in the head, it comes off or loses a part. The axe and samurai sword are pretty cool, too. The only problem is, let\'s say past Wave 30, with the lack of multi kill weapons with good magazine size, overwhelming amounts of zombies are imminent.',
       'I really like the concept. Can\'t wait for the updates. One thing I have noticed on the game is when you go back to main menu, you lose the guns you paid for in each area. But keep your health with no way of restoring and also keep your level. Was this intentional or just in the development?' ],

     [ 'I really enjoy this game alot. Its better then the other hospital type apps that i have played. Great time killer and fun.  There is only one problem that i have with this app so far. You can not rotate the map around to see the diffrent angles and it causes me to have a difficult time placeing things sometimes. I would love to see a rotation button added to the game.',
       'This game is great . All the features are excellent. Laboratory, patio , VIP ward every things is superb. But here is one problem that whenever I but something , it becomes more expensive than the last one . I want to expand my hospital , but it is too expensive. The cost should not be more than 1000 rupees. Please it is a request. And if it is not possible , than its OK . I will manage. And a big thank youuuuuuu for creating this game. THIS IS REALLY THE HEALTHIEST GAME IN THE WORLD. THANK YOUUUUUUU CHERRY PICK GAMES. THANK YOUUUUUUU.',
       'Love it. But I do have a suggestion. I think the game should have wereifur in need of something u should be able to ask nother player if they have a item u need and if they would sell it to u.bc searching tho the ads and waiting for what I need to come up takes to long... I always need shovels but can never get any so it would be great if I was able to ask a player if they had any they would be willing to get rid of for a price....and it dose take to long to get to the next level... Like way to long I been on level 33 for 4 months now n I play alot..ever day a good many hours and I do alot on here and it seems I never can get up to another level Other then that is great. I love ethe game...',
       'Why is getting the shovel getting harder and harder? This way it would be difficult to play the game at all. I tried finding it in stores and cant find any. I tried going and helping in the gardens of others yet i dont get shovels. Please change it back to the way it was instead where we could easily get the shovel making the game slightly easier.',
       'Got to Level 28 then it stopped fully loading. Have tried everything makers suggested in troubleshooting  nothing. Has bren like this for 2 months. Have had to find other games now used to love it give up on it now.  Spent real money on it too while playing big mistake! Would not recommend!! I have a Samsung Galaxy 7 phone and this is the only game Ive had problems with.',
       'It\'s a good game but can the developers please fix the bug where the daily quests help bubble won\'t leave the screen even when you tap on the daily quests?? Really hard to accept any gifts when the whole bottom of the screen if filled up and you literally can\'t do anything.' ],

     [ 'It was a great game until they introduced Deathstroke. Now you either need to have him(I do but it takes the fun away) or have people specifically to counter him. They made him way OP and arnt nerfing him anytime soon. So if your just starting you will want to spend money to counter death stroke.',
       'Ok, maybe this is a minor nitpick. But some of the legendary costumes look really bad. It is worse on characters that look good before the upgrade. The detective Batman and comic Harly Quinn are the biggest examples. I would rate higher if they gave us the ability to hold the apperance. Maybe add another level and costume and let players choose which they like best.',
       'Had to change my score after playing this game for almost a year. For more than a year this game hasn\'t done a single update. We still playing the same tired and boring game modes. No character rebalancing, no new gamemode all the do is introduced new broken character every month to get you to buy them and completely nerfs them the next month\'s just to introduce another broken character. Do not spend money on this game EVER.',
       'Very frustrating:  NO customer support at all - nobody checks or answers feedback infinite fights: you\'d better not end up in a fight with batman dark night vs green lantern hal jordan at similar level - cause nobody can win - you can only give up and lose your ressources!!! Update: they changed Lobo again. The most helpful one against Deathstroke. Now his revives are limited to 3. Additionally: the new heroes are unusually strong and frustrating against the old ones. Frustrating for old players.',
       'Can you please remove this "Join dynamic PvP battles" from the game discription. There\'s nothing dynamic about every person having deathstroke as a team leader. Maybe having more character balance in the game would make the game better you guys should try it out.',
       'DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME. You can spend money to get a character which is ok but they can change it at any time leaving you with something completely different than you paid for. Poor business practice. It\'s like buying a Ferrari and them taking it back giving you a toyota Corolla.' ],

Are you able to add this feature? I can never remember my mana creating limit.  If you make more mana than can fit in your mana storage line, you lose the excess.',
       'AWESOME!!! Originally, I was very reluctant to download this becuase I though it was going to be where you just sit and watch your character do everything for you. I HATE those types of games... This however is actually how I was really hoping it would turn out to be! You can move freely! The levels are linear and its not very open, but thats okay! You see each piece of equipment on your character when you wear it, which is absolutely essential to me! I will not play a game where my appearance does not change, so this has all in all met my expectations! Another RPG worthy of my collection! Thank you!!!',
       'Repetitive and too expensive.  When you try to do the side tasks to earn diamonds (in game currency you\'d otherwise spend way too much cash on) they find ways to not pay you. I\'m owed over 800 diamonds and they\'re telling me to contact someone else.  Absolutely not worth it.',

Even the arena battles arent winnable. Not fun at all anymore. This coming from someone who played religiously every day for 6 months or longer 👎',
       'Think I\'m the same as most people who have been playing for a long time. With the new update its just to much of a un-enjoyable grind for nothing when for all we know the game will update again and we\'ll be set back and have to grind all over again.',

       'Login bonuses gone? Great job guys. PVP too punishing now. Win a game it\'s +50pts, lose a game -50pts when it used to be -35. Now your effort is meaningless. Take it from me, don\'t spend your money here, it won\'t pay off.',
       'Fun game, but only loads half the time. It can load in a few seconds, few minutes, or not at all. No way to tell how it\'ll feel today. I\'ve paid money for daily rewards. I can\'t login to the game again. Thanks daily rewards that I paid for are wasted. Seriously?',
       'The gameplay and card collecting is awesome. It\'s great to see all my favorite characters and the game overall is a lot of fun. However the game is full of bugs. Half the time it freezes on the initial loading screen, the rest of the time it freezes after battles.',
       'All Im getting lately is oops no server connection, is there some bug issue. Paid money here to gonna lose a 28 login. Thanx kong, I play this game to help with my pill addiction and now you take my money and deny me access, I am in full panic mode. My lawyer says anything I do while Im in this state is easily half your fault. As I use this game to supplement my addiction, FIX THE GAME...FIX THE GAME...FIX THE GAME...FIX THE GAME!',
       'A rubbish game do not install it is a pure waste of time first amount of times I went to buy something with in game money and almost clicked the £5 sliding along also there is just nothing fun after around first 9 levels it gets depressing same repetitive technique as I said it is just a waste of time' ],

     [ 'I used to love this game, very addictive but recent updates have made the game have too many elements (clubs - who cares???) Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels "fixed" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.',
       'This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.',
       'I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn\'t really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don\'t know how many more points you need.',
       'This game has many issues! It continually freezes and shuts me down. I can no longer play on my tablet, which I purchased just for games, and have to use my phone. I don\'t like using my phone because it drains my battery. I am so ready to quit this game and return to candy crush instead. Latest updates have rendered JP and other perks useless.',
       'Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the "boards" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it\'s addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It\'s becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.',
       'I don\'t know if a review is still available  after a game has been deleted. The game was fun to play I\'ll say that. I didn\'t need 5 push notifications coming @ me in the middle of the night however. The one that came through @ 3:17 a.m. was it for me, I\'m out.' ],

     [ 'Its Very Good Game But in this game Units and Weapons Cost is Too much how can we buy. If we want to buy a unit or weapons we has to play for 3 or 4 its taking too long time, so we are losing interest inthis game. Please DECREASE the COST of units and Weapons..... Please.......🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏',
       'I love the mechanics. It feels like you are playing card games but you also control your player making him like the king in a chess game. I think the developers got inspired a bit from TF2 xD Heavy and Demoman being there',
       'Fun till LVL 15 then it\'s just all about money. Shame as the idea is really good. Very addictive but as soon you hit 15 then matchmaking is simply broken. Facing enemies with all troops and weapons at least 200 more damage then you, with jeeps, cobras and weapons that you can acquire only by paying gold (real money)so no matter how good you are you losing just because they paid for better arsenal and you didn\'t.  Weapons that you can get by clearing stages are very limited and weak. Sadly 2 stars would be 5 if not pay to win after LVL 15',
       'I love playing WarFriends... Its so much fun and Exckti g! Surely time seems so fast while you play..you get lost in it and be in WarFriend World.. Going against Squads Nd wanting to win all pVp battles...',
       'The game is really an ideal  combat game. Very addictive. Only few demerits. Like matchmaking i am being fought with ranks of upto 3 higher than me! How can i defeat them with extra poweful troops. Also the concept of squad war. Initially i thought it as clash between 2 squads. But to my dissapointment it wasn\'t so. It is kind of fooling at the name of squad war. If you can work on these i would surely change my ratings to 5 star.',
       'I love this game. It is very easy to play yet still fun and it doesn\'t get repetitive. Also you don\'t need to pay to play as you can earn adequate amounts of in game currency from assignments. the graphics are awesome and the gameplay is great. I highly recommend this game' ],
