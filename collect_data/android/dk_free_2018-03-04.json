        "Needs way more bats i beat this in 3 days and can't get the ball any farther. Add more bats and I'll give 5 stars.  Update: need to make the bats harder to get i already had all the new ones unlocked when i opened the app after the update. Litterally took one swing with the now highest bat and now there is no point to play.  You should make it like 5,000 km for the next update or something.",
        "Great game! I really love it and its great to play when you want to pass through time. My only issue i have is that my upgrades are so high that i go over the side barrier almost every time. I feel it would be awsome if, like bats, you could unlock new balls. Also, online leaderboards would be awesome, so we can see who holds the current record.",
        "One thing is bombarding everyone with ads, another is: 1. There is no sound whatsoever. 2. The whole purpose of the game is getting a new bat.  3. There is no point of hitting it down the middle because it will hit something and bounce back thousands of feet.  Overall this game sucks! About the ads?  I've learned 1 thing: If you see a game on an ad? When you download that game, it will be flooded with ads. That's just how that works...",
        "The game is awesome but there are way to many ads between pitches. Cmon man!! I get it u want to make money.. So how much does it cost to have an ad free Baseball Boy? I feel like 99 cents would reasonable. Cause everyone would buy it just to not be annoyed by the stupid ads!! 😘",
        "To get the most power you have to also hit it in the same direction every time. Not a hole lot of fun in that. Its a grinding game that every two swings it's a 15second ad if you are lucky. If not expect to spend just as much time playing as you do watching ads, if not less.",
        "Bloody adds. Relax with the adds. There way way way way way way way you too many adds. Every time you play you gotta wait for an add to finish. It's disgusting. Whats the world coming too. Rather pay a dollar and have no adds. You guys messed up big time by making this an add flogging game. Hang your self's from a tree by your throat. Hope you get cancer."

Now I have nothing to spend apples on.  But here is what i really wanted to say i really like this company and the games you put out to your users. I'm newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me. I own alot of your games and have spent alot trying to help. I wish I had more to unlock things in time. But Thank you very much.",
        "The game sucks it's alwful. It's gliching non stop for your bad. There are ADS everywhere! Ketchapp you getting worse and worse. There are ads of stupid games everywhere. What a game maker will pay to another game to show them in ADS! That makes the game in the ad even worse. Please ketchapp I was a big fan of you but you made your games so STUPIT. PLEASE FIX YOUR GAMES!",
        "This skill-based time waster would be better without the hyper-agressive advertising. First you have the constant banner ad at the bottom of the screen. That's forgiveable because it's out of the way and doesn't really affect gameplay. It's the fail-state adevertisements that constantly interrupt retrys that will irritate even the most casual of gamers.   The only people writing good reviews for this game are bot accounts.",
        "I like the game, BUT it is glitchy. Most of the time when I hit \"continue\" to watch an ad for longer gameplay it freezes, so I have to close the app and start over. When I open the app and start playing the first round, an ad pops up and I inevitably click on it because I'm in the middle of playing the round. Please fix these issues, and I'll try to remember to rate this higher once they're fixed.",
        "Ads interrupt gameplay and are extremely aggravating. The video that you have to watch to continue your gameplay never works. The game crashes when xp increases. I personally dislike this game, and it would be better if these issues were resolved. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this review.",
        "Deleted all my data with no reason. Had a bunch of Legendaries and Rares that have now been deleted. I put a lot of time into this game, and even bought the ad-free package. If you don't want a load of wasted time, don't download this app.  Edit- Updated the app and levelled up a bit. The game crashes every time I get a free revive. Still a massive waste of time."

It's only happened once to me and I'm on level 41. Now that's saying something. It gives you a super good promise and nope it's gone out the window as soon as you get the game",
        "I have been playing for a while now, I like almost all of the game, not too impressed that \"the piggy bank \" is basically held to ransom until you buy it... find another way to entice spending... reduce number of coins won or something but as the levels get hard if you dont spend money you get stuck even with team helps.. it gets disheartening and reduces interest after a while.. to the gamemakers: keep the game playable..the money will come",
        "Update...as I go though the levels Ill get stuck for a day or two...even 3 on a level. Gameplay FUN has Dropped significantly. Moved to 3 stars as a result. If it does not change I'll continue to move to 1 star. Games are many to be played...not just stuck on a level forever!  Other issue with the game is that there's so much clicking and waiting once you win. I wish that it would just go right to the next level and it wouldn't have to wait for the splash screen. I just spend so much time wasted versus playing",
        "Oh my gosh, this game is so much fun! I have a dentist appointment coming up, so I got this game to settle my nerves. I'm having such a good time playing, I know this will be just the thing to help me out! 😀 Thank you 😄",
        "Don't waste your time playing this game.  I got too 300 + levels but you get 100 coins for completing each level.  Unfortunately it goes in a piggy bank, which you need to pay to break starting from £1.99, then next piggy bank was £4.99.  It's a con!",

You can play for hours with out bring stopped no lives. . I want a game that's fun and relaxing. No hard or extra hard ones. I really like cleaning and fixing thing. Be nice if you could do more area and less puzzle.",
        "I love decorating the rooms but I am having to pay too much to get enough points to do it.   I also don't like that each room requires more points to do the tasks than the previous room.  I have changed my rating to low because you end up spending too much of your own money to get powerful to get your stars to complete the tasks.  They also lose your purchases.  I bought a desk chair yesterday and now it is missing and the task is gone too.  Rip off.",
        "This game is awesome. But the stars, please increase the amount of star not just 1. Make it 2 for the Hard Level. And lastly, it's hard to download new rooms when it always appear the Technical Error. Better if you do not require to download it and the user can open it without connecting to internet. However, the game is great for relaxing. Keep up the good work!",
        "Never thought it would be this addictive! At first i thought \"Oh, its THAT game that always pops up in advertisements.\" but after deciding to give it a try, i am hooked!   I introduced homescapes to my mom as well and downloaded it for her and she finds it adorable and fun as well. We both take time to chill out and have fun with the puzzles occasionally when we are together.   I cant find a single flaw or critique for this game, its amazing :)",
        "Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it's advertised too much, but it's definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That's slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.",
        "Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I'll be playing this for a long time! I'm working on the living room right now, getting close to level 600. Can't wait to see what the new character, Jerry, has in store for us! Thank you Playrix!"

        "This game is very laggy D: you should get 50 robux to people when they first start it would be handy and you should be able to make tycoons it would be WAY more fun for people if they did start win robux there should be a daily reward!!!! Thanks alot please choose this suggestion.",
        "It has a wide range of great games, but ROBLOX is flooded with OD'ers (Online Daters). That is mainly the reason I rarely play anymore, because ROBLOX is just gready and only wants money, so they took away great features of the game that made it great.",
        "I actually love Roblox so much because then you get to like the same things and it's good for creating jobs and stuff what you want for an example jailbreak jailbreak as an awesome game that has a game that you can actually brainstorm ideas what you can do to escape the jail although that is kind of seminar for you to get in jail and breaking out for it too real life but it's just a game",
        "The game is perfect, bit there's one thing I need to know: how do you equip t-shirts? I can't find an option for it in avatar customozation. Other than that, great game.",
        "This game is awesome because I can play with my friends and family,also there is so many games in one.But the only thing I got mad about this game is that you have to pay money just to get robux to dress your character😢.But its still a good game"

Thank you creators of the game, I enjoy playing it so much, and I do hope that there's more.",

        "I paid the 2 odd dollars to remove the ads since i really enjoyed the game. If you are thinking about doing the same DON'T. Paying the money removes ZERO ads. It simply allows you to skip most of them after 5 to 10 seconds rather than watching the whole 20 to 30 second ad. They still pop up just as often and are just as annoying. Personally I would wait for another developer to make a good clone of the game, shouldn't take long it's a simple engine.",
        "I paid the price to get the ads removed, because I like to support developers and because there were a LOT of ads. The ads were never removed. I have contacted the developers more than once and received no response. Then I contacted the Play Store and they rejected my claim. Now I have paid for the ads to be removed and they are still there at a level that makes the game unplayable. Worst customer service ever; what a waste of money. I will remember this developer and never download another of their apps.",
        "Terrible game. I can't pay twice without having to sit through a full 30 second add. I found it faster to exit out the app and go back in to avoid adds. But there are just too many adds that it made it not fun after the first few goes.",
        "WAY TOO MANY ADS! Its so frustrating that after three failures an ad plays for 30 seconds. Also, why are you asking for access to my storage and location and the ability to make and receive calls? As a developer, get with what your customers want. Then I'll consider buying something.",
        "Far too many ads. One here and there is understandable but after every single try, you get an add. Definitely uninstalled for that reason. As far as the game itself, it's really fun and could be addicting but I spent more time trying to get through the ads than I did playing the game.",
        "EDIT TO PREVIOUS REVIEW: I PAYED FOR AD FREE AND REINSTALLED IT AND NO LONGER HAVE AD FREE!  I loved basically all of it except... If you don't buy ad free the game is completely unbearable with how many ads there are. Also I absolutely hate how it kicks me out of the challenges after I die if I tap too many times or I hold the screen while waiting for it to load."

Getting kinda frustrating and just not worth watch the ads anymore. Can you fix this? If not, I more than likely will delete the app and free up the space.",
        "this game is slightly good but  it is lost its priority to me day by day. initially this game was awesome but now a days it seems to me boring, authority takes this game only for business purpose. after finishing level 30 i lost my patience to this game. it gave more ad. but not increase their game quality. so finally i take decision to uninstall this app to release the space of phone.",

I don't know... looking like a hot dog... what's the point. A hot dog with super speed and stay low would be ideal. Love the game, but to keep playing.. maybe give us something new. The only thing I love is wordy weekends. But only to get the coins back for what I spent on the characters",

Sometimes I will go a whole day with no shields and the whole time I'm getting attacked. The other thing is the bonus spin. Never have I won more that 250k coins. I know you want us to pay for another spin but maybe award a higher number once in a while. All in all cute game.",

Please help and put me back to the level ahead of me as this is very upsetting for spending money and being right back where I was before. Fix it and I'll give it 5 stars for everything thank you",

        "The game is good, but the multiplayer needs to be fixed.  It hangs on load and results in the player losing money or gems with no recourse.  It randomly drops ships, and when one player immediatlely gets the best ship and the other player doesn't receive any ship until 10 rounds later, it is impossible to catch up.  Fix the multiplayer, then you get your 5 stars.",
        "I was trying to take advantage of the first time deal. I purchased a deal and for some reason Google play didn't allow me to  complete the charge. The next day I look in my bank account and I have been charged for what Google play said I couldn't do and I was charged another $4 when I didn't even click on anything. I want my money back. That is real shady that you would charge someone for a service that didn't even go through. And where did a $4 charge come from. And there is no way to ask through support to get that back so I'm taking this here where others can see. Don't spend money here or there will be random charged in your bank account.  Update: I do not want a thank you, i want my money back. There's no way to contact the developers except through Google play which already seems shady.",
        "Definitely not worth it. Was fun at first, but after the updated quests, the game took a serious nosedive in quality. Now you HAVE to beat the opponent in order to get anything, otherwise you're out 1000 gold. Before, you would get something just for playing. The new PvP just sucks.",
        "I got a new phone and I installed this game on it and it put me on level 5. I was on level 32. I had 56 stars and my combat power was on 72000. If it don't update the game with my current data I don't think I am going to play it anymore. I don't want to star all over again.",
        "Pretty decent game, shame you need to pay gems for the second last ship. The PvP is fun but half the time reduces my gold when I win. Cannot see the devs replying to any messages so unsure if they care",
        "Th game is fun and addicting. Way to many ads!!! Ahhhh My gold counter doesnt always register after endless mode is over. Gives me dble gold if i watch ad but doesnt register after endless battle sometimes. Would gave better review but that sux when it happens. Fix!!!!"

        "This is a great game but the bottom line is the developers want you to spend money upgrading. You get along so far upgrading with coins, which can be earned. Then they want tokens, which you must buy, to go further. The deals on weapons that are offered are always just out of reach. You can earn diamonds watching videos but I would rather play a game than waste time watching stupid add so I can play a game. It was fun but no more. Deleting.",
        "It is far too difficult to advance in this game without spending money. The developers get money from ads, and I'm willing to watch them, but not for 1 diamond every 30 seconds, when the smallest upgrade in weapons is 360. They must not want people to keep playing an otherwise good game.",
        "This is the most grindy game I have ever played. To get anywhere close to a smooth play through, you have to spend obscene amounts of money. It'd be just as much money to buy a PlayStation 3 and fallout 3, and you'd have better graphics, better shooting, and shorter load times. Plus, every level and every gun has to be downloaded separately. It's over 200 mb for me, and I only played for a day and got to level 2!",

        "There are always connection errors during PvP (internet connection was stable) and since the last update PvP is such worse. I don't know why, but there are just 4-5 other players each game and  the game is over after a few seconds"

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "Good game. I initially wrote a one star review because this game was very dependant on microtransactions but it's actually pretty fun if you have the patience. Right off the bat you have to wait upwards to 30 minutes or an hour for basic production and warming but as you grow your farm it gets easier to deal with. This definitely isn't a game you can play for, like, an hour, consecutively, which kinda sucks but it's great for the 10-20 minites you pop in now and then.",
        "It is an amazing game. Our entire family is hooked and i love the idea of neighbourhood chat on hay day it is awesome!!! Continue making this game as cool as it is👍. However it would be nice to have private chat on hayday where the entire neighbourhood does not see your conversation. There is also a glitch where i cannot open my daily videos."

The coins you win are miniscule compared with how many you need when you use the Help function (even bumping it up to 5 coins for each correct answer would be better) & the other thing...I get that you need ads to keep these games free but does there need to be an ad after EVERY SINGLE PUZZLE??",

        "I think it's a good game but sometimes the ball would go in but then it bounces out you should also add modes, one like there are walls all around and I like the game keep making these addictive games:D also all you guys stop with the adds just turn off your WiFi let them have some money after hard work on many game's like would you want to make a game and not get money and just get  ALL YOUR COMMENTS WITH ADDS! ohhh that would be soo annoying.",
        "I love the game it is so simple yet super fun. Just the only down side is that there are WAY to many ads. I stared playing a round and then an ad pops up.. Like really. At least put a 15 second ad up after the round is finished where you can choose to wat h and ad to continue after you have missed and your time is up. If that person skips the chance then put up and ad. Or just remove them. Thank you dev for the lovely game though ¶:",
        "Don't get me wrong this app is addicting and fun. The thing that ruins this app is ads. For a game were it is meant to be played in quick bursts and you aren't meant to succeed for long periods of time, i don't understand how you can put an ad after every attempt. Sure one per 3 to 5 games and the another 30 second ad, but at the rate they come this game isn't fun anymore. The craziest thing to me is that i can't find a way to invest a few cents into the app to perma-block the ads. Come on dev i know you can do better than this. I will adjust the rating when i am offered a solution. Until then this 4 to 5 star app has 1 to 2 star potential.",
        "Ya hate ads? Turn off wifi and play. Stupid phone/gaming noobs. Its a good game and dont hate on it for ads. The ads make the people who made the game MONEY. Give then a break. Let them have money while u watch something u might want. If u wanna turn it off, like i said, turn off wifi.",
        "Would pay for the game to remove ads. I get you can turn off WiFi/data but it shouldn't be necessary, and is unfair to the company itself. Please offer a paid ad-free version!",
        "I genuinely liked the game it was fun and addictive but the ads is what kills it. Ad pop up like almost everytime you lose.. other than that its a grest game. The ads make me want to delete it. I hated giving this game a 1 star.."

I have been stuck on level 348 for several weeks, because of that blasted bomb, and need the extras to help pass it. Do you have a hint on how to pass this level?",

Now, when i boot up the game, it just freezes when i click on anything. My shop tries to open but just goes to a black screen and freezes. I will try to play for a few more days, but if i cant play by the end of the weekend, i will be deleting the game.",

And I can see the normal background picture. When that happens I have to close the game and reset. I've tried to get the item 20 times and it does that every time.",
        "Was a great game til the update. Now I have to open it twice for my energy to update and for the money in the pawn shop to change. Also when I bargain with clients now it's alway a negative profit compared to before. More annoying then anything",
        "It's a fun game my only complaints are that you have to wait until your energy refills. There is no way to earn energy and you should make it so you can customize and/or upgrade your shop. Make it more exciting. Also you open the building that say they will finish construction soon because the game gets boring if there no excitement added to it.",
        "I enjoy playing this game. Currently I have two major problems with it.  1. I wish I could change orientation based on how my phone is tilted.  2. I tried to have Mutt trade something really expensive and now it freezes every time I attempt to open the trade.",
        "Cool. Fun. But your guys really need to fix the bugs. I would load it and keep it open doing certain things (playing a auction getting a item appraised and it would FREEZE or take absolutely forever. I would have to close the game out and re load it."

There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "Should make the money in higher value as it is very hard to accumulate.  Poor marks because it takes so much of your hard earned levels and drops you down the ranks if you don't solve immediately.  I was at ruby level and have so many points taken away now I am back to silver....uninstalling thanks for nothing.",
        "I really enjoy this game, its quite addictive but i find it very satisfying. The only problem with it is that once you get into higher levels (i'm at 300) you start needing tons of stars for small things and for instance to get rid of one stump takes like 8 stars. Anyway I like the game and am going to keep playing it.",
        "I use the love this game and have played it for months, but the lasted update ruined it for me. Every time you don't finish a level it asked you a second time if your sure to want to lose this or  that. I don't apreciate the guilt trip to try and get money out of me. It's dispicable and unethical!",
        "If I could give it 0 stars I would. There is no way to contact support and you can't restart the game. I got a bad download and now I'm stuck with it. My personal information should not be part of playing a match 3 game anyhow. Game crashes at least once a day and my controls only work about 60% of the time. Horrible experience! Playrix should be ashamed of their programming here.",
        "The game is awfully hard for what is essentially a match 3 game. For a game that is supposed to be as much about the storyline as it is about the matching, it sure doesn't want you to advance that storyline. It's more about the very obvious money grab than it is about game play. Do yourself a favor and don't waste the space downloading this game. There are much more enjoyable match 3 games on Play. There's a reason it's the #3 grossing game on Google play. It's all about how much you are willing to spend, not about the actual play."

        "The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn't make it better at controlling. I don't know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌",
        "this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It's so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It's just so addicting and I can't get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the 'play online' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊",
        "So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I'll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It's in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I've ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍",
        "Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃",
        "I'm highly addicted to this game. It's a thousand times better then agar.io in my opinion and it's really cool that you get to create your own skin. The only downer is that I just wish there was some music because you start to get a bit bored after a while.This game is NOT a waste of time, and everyone needs to download it to experience the awesomeness!",
        "Its amazing and highly addictive. Actually one of the few games that not only hold my attention but my kids as well. The only two issues I have is when lag strikes its basically impossible to play conssidering your hand takes up part of the screen anyway. Then every time you die you have to close out of an add. Which if you have a curved screen some of those are hard to close out of.  It would be really cool if in addition to building your own you could create your own list of worms youve made and name if you want."

        "I love it very much. I also have some sugjestons to make. I think you should make categories for Thu pictures (animals,people,food,ect) and also have a daily challenge where you have to finish a picture (that you say) and we have to finish it. You would get a prize of a amount of coins and you could save them up to buy new pictures or tools like the bomb. But i really like this game. So even if you don't do my sugjestons I will still love it. ❤❤❤",
        "In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it's just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.",
        "AMAZING GAME! I am SOOOOOO HAPPY with this game! ITS SOO ADDICTIVE TO PLAY! SOOO MANY PICTURES TO CHOOSE FROM! THERE'S EVEN A TRUMP ONE(which is EXTREMELY funny)! THIS IS THE-BEST-GAME-EVER THAT I HAVE PLAYED!I LOVE THIS GAME SOOO MUCH THAT YOU, YES YOU, SHOULD GO DOWNLOAD PIXEL  ART RIGHT NOW! YES RIGHT NOW! SO GO AHEAD AND DOWNLOAD IT!!! (also this is the longest thing i have EVER typed on my phone!)",
        "I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It's kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.☺",
        "Awesome app, its oddly satisfying and can either be really challenging ir really easy. Its constantly update with new pictures to do, and already contains probably hundreds lol, if dont 75+ and in saving the really detailed ones for last. If there even is such a thing. But, i think a counter for how many blocks of each color are left would be a really awesome alteration. There are many strategies to use when you do a color by number. So a counter for how many blocks of the selected number are left, it would be such a life save.this game has taken enough of my life already as is lmao",
        "Way to many ads, was hard to enjoy. Would have been more bearable If the ads weren't 30 seconds each, and played everytime I open/close a drawing. And, to prevent any ads you have to pay. I just want an easy, accessible, relaxing game. And by either making one pay, or making them suffer is not really my idea of \"Relaxing\". Thank you for your consideration."

If you have a new and protected phone, get the game, but if you have an old phone, do not get this game. IT WILL GIVE YOUR PHONE A VIRUS AND YOU CAN LOSE EVERYTHING ON IT!!!!!!!!",
        "I really like playing the game, it's fun with all the different character mechanics, but after the last update there has been a huge increase in ads that take me away from the game and open up play store or chrome. It does this in the middle of a round, so obviously it screws up my gameplay. Makes me consider paying for no ads, but also makes me want to delete.",
        "I would give all 5 stars if the game would work. I played it yesterday on two different devices with no issues and today it is just not responsive. DO NOT DL THIS GAME. TOO MANY SPAM ADS SAYING MY SYSTEM HAS A VIRUS ALONG WITH ADS SAYING I WON A GIFT CARD.....JUST HAVE TO REGISTER ONLINE ETC... DO NOT D.L",
        "It's an amazing concept and idea that is very entertaining. The bad thing is that the ads interrupt the game so constantly that it messes up your shots and your online games too.  If that can be fixed so they appear after a match not in the middle of one that redirects you to a page full of ads and false notifications, then it will be a very awesome experience.",
        "Fun, but will not let me \"watch video\" to collect chests or continue ongoing game. Always says \"failed to connect\" or something. It crashes mid game sometimes or when I'm choosing a character. It's fun but needs work.",
        "I WANT to like this game. It's fun. The problem is the ads (I'm fine with ads. It's a free game) but mid game it randomly opens ads. I'm talking the kind that take you to a whole new window and tell you your phone is infected and won't let you go back without closing that tab. It screws up your shots and it's just NOT ok. Please fix this mess and I'll redownload and give the game a better review. Ads are one thing but when they make the game unplayable, I have to delete the game."

        "Awesome Game!! Really I like this game. I dont even have words to describe it. Totally Fantastic... Whatever you say, this is totally cool. But I have a request...please add a column of legendary bikes. Like there is Common, Rares, Epics, and Specials , there should be a column of legendary. Waiting eagerly for the next update. Thanks a lot of making this fabulous game. And I would also like to appreciate the colours and graphics of this game. Thanks to the team for making this game. I advice this game to those who are looking for cool new games. Please install it and have FUN!!!! Dont just look at the pics, install and you'll be amazed.",
        "Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death",
        "Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I'll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.",
        "This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can't seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn't be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it's not something you have to add, it's just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven't seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it's an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘",
        "This game would be great if it wasn't so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn't slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.",
        "The game is great fun. I have been playing it for a few months and actually still play it. The only problem i seem to have with it. Is the laggish performance when i am connected to internet. The moment the internet is off then game runs more smoothly other than that. Still enjoy playing it. Though I must say it would be nice if there was a gem counter for each ride so i know how many I have collected. Otherwise great game"

You can pay 2 bucks to remove the ads, but isn't necessarily going to make the experience better.  The ads are short, for the most part, but still can get annoying if you've played 10 puzzles in a row.  And considering you can complete a puzzle under or around the 2 min mark, those ads add up.  Worth a dl if you enjoy this type of game.",

        "Honestly i really enjoy the game thus far thank you for all the recent updates niantic... but there is one thing that has been bothering me and that is 1v1 with friends and trading... both features were shown in the original trailer... yet again i love the care your giving the game niantic i truly praise it but i would like to know whats happening with my 2 listed thoughts",
        "Simply just needs more events. I get why trading isnt available yet, which is to prevent RMT and if you have RMT that's just the end of the game. But hope you could soon add the 1v1 battle feature, BUT WITH MOVES LIKE THE REAL GAME NOT JUST TAP AND USING THE SPECIAL SKILL.   Overall love it tho, been walking 2km/day for 2 whole weeks now. (Lookin for a gastly xD)",
        "Please have more legendary raid events with gen 1 and 2 Pokemon for new and returning players who want to collect everything. With regards to using GPS and joystick cheats you guys actually benefit by getting more players from rural areas or dangerous areas playing and spending money. Besides you still have to do all the hard work minus the walking so it technically isn't that unfair to others especially since everyone is level 40 these days with legendary Pokemon. The game is already balanced just needs more events. Please consider a premium service to pay for where we can use a joystick in game. We can pay monthly or something so everyone benefits.",
        "I love this game! Been just playing on my wife's account. Just recently decided to make my own, and it will not let me get past choosing my first Pokemon. They all spawn in the same spot and it quickly shows error 11 or whatever and won't even register me moving. I've tried everything to toubleshoot and fix it. Nothings working. Really sucks because I love playing. Can someone fix this or tell me what's going on?",
        "thx for niantic that always listened our sugesttion, but i wish we can trade or battling with other player around the world by staying at poke center or else... - and btw you should update the new gym and new pokestop... since when i was on holiday in Indonesia theres not so much pokestop and gym around :( even there are many landmark in there - another suggestion plz maked some item that can be used to summon legendary/raid battle in location that we want, so its much easier  for the communities to do raid battle in specific location",
        "Can you developers make it so people can trade pokemon and other things like items? Itll make the game sooooo much better if teamates could trade items and Pokemon. People did it with cards, atleast to trade Pokemon. My bf and i play along with his friend David and when one of them need something that i got and visa versa, we should be able to trade. If you guys can make it happen, ill give this 5 stars instead of 4."

        "I'm totally addicted to this game! great graphics and lots of fun games that really make you think.  I just wish that it used up lives rather than credits because the credits can run out so fast and take a while to build the pot up again unless you want to pay £",
        "It's a really fun and addictive game with one major flaw. After you start getting to the harder levels, you might as well quit and find a new game unless you only want to play one or two rounds an hour or pay to play. Every level costs coins to play and if you fail a level you are out pretty much your whole hourly allotment of coins. Winning a round doesn't make up for even one loss either. Love the game,  but really annoyed that I can't actually play it consistently enough to truly enjoy it.",
        "Like it but costs too much to play. Can only play a short time before I run out of points. To bad because great graphics.",
        "The only thing I do not like about Grand Harvest Solitaire is not being able to earn more coins to play longer. Games cost 2000 coins to play and you don't win much more than 2000 so you're always relying on harvests for coin & unable to play until you build your coins back up by harvesting every hour...",

        "Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "First of all It's joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱",
        "I realize y'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don't pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I'm pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It's a pretty good app and I've sent many people to download your app.",
        "Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don't decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don't mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don't actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.",
        "8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don't win any games until those coins are over and I'm only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don't know why this is happening but it sucks because it's putting me off the game.. it's like 8 ball is making sure I'm losing hence the rate 3",
        "This is the most addictive game i have playing since a bought this phone. All the new updates are cool. Need to get rid of those hackers playin along. Also when we get a phonecall the game reopens, its better if you  reconnect it during the tier its self .. very plesent game give lots of happiness.. make sure you work with above mentioned glitches, then 5* is sure."

        "I like the game, and it's addictive, but the mechanics are absolutely flawed. There have been tons of instances where the game has unfairly screwed me or other player's over. 1. Places mystery boxes in front of the player who drives second, but not the first player. 2. Hills like to stop a ball, that is being shot full force by an iron club, in it's tracks. 3. The swinging spike balls only affect some players golf balls, but not others.  Things like this piss people off, because they expect the game to be fair. Those small things easily aid a player in losing a match.",
        "Game cheats, puts you against lower lol players with better equipment who make ungodly shots, or much higher level where you don't have a chance. I hit things that aren't there, and with a crossword my ball will fly into the wind with no action. Opponent Always get better wind and direction, and will outshoot you work lower equipmeny.",

        "Really has potential to be fun, but is pretty well stacked against you if you aren't spending money. I did well, won 60%, until I unlocked stage 6. Now I can't win in stage 3. I lose 5 or 6 times until I'm out of coins and have to wait to get some again. I couldn't even earn enough to enter tournament in a 3 days span. My skill level didn't suddenly drop off...",

        "I used to play this game a couple years ago, and at the time, it had satisfying gameplay and great time killing qualities. I used to love it then and I still do now, but I've recently noticed pretty annoying glitch that's driving me away from the game. For some reason, a few hours after I download the game, it doesn't allow me to enter the game anymore. When I open the game,  it will run smoothly up until the point when it reaches the loading screen and simply returns me to the home screen. I try to reopen it and the same thing happens. I'm not really sure why this happens, but until this glitch is gone, I will be forced to stay away from the game entirely as the only way to fix this glitch is to download the game again which is quite time consuming.",
        "Marvelous game!!! Likely you back to the right on your last update.  I just purchased the chainsaw blade, the DRAGON blade was a huge desappointment we was expecting phenomenal motions not that catoon flag . Also : all the good stuff are in mini game, the others dojos are kind very less quality, let us use minigame blades and dojos in arcade or zen even by purchase that will be nice. Thank you",
        "I don't really mind having to watch ads to get bonus items or XP, but the forced 25 second videos after EVERY DAMN GAME is just too much; it's way faster to just close the app and open it again, but it really destroys the game experience",
        "This fruit ninja is great! However, I sorely miss Fruit Ninja: Puss In Boots, and I'd really like it back!",
        "They should add that you can give your friends starfruit and that you can friend people      PLEEEEEEEEASEEEE ADD AND UPDATEEEE!!!!",
        "I love it! My whole family was telling my friends to download it and they just love the whole game. Anyone who doesn't like the game are just saying that so people don't download it. DON'T listen to them liars! Keep up the good work. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"

Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.",

I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!",

I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It's not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game",

The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.",
        "Not 100% sure how that works but the other person has their king and it's a stale mate and I have practically most of my pieces but to unlock harder levels I have to win. Does stalemate not count? I think its pretty stupid"

Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.During the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.Chess is popular and is often played in competitions called chess tournaments.

There is no in between you either win or you finish 14th or lower. You have 30 pts lead in front of number 2. after 1st round, you slightly fail your 2nd jump, guess what? 18th place for you! If you jump for example 120m on a K90 in Q, you finish first because everyone jumped 20m less, sudennly in 1st round you need 130m to secure your first place because everone managed to jump extra 30m.

I'm disappointed, expecially for the \"restore purchase\" button that not works. Despite this I think that as a game is fun but monotonous in the long run, defect of 90% of apps of this kind. I hope developers will add something with updates that are not other challenges that ofter go to luck (and waiting time should e removed also). Sometimes there are some bugs but irrilevant for gameplay. The development house has made other interesting apps too. Sorry for errors, is not my first language.",

        "The game is alright. Still too early to give it a proper review. Only here to say that the timers are way too long in the early stages of the game. Waiting an hour or four for thirty seconds of gameplay. They need to work on scaling the progression timers. A game like this is okay with long timers in late game when you have more than one thing to keep track of. But for these pay to win games to be profitable it helps to bait the hook a little harder before making you wait hours for more content.",
        "This game is a solid mix of \"clash of clans\" and \"fallout shelter\". Just like COC, you have to learn to let the timers cool off. The long term time investment can be very rewarding. The questing/pvp is also well done considering you can't choose what to attack or when during battle. Wholeheartedly a good game.",
        "GG easy. everyone whining being pay to play this that. i never bought anything and I'm loving this, just need a little patience and you can do many things untill one thing gets done or upgraded. I'm high in ranks, have a clan dedicated to non buyers. its all cool. been over 4 months and i still play this its amazing! great work guys, keep it up and keep adding new stuff.",
        "I love the game.  The thing is, this game just gets boring.  For example,  all you can do right now is to vanquish invasions. That's basically it. The portal is not always open.  The tournament? Well the match ups are way too oblivious.  My in game friends already have started quitting coz of these problems. You have to add something fun soon. Well it is still a fun game tho.",
        "Would be a great game if it wasn't blatantly pay to win.  Everything in the game is designed to push you to pay.  I enjoyed it at first and usually toss about $15 since it was decent.   But then, the system pairs you with opponents you can't defeat which then hampers your progress greatly which then means you either pay or hope you don't get attacked too much and lose all your resources.",
        "Been playing since early access relese. Game is very well built. But like all other games. The ads now bugged. The daily quest for the ad has never worked for me. Starts ad restarts app no credit. Oh well its an ad right. Well now your forcing me to watch them. Please fix So can i atleast finish those 2 daily quest?!?!?!  Also since update my androids menu buttons overlay all buttons on far right/left hand of screen depending on tilt. Phone is an LG stylo 3. Please address and i will rerate later."

        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",
        "Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.",
        "Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don't even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.",
        "Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn't be putting people in the \"club\" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this \"club\" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they're INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game"

        "This game needs the ability to gain more township cash. I have spent way too much real money to buy township cash and im not doing so again at this rate. Farmville isnt this bad and hard to expand.  You cant expand the barn without waiting on products by train or paying in township cash to expand. And that costs over a couple hundred township cash for each expansion. Getting a dollar or two here and there takes forever to collect. Plus the expansion makes small expansions so it doesnt help much.   If something dont change i may quit the game. I enjoy it and would like to continue but at this rate i dont see much point. I cant afford to pay more money to play.",
        "The VERY best game EVER..so fast to level up... Never boring.. Always SO much to do!!! ... it NEVER asks 4 money !!!!!!   NO pop ups or commercials. !!!. . the inventors are genius... i Love this game..  thank you for making this game.. Graphics are Amazing!!!   Best farming game ...Bonus Zoo !!!...and breed ur animals ADORABLE BABIES.. with a splash of Cityville  ..Gold digging..making ingots to use...  So many optional tournaments if u want to win more money n prizes in the Regattas... Township friends make it SO much easier n fast 4 everyone  .. and so much more You just HAVE TO Try TOWNSHIP ❣💞",
        "The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen",
        "Great game very addictive, and I don't know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats's kind of ridiculous. That's the only bad thing I have to say about this game.",
        "BEST GAME EVER! It's my biggest game but even though I have an old phone the game still runs really smoothly. There's always something to do, it never gets boring. I've been playing for 8 months. Super easy to use and learn. It's addictive. You also don't feel pressured to make purchases like other games.",
        "I'm not a game player, but this game is a lot of fun, AND, you never have to spend a dime! Of course, unless you want to spend money!  I do wish the direction went into a little more depth. It would make it a little easier for new people to understand the extra things, like the snow boarding and the regatta."

The mechanics are poorly-thought-out and I frequently would hit the \"wrong\" button while trying to play, which would cancel my productivity. Not worth my time and not worth yours."

        "Its a legit fun game to play but...  For me I get streshed because when I need to do it over again then u  streshed by not doing it...    Its still kind of a good game though..  Also on YT thanks for...   !!!! 2 SUBSCRIBERS!!!!  I know its not alot but I am rlly happy and I'm thankfully to who subscribed to me on YT :)  My name was galaxy DJ but now..  Its AngelPlayz I haven't even uploaded any videos yet 😂😂 but thanks for the support!  I might be making new videos about roleplays bloxburg builds and games to enturtain u guys to not be bored!!   I LIKE TACCCCOOOOSSSSSSSSS.....  🍍🍍🍍 .. This is so long lol...   Sorry how this is so long 😂😂😂😂 Well yeah that's all I got to say..!!?  Cya peace GUYS🍍🍍",
        "Well, I admit, I'm addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn't be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can't Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍",
        "The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won't annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie",
        "It's a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it's super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.",
        "So rage inducing! But i am a comete noob at your amazing creations. When o first downloaded it 3 yrs ago i hated it a deleyed after failing the first level before getting halfway. Some how though my abillity for rage cam control itself and yea. So in a way you made a rage game that helped my rage. Huh. Anyways great game might buy full version. Only if i can become a good player though",
        "Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it's fun because it's challenging and there's super fun things in GD except hacking because that's no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I'm super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂"

My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I'm not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr",
        "Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I'm paying £9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn't make it worth the price being asked.",
        "I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren't here. They don't connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw",
        "Super Mario run is a great smartphone game it has the very addicting toad rally and remix ten and the simple, but very rewarding controls. The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars",
        "Its good fun but extra world tour levels are needed to sell the full game, both after purcgase and before. But if you delve into the crevices of each mode and extract every bit of play you'll find out whether it's worth it",
        "I beat world 1, and I have to pay for the rest of the game? Really? This is stupid.. If you're going to have a game you need to pay for, market it as such, not the ol bait and switch. Very deceitful.. At least make a trial game or demo game not lure someone in and then tell them they need to pay to finish the game"

        "I rather enjoy the game a lot. It feels balanced for the most part,  leveling takes a while which wouldn't be a issue if it didn't take so long to go place to place. Gets sort of annoying to go back and forth trying to get resources and the game goes from fun to grindy quickly.   My main issue is the battery life of my phone. While charging my phone and playing this game but battery was being drained.  Graphics are good, I enjoy the crafting and base building, the combat is nice, and the auto harvest feature is a life saver.",
        "**UPDATE** Is an awesome game. Could use a few more perks (ie. Weapons and hard to get items) in drop boxes and yellow zones.Now the down side is if you die in a level your last position is no longer there to try and recoup some of your items. Players killing you as you open trunks in inventory. Oh ya and the free spin box...give random prizes instead of coins and rope. People will get really into it if perks are awesome. Great game could be the best with a couple tweaks. Awesome job.",
        "Just another game that either makes you wait to play it, or pay not to wait. Why? Don't make me pay not to wait. Entice me to pay with cool things, otherwise it's an instant uninstall. Poor business model. Imagine paying double to get them to make your food faster at a restaurant, or just wait a long time. Would you really keep going there, or somewhere else that makes something just as good but in a reasonable amount of time?",
        "Anyway i edit this review... The is nice and graphics are cool. But there is the problem on the game. Could you pls remove the energy bar so i can still play the without waiting to fill the energy bar... Cause otherwise i less play this game in days... that you know you must wait your energy bar to fill again in a couple of minutes if the energy is gone?. Pls Remove it so we can play all day along.. Thank you.",
        "This game truly amazing with beautiful graphics, decent yet easy controls, a large amunt of items and okay customization. The only reason i give this a 4 star rating is because one thing. The hoard mechanic. I mean it's a good concept. The only problem is that there's a hoard every 24 hours. And since wood is kinda pain to get it sucks to come back after work to come to a destroyed house. If it was like every month or heck even every week that would be fine just please give more time than 24 hours for a hoard",
        "Not happy at the moment after the latest updates... No point of spending any cash seeing that you went from getting a loot box to only getting one item at a time... Some parts are still impossible to come by even clearing the infected forest. Hope the next update will be more worthwhile. Apart from that still a good game. Keep it up"

And then you have that \"Aha\" moment. There it is.  The trap is set. Lol you are not continuing to play because it is addictive. You play in order to collect coins so you can buy stuff to make the little fish happy. 💘 the graphics kind of a little like an underwater Farmville with the plants 🐟 and decorations you can get fort your aquarium. I do play with 🎶 turned off. Cute game so far.        Graphics make it better than Candy Crush.",
        "With an easy guide, on 'How to play'. Once you get going its great fun. Dare I say quite addictive. Fantastic animations. Amazing back ground music. Plus, no app freezes either.  Its an 'A☆' from me at least.  Only, what would be a great idea. Is all the piggy bank jewels you build up, should be awarded for your hard efforts. Should not have to buy them back.  Only purchase jewels when desperate.",
        "Great game but would love it more if it kept track of when you bought something . Like a little quantity number in the corner after you purchase a fish or decorations. Hard to save up to buy things for guests, sucks when you buy something you already have when trying to complete a task. Other then that it's a great game lol I enjoy playing it.",
        "Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I'm 32 and play this often so it's not just for kids . Give it a try it's very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen 😉",
        "Fantastic game! It's great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.",
        "Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can't do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!"

        "Very simple. Gives me a lot of nostalgia. Two things though, it seriously needs music maybe some Celtic tunes or shanties. And secondly it needs more stuff to do. When I first saw a whale I was excited about doing some whaling but nope. The whales do absolutely nothing. Maybe even some treasure hunting puzzles or something. Good game just needs a little more content.",
        "Good game however, once you've taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world's and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.",
        "Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.",
        "It's a really great game! I'm really looking forward to an update. I think it'd be REALLY helpful to be able to purchase an extra boat that just goes around and picks up boxes.. Having to turn around all the time gets tedious. Also an online pvp would be awesome. Maybe have the ability to make clans with your friends that can attack other clans. I'm looking forward to see what you guys do!",
        "This game is great overall and you have a great sense of progression as your ship gets bigger and faster. The problem is the controls themselves. I found it very hard( I noticed this when I reached HP or ship level 6 ) and sometimes close to impossible to fire at other ship even at point blank range. The game has a very hard time trying to focus on one ship and would often shoot at where the enemy was 3 seconds ago especially when there is more than 3 ships at once which often happens. I would recommend a fire button option to compliment the controls and the gameplay experience. As I said before, it is indeed a very amusing game and would be even more enjoyable with this added feature.",
        "Great game in all honesty I can actually see myself playing this game for weeks to months. Everything about it is perfect and I  love how it is not based on a story.   Note devs: for some reason after playing for 10 min strait my boat gets to the point where it can't hit a single shot so I have to restart the game."

        "This game is mind blowing. The art style is great the animations and the crafting. However u can improve this great game. 1: It would be better if u could tell us what each material is and what can it be used for by adding an information section. Add more building materials. U can add a fence so that we can guard our house and more weapons and types of arrows (🔥 fire arrows, bomb arrows) something like that and more clothing. Also add multiplayer (cuz it would be fun).Overall this is the hands down best survival game on mobile. TBH I thought this game would be a dark souls on mobile but no it's better than that.",
        "I love the game, the crafting system is awesome, the gameplay is great. However, there are some points that I suggest  1. Nerf the Damned, also the Lepers, they are strong for beginners. Club can't beat them easily 2. Make another way to find leek seeds 3. Lepers can detect you sneaking to them, and they spawn out of nowhere. I don't know if it is a bug or not. 4. Cooking meat uses too much wood.  I look forward for more updates. It's a great game to be honest.",
        "It's a good attempt but too easy to die. No water. Seriously? I have an empty bottle yet nothing to put in it. I would like the chance to explore and build BEFORE I die five times and can't reclaim the stuff I've spent time collecting.  If these things are remedied I'll try again. Till then, deleting.",
        "Honestly it's a great game and lots of fun but that energy mechanic needs to change. I know you can walk but it's still such a strange thing to gate your players out of playing.  Maybe if you could always travel at the same speed but if you didn't spend energy you could be attacked randomly while you travel. Or if energy was used to speed up crafting. I dunno but it's the only thing holding me back from a perfect score.",
        "This game is awesome but here are the things like really want in the next game. 1. I need to disconnect with Google play to delete my old saved progress full of mistakes. Please add this feature. 2. Zombies are too hard to beat . Please decrease some of their capabilities. 3. There must be an increase in chest slots . 4. Please decrease the quantity of wood logs to cook. Otherwise all of our hardworking to gather logs while be replaced by only a few meats and others. 6. Please add another source of getting seeds. They are too hard to get.",
        "Very good idea but lack of some stuff like improvements. Right now the demolition system not work and we cannot move the walls or floors. The energy should be more sustainable and will be good if the trees on the base and some stuff randomly spawn. I will drop the game for now and on the future i Will give another shoot"

        "So nice to sit and enjoy a game of challenge. Almost as much fun as chess, but easier to carry. Great way to relax while waiting for the zombie apocalypse or the bus to come. Thank-you and keep up the awesome work.  *UPDATE* 17 FEB 2018.  Have started my friends and family trying to get Top Score. No one is really trying as they are all enjoying playing the app to care. Brought a tear to my eye. Once again, \"Thank-you\"  for a truly  wonderful game.",
        "Simple tile game with a nice learning curve. Easy enough to be able to relax while playing and challenging enough to not be boring.  Instant gratification for finishing levels, packs, and difficulty ratings.  There are 'rolling points' that I haven't figured out the use for yet. Coins to purchase hints and other stuff. The ball can have different 'skins' that you unlock as you complete grpups of packs.  TLDR?  I'm having fun. Maybe you can too.",
        "The graphics, controls, n the gameplay are ALL 5 by me. I was expecting this game to be boring but finally, i downloaded it n it was a BLAST! I could NEVER take my eyes off this game as its AMAZINGLY fun. I was not expecting it to be THAT fun, but it was!!! There is absouloutly NOTHING WRONG about this game. The only  thing that is wrong is when people say bad things about this game. But there are NO glitches, barely no adds n NO expectations! This game is absouloutly my MOST favourite  game OF ALL the others.👍",
        "Great game. Starts easy so you can get your eye in and then gets harder. Fun to play and not so difficult that you give up and uninstal. Ads are over fairly quickly and I like that you can choose to watch some to get extra coins.",
        "Nice game I like it very much and in game if we don't have money so they ask watch and after watching video they give 100 or 200 Rs the game is very long and after win we got a new Ball",
        "This game is awesome,  a great puzzle game. I only had it for about 3 weeks and already on pacgage 20 level 10 on expert. I  will have the game beat in a few days. Thanks for amazing game."

        "Good game to pass your time. Upgrade costs and parts spawn rates are reasonable if you only use a few vehicles because it will take a long to yo max out everything. I think it will be better if league vs trophies distribution are reworked because its very easy yo reach legends. should give a higher win bonus at higher trophies i think to make it more competitive. And lastly, hackers should be deleted from leaderbord.. there are a few impossible timings on the board.",
        "I enjoy the game greatly. It's slightly different with  the chest and stuff but it is sure nice to get bonuses every now and than. There are new adds though which I'm not super stoked about like the brake time adds but they keep them short and can be skipped quick if you have already watched them. All and all great game",
        "I love this game. Every game I've had, I played for a week or so, and uninstalled. But this one? Ive had for almost 6 months. Been playing every single day. Finally reached legendary 32, I've unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so. Or at least a new adventure spot. Making a modded version of the rally car would be fantastic. Also, an upgrade on the formula car where it doesn't almost dead stop after it lands from a big air.",
        "If you don't want to give away free stuff from the chests, don't. But stop wasting my damn giving me these \"free\" coins for watching a video only to have the ad freeze %95 of the time. The are plenty of other free games out there, might be time for a change.",
        "Constant ads.  Excruciatingly slow progression unless you pay.  Game crashes more than I crash in the game.  Could have been a great sequel to HCR 1, but it feels like playing a money-grab instead.",
        "Superb game! Too bad, the elements of hate like to hack good things and cause frustrations. For this reason, constantly run constant updates. I wouldn't mind paying through my rather expensive data to diffuse the damage by these bored, small prick nincompoops! Africa😝😝😝"

It makes my phone slow and all this might just be my opinion but it really is a terrible game that I wouldn't recommend.

But for the time I was able to use the game, it did seem like an okay game.",

It's especially insulting when you're in Sydney Australia and most of the questions for the careers relate to the US. Also, seriously lame that you now have to spend large amounts of bp tickets just to complete land marks. I'm going to uninstall."

The game goes easy on you if you're not good at it which defeats the point of getting good",

I'll make a shot then it will continue to count me down and tell me I'm out of time.  Freezes until my times up. I've lost close to 200k in coins lately and it's really starting to piss me off. Also, never consistent. I'll make a near identical shot as my opponent and ball travels completely different. Really starting to piss me off. Been playing this game for a LONG time and I'm about ready to delete it!",
        "It's cool but everyone seems to be fairly good so all matches come down to a shoot out. Meh. And in the shootouts your opponent can see ur shot if u go first. Meh. All kinds of perks for FB. I don't have FB. Meh. Have to spend $$ to get decent clubs and balls or play this 24/7 and I won't do either lol. Nice try tho playdemic. Cheers."

My only gripe is that the squares or hexes are too small so it is very hard to navigate the puzzle without breaking previous connections. My other issue is that at times connections randomly disconnect. Fixing these issues would make the game more relaxing",

Its so easy that it's a good game to play when you need to multi task while watching tv. I went public and noticed there have been hundreds of others already mastered this app as well."

But when I'm connected to Wi-Fi there's too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you'll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I'm playing the game??!! It's too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.",
        "Well before I say my review, I would like to clear out a few of the negative reviews. There are not very many ads at all, in fact I barely ever even get any. Second, the controls don't suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.",
        "Nice game but became boring in just one day! 2 options of controls: Spin (Steering Wheel) and Tap. Tap option is easier than spin. You have to complete the damn missions but the coins are only available in Normal mode they aren't available in arena mode. For making easy highscore follow this!! 1. Switch your controls to tap mode. 2. Open Arena mode. 3. In the beginning take the U-turn. 4. Keep driving in the middle line i.e in between of lane 1 and lane 2. 5. Just keep driving on that small line dividing both lanes and you'll get your highscore until and unless you get tired, I've made it to 3,887.  Normal mode is quite harder than the Arena but it provides coins and you've to play it for getting your missions accomplished!  Thanks",
        "I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don't you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?",

If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game.

One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.",
        "Fantastic game. Real addiction game I'd say. It's an awesome time killer. Different types of levels never make the game boring. Graphics is okay. Number of ads for a free to play game is less compared to other games out in the market which is a relief.Overall I would give 4.5/5",
        "Love this app! I prefer the original version over the walls, hex, etc. and have solved every single one of them. Need more puzzles. Although I'm sure I can solve them all again as it's impossible to remember these. Either way, I cannot get enough of them."

Im prob gonna try to get more ppl to play with me too lol. There could be more variety in the blocks, and there should be like different modes, just an idea",
        "Its cool and all but needs some extra features.  Maybe a way to store 1 brick for later or some level advancement.  Maybe challenges or a power up system. The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.",
        "What they show on the preview and what it gives you in game don't even match. They make it look like it so easy. You cannot rotate the pieces. The pieces they give are so random, and most games you can barely get past a couple of turns before you can't place anymore and you lose.",
        "Would like to sometimes when my score is really high get a second chance to redeem myself. Other wise I like the game - kills some time when needed👍",
        "This is very deceiving. It looks like it's Tetris, but it's not. The pieces don't come down like the pictures show. I hate apps like this who deceive people to believe its a certain game when it's not just to get people to download. Will never download a game from this developer again.",
        "Love the game can't seem to put it down. Great time passes while you're waiting for your washing to dry at the laundromat, beats watching it spin around. Not happy with all the adds popping up after every game and sometimes in the middle of a game."

        "Should be called adzy. During the level theres an ad banner at the bottom. At the end of every level there's an ad, some you can't skip and have to wait an entire 30 secs to sit through. To make matters worse, the chests can be boosted by 50% by watching, you guessed it, an ad.  They don't even give you a shop option to remove ads for a small amount of money or some sort of package. Pure plain greed",
        "All in all it is a really great game there are very few ads, its fun, the graphics are crisp. Its amazing except for one thing. On one of the levels all of the monsters have exactly 666 health and im not religious or anything but I'm pretty sure that if some one who is religious see's that, well lets just say that it might not be good for the company, so I suggest you fix this.  Thanks.",

I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn't level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can't progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.",
        "This game is simple. So simple that it is stupidly addictive at times when my mental and physical ability equates to a bowl of fruit. Nothing in this game brings me more satisfaction than the immensity of lag when bolts are caught in rapid bounce in a confined space. I say that with the utmost sincerity, no sarcasm at all. The lag is so intense, so joyful to watch. Please don't take it away from me. It is beautiful.",
        "Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It's nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don't want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn't get a key.",
        "Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion."

        "This is the best life simulator game by far. Instead of just focusing on getting rich this game has many other focuses like love, nationality, jobs, kids etc. The one thing that isn't at all necessary but I kind of want to see is a avatar for the character you're playing as. Perfect game. 😁👍  EDIT: hi just reporting on a glitch in the game. There's an option to transition your gender bit even though my character is over 18 they can't do it. Otherwise still a perfect game.",
        "I think it's incredible and I am hooked. Although I do hope for more such as, instead of just instagram famous, perhaps become a famed scientist, actor, writer, astronaut or business person OR be known as beloved (or not so) Educator/Teacher etc. A bit more drama added with partner/children good and not so good. Varying reactions to their dilemmas, perhaps even a child dating, married, having a child (grandkids) and other random child updates with or without the option to react accordingly. Overall, addictive and thoughtful game.",
        "Hi - playing this game for a few months now and a big fan. I suggested during beta phase that there should be an option of money management as well. We can be a millionaire but dont know what to do with all that liquid. We should be able to invest in moveable and immoveble assets. Should be able to open a company/business and invest in other company's stocks etc. This game will be even more interesting that way. Hope we will see these features soon. Thanks.",
        "I have been playing through the beta phase, and am completely hooked. You can pick it up and play whenever the mood strikes. It is easy to grasp, every new life is different, and it is engrossing without being addictive. Once you're done with a life you can create a new one or close the app and move on with your real one. There is no waiting for something to build or happen, there are very few ads and most are by choice to gain something. There are no in-app purchases to enhance game play, its all there from the beginning. The developers have done an incredible job with a simple concept.",
        "Truly amazing game. Highly recommended to anyone who likes simulator games. Works without wifi and the developers listen to what u have to say. Sure, there are a few glitches but I'm sure they'll get fixed over time. Loved it Edit: can you transition your gender without having gender dysphoria",
        "First of all, congratulations on the full release! I've been playing this game for a few months now and I'm absolutely hooked. Whenever I'm bored or don't want to use my phone's data, I just play this game. There are a few things that I think would be cool to add in or go more in depth with, but other than that, this game is borderline perfect! I reccomend downloading"

        "This games accuracy is worse than my atari 2600 and is 1000 times worse than my 5200. It seems like in 38 years with all the technology we have today , someone would finally figure out that when you go up, You go up and not right and when you go right it goes right and not down. Not the case here. Man we have games that live life for you basically. But still cant figure out how to fix pac man. REALLY? And the ads an ad after every board. Ads ads ads and then guess what? Another ad. Very shameless",
        "Touch screen Pacman never as good as joystick. This app way too many popup vid ads. Graphics not the greatest either. But offers several additional mazes and options than standard Pacman layout. The constant forced ads cause me to close app and play something else.",
        "Came for Sonic, stayed for a good game. I suggest adding new ways to use coins, like for different variations of pacman or the ghosts. The only complaint i have is the loading time is quite slow",
        "Fun game, except in some games it gets too sensitive and I seem to lose control of the pacman. Other times it gets stuck in one place. It can be frustrating at times.",
        "this is a great mobile adaptation of the pacman we all know and love. it's not flashy like championship, or circley like the flash version - it's just good, clean fun",
        "When I got this back in 2015 it was great! Now it a full of ads and tokens for people to spend money. As well as nullifying my previous purchases. Thanks"

Given a legendary atrandom at start a,nd a random rare in chest would be cool was expecting that..but no just normal cards.hope I get  cool legendary one day.like. the chest idea hope you bring in armour card add on.like spear guy could have ice spear or flames.plus that's cool extract cards to collect to make your cards even better and unique. Thank you my supercell friend.this game oh almost,st forgot.bbbbbbbeest 2 v 2 game on mobile,!!!!!",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "This is  the best game ever. And supercell, can u add google + sign in so that people who don't use facebook can also have friends.. Also I have like 8 leggie right now and I am so happy. And the new clan battle is awesome, it is the best. I wish it is permanent. Anyways clan battle is so fun to play and who ever created it.. U r awesome. Keep up the good work Supercell. Love you so much and ur games.😙😙😙❤❤❤❤😀😁😁😊😊😊",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖",
        "This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game."

Wish i could get a refund back on all the gems you have to buy to finish levels. Yes you and your game is starting to p-ss us off waiting for you.  My phone is brand new up to date don't try to blame our phone and it the same on my tablet which is brand new to. All the sound was there before your new update",

Since I use my phone for making real income, I need to swap screens to other activities, and each time do a four step log in process back into the game. I have never seen this problem before in any other game, no reason this game would be different. About the game? Well, I'll tell when this problem is gone 😅",
        "It is  great game, for ages 10 and up even 9 is okay. It is cool that we are building a town from scratch, like from the prehistoric time, and building our way up. Not like other game that start you off with big present day buildings. It doesn't cost a lot to do things like building and removing things, some object are free, they give the right amount of money and you can always win some more diamonds. In other games you would have to pay to remove object and buildings are ridiculously expensive.  It is hard to make money in other games and to make diamonds. I personally at night put my hunters too make things that take 8 hours and in the day things that take 5 to 15 minutes but sometimes 1hour. It is a very good game, it is almost as a real life city town, empire.",
        "Boring!! Hurry up and wait. Never enough coins and forge points. Constantly waiting for buildings to make money and points. Ready made buildings. Can't build your own. Waiting, waiting, waiting. Been playing about 2 hours and already bored to death!",
        "Although FoE is very enjoyable, it can get very complicated, especially for new players.

        "Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!",
        "Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm's Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!",
        "Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I'm just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it's going to be good.  We'll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!",
        "This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10",
        "I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.",
        "Don't get me wrong, these new levels and songs are fun and addictive and all of the new stuff is awesome... but stop making new apps? Why not just update the original? It's kind of frustrating to have a paid version with stuff I've unlocked but have to deal with an unpaid version (aka, ads) and have to unlock skins and colors all over again because new apps keep being made."

        "I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It's fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn't want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.",
        "This game is have potential, don't ruined it because of money. I have never been watching so many ads In my life just to get some 2 stars parts. Instead of being creative and making cool machines, this game is turning to - either pay to win or watch alot of ads to win. What's the point of \"playing\" in this game?",
        "I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I'd end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!",
        "Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It's reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis's and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I'm offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,",
        "Fun strategy game, just wish it was easier to understand upgrades and easier to get a decent vehicle. Sometimes you have to wait for boxes other times you can watch ads to get thru them with no rhyme or reason as far as I can tell. The variety or maybe the lack of variety in boxes is pretty annoying. Sometimes you get the exact same part multiple times or with slight variations, which can drag out trying to get a decent upgrade on things.",
        "Its now just a money grab... not happy with the way this game is going, it used to be a fair rewards system, with decent quality gear, then it changed to become basic gear almost all of the time, then it became difficult to prestige since it was have good rockets and a lifter or don't win and now you actually get very little for your hard work climbing the ranks. Waiting 24 - 48 hours for a reward doesn't cut it for me."

        "I have crashed a ridiculous amount of times in the new update. And guess what? If it doesn't crash, it lags so bad that it makes it impossible to play. Its a good game when it works, which isn't very often for me. And now when I was riding in a three wheeler and a enemy started driving and I crashed, then when I got back I was out of the three wheeler and in the middle of a fire fight and died",
        "I love the game over all. There is one thing that ticks me off the cars. people get them then chase u and knock u down. Once u r knocked down they get out of the car and kill u. IT'S RIDICULOUS. The fact that you cant shoot through the fences makes it so others can use them as coves while u move to them and get killed",
        "Before the update its just normal lag that I used to. But after the update, its getting more lag + delay when try to look around. What I mean is you know when your finger is not sync with character movement (uhh how do I explain this). Sorry my english is terrible. Idk if you get what Im trying to explain. Like 0.5 second delay when look left look right look up look down. Its very hard to aim at enemy and looting and stuff. All of this happen after the Feb 28 update.",
        "This is F ridiculous!! I experienced more glitches after the update!! The updates didnt do anything much about the glitches!! People will just appear from nowhere!! I played this game everyday and every single day i always experience glitches!! The sound is also confusing even if you try to listen.You hear sounds that coming from the back but the enemy is actually in front.",
        "No complaints about the game, i liked it. It's just that i lost my account today and i dont know what's the cause. last time i played it i closed the game when i finished a match by pressing the home button and left it there for a few hours. when i open the game again my account was lost. i forgot to bind my account to any social media because i thought i already binded it by sharing to facebook. is there any way you guys can help me ?",
        "Hi, i really enjoyed the game, i play it every day for a few monts. But one thing that really bother is this game still have a lot of bugs, and cheater - how can enemy shot me while i was behind the tree? And we can get shot too while hiding behind the wall. Please fix this. And one thing, you need to change your system on buying some box. I kept getting the same clothing"

        "l was enjoying the game a lot and would have given it 5 stars. l spent a long time to get enough bricks to  build a level 7 home so dragons only needed 7 mins sleep.. NOW    only  the same 5 of my 30 dragons get out and this is making collecting bricks and healing power very slow. l have not seen all my green dragons and moon dragons( the hardest workers) for 2 days now. developers please help or l will stop playing. TY.",
        "I would love to give this game 5 stars but 99% of the ground I've uncovered is covered by \"treasure chests\" and there's no way to get rid of them or contact the game makers for help. I've completely run out of space and can't play anymore. The chests should disappear after 3 - 5 days if they're not opened.",
        "Love this game. Graphics are great and so much to do. Keeps me going for ages. Main concern and the reason I've not rated 5 star is the time it takes to get each token. When some levels take 7 and it takes half a day to fill up it's a major pain. Then you do a level that needs 4 and the next also 4 it takes the p*ss. Would be great to have a higher limit without getting charged or for them to fill up quicker. If this was done I would rate 5 star all round.",
        "2/5 stars because the only way to play the game is by paying! You can either pay to remove \"pay to open\" boxes or they don't go away taking up all your space! It takes 1 hr for your chalices (energy) to refill only 1 and you only get 7. Love the concept of the game and it is very unique but make it so that people can actually play. Get sponsors, play some ads, have the boxes disappear after a certain amount of time, ANYYHING! This is b*lls*it and not everyone has money to throw away on games. Fix it or I keep the rating low.",
        "Playing this game makes me lose track of time. Wish we could buy the dragon egg chests with game coins.  That would be greatly helpful. Please consider this. Also would be great to transfer items from other levels back to the camp, like eggs, flowers, etc. Plz have this feature.Thanks. Plus would help if there was a set button to hit to exit the game. I am finding it takes between a few to about 5 times to hit the back button on my tablet. Plz fix, would make things alot quicker.",
        "Buggy.  The game itself was pretty good but there are issues with the cloud save deleting peoples games + all their in-app purchases (like me). The support for the game is non-existent. They have one email address to send issues to, and it's been weeks, almost a month, since and there has been no response. So everything is gone and they can't be bothered to try and restore my account for a month.   In short, it was fun and addictive, but your game will delete itself eventually and the support staff doesn't care since they already have your money."

        "This is all I needed: another Criminal Case game to take up my free time! I love the whole four of them. The the hidden objects tease my brain to no end. Each game  is intriguing with an original story line. I do have my favorite crime scenes,  and plenty of friends(all over the world) whom play as often as they can too!",
        "It would be nice if you level up and get full energy but your energy had some if not all left before you got it restored that you just increased by the full amount, the way it is now I lose energy when levelling up because it doesnt add any more to the 110 that is standard. I dont think it is fair to those of us who play daily. I never know when my pet will find that last batch of XP and cause the level up to happen. If I am over the 110 already, I don't even see the new energy. Some concessions need to be made for this. I love the game though, it is fun and challenging.",
        "I love this game. I have all of the criminal case games & love them all. The only things that I don't like is that when when ur energy gets refilled, it only adds to what u have, instead of adding an extra 110 to what u have.

Although many improvements can be made to the game, the worst part is the ads, it's really bad, and it's insulting as a player that they try to milk this much out of us. You have constant random ads that take over your game at any moment. 5 ads per chest you craft to unlock each slot, ads when you switch to the map, floating treasure chests that require ads to open, even more pointless ads at every crafting bench, and the list goes on. I would gladly even pay to play an ad free version, but this is just ridiculous.",

Please fix this it is very annoying and im not able to play the game, because when the shark attacks in a corner you cannot hit him with your spear. This is the same for the zombie. I built a little house on the raft and it spawned behind the wall of my house. Please fix it",

        "Excellent fun and a fantastic way to introduce a new audience to some wonderful classical music as well as very talented contempory composers. My one gripe is that recently players have been given multiple oportunities to get 3 crowns or very high scores with ad powered resources. I feel this takes a lot of the challenge from the game. Anyone can get 3 crowns in 4 or 5 goes where us old guard of the game did if in 1 or 2 Still an awesome game though and well worth the download anytime.",
        "This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don't worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you'll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!",
        "I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who's better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn't seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don't think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.",
        "It's been 4 months since my report that the game has such a major glitch, still NO improvement. I lost so many lives just because the song suddenly slowed down and then as suddenly fast forwarding itself, there's no rhythm at all. Why don't you just fix the glitch first rather than add more songs.. Now, at 2018, it's only getting worse..",
        "I'm in love with this game. It's challenging, you don't have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks.",
        "there seems to be a malfunction with sound. I've played several songs and each one has parts where there isn't any music. I'm not sure if this is a bug or just something wrong with my phone. other than that, though, this app is really entertaining."

What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven't listened to this game's. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I'm entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.",
        "I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it's meant to be \"skillfull\" but thats harder than skillfull, you can't even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don't care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.",

        "Love the detail of going down to nut and bolts practically to do repairs. Two bones of contention:  The timer to access new barns is too long, does not make for satisfying game play. Also, after purchasing a tool upgrade, I was pleased to see a longer list of repairs gained. Great. Except I couldn't remove the fuel pump to remove the fuel tank. It said my tools needed upgrading for that one part. Please fix that bug so all repairs needed can be made with tool set level.",
        "It's a good game with room for improvement, I've leveled up my tools to level 4 but it's so annoying when it says tools need to be upgraded, this need to be  improved. All so when you fix a vehicle the money could be upped a bit more. I know you can re-paint the vehicle but I wish you could improve the wheels and the interior of the vehicle to make some more money. The other thing that the other paint uses coins how about instead or all so to pay for the other paint with the in game money.",
        "Well let's see ..played the game fixed 7 cars and I made about $70,000 on the game I bought another car and had to replace just about all the parts on it I bought all the parts and was in the process of putting all the parts on it and in the middle of that ,the game shut down on me I opened it back up to continue playing and it had started back over from the beginning at the tutorial and I lost all progress. y'all need to fix this. until this is fixed and or I am put back where I was on the game then I would not recommend downloading this game or any of the other mechanic games for 2018, much less even playing it. it's a waste of time and data also had a trouble with the other 2018 version mechanic game you will see a posting on that one where it's not giving enough time to fix panels and it's not registering clicking on panels to find out if anything's messed up on them .thanks for the problems and the issues. This game is on this phone of mine and the other game is on my other phone developers. You'll see a post on the other garage mechanic 2018 game by Wesley wright. Yaw need to fix these issues ok , because these bad ratings I have been seeing by others isn't looking good for you games.",
        "Game is great but I would've loved some more features or more cars it gets repetitive real fast please add more features like OBD SCAN or inside car customizations also pc version you can change rims and wheels lights bumpers and add more cars not saying you should add all that but maybe some if possible to make it less repetitive",
        "\"Breaks\" is misspelled, and the photo button is in German or something. Cool game, can really help someone learn how a car works.",
        "Hi, I think this game is great, but it has a problem. Whenever I try to scroll on the menus all the items in the menu dissappear.  Would you please see what you can do to fix this?"

        "Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I'm 20 just..😉😉 I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I'm in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️",
        "Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there's nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.",
        "A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!",
        "Fun little time killer. My only problem is that daily rewards fail to show up most days. It could be a problem on my end, but I don't know, and it's a pretty small issue so I don't really care.",
        "Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn't respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I'm willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.",
        "I've noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don't think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying."

        "I think this game is brilliant. An absolute pleasure to play and I never get bored. This game should be voted one of the best games ever. Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can't join my sister and were only five levels apart.",
        "I LOVE this game My only complaint is in campaign mode it's said more worlds coming soon for YEARS!!! If they're not going to add a world eny time soon  they should at least change the coming soon part. But overall this is a good game and it seems like Cubic Games really care about what the consumers think.",
        "This used to be really cool. If you want to be strong buy gem weapons. It is too hard too earn coins or.gems. Also your opponents must be with same armor or level. I once fought a guy with the minigun shotgun and diamond armor and before I rekt everyone with the demoman but now it sucks",
        "This game is so good! I have played this game when it was in its early stages, and it was pretty good. Now it has gotten even better than before, with lots of multiplayer game options and lots of weapons and gadgets to choose from. There is one problem, which is when I got this game about a month or two ago, the prices to upgrade guns were pretty low for coins but ok for gems, but now they are ok for coins and WAY TO MUCH for gems, so I ask of you developers to please decrease the amount of gems it takes to upgrade gem bought guns.",
        "This game is the best I have ever played on a phone tons of maps, game modes, hundreds of guns, different tools, gear, and lots of skins. There is just so many things you can do. I also like it because it is a challenge something I would play. That's why I rated this game 5 stars.",
        "I don't like this update. Why does it cost so much to upgrade  weapons 2 more damage higher. And I don't like the fact that all the weapons that have low stars are nerfed. When I was on level 6 the hellraiser was a beast. Then when I got to level 7 I it wasn't as good, so I tried to upgrade it. BUT the price cost 120 coins. I am really disappointed about this. I played this game for 2 years and it sad to see how hard it is to win. They only want money that's it. Make your game better and fair. It's so unbalanced."

Please fix this as soon as possible because I really enjoy this game.",

All other puzzle improve your skills but this isn't since you have no time to caulate the expression it's more a test of memory then calculation because you can only 3 star it if you know the expression by heart if you try workout you answer right but run out of time. You should make is so each correct answer adds time so you can accurately l improve.",

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend.",
        "Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I've progressed it's just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I'm not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!",
        "One of the worse cash grabs I have ever seen.  Love the game, but you literally need hundreds of dollars to do any single event and get a decent reward.  Go look at the latest event on their Facebook page.  The reviews are awful, ands it veteran and new players alike.  Game is fun, but they need to cut costs by half to make it worth while."

Additional to that i saw therr locked 200 diamonds i clicked one of that and all my 420 diamonds gone and onlu 220 diamonds left and its showing me 2 big circle white and pink.. that's not fair....",
        "Found a game called \"Infinite Balls\" on my friend's iPhone, we loved it. This is the best Android alternative we could find, but it's not quite as satisfying. Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls. Would be nice to turn off the help lines, too.",

However I would highly recommend not spending any money on the in game purchases. I got ripped off, luckily with in game currency only and the \"game team\" is adamant that nothing went wrong. If that is the type of support they give I wouldn't want something to go wrong with my actual money. So long story short as long as u don't spend money u should have a good time playing",
        "This had already been done much better. This game allows you to play about 30 minutes before you need to shell out money to compete. Not interested in these crooked games. When are we going to get back to some honesty and not trying to screw customers to get rich?",
        "Love the game defiantly 5* just a couple of comments I hope get read it would be nice to gain some coins through friendly battles with people in your clan. Also if you could see when your group member's were last active it would be easier to sort out our clans. Thanks",

        "Smooth control. Awesome idea . Not Much more I can say about it.(First Review). Now, my first thoughts about this game was that it was very good but as I have updated the game it has just been very slow and overturns when you tap. It also randomly takes you to the play store without tapping on an ad.",
        "Very enjoyable game, quite addictive and jumping back into a new game is quick. Couple of gripes, there seems to be some slow down or framrate dipping after an ad has shown and the option to remove ads isn't working. Sort this out and it will get another 2 stars",
        "Ads pop up during gameplay where your fingers contact so it stops game play ... other than that it's good but I've had enough. Fk you chilly:-p uninstalling",
        "The game was awesome and I loved it. But the latest update ruined it with ADS. They put the banner exactly where you mostly tap with the fingers to change direction, the game got laggy which it was not before and has started getting way too many pop ups. Uninstalling. *Sigh*",
        "A lot of frame rate issues. Lost many runs because controls become unresponsive while gameplay continued. Ads are incredible intrusive. That said, it can be really fun if they cleaned up the coding on this simple game."

It says \"check comnection\" and my connection is fine even tried uninstalling it and all. Other games work on my phone and so does my Wi-Fi. The game just worked last night for me now it doesn't! PLEASE FIX!!",
        "Please bring back the old brewery map. I have been a long time player of this game, and loved the original brewery map. The new update of the map is so radical that it feels like an entirely different map, with all the pathways and corners. The uniqueness of the original brewery map is that it is small, and relatively open, so that combat is focussed and fun. There is more time fighting others than moving around trying to find enemy players. The new update just ruins that uniqueness, making it feel like the Bureau or Legacy map. I am okay with the new brewery map being a new addition, but please make it \"Brewery 2\" and bring back the original Brewery.",
        "Could you please add an offline mode...would be nice to practice on the go. Also please please please add more guns. I have been playing this game for a year and still no new guns but glad you are keeping up with the maps. I have this HUGE problem, it says check connection when I have good connection. I tried to restart my phone and reconnect but still doesn't work. PLEASE FIX.",
        "Just good. This game is great. The controls are completely customizable so you can make it work the way you want it to. Graphics are on point, better than 2nd Gen consoles, lesser than 3rd gen. If this game came out in the age of the PS2 I would have bought it. Also, buy a box because this game couldn't have been cheap to make. This game should cost like $25.",
        "I love C-OPS. It is one of the best FPS games for Apple and Android devices. It is very popular, few servers are empty. On lowest settings with 2 gigabytes of RAM, it runs at a BUTTERY 50 frames per second. Also, controls can be customized. I just notice a few graphical glitches.",
        "I love the game, it's great and there's not many fps games like these for mobile phones. My only problem is I can never play ranked. For whatever particular reason I can't even find other players. The game just stays searching forever and I really want to play ranked. I would have voted 5 stars but thats the only thing that bugs me. Please fix and will be happy to give 5 stars."

They offer 2 packs for 5 and 20 then except for rare sales which offer 49 and 79 dollar packs everything is 100 dollars google should step in and pull this game off the google play market for a square enix licensed product they have enough backing to have actual microtransactions not be a game exclusive to rich people who use 100 dollar bills as toilet paper...",
        "I kind of enjoy the game but would like it more if there were cheaper options to buying. After you buy some the prices jump to 99.99 and have yet to see cheaper prices. I'm not unloading that in one go. The people of this game would probably make more money if they bring cheaper prices. I would buy several different little packs that eventually add up to 100 bit you ain't getting nothing otherwise. Also wish you could buy more things with the gold you purchased. Like have a choice to spend loyalty or gold",
        "Please understand that there is really nothing free about this game except the install. While the gameplay WAS very promising at first, purchaseable bonus packs take any strategy completely out of the game. Now, in addition, each new element of the game that has been released in recent weeks requires cash to unlock. I can only use about half of the games features now. Bummer. If you're willing to pay, have a blast with this game. Otherwise leave it alone!",
        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much."

I just wish there was a difficulty setting so you start off with easier games and then it could get harder as it progresses, because at the moment I can't pass 70% of the levels without using hints.",

        "This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!",
        "This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you're willing to go broke",
        "Its the best game I have ever played. The things you can build are amazing and it's great that you can build your own to. The controls and graphics are unbelievably amazing. Great animal sounds to, they actually sound exactly the same as a real animal. Its also great that you can have villager's and your own pets. Only problem is the packs you have to use diamonds and if I don't have enough then I have pay for the diamonds and I'm just a kid and my mom says no so please make the packs and the things in them cheaper. But other than that, this game is so AWESOME. 😃",
        "Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.",
        "Great game but I have been trying to figure out how to chat. before any recent updates when the graphics were different I somehow figured out to chat with someone, but now I can't remember! plz plz PLZ tell me how to chat, and if u removed the ability to chat can u add it in again?",
        "Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses."

        "I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It's pricey but we'll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn't need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get",
        "This game is an amazing way to pass the time! I love all the upgrades and different levels, especially the events. The game gets more challenging as you go along, and the events I previoisly mentioned make it just that much better. My only complaint is how hard it is to get the special currency of the game, being diamonds. Other than that, it is a great game overall and I am looking forward to future updates.",
        "Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn't need to have the internet on. Don't know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.",
        "I loved the game but after the first restaurant you need gems to upgrade things regularly and they do not come around often after the first restaurant. All the achievements are money based. Money is easy to come by and I have only won on the casino once and all the fun is lost grinding to make money to spend on the slot machine to try and get gems. I'm on the second restaurant and I'm bored of waiting for gems to upgrade now.",
        "I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.",
        "I think it would be better if you got more gems. You can barely win anything on that little slot machine. I also noticed that you no longer get gems for every day you log in to play. Sure, the money is nice but you can't upgrade with just the money you earn while playing. I spun that slot machine 80 plus spins and barely won anything. Do the gems even pop up as a winning combo? They used to but not anymore."

And some items I've purchased don't work it gives a message saying they couldn't find it in the warehouse. But the game never gave me my gems back and of money. NEED TO FIX IT",
        "I have been playing for a year now and I'm still in love with Design Home! True, it's hard not to spend extra money but I do believe that the makers have formed a game that can be enjoyable by those with money to spend to have fun but, also have developed a game with really beautiful items that one can buy very inexpensively, and even pieces that are in between. You can't get more thoughtful than that!",
        "I love this game!! \"it helps a lot\" with my shopping addiction because I feel like I'm buying real merchandise. I really enjoy the updates and how you guys added more room to be designed!!!! Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))",
        "I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.",
        "Entertaining. It's easy to spend a lot of the free money and diamonds on design, then you may have to wait a while to advance if you want to play free. It's clear there is no switch up on the top players, so when you go into competition, it's all about how much money you have to spend. Even when the rooms have a theme, people tend to vote for their taste, vs. if the request stated i.e. Mid-century mod, or traditional. Addictive unfortunately.",
        "Great application. Very enjoyable. Only complaint wish app had more international design furniture to match the themes and settings. Also need to fix the bug so that the design loading screen appears.  This is the only app that I have to reset my tablet to get my results, since the last update I have had this issue. I have made an inquiry adressing this issue and it still has not been fixed. I have changed my rating because of this issue, once it has been addressed and fixed I may change my opinion."

        "Ive been playing for the better part of a year, and this game started out great for a long while. But IGG not only panders and gives better deals to Chinese people, cheaper packs etc. But literally 99% of all mega guilds and players are Chinese or Vietnamese. If your not asain don't play this game  you'll end up like me playing forever just to quit because of the obvious discrimination IGG holds with its playerbase",
        "Not a good game for new players.  Was fun and  interesting at first but you qucikly realise that you are just food for high level players with no way to reach a defensible level.  High level players basically teleport in, raid everyone and teleport out.  They should lock servers to keep it balanced and give more guidance for new players. This game is  clearly weighted towards the people who have been playing it the longest. Dont waste your time",
        "Kingdom 249 is open before just 50 days back. And one guild have 2B might. Most of the guys have millions of might one of them got 700M might. How's this is possible. Kingdom 277 is opened before 15 days back but one guild K03 got more powerful. Top guys got 120M might in just 15 days. Does IGG employees playing this game. We are lover of this game please don't lose your credibility. This two kingdom which I observed only Chinese players are strong. How overall kingdom only Chinese players got higher might in less time.",
        "Do NOT go for high level military research without searching monster hunting, and Do NOT go for T4 if you not going to spent thousands of dollars. Even if you don't mind to wait 200 days, you will not able to afford it (lvl 10 military Def, Atk, Health cost 100m gold each). DO NOT GO FOR HIGH MILITARY AND T4 WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE GAME.",
        "This game is fun but be prepared for the mother of all Pay2win games.  These folks at IGG are experts at crafting new and exciting ways at fleecing their customers of every cent they can.  You CANNOT compete if u dont pay and pay often.  Players here ...just regular people... dump hundreds of rl $$$ regularly.  You have been warned.",
        "Troops die just because you are not sheltered or shield...Strengthen all troops and walls even defenses and masters... Also lessen the price of buying shields it cost a lot of gems and longer is effectivity like if it is 1day update it to 1day and 12 hrs and cost it 1.6kgems is good mostly for us busy people"

        "Think about playing all day Ridiculously good graphics for a mobile game, excellent soundtrack that matches the intensity of each level, and never gets boring. The free version makes you restart from the beginning instead of checkpoints, but I don't even mind because it's still challenging and fun with each replay. I do wish I could play in a different mode for free though. This would be an awesome Zen game.",
        "The gameplay is unique and challenging and fun but this game feels like a demo as all the other game modes (PvP , co-op etc) are locked for free users. And you can't even use checkpoints without paying them( like SERIOUSLY?!) So once the game is over you have to start all over again if you are a free user. Apart from that this game definitely deserves a try from people looking for casual , relaxing yet challenging gameplay.",
        "Great game This is a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing aesthetics and highly addictive. Totally worth the $2 for the premium version. I do have one problem though: even though I am pretty decent at the game, Google Play won't give me any achievements even though I'm sure I have earned some. It won't even let me open achievements or leaderboard pages. Is anybody else having this issue?",
        "So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn't save where I'm at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won't be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!",
        "I love this game.  It's very simple, just go without getting hit by glass or running out of balls, but it is a lot harder than it sounds.  I am forever telling myself I have time for just one more attempt, it is very addicting.  The 3d design on this is amazing and creative.  Up at the top it says to write a SHORT review, so this will end here.",
        "I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I've decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I've upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!"

        "Great game, no build waiting times, lots of strategy, a mix of tower defense and rts. Really is a game with a lot of effort put into it from non greedy devs. Well created hiker games. One small point that a future update could sort out is making a feature to create the same bandits again. Rather than manually going in and picking them again. And if you have spares, to automatically put them in place. Also duplicates seem to have no purpose as of yet....",
        "At first I got a clash of clan type vibe due to some mechanic like throphies and graphics. But the game is widely different and in a fresh new way. It's basically tower defense where you play both the defender and attacker roles which is done very well.",
        "Love mini games, also building tokens to obtain chests... please keep updates coming! And would love to zoom in more but I dig the overall quality of the game... when can I use my convoy to attack towns and castles?!?! Later on in the game?? Thanks!! And I would buy more gems if the price was reduced... fyi",
        "Simple fun time waster. Has enough different about it to set itself apart in the big mobile game industry. Gives a little strategy and also isn't a super money hungry game. I got some advanced units before it even offered to sell it to me for real money.",
        "This game is  great and is very addictive. The gameplay is smooth and battles are amazing. The only problem that I face is that it never matches me with people with same power in ambush mode.Most of the convoys are always powerful than me. Please do something on this issue",
        "The game is amazing ! No doubt , A note to the developers : You guys might not want to update the server so often , it's irritating! I click on a single troop, and server is being updated!? Sometimes it doesn't even happen successfully. So the screen keeps bugging me ! Except that , I can't point to any cons in the game, Fix that and I will give you guys 5 stars."

Please KING fix this problem!  UPDATE as of 21st February: the message \"go online for more episodes\" is still showing everytime I try and play. So still not fixed in the new update! PLEASE FIX!!",
        "U want 5***'s, well hard is ridiculously too hard, it has impossible levels that  you only win,  when king wants you to, this is so utterly ridiculous! Really makes me want to uninstall the game. I will give it another try, I'm waiting for the game to divvy out more tries.. I mean 35 tries is stingy for a hard level, how about 45 tries instead?",
        "I'm a addict when it comes to all the candy crushes I'm currently on level 1060 (a really hard level) and I'm  upset cause I get almost threw with that level and the app just close very upset fix the glitch please.. Other then that like I love candy crush but it still get 4 stars!",

I know I logged in yesterday and didn't miss a day. I also was moved down a bubble level. Updates should not make you lose everything you've earned.",
        "Love this game until my last update, now I have to see after (EVERY) game -Do I want to continue  which involves a purchase or loose what ever progress. I hate to Uninstall being I'm at level 727 & Hitting the (X) does nothing but frustrates me & I'm just about to delete. 😠 Please change some how some way.",
        "One of my favorite games, but after the most recent update, just like most of the reviews in the last several days, I'm stuck at 705. I should be at 1153. Tells me to go online and download new episodes when I'm constantly online. Need to patch it or rework the coding.   Edit: finally fixed, everything is running smoothly. Thanks!"

        "I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there's only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can't beat them! Keep making more awesome games!",
        "I understand that people want their games to be entartaining. But i dont understand why there is a thing that downgrades your item upon trying to upgrade it. I have soent the last 3 hours trying to upgrade my helm to lvl 15. Guess where it is now, On goddamn lvl 11. I have spent less time grinding mounts in wow than getting my gear to lvl 15. Stupidest thing ever. One tip. Play the campagin lvls to lvl 40. Then dont do campagin at all and run hell for gold and xp. Repeqt to lvl 80 and then get rekt by the stupid item upgrade system.",
        "This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn't always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing",
        "I really like the game. But there's one thing that annoys me: when I don't play this game for a few hours and then I do another battle in dungeon, the game crashes after killing last monster in that battle.  I found out that if I switch on mobile data it works. So I wanted to asked why is that. EDIT: now all works just fine. 5 stars",
        "The best game on market right now. No ads, unless you request it for coins,(which I doubt you'll need to), many modes, including HELL(Infinite waves), MAP(To gain access to abilities and magic) and BATTLE(Normal wave advancement with bosses every 5 levels.). By far the best game that advertises it is not pay to play. Because it's not, despite the option to buy coins.",
        "I'm really loving this game it's simple but still a ton of fun. My one complaint would be the sometimes the grind is too long and I almost gave up... I wish the developers would throw in some kind of experience boost in the store instead of just being able to buy coins. I would pay real money for an exp boost and would love to support the Developers! just give me the chance!"

I kinda felt like it was a lot shorter then the other games. But other then that I had fun playing it and I'm super excited for other to come out so hurryyy!!!!!!! Lol",

On a side note, the story is different but the game play is the same, go have a look if you want. I will say this is a good game and I take nothing away from the hard work you have done. Good looking graphics, good smooth game play. A game you can get into and do try the other games of this developers you may like it as well. Over all a good game I just do not think it is worth $15. But best of luck guys.",

However I had to order a new phone due to mine being replaced for insurance purposes and I was logged into my Facebook and lost all my progress and the app is NOW wanting me to repay. I don't wanna have to pay another 9.99. If there's anyway I can get my game back.",
        "I've bought nearly most of these games and this one has disappointed me most. When I finish a level it won't actually finish so I have to keep restarting it. Also some of the bonus levels are hard to understand what I'm supposed to do. I don't know if it's a bug but it's kinda annoying. Apart from the bug, just like the Delicious games etc it's great. Just need to fix the bugs :)",

        "For a shoot 'em up racing android game it's really addictive. I'm always playing it. It's fun. My only complaint is the time it takes for the fuel to charge, 30 mins? Come on! Otherwise very challenging. Challenge accepted!",
        "I would give more stars, because it's very addictive and fun to pass the time. But it just contains WAY TOO MANY ADS. Like holy crap I  get 3 different ads back to back after every single run. Kills my battery quickly and I spend more time watching the ads than I do actually playing the game.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "I really enjoyed this game until it started crashing mid game. Happened to me just recently and I wasted all my available fuel trying to frantically restart the game.  I was just completing the assigned jobs when the game suddenly stalled and I had to restart it again just to find it stalling again, all the while consuming the fuel with each restart. Hope to see this problem rectified soon, otherwise it's an enjoyable game nonetheless.",
        "Epic old school arcade game play meets mobile app heven  This is a great game for any one that can look past In app purchases. Its loaded fool of great charectors and cars that have a usable MP3 player with some tracks . With great leveling up abilities from weapons more powerful weapons. To Nitro 2x points Health and more cars. 5 gas tanks and your either waiting or buying diamonds. What ever it is this game has even more levels . jobs for other charectors. All I now is some of the best old school arcade stand ups with that mobile app. Non stop Rockets and machine Gun blasting with some jams playing in the stereo and little cute pug dogs giving you Xp. Great FUN .....!!!!!!!"

        "This is an awesome game that gives you daily and weekly quest's and offers treasure chests. Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven't tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.",
        "Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a \"slide,\" I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don't compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.",
        "Nice, good, adventure game.but some times your team irritating who one completed thirteen level they will easily get diamond  your giving master challenge ( now the challenge Chinese New year )who one complete your giving thirty diamond only.this offer will useful only for entry level gamers. Most of players finished fourteen level so they no need diamonds.so think about genius players.",
        "I love all the graphics it's a bit like the        piano tiles it test's your fast skills but except it is temple run 2 love it. Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.",
        "It's my favorite app. I love it a lot. My only issue is that it doesn't quite accurately update my stats especially my highest score without using a 'save me,' longest run, most coins & gems. I would really like the developers to look into that but otherwise it's a brilliant game.",
        "I love this game, very addicting. And I love that it has the daily, weekly and global challenges. As well as objectives and the daily chest challenges. Lots of things to work for and win. Makes the game more fun. Plus, so far, I haven't come across anything that I've had to spend money on in order to advance in the game"

        "So far, I dig this game. Although, the individuality of it is scarce. I still play it and enjoy it. It's not identical to other games of this type, as the challenges are similar yet different. The scenario of the game is basic with the others. I have a variety when it comes to games, this one has similar sound affects to other games that I, personally, downloaded. (But they're also from the same makers.) This game is over all.... Good so far.. I would recommend, linked my account to this game and invited friends and family. (I only do so, if the game/app is worthy. I'm a picky bull!!!!) Overall, you'll have fun! Cute toys and  unique power ups, with a slightly (10%) twist.",
        "Definitely addicting. The levels are challenging, the tools are fun to figure out and the reward set up is not unattainable. The only other thing is they grew more wise  for the latest update, you can't change the time on your phone to add lives anymore! Probably better that way, one (read: I) should pace themselves when playing....",
        "This is by far the most fun I've  had with a game app! Its so cute and  colorful!  And each increase in difficulty  makes you want to keep coming back for the next challenge.  What also makes it awesome  is a no brainer,  its great for children and adults alike.  BIG THUMBS UP!",
        "Really enjoyed the game until I was entered in a two week tournament.  Now, the boards are incredibly difficult and I can no longer earn prizes on a regular basis. Of course, I suppose that's by design so I spend money. Which I won't do. I just want some \"bubblegum\" to past the time.  Now, it's making my blood pressure rise...  Also amazing how many 5 ⭐ ratings they get in one day without the user giving explanations on why. Seems suspicious...",
        "I  love this game but why does it take 30 minutes for a life to refill and also why does everyone who plays the game not receive ten lives only some of your players this needs to be fixed it's not fair I've been playing for years and only receive five lives at a time when others receive ten lives.I play other games and the lives refill every 7 to 15 minutes. Can you please make changes",
        "Nice game challenging to think ahead. But, basically this game is cheating on you. Levels are far too difficult to complete without boosters. So, after failing several times the not so random appearing tiles give you a lot of boosters. That prevents to uninstall (at least until you master the highest level and you enter the Legends Arena) !"

Overall great game when they game out with the sequel it addressed the main problem with this one mainly no other maps and you have to pay to get the female character",
        "This is  a extremely exciting game to play. It reminds me of the game PITFALL from ATARII. All though I like the graphics and the obstacles, I wish you could save your progress.",
        "I think this  game is so interesting  that I play it all day , and somtimes  it tell you that you  should  never ever  steal any thing  from a dangerous  place where nobody  is there, it is really  difficult.  Good luck  and be  safe",
        "It's a great game to spend time playing on but I would like the controls to change, their to annoying when I jump I die and am like WOAH... I JUMPED, THOUGH!!! otherwise. Great game.",
        "The game is cool but there's a few things that have gone wrong because when my 10 and 5 year old grandchildren  play they say when we try to jump it won't let us so it would mean a lot if you changed it a bit",
        "It's a bordom filler but that's about it. Is kind of boring it's self but I like it. It's a pretty cool game. Good job on the graphics tho. The animations are really nice. The gameplay functions are really simple. I give it a good solid meh"

So if you are downloading this to get reward from another app don't bother as you won't get it",
        "I like the game but it is hard for players who can't buy a lot of packs. Some slight tweaks to make it not so slanted towards big spenders.  Maybe make some exchange rate for silver to gold without changing the silver availability or price. Someway that gold can be acquired beside the little in the ground. I understand the game has to make a profit and so you should but more people would continue to play instead of giving up Anyway just a couple of thoughts. Got plenty more on just general gameplay  that I think would be useful. Again, not hating as I like and play the game.",
        "Pure pay tto win. You will either pay or quit out of frustration. Build times are hilarious. Seriously, our Earth's sun will die before you max out your hero's knowledge or most any other knowledge.  The Stronghold is worthless and a huge waste of resources. It's more of a trophy.  Sure you can join a clan, get some bonuses and buy some shields with points, but you will be destroyed by the winners. Me, I had a gift card and blew on this game, now I just start fights and make people quit.",
        "Waste of time. I started playing the game as an offer to get points for another game. Vikings is not a bad game on itself but I feel cheated when I'm promised something and IronSource does not honor their part of the bargain. IronSource said the Plarium did not verify my completion of the offer, so I won't play it anymore nor try other Plarium content nor IronSource advertised games. The actual content is fine, but the business practices are deplorable.",
        "Great time killer, I love the interaction and concept of the game. It can get a bit laggy at times and at it's worst, it will crash on you. The wait times are unbearable though. No ads at all since the first time I played too!",
        "Too late to join this game. As soon as you lose your newbie protection you become a farm for higher level players, preventing you from progressing. Every morning you find all your resources pillaged and your troops dead or incapacitated. Maybe I'm just in the wrong timezone."

        "Ah perfect game. Fast pace not laggy smooth graphics, and playable on any devices. But i hope i can change my region like asian.. Bcoz most of the player i encounter is mexecan or spanish.. 1 more thing i hope you add a larger map i guess for team battle i think 4km x 4km is enough.. And 30mins of total playing time.. All in all fantastic game.. A two thumbs up for you guys. Keep it up",
        "There is nothing as satisfying as sniping a person a kilometre away with a modified SCAR with a 4X scope, except for winning the match. There is a single problem though. SMG bullets do absolutely no damage with no attached scope, up to a certain distance when I put the aim mode on. Could you change that and make the damage at least 5? Other than that this game is absolutely amazing.",
        "The best survivor royale esque game you can find on the play store. Takes up immensely less space than others like Rules of Survival. Anyone can play this, no matter the quality of their phone. It's intense solo, duo, and squad gameplay will always have you coming back to take a shot (no pun intended) at another win. An amazing feature is it's voice chat communication system. You can talk to your teammates (though unfortunately, I find most players speak Spanish. You may have more luck.) though i wish there was a text chat as well. It will hopefully come in the next update, bur I would definitely recommend getting this game. My only other suggestion is new maps, a night mode, more weapons, and attachments.",
        "I could have given five stars. The only problem is the number of players per drop/game. Please change it to 80 to 100 range. Pretty sure youll have a lot of players and ill be glad to recommend it in my facebook page if youll be able to increase the max players. It tends to become boring when you see only 12 players left when the safe zone did not even appear yet. You will look like a rat looking for a cheese around the map. More players means more fun. If you'll take this suggestion seriously, you will thank me later.",
        "It's a pretty solid effort at a battle royale genre it need more customization however maybe another map and just a tad smoother on the game mechanics. Also if it could hit the 100 player per match marker that would be great but I understand that the map must be smaller so it might get a little too crowded.",
        "I love this game so much, but what about more structures? Also I wish there was a chat in game that you can just type instead of voice chat, also the number one thing I wish you guys could add in or fix is the snipers bc they are weak... also I think there should be a counter somewhere when people dismount the plane so we can Dee how much are still in plane and how much already left  That's all"

        "I've liked this game for years. Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you're still coasting or you're in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You've had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven't fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!",

I hope my tears will help u guys. :)",
        "Great game, but I only have one issue which prevents me from giving 5 stars. This issue is that the hot rod doesn't go as fast as it should, I know this because I have grown up around hot rods and Rockabilly since birth. This is only a small problem for me, but it prevents me from enjoying the game as much as I'd like to. Please improve it.",
        "Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it's just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............",

I have have now stoped playing Trivia Crack. You must tighten up your App. Over the last 2 weeks, Trivia Crack has added 4 losses to my running score. I stopped playing for a week, and it still added more losses to my record. Fix it and give me my correct score  I will not play this game again in any form, and watch your endless ad's until my score is corrected.",
        "I generally like it, but it keeps having freezing moments. Right now it's trying to load an ad so I can continue on with playing, but it's been doing that for 5 minutes now. That has been a continued problem to where I lose my progress. I will also add the too many ads problem. Whenever you want to do anything, it's all ads based. I probably spend most of my time on the game watching ads rather than actually playing the game. I just downloaded today and that's already getting old. I like the concept of the game but needs adjustments.",
        "Would probably give more stars if I could play. When I try to sign up via Facebook it says the date and time on my device are incorrect (???) And when I try to sign up with emial it says there's a problem with my internet connection. (Hint: there's not).",

        "A bit misleading. Questions are user-created, so the quality, format, grammar, and range of questions posed is ALL over the place. Often asks the same questions multiple times in a row, all while assaulting the user with ads throughout."

Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "One of the few games that I don't mind spending a bit i.e. $10+ every month. Requires team guild effort to achieve stuffs together definitely gives a good feeling. Event is weekly and community is lively. Card's artwork feels like Rage of Bahamut but using matching puzzle style to deal damage. Skills of card matter as well increasing the complexity and fun. Only thing to improve would be cheaper ingame currency to encourage more people to have better decks thus higher activity rates.",
        "It's a lot other games of this type. I haven't been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you're looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn't find any more connections, that would be great!",
        "Dont expect any support for this game. I've been locked out and i am still waiting on a resolution, like many here. I've paid money and i know i wont be getting any compensation let alone how long its going to take to fix it.",
        "Its a match 3, pay to win game with heroes. Its pay to win lootbox style pay to win mechanics enures that unless you are extremely lucky or9 intend to pay alot, you wouldnt win jack. The match 3 RNG can also make the game infuriating, such as when there is little to no matches or the matches are for colors which yohr team doesnt have. However, unlike other match 3 games, it is fun for longer.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition"

And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.",

Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!",
        "I'm giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won't make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least",
        "This is the best game ever it is also funny because I was giving the girl food and I gave her some strawberries and I put a lot of lemon, hot sauce, Barbiecu sauce,Manas,keckup,salt, and pepper... SO funny, it also sounds just like a kid is playing with the food, that I'm eating grapes right now,😂😂😂😂😁😀😊☺🙂😐"

        "WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you",
        "Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It's pretty decent. I'm enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I've raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn't a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)",
        "First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I'll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC's (and MK's) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.",
        "As expected, it looks and performs amazing. Fighting mechanics and modes are pretty innovative and thrilling. It is quite stupid to compare the console version with mobile one. Each one has its own unique style, so they should NOT look the same, cz' each one provides the fans with a different gaming experience. This surely increases the already huge number of fans of Tekken. 5 🌟 game",
        "Am I ever going to play this game?  All it does is download stuff Update:. Graphics are great, game play is ok, seems like I'm just hitting random parts of my screen.  Healing component is going to make me uninstall.  There's no area to practice to figure out what you're actually doing.",
        "Love that tekken is on the phone I was a master at it when I was younger no one could beat me with my combos and counters. The game play is good but having to heal at every opportunity is not. The fight should be about the fight not having to heal before going into the fight. If I could go into every fight with full health I would probably spend money on upgrades and fighters . It's good but not brilliant as tekken should be. It yous would like to hear what I have to say message me back because I love and loved tekken on the PS and Xbox one of my top 3. Games off all times. Keep up the good work but yous are not just there yet for me to spend money on it but overall it's good but not brilliant as it should be"

But other then them 2 changes I think it's a great game and I've had lots of fun with it.",

If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy? It's the strategy game, not for only the big or strong players. Thanks!!...",

So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.",

It does not take lots of money to complete they game it only takes skill and dedication. I have played this game for years and have had many different accounts on it, but you just have to dedicate your self to one on those accounts to get a good high level account",
        "What happened to the game I used to enjoy? Now everything is turning into a spam fest. Strategy has been consistently removed from the game with each update. BH still has a bunch of AI issues. For the first time ever (as a max 11 and misc other accounts) I can honestly say uninstalling has crossed my mind.",

Because it is not much easy to use. I recommend using the normal GOOGLE PLAY sign in method because it is much more appropriate for me. Overall COC have become my life. I also recoomend to have a time limit for coc, like coc automatically switch off if the user plays coc more than 1 hour. Long Live COC!"

Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don't like my non-responsive faction members and I'm worried once I leave my faction I couldn't join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.",

(For what I think) It's a fun game to play you can get free coins which makes it more fun and fair for players that can't pay for anything, except patience. I do wish it'll be easier to level up characters. But it's pretty easy. Just so difficult to get more characters to pay for level ups.",
        "This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn't make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!",

Money and time wasted. Not pleased",
        "Fun and addictive game. New features are added to keep it from getting boring. They do a good job of listening to players opinions when and if something needs changed. I would give 5* but nothing is perfect. Hands down the best TWD game out there."

        "So nearly perfect. I tried several and they all had too many ads... some (others) with startling loud sounds that you couldn't turn off! Very upsetting! THIS game, however, has only ONE ad at the start of each game, and allows you to mute the sound \"once\" for all future ads. It's simple to click the ad off before the game commences. *wink* The background is lovely and the graphics are wonderful! So relaxing. The happy little \"card dance\" animation after each win is nice, as well. Thank You!",
        "It's a fine enough game, I mean it's solitaire.  However the app refuses to allow Pandora to run in the background unfettered.  I listen to a lot of music, all the time and if this app can't work my life, I can't work with this app.  Also too many adds.  I understand that some one needs to pay for the development and what not... Just make me buy the damn app.",
        "I love this app!  It helps kill time,  keeps your mind occupied and before you know it.  Waiting to see your Doctor seems a few minutes lol. Cons are wish there weren't too many ads. When the ads pop up, it kind of ruins the game. Other than that, great!!!",
        "Had an old version that was pretty fast and got used to it. This in comparison is kinda slow, like real cards! I will get used to it. Otherwise, really like this solitaire game. Picked it over several others.",
        "I agree with other comments the ads are awful I've tried several of these type games and all are to much ads .. But this one i seem to have higher scores than with the other ones.. It's a great pass time and over all a better choice",
        "Way too many ads.....way too many ads.  It drives me crazy!  Also I noticed sound(commercials) coming from the scene as I'm playing and even after I stop playing to hear it, again it came from the scene.  This has happened twice in the last few weeks. I took it to my local Verizon store, but they couldn't figure it out.  HELP!!!!"

        "Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?",
        "I would have given this game a higher review than three that I have given it, the problem is that I have noticed a problem when trying to save some money. For me at least when trying to save money through the daily giveaway/present of playing the game everyday it has stolen money from me discreetly whenever I get around the 1000 coin mark sometimes it is one hundred sometimes I have lost 400 with no explanation as to where the money is. It is for this reason that I have lowered my rating. (Besides the disappearing money I enjoyed the game.)",
        "This game is pretty good, for the most part. The only problem is the bots you go upagainst are  way to hard. I can never win. I would have gave them 5 stars but I gave them 4 stars because of the bots. And the game is kinda hard to control. When I move backwords on a veichel it goes up.",
        "Good for killing time. Some of the computer driven opponents seem to have a very decisive advantage at initial start of certain stages, and some of the smaller vehicles are too sensitive on the controls  but overall decent game.",
        "New update stucks a lot and 1st time my mobile hangs a lot due to this game and btry drains faster than ever. plz crt these mistakes to continue njoying this game",
        "Great game, would just love if replays were available to more phones, mine isn't able to do replays yet. Just wondering if it might be coming soon. I've got a Pixel 2."

        "Honestly, I like this one the most. I like that it keeps the mini games present, but it has a new game style as well. I also love that you can play as the characters, as well as the fact that they now have a backstory! The game itself isnt too difficult, making it a nice game to play at all times. The only thing i dont like is the amount of ads, but it is a new game, and ot needs its funding to stay up and running. Overall, good job Metro! Keep it up! :D",
        "Nice game. I like the concept of rebuilding but this game was meant to kill time, I hope so. Keep adding characters and what we require is a hell lot of mini games so that they may keep coming and coming and coming. I do not intend to harass you but try to add more and more mini games after each update. I'm sure that in the course of  time you may be able to compete with the best games ever created but do not make the game larger than DWTD 2. Add more new locations too otherwise we will not be able to consume the tokens. The game is nice because you do not have to consume money for characters and get them through gifts instead. It is also nice because tokens can be collected easily. Please think about my opinions. I❤ this game.",
        "Brilliant! It is absolutely fantastic! Bit of lag and ads but apart from that it's perfect. Also it's very different from the other dumb ways to day which goes to show how much effort the creator(s) put into making them.They didn't just quickly make a few quick games for the money. No. They put effort. It is amazing. The deaths are funny and the characters are cute and so is the art style. Creator, GREAT JOB!!!",
        "The character models are cute and all, but the games are getting a bit repetitive. WAY too many ads. Like, ridiculously too many. The app forces a couple right after you finish some of the minigames. You have enough to offer us - forcing even more ads on top of that is tiresome. Get rid of them.",
        "Dumb ways to die 3 gets 3 stars. No, seriously, I loved the first 2, but this one is not good. Only 4 minigames, not really different each from another. Remember FASTER FASTER FASTER ? It disappeared (I miss it), and is now ADS ADS ADS. The goal here is just to use money and play as often as you can for ADS ADS ADS. The main thing here ? Minigames ? Nooooo, just getting (or buying) tokens and use them to repair houses (no impact on gameplay). Why would this game be nice ? The graphics are still good. Yes, that's all. Have a nice day. ADS ADS ADS",
        "To be honest, I don't think this game updated at ALL. Dumb ways to die 1 and 2 were GREAT but this one... not so GREAT.  First of all,  there are only for games that you could play.  Second,  it's not as creative as the other ones. And third,  the only good thing about it is that for ME there are no ads.  The list goes on but that's for you to find out and for me to uninstall. 😐😐😐😐😟😟😟😟😢😭   Im VERY disappointed"

        "The game is okay it has a lot of faults. The matching system is horrible it always puts me against people that are hundreds of levels higher than me. And somehow their money regenerate quicker and they're able to send  out more and bigger and better units out on the battlefield. Even when the matchmaking system puts me against somebody my own level their money regenerates quicker than mine and they send out a lot more units faster than I can for whatever reason. Uninstalling this game",
        "I absolutely love this game! As a person who enjoys strategy games, from RTS such as Stronghold, Supreme Commander, and C&C, this game takes my top 3 for the phone. The match making system is very good at keeping same skilled players together, as well as it isn't very much a pay to win game. The units are decently balanced and the game isn't to slow or fast. Definitely a game I will keep playing for a long time. I do want to ask, if you guys will be putting in a \"survival mode\", and withstand against waves of enemies. Great job FourThirtyThree",
        "I'll update whenever I can actually play the game. It's up to date. I get to the screen that asks if I'd like to use my Google account or Facebook account. I do not have a Facebook. Obviously I have a Google account. I'm writing this review. I click Google and both options disappear. It sets at that screen where the two options were previously available and nothing happens. I made sure to wait around 5 mins to see if it was a loading issue.. dunno. I'd love to try out the game.",
        "really good game i love it but just some ideas that might make it even better (I think the menu on the left side could have a higher contrast (text and background)or I think the trophy chest amount could be adjusted to the player amount in the clan +to participate in trophy chest you have to be in the clan since it started (midnight)please do some balance changes soon... some untis don't feel to be used enough or some just are OP like the steel saw mech or another idea :to have some way to delete (locked) chests )please reply if you (4:33)see it and want to give a statement",
        "Its a good game, i like this kind of games and i love when i play with friends too! The game its really easy to play, a strategy game and simply as destroy the enemy base... Love it! Its true that not all are going to like this but for me this game its 5 stars. Btw i have started the game and i said i love to play with friends, does this game has a Couple/Duo match to play with them (Not versus them). Thanks in advice, keep staying great!!",
        "This game is awesome, it reminds me of Guns Up! . The ONLY thing I don't like about it is it's basically pay to win. I only have 5 slots to open chests and it cost gems to open the chest and money to get gems. Other than that, the gameplay is solid. It's very unique in it's actually a wonderfully crafted game and not some thrown together garbage. I probably will end up throwing money at it only because it's made so we'll. But like I said I do feel the process for opening chests is a bit too cash hungry..."

So i was playing the game and i went downstairs. Then there was a button that said: \"Unlock All Rooms For 20 Minutes!\" So i clicked it and my game crashed. The button still shows up when i play the game tho. What do i do?",
        "I love it so does my little sis! But one thing that bugs me that u have to pay for the rooms... If u could like make the rooms free for A Day I be happy but still I like this game c:",
        "My toddler loved it! The only thing that I don't like is when people are tapping their feet I think it's an annoying gesture. Anyways, I love all your other app like pepi house and superstore. I wish you'll have pepi theme park too! :)",
        "PLEASE READ THIS THE CREATOR OF THIS GAMES.IF YOU DON'T READ IT YOU WILL NEVER GET 5 RATE BECAUSE EVERYBODY GIVE THE SAME COMMENT JUST LIKE ME.It contains some problem. It won't give the  ad to unlock all floors. I already answer the question but it won't give the ad. Because of that I'm started to hate this f***ing games. If you repairs it I gonna love this game only if you repairs it. Please repairs it before I sue you. My father was a policeman.",
        "Its Beautiful And A Lovely Game! The Only Problem Is When I Uninstalled It And Restalled Then The 20 Minute Button Disappered Can You Please Fix It Thanks!",
        "I'm 9 years old and I have great imagination and I heart roleplays ,my problem is the rooms need to be paid, I thought it.will be super cool as what the things say,please let us unlock all rooms without paying and also the 20 mins don't work thx"

I love all the different tribes and take no issue with shelling out a few $ to check the all out. Of course playing the free tribes leaves little to be desired if u can't afford the extras. Best game I've come across in a WHILE.",
        "Fantastic mobile game. It's a great pocket sized Civilization-style game. Quick games with the depth and variation to keep you immersed.  Unfortunately, the multiplayer update doesn't seem to be functioning very stably at the moment. My friend (Verizon iPhone) and myself (Sprint Android) have been trying to play some matches, but we keep getting turns where we can't move our units, or gain resource points to spend. As it's an indie-developed game, I understand it's tough to test every permutation of devices and connections. I'm hopeful and looking forward to subsequent updates and bugfixes. Keep up the great work!",
        "I really like it, turn based strategy, probably one of the best games I had on this phone yet. There are a few fun tribes you can buy (or rather should buy) and I think spending a few bucks for a game like this is absolutely fine. Just keep an eye on the time, half an hour flies away if you don't pay attention ^^",
        "This game is amazing! I've never been so hooked on a game before but this is just fun to play. You won't realize how quick time flies when you're playing this. I love it so much I'm taking my sweet time collecting all the tribes. And the graphics is just fitting for the gameplay, everything about the game is just peachy. Totally recommended.",
        "balanced and very deep. You have fulfilled everything I ask for in the last review whether you read it or not. The 'modes' list is a little sparse, however, and it would be great if you would plan some modes as a side project or something. Not that it is easy making a new mode. Well nonetheless, god job",
        "Love game, but why the auto start, in my opinion, no app should auto start, app should only be turned on when in use, fix this or I uninstall. GEEZ, all you developers think your app is only one used, get a clue! Then why do I keep getting a \"Poytopia has stopped\" message every time I start a session on my tablet, even though I did not play Polytopia during last session."

        "I really like this game, kind of wish the progression system was a bit quicker though, other than that, the tight controls, open world and variety of creatures you can eat make it a solid game. The special sharks look really cool, and I even considered buying one until I saw the 50$ price tag.   On a side note, what's the difference between this app and the Hungry Shark World?",
        "Winnings suck. Instructions are very vague. Way too many ads. Feel like in order to play you have to pay in order accomplish levels and continue story campaign. Sorry guys but I bet my criticism has been said over and over again. Result is boredom. Too many other games to waste my time playing. Need to fix these if you wish to keep this game on the market people!!!!",
        "It's a really fun game, but sometimes you'll play a video to revive your shark and the video will play but you don't get another life afterwards. It's hard to believe that it is a WiFi problem because if it was an ad wouldn't be able to load at all. Also, I have paused the game before and come back minutes later and the game had kicked me out and not saved any coins/gems gained from that round. They clearly have a few bugs to work out.",
        "i would rate 5 stars... but.. something with the cloud save broke, i used to have the megalodon, without any cheats.. but now i have the mako. could you fix this somehow? And do i email the support team? Im not good with all the emailing stuff.",
        "OMG! I love the gameplay in this arcade game I love everything about it. It is very cool that you can evolve sharks that can eat more stuff. Keep the updates coming it would be better if you added more sharks in this game . I recommend downloading this game if you want something to do in a long amount of time. This is so addictive I can't stop playing it!",
        "I thought it was SUPER DUPER AMAZING. Keep that game like this and don't change it. But whenever I would eat like a lot, then I don't get bigger and it said the more you eat the more bigger you get. So I think you should make that better. If u wouldn't have done that then I would be impressed by the game."

It says it failed because I would not allow them access to my friends list. Something doesn't seem right about that. Never had a game NOT allow me to login, after denying access to my friends list. Sorry, would prefer you not send messages to all my friends with my name tagged on it.",
        "I think this game is a really fun addicting game. The main reason why I got it was because of 8 ball pool. That game is also very fun. The only thing I don't like about football strike is that when I get on sometimes it won't let me click the spinner. So it's like my phone froze. But my phone didn't freeze. It's just the app. So can you guys please fix this.",
        "At first I was skeptical about this game. I had downloaded it and went without playing for a couple of weeks. Then,one day I just happen to open the app and play. Best move I ever made for an app! This game is just flat out addicting, fun and challenging.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much fun it is and that there is, most of the time, something new.  Chalkenign friends and new people always makes for a challenging and fun time waster. Even if I don't have the time to play, I still make time!! Haha",

I didn't get my prize and I'm really very upset. I have a screenshot of winning cup also.. I hope miniclip will help me. I'm expecting my prize from you. I really love this game.",

        "Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!",
        "In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it's newer it's boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star",
        "Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can't just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can't advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it's basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.",
        "This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said \"add break\". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them.",
        "The game desparately needs to offer more coins as skill level increases.  The frequency of coins remains the same while the skill level demands more and more coins (in the thousands).  Watching ads helps, but the player finds themselves doing that exclusively, which defeats the purpose of the game.  Physics, graphics and gameplay are good.",
        "One Of My Favorite Games  So. Let me start of by saying I LOVE it! So I like very few games, in fact nearly no games. But this  game is epic! It's interactive, fun, motivate and time killing. But there is one problem and that's there are to many adds and most of them are inappropriate"

        "This game is the WORST!!! The controls don't work and there is not even demonstration on how to play. Also every time I retried to do it a stupid add came up. I AM FURIUS!!!! Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don't get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don't mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!",
        "Ugh look people if u start playing this game oh wait if u had any sense u wouldn't. these adds are outrageous every time I die there an add I'm not even kidding. My dad rates tones of games and I'm the one playing some of them and I told my dad that these adds are so horrible I even had to report it. Now here me out great game but the adds. And in the beginning there is no instructions on how to do the game so like I said in the beginning there is a add at the end of every round so in the beginning there are many adds. Now i think there are more adds then game in this game. I'm not trying to be mean so don't go crying😢 to ur boss.",
        "I think there is to many ads like u have to watch a ad after u die. And then if u wanna continue u have to watch ANOTHER ad. Its just so annoying. But other wise I love this game. It keeps me entertained while I am bored or when I am on the bus on my way to school. But there are way to many ads and I hope u guys please fix that. 💜",
        "tbh it's a really good app! The only problem is that it gets a little boaring after a while (obviously that's my opinion) And I don't know if it's just me but there or tons of over 30 second ads.",
        "I like this game  very much cause you dont know what comes in front of you which makes this game more interesting. But 1 problem is there that the second i crash to any obstacle an add popups",
        "I really do like this game. It's a good way to learn to think quickly with what side you should move to. Although, it would be even better if you didn't have so many adds, but every rose must have it's thorns and I'd say the adds are this roses thorns."

        "A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it's a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you've done them and reached level 10 on both, there's really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.",
        "Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!",
        "The game itself is awesome, really awesome. But my god, there is too many ads, It is okay to have ads in a free game, I totally understand, the dev has worked to build a game so it is fair to receive money back for the work.  But here there are too many ads, there is ad in game, there is ad when you lose a match and there are the famous win coins for watching a video.  Couldn't find an option to buy the game and remove the ads, hope the developer improve this, because the is really awesome...",
        "Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I've basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I've got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.",
        "Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot's more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn't bother me that much. 5 stars for the team",
        "It's a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the 'colony' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you"

        "I love this game, i've been landed surface in every celestial object few times, included Sun. I also recommendation to other friends in forum to play it.  But, I want suggest to add some simulation like : - Rotation planet. - Perihelion/Aphelion. - Perigee/Apogee.  And also some feature : - List for delete few space trash like empty booster in orbit. - Name rocket every launch (it make fun & realistic).  Thank You",
        "I am so addicted to this game. I love everything about it. I just wish there was a place to donate to you (developer). Also, I would love it if there were more rocket parts. Also, I wish there was a thermosphere you had to get through to get on planets. All in all, I love it! Can't get enough!  Edit: Thank you so much for the reply. I'm sorry I wasn't clear on the thermosphere part, but i think the reentry effect would be lovely. I just can't stop playing. And I'm SOOOO excited about rovers and things! Thank you so much again! :)",
        "I absolutely love this game, but I keep having a bug where either the close up or the tragectory map goes completely black so I can't see or control what I'm doing. It started  becoming more frequent after a few days and even after uninstalling and downloading again the problem persists. Please fix this! Everything else is amazing: the gameplay, the allowed creativity and the ease with which one can learn new techniques.",
        "Trajectory in orbit I really love this game you made. It would be cool if you could make the rocket face the direction of it's trajectory during orbit. Edit: Can you add re-entry effects when going to other planets? It would be more realistic. Also add heat shields for re entry situations. And when is docking gonna come? Hopefully in the next update.",
        "Very addictive game.  Next version here are some thoughts:  show some flames on re-entry.  Docking clamps so you can put fuel into orbit and pickup additional fuel so you can go to Venus and return to earth.  Put the rest of the planet's in there.  Make it so you can take cargo such as rocket parts to moons and other so you can build a rocket there that can go further due to low gravity at launch.  I really liked this game and a lot could be done with it.",
        "Excellent game, very addictive Would be great if larger rockets could be built though. Also maybe someway of allowing multiple components to be linked to command buttons (i.e) 1 button that could be assigned to all stage 1 separators so they all detatch at once, then another button to ignite all stage 2 rockets, and another button which could be linked to multiple parachutes so they all deploy at once rather than ending up in a crazy spin"

        "The game is ok I mean it's really nice like I love it my friend introduced me to it. The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 stars is because there is not much to do although it's a beautiful gsme. It's addictive too. For those who said it's boring they should think again",

        "Irritating. At first it gives you an option of playing a video to receive additional help. Which works only for the first time. Next time onwards no way to cancel the video in case you don't want to install it. It is so frustrating. Either allows to cancel or tell the users what to do next. Worst way of promoting other apps.",

Recently my phone was stole and had to get a new phone.  Familyfarm helped me recover my farm within a couple of days.  Their services were quick and resourceful.",
        "Fun game, but...What happened?  Don't like the snow,  it lightened all the colors of everything, they are not as vivid as they usually are.. With cataracts,  too hard on eyes,  all print got really small and can't read anymore.  Will have to quit til eyes get fixed.",
        "I love the game and have played it for almost 5 years now but for some reason it will not connect to facebook. Not sure what happened in the last update. Hopefully it gets fixed soon. I would hate if my phone got messed up and my progress is not saved",
        "The game used to be good but it has been hanging up repeatedly with the recent updates. Open a treasure chest/daily chest to get a reward will forever be loading and not running. Have to shut down the whole game and redo the quests again. Auto-save for the game had also been unstable, with us having to redo the stuff that we have done previously. It's very frustrating given that we have planted some crops and only to realise that the crops we had planted were not actually planted when we revisit the farm to harvest those crops.",
        "This game was good and fine then it crashed and when I reopened it it had lost all my progress from level 36 to 21. What a waste of time so annoyed. How the hell do i get my game back? It looks like it connected to a Facebook account and loaded an old game but I don't gave the option to disconnect. So frustrated!",
        "This was my favorite game but lately it has so many problems. Things I've completed keep DISSAPPERING and I have to keep redoing them to move on in the game. I've been asking for help for a few months now. Also there are tons and tons of issues with the game crashing. I've done everything to fix this that I was told to do yet nothing is working. As for contacting the link sent to the reply to this I've also done that a few times now with no help. I've been using the in game help tab and keep getting told its been sent to another help team. I've spent Way too much real money on this game and if not fixed soon will want it all back and the deleting the game.   Please fix this so once again I can give it 5 stars. Since the last update the game is now closing in it's own. This is very frustrating. So again as I've asked above please fix this ."

        "I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance",
        "I LOVE THIS GAME This is good game design. It rewards you no matter how high you go with a beautiful little tower. The colors are really satisfying. It keeps me engaged since you can \"regrow\" your blocks. That creates tension too--something to strive for. It's so simple but soothing and really addictive!!",
        "A Great Game For When You're Dumpin'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I'm in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren't too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I'm happy to say that. I don't like to stay too long. Great game!",
        "So,  basically it's a pretty fun app to play when you're bored. It's a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It's a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don't really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!",
        "Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn't have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic.",
        "Good, with a major flaw I've ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I'll tap, and the game won't register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I'm on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I've closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It's an issue I'd like to see fixed."

It looks that they are not having further challanges  but  not agree to accept",
        "It's not fully free. It's designed to make you pay for extra bonuses otherwise it would be very difficult to pass a level. Uninstalling for this reason.",
        "I'm about ready to give up on this.  The 'laser' balls introduced around level 1260 are both unplayable and completely pointless. The game is all about popping bubbles, well... it was until this point.   I was hoping to push through to the final levels but as long as these are in the game I really can't be bothered.   Honestly, when I have to guess the best time to launch balls based on totally random evidence... and lose when those balls are gobbled up for reasons I cannot fathom...  Following on... I've reached level 2082 and cannot possibly see how to  get further than about half way through with the balls provided!  I guess if I stick at it for a month or so I might be able to accumulate enough bonus balls to have a chance!  And there I was thinking that 2076 was tough!     And I **still** hate the laser balls!   Been playing for a year now... on the free version... you guys must have earned a motza from all the adverts that I've displayed!!  Update - I think I've found a bug in level 2215 - whenever I launch a ball it is immediately invisible and doesn't seem to have any effect on the balls it's aimed at. Randomly a ball will cause others to drop... sometimes invisible ones will appear as they drop.  I've rebooted the phone... problem still here.",

        "GAH! They've over complicated this game with unnecessary graphics and gifts and prizes etc. I couldn't even figure out how to get into the levels for a while haha. I'm sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn't want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn't change it. Uninstalled after 1 day.",
        "I really think the tower is rigged. 1 in 4 chance of getting the pig but it seems to happen ALL the time. Cant get past the 6th or 7th floor. However if you spend lots o money to buy gems I guess it can be done. Not for me I am out.",
        "Can no longer watch ads to get an extra rewards chest plus, I logged in for 90 days and did not get my legendary chest. My screen froze up when I hit the claim button and had to restart my game. Now my chest is gone and the next level has appeared without me being able to chose what I wanted from the chest.",
        "Caution! Needed access to my personal files including photos to play the game.  I denied and could not start the game unless it had access. Uninstalling after this review.  Don't let programmers and hackers get a hold of your personal files!",
        "Graphics are good, game play can be lame at times when you get birds that are incapable of completing the level. You can't buy the game and that bothers me. I spent $20, (to support the effort) but am trying to keep it at that.  Others have spent $100 and more. Greed ruins this game. Just finished a level that was designed to be beat only by spending money. Spent hours trying but finally paid and beat it. The game play is not consistent. If you have a bad day it will let you win, if you're winning, suddenly an opponent that should never be able to beat you, kicks your ass when you've played perfectly.",
        "It won't let me watch videos. Every time I click on the TV to watch a video for a free bird or arena ticket, it restart the game instead and I lose a life. I hope this gets fixed because other then that it's an addictive game. When the Glitch is fixed I will give a better rating."

        "Despite the balancing improvements the game particularly in Raids still needs lots of improvements since someone with 400 less power than you with characters in lower tiers can still completely kick your ass. Serious detriment to wanting to continue to play if no matter how you level them up you still lose.",
        "Installed to the latest version but the screen now remains blank after the initial launchscreen.. as a paying customer (I just purchased a monthly gem pass and am only into the 4th day), I expect the developer to resolve this issue ASAP!",
        "Getting tired of saving gems to summon specials and always getting duplicate 3 star heros. starting to lose interest.",
        "Hello? Been playing for a bit spent money o  this game loved it till about 2 seconds d Ago just went to open it and all I'm getting is a black screen after loading complete??",
        "It will not open. I liked this game, but I have uninstalled and reinstalled it twice and I still can't get back in. Five stars if the developer fixes it."

It's enjoyable to see people have the ability to buy what I worked so hard during the last 3 years for a mere $10. I haven't enjoyed this game in months, it's a chore to still play. Download only if you're willing to drop a fortune.",
        "I've been playing for almost 4 years and CC used to be better before you could purchase top level heroes. IGG really sucked what little competitive nature was left in the game out with pay to win. If you want to spend money on a game and still be competitive, play Summoners War instead.",
        "Some people use this for a dating app or say innapropiate things and kids play this game obviously. But that isnt the games fault its the players fault. However i would like it if the creators would sensor all of that",

But it should really save to the cloud because I was on LVL 38 or something, I had everything, then I had to move to a new tablet and all of my game progress *poof* vanished!! Also, everything's a BIT expensive... Other than that, It's a really good game! Well done Outfit7 😄❤",
        "Everything players have asked for is added. At a ridiculous price.  But if people are paying that's on them.   HOWEVER you shouldn't have to buy the adult /baby formula more than once. If you bought it you should be allowed to switch back and forth as you wish.    It's a really zen pass time  game :) also cute and interactive.",
        "This would totally be worth 5 stars if it weren't for the ADS. I get it's a free game, but its one thing to put an ad on the top or side of the screen. It's one thing to optionally watch ads for coins and prizes. But its another thing when full screen videos pop-up, pausing your game and wasting your time. I was honestly thinking about giving this 3 stars just b/c of how annoying that is alone.",

        "The game has gorgeous graphics. Each scene is very detailed and fun to play. Some are a little difficult to get through if you like to keep your brightness low like me and some items are incredibly tiny to find. But it has a fun premise and it's a pretty good time waster. However, you can't play for long. Each play takes 20 energy and it goes by quickly. Waiting for it to refill takes a long time. Getting stars to solve cases also takes some time. It's basically the wait time in this game that kinda kills it.",
        "This is a really enjoyable game, especially for fans of HP and/or the fantasy genre. The graphics are beautiful and the characters look so real. I just wish energy wasn't used up so quickly. At 20 points of energy a pop you can't really play for long, and the XP needed to level up is also high so you usually have to wait for the energy to refill. Also, when you level up you don't get a complete energy refill; you only get about half. Waiting time to complete tasks is also too high IMO. At least a couple of hours if not longer. With any other game this is usually enough to turn me off but the gameplay, the story and the graphics are so good that I'm willing to exercise a lot of patience.",
        "Beautiful hidden object experience. Offers a variety of gameplay including mirrored levels, timed levels, and spot the differences. The Facebook connection is there without being thrown in your face like some other games and is a nice subtle addition. It does work off of energy however I am willing to stick it out just for the storyline.",
        "It's a good game but having to wait so long for the energy build up takes away the excitement of the game play. Iv noticed alot of other game users have the same outlook on this game. Even the timers for tasks take way to long.. 6 hours to complete? Really? Why so long? People will get bored and find another stimulating game. This is based on the whole wizarding world so it should be alot more magical and less time consuming.",
        "Love the game overall but it takes way too long to build up energy. Because of this you are only able to play for very short periods of time before you have to wait for the energy to build back up. Also some of the 'inspection' actions take way too long. Waiting 6+ hours for an action to be completed is excessive. I would love to be able to play the game for more than just a couple of minutes a day. I realize it is done to encourage people to make in app purchases, however, perhaps you could provide a paid version of the app to avoid this. I love the game and would love to be able to play it more.",
        "Love this game, but it has only 14 cases!! WTH?? The last case acted like you were going on to another one, but no. Feel like it shouldn't have been released with only 14 cases. Very similar to Criminal Case in a lot of ways. The upgrades help a lot, but it takes a while before you notice their effect and cost is too high, IMO."

        "Very fun game. Multiplayer is awsome! Please add private matches so i can play with friends.   Physics still need work to hold up to real world standard. Rocks dont follow thru on take outs in real life as they do in this game. Also (rules), a rock needs to make it all the way over the hogline in order to stay in play.  Thank you for making this game!",
        "Best curling game I've seen Enjoy the graphics, controls, love the 1 on 1 against international players and career game options. Seems consistent and easy to learn. Needs a few tweaks like... throws that don't make hog line or touch hogline must be taken out of play. Have seen the bug that others reported, sometimes rock after thrown disappears , some kind of glitch that happens occasionally.  Sometimes the sweepers don't react to my movement to sweep. Would love to see 8 stones instead of 6. If you love curling, this should satisfy",
        "Great game except for hackers. There is a hack that allows some to bump or change finish of a throw. Yoy can go from having 2 scoring to opponent having the score, changing after the rocks stopped. Developers have not replied ti report. Fine for some fun but don't waste your money in upgrades",
        "Physics are not like real curling, rocks are dead in the house when hit, physically impossible doubles and triples, improper use of the free guard zone rules (if a rock is in the house, it is free to be removed...not in this game).  Connecting people across the globe is a cool idea but you frequently lose people and you win without finishing a game.  I've played for 35 years so I speak from experience.",
        "Full of cheaters Started to play and it was awesome. But it seems that some people created cheats and make your pins move from their places without even theirs touching them so that they win points. I will not play it until its updated and try again. Too bad.",
        "Not bad for free. Minimal ads. The two drawbacks are that in career mode, the game is slanted in the opponents favour too much. And in 1 on 1, it takes forever to load an opponent. Fix that and I would give it a five star rating. Also, it would be nice to see the developer actually respond to some people's concerns."

For a simple game like this these facts fore me to give only one star. Fix the code and improve the graphics and it can easily get a 4 to 5 star rating.",
        "Silly pointless battery killing little game, I loved it! The game kinda runs out of puff after level 150 though, as there is nothing else to achieve. I've got all the prestige balls, all the regular balls, all above level 150. Can we have some higher order balls above Thunder please?",
        "Looks BORING at first. But I can't put it down now. And to those complaining about the adds, spam the back button after they start. The only adds this doesn't work for are the ones with the fast forward button in the top left",
        "Would give this a better review, but there are so many glitches. You can only upgrade a booster once, then you have to close the app and open it again so you can keep upgrading. Loved the game before this started happening. And the tap boost should be longer than 60 seconds, how about 30 minutes like the speed boost.",
        "The first thing that happens when you open the game is collect what you've earned while you're away. And whether or not I pick the X2 option I have to wait through a 30 second add. Every. Time. Whoever decided to force adds at every collection is costing the developer a lot of money.",
        "Would have give  a great review, however I bought the no ads extra and to my surprise paying the no ads gave me more ADS. So many ads it's gotten to the point where this is unplayable. Wish I would have saved my cash because now I feel like I have been scammed."

The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can't go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.",

I have no interest in trying to play something that shovels ads in your face more often than you can actually play.",
        "I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i'm asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting",
        "I'd happily purchase this game but that doesn't seem like an option. Tge ads, especially the LOUD BLOW UP EXPLOSIONS game that go on for 30 seconds are especially annoying. I'll gladly buy it, if only to not deal with Fing ads all the Fing time!!",
        "Too many ads. It's annoying especially when you are connected to the internet. The King Boss is not working and is always saying \"Something went wrong, please try again later\" and crashes the whole gane. On the other hand it's a super addictive and fun game to play.",

        "I like this game but after the update the game is now unstable. Whenever I get loot box from battle it doesn't  show on the loot menu. Also after any battle the rewards is shown blank no picture of the item. The previous version runs very smoothly but after the update it becomes sluggish and unstable. Please fix it. I get so many loot during battle but it doesn't show.",
        "I waste 100 gems reviving my Jaeger   for nothing. because after beating the kaiju the unexpected lag appeared.",
        "Thx this gameplay",
        "Enjoying the game. Support is great too. It would be nice if we can challenge anyone online or share items to friends. Also view others profile with ease. It would highly make players interact with other who's online. Chat could also be improve. If you want this game to last take my advice.",
        "this is game is awesome!! also pls make this available for android 5.0.2 also can we control kaijus that would be cool",
        "really cool concept..but more improvement..like graphics adjustments and sync link to Google in case changing devices.."

        "My favorite puzzle/physics app. After I reached my goal of 3 stars on all the levels, I was sad my conquest was over. Then I discovered a whole other area of the app that consists of user created levels to solve. Now I've got new puzzles everyday thanks to the active fans in the brain-it-on community and I submit my own levels on occasion by using the level editor. If you like solving puzzles this is a great way to escape for awhile and exercise your brain at the same time.",
        "I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.",
        "Calling this a physics game is a joke. Sure, it has a physics engine that handles things like acceleration, \"mass\" and magnetism... But it's really just a very limited drawing game. Want to draw a ramp because it would lead to the most elegant solution? Sorry, can't... Because your \"pencil\" is too thick and the ball just hits the base of the ramp and bounces off. Know a simple solution? Well, have fun drawing it fifteen times while you get the exact dimensions needed in a very inexact system. I really think there are far better games to practice problem solving that don't get in your way as much as this one.",
        "It's an alrite game. Some people like this kind of puzzle, but I am not too fond of it. Being a freeware it has ads that can pop up before and after each puzzle... so prepared to be annoyed. Game has many solutions and offers hints(not before... you guessed it, watching an ad first) so you can atleast get through some of the harder levels. I'd say give this game a try until you get frustrated by the app, not because of hard puzzles but because of ads.",
        "this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates",
        "LOVE this game!! Literally, I don't think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it's just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜"

Some item descriptions aren't in English, and the text after you gain things in combat for gold and souls goes too fast. Still don't know what it's saying.   Would recommend though just for a quick thing to do when you're bored and have time to kill.",

        "A surprising find, i really don't expected this game to have this level of quality. This game successfully give me the feeling of discovery and exploration while in expeditions, and i feel compelled to build and better the manor. But a disappointment is how there are no differences between characters other than their classes and aesthetics.",
        "This game is great takes a little wile to figure out but it is no way a pay to play you have the option to buy gems that help u acheive things faster. Its not much of a grind either to acheive things that are less common with that said the classes are somewhat confusing finding the correct skill set and play style can be hard",
        "What a surprising good game, somehow it manages to keep me up logging at it daily to train my heroes and do some quest, a thing that would be really amazing would be cloud support, so you can play the same savefile on two devices, didnt found any game breaking bugs and so far the game didnt pushed the shop into me which was nice. All in all a 4.5 out of 5. Can t wait to see this game evolve and age.",

        "An honestly good game with neat intentions, but I do have a complaint that is probably common for other. It's that the game just freezes abruptly and you can't do anything unless you restart it. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly, but other than that it's a good game",
        "Best drag racing game I've played in a while, doesn't force you to spend money but the option is there.  Not in a rush for class E to be released since class D isn't finished yet, in expert races I only see a pink wire frame of the interior and no rev indicator, negatively impacting gameplay since most quests call for these races.  Otherwise great game.",
        "Like the game so far. How do you change the camera view to inside the cockpit. There doesn't seem to be an option anywhere to change camera as advertised. Maybe I'm missing something. Other then that it's very fun game. Thank you",
        "You guys still havent fixed the problem with the boosters for samsung. There is still a x-2 on two of the purple boosters which causes it to not appear when i go to choose it in the race.please fix the problem",
        "It's a fun game but it won't let me buy tires even though I got more than enough money, i have 60000 dollars and cant even purchase a 7000 dollar pair of tires",
        "Really enjoy the game it was easy to get a hang of the controls but there was a minute there i couldnt win however theres always a way to get it done. I like the cars I guess i do sorta wish you could use the expert view at all times but i do like to look at the cars. The loot drops are also better than many similar games. All in all very entertaining"

This game is literally the best ever. 01.03.18 Although in the new update I went to type something on leagues and the game just crashed, it also made my phone spam so I had to shut it down and reload my phone up, please investigate this.",
        "Vs mod is so bad after update. I have ovr 99. After update i lost many games from some guys who have ovr 94-95 because u didn't give me as many great chances as u predict. Once i played against 98 ovr player. He had 2 great and 6 good chances, i had 6 good chances and 0 great. It isnt ok.",
        "Had been playing this game for past 5 years. Its probably the best game in playstore. I had gone through lots of new events, campaign. The new updates are getting even better and better.    The only problem is league tournament needs to be worked on. The tournment matches between two league must be a equalised in terms of their player and team rating. Sometimes leagues tournament are so hard..",
        "Hey fifa, it been like this even before the Toty event Almost 2 months, no adds, no stamina for me, this really unfair, all of my friends are getting adds stamina, TOTY, Carniball, and now Lunar year Those eventy went extremely terrible and useless to me with no stamina!!  Please help me and fix this, my app is up to date, and i even re unstall it a few times desperately trying ro get adds back! But it was no good 😔😔",
        "You're fucking shit EA. Your A.I. is overpowered like shit. Our \"chances\" in vs attack are full of bullshit. Money never lasts long when you're playing this shit. Your rewards are pretty crappy too. The \"chances\" when we're opening packs are not chances, it's \"open as many as you want until you have no money left and still haven't gotten anything\". If you're reading this (which you probably won't give a fuck about because you get this everyday), you better make some changes. If you're just hell-bent on making money, then you should go fuck yourself.",
        "The game is terrible the teams are too hard and 2 defenders decked my zardes and then he got red carded hooray!!!!!!!!. Please improve it because it sucks!!!! And why are players so expensive and also if you are going to put someone on sale then why are they reseted to the their to their rating at the start please improve it and at least tell us what you have improved because I know the reason why you don't tell us because you haven't improve anything!!!!!!! You just add more glitches in the updates and make our players worse and also it is so hard to make a team that is rated at least a bit different. I hope to see your next bad update. Keep making your game worse and you will lose the population of people playing. GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR NEXT UPDATE!!!!!"

Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you're given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.",

It's a game I selected to relax my mind but it quite becoming the opposite. I cannot give a 5*",

I went over other reviews and the developers wanted to know which ads. Seriously?! How about all of them?! They have to be aware yet refuse to fix the problem. Do not download this intrusive app. Also I get a migraine with the annoying \"Ready? Let's go!\" voice when the sound is on."

        "What really drew me into this game was the the Pac-Man promotion, I love a good crossover and I can say with total certainty that I wouldn't be playing it if I couldn't play as Pac-Man, he's such a good inclusion. It's a super addictive game, setting it aside to do something else is quite difficult, hours go be seamlessly when playing it. The graphics as well are beautiful, very vibrant and colourful.   I have a few minor gripes with the game though, it crashed on me and when I restarted the game I had briefly lost all my content, that gave me a minor scare. The game is heavily geared towards microtransactions as well, unless you're prepared to pay money, get ready for a very, very long grind trying to get the stuff you want. Having said all that I absolutely love the game, very glad I downloaded it.",
        "Game looks good and it's well design, but far too many gimmicks and interruption. Hardly ever can actually run. Plus some silly hanging in the air for no reason. Got bored in 5 m",
        "This game is one of the best out there. Now I know it might seem like a remake of Subway Surfers or any other endless runner game out there, but I must say, Sonic Dash is much more than that. You can do way more in this game than you could in Subway Surfers. I would recommend this game of you haven't tried it. It's occupies time and above all else, this is a great game!",
        "This is a pretty cool sonic game for moblie for 1 it's cool for 2 you can unlock other sonic Characters and for 3 other characters from other games will come too like Mrs. Pac man!",

I would like to invest money in this but worried about tht CON. Other than that this is a very addictive throwback to a certain degree XD end up spending more time thn I realized on this game feels like I'm on an old game boy pokemon game congratulations and many thanks for the creation of this amazing game. But admin plz fix and respond. Thankyou",
        "I paid out $160.00 for a package in the game. Got a Google game play receipt and can see the charge on my card. However I got nothing in the game and customer service hasn't replied to me about fixing the issue. Multiple attempts to get a hold of customer support have resulted in no responses from them.",
        "Just a knock off of Pokemon idle like really guys come on i would have played but pokemon idle is the real game here this is actually subjected to criminal defense.  You just stole another game called it something different. It better be taken off or legal action will be taken into account here noone bother with it.  Pokemon idle if you pay you get what you see that you played.  This one they steal your money as everyone is finding out the ways",
        "This game is so laughably awful it somehow is decent I will not say good but there was some charm for a moment before I found myself confused. There's little to no sound meaning the weird instance of sound is invasive. I don't understand what's going on at all and I don't feel in control of my actions in the game",
        "I gotta question. Is this like some sorta card game thing? Cuz i coulda sworn the ad made it look like the adventure 1v1 battles like in the gameboy, which was why i was interested it in the first place. But the game is completely different upon download and a dissapointment overall",
        "The great balls doesnt work and this game doesnt allow you to buy regular poke balls. It should be easier to catch pokemon. Even when there hp is really low the poke balls still dont work."

        "lnstaII 'VEARN' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won't make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It's also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII 'TOYOCASH' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.",
        "I love the game play and graphics. But I payed for adidas female clothing and an aquarium previously on the game, and then when I restarted, they have gone. I spend £3 on it in total and I actually spent more money on other things that didn't come back in the next game, but it's understandable because they were lifestyle points and you know it's currency not clothing or furniture. I uninstall sims sometimes a bit of always go back and before my items were there, but now they're not and that really frustrated me. I actually ended up in 2017 spending  £10 on sims freeplay and that's the only money I think I will ever spend on ot now because if you restart,  you don't get anything you wanted. Please fix this because I spent that money and I could've bought something else with it but I didn't because I like sims.",
        "Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools \"playable\",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it'd be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.",
        "First, I don't like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don't like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you're just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!",
        "For the fact that we can't sell multiple items at once is a big downer. I have accumulated so many windows, computers, chairs etc with watching the daily news ads and it's a complete pain to delete 30, 50, 70 or even more! items one by one. Please consider adding this function in the app as it's in the real The Sims games.",
        "This is a really nice game and I would have given it 5 stars but because I didn't use Lara Craft to help with the wedding (my sims worked day and night to make those items) but I still did not make it. It's hard to get social points and since I do not have a credit account I could not buy social points. I'm really disappointed because I wanted the wedding to happen 😢"

        "Cross platform across Apple and Android and PC makes this game a fluid joy to play, without the feeling of a toned down mobile port - due to its 1:1 experience from the PC. It's the only Blizzard game u can play on Mobile. I'm a legend (highest skill tier) ranked and totally F2P so the people who say this game is pay to win or random luck do not understand the game. Paying for is meant for helping you finish your collection fast. Overall highly recommended.",
        "Lots of fun over and over again. It doesn't get boring because of all the expansion updates that keep coming up. You need to readjust your decks to adapt with the new cards that get released. Didn't give it a full 5 because of the lag and graphic issues that keep coming up for me and others of the forums.               Playing on a Note 5",
        "I'm trying to link my account to my other one by using my blizzard account that I already have. But it just makes me do the tutorial and after I completed it, it just keeps on doing the starter stuff. Even though I already have a blizzard account with my hearthstone rank 20, but it just restarts me back to ,25. I'm not sure its a glitche or I'm doing something wrong but It just wont let me log in my account.",
        "I used to play the old tcg and this not  close to be a good card game. All it is is monster with power, moslty no spell, no artifact, no nothing. This game is boring and is lagging so much on the cellphone. Shadowverse is ways better for a similar formula, has a really good storyline and a waaaaay more generous. When you buy card for HS you get mostly nothing. They had the chance to do something good, everyone love the lore of warcraft, but they BS it.",
        "What the hell? I played this game about 2-3 years ago and i really liked it (on that time). But now when i came back I just can't win anyone. I tried to win on rank 25 about 10 times. There always players with full deck of legendary/epic cards, 25 RANK, DAMN!",
        "This game is about alright. Its very fun. Period.  But 2 major issues it's gonna face problems with is we can not add friends. Says friend request sent but no request found! Plus this game is very very Pay 2 Win! In the start its fun but than deck goes so unbalanced since money hungry creaters wouldn't allow good rewards for free! So kbviously knly the rich win? Ahh this sucks"

        "Amazing game... Loved it...😍 The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it'll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it's okay 😊",
        "Seems like controls tend to be problematic, and synchronisation has to be adjusted for every song. However the game is wonderful, precise, compelling and worth spending time on! Everything is well thought, new levels and lines are frequently added. So far my favourite app ever, looking forward to playing some new levels and the match option.",
        "I originally had it as 5 stars, but I noticed the longer that I've had the game, the more bugs I'm starting to see. Sometimes the music won't line up with the levels, which is the point of the game, and other times the game won't register my touch and will screw up my progress. If this gets fixed that would be great, and I'd move the rating back to 5 stars!",
        "I really wish you guys didn't update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can't listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!",
        "This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn't as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn't there but now it's forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.",
        "It's an amazing game. Sure I run around my bedroom screening every time I fail next to the end.... but there is something about this game that makes you happy. Is it the music? Maybe. Is it the back ground and the way it moves?possibly. It's all of those things plus more   In a nut shell I really really really really really really really really really love this game :p"

        "I freaking love this game but I do recommend more energy or at least less time to wait for energy. Please and thank you :)  P.S. We need more diamonds some how like. Maybe you should let us watch ads for 2-5 diamond's each ad. Or do a daily login type thing. I know you guys wont but I've been playing this game a ton and for a long time. i restart everything because when you guys make new stories it makes me want to use diamonds but I don't have anymore. I restarted the game like over 10 times honestly. Thanks for a great game though.",
        "I never thought I would find a game like this that would work so well and play so easily! The only things I would change would be adding videos to gain more gems, or getting 2 gems after each chapter. Maybe even some extra gems after finishing a story? Getting gems on previously finished stories as well. I would also add the option to replay a chapter from the menu, not only after playing the chapter. Other than that, THIS GAME IS A MUST PLAY!",
        "I really do love the stories this game offers. I just wish the key and diamond system was better. I feel like I've purposely passed up some great stories just to play through them quickly so I could get back to the current story I'm really hooked on. Not to mention I've put money into the game as well. But being on a budget, I'm limited with what I can do. Sadly I think that is what will eventually make me stop playing such a great game. It's just too expensive in the end.",
        "I love this app! I just wish you could collect more than 2 keys at a time. Sometimes the chapters feel short and to only be able to accumulate 2 keys feels like its not enough. 3 to 5 would be way better! Its already a bummer to not have enough diamonds to unlock cool stuff. (unless you want to pay more.. Not everyone has money to spend on phone app games)",
        "I actually really like this game. It's fun, it's time killing, all that good stuff. But the diamonds are what really kill it.  You get one free diamond at the end of every chapter, which would be nice if it didn't cost 25+ diamonds to make a choice. So to get all the options required to have a truly full game play experiance you must buy the diamonds, which also wouldn't be a problem if they didn't cost so much. (For 5 dollars you get 60 diamonds which is ruffly 2 choices and really they should be lasting longer then that.) There isn't even the option to watch an add for more diamonds. Buying them is the only choice if you want to have those certain experiances. I understand that the company has to make money, I really do, but charging out the ass for something is not the way to do it. In short, I would love this game if it didn't cost an arm and a leg to play.",
        "The gameplay is great but nearly all of the important choices cost. I am not opposed to paying to play a great game but the cost of this one is too high. Every chapter of every story has at least one important choice that will cost. The price for the choice is too high and there is no way to obtain free currency for the game. In order to shape a story the way you want to you have to spend a rediculous amount of real money to obtain game currency. A method of obtaining free currency and cheaper costs for choices needs to be implemented"

Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "Rebuilding that hospital in Africa is a total waste of time and resources. In the 2nd room, on the mission 9 out of 15, you really have a bug! The moment you complete 90% of the task, the pacient vital signs are dropping and there is no way to get them back. I continuously tryed for several days now and you simply cannot pass that task. Seriously?? Next step is to delete the game. Waste of time!",
        "I got a new phone and I did transfer everything and it transfer my game but it started at the beginning again  I put alot of money on this game.I need it back can some please tell me how to get my game back or money I spent over close to 200 dollars on this game is so addictive. I don't get it cause I thought all my games save on Google or facebook all my other games are were there left off so please tell me I didnt waste all that money to start from the begining. I made this comment like 5 days ago I emailed provider of game waited 2 days then called Google only for them to tell me I need to get in touch with the game provider. Then I sent another email with purchases I did and my email and my phone number and nobody still has got back to me or commented on my review. So what do I do now my patience is running out. I even called the number that Google has provided for me for the provider and all I get is a voicemail which I cannot leave a voicemail.",
        "Great time killer but there are problems with the game. Wait tasks to advance suck. Surgeons are doctors. The developers need to know this and apply it. I've 5 surgeons and 2 doctors. This makes for annoying gameplay. Plus without using real money it is damn near impossible to get the staff your hospital needs.",
        "wap to Malay  an exciting game. but so hard to get a lot of staff. one room can only be 1 staff only. I always upgrade rooms but still cannot get a lot of staff. I have also bought recruitment and premium recruitment is still not many staffs i earned. I hope that this problem can be fix as soon as possible because I am very excited to play with this game. Thank you",
        "I love this game but why, on God's green earth, is it such a struggle to get skill training cards? I have spend 120 gold heats and who knows how much in game cash to only get empathy and dedication training card, of which I have 300 of each and only 5 of the skill, like what the heck?"

        "Love that you can now earn gems from reading.  However part of the fun of games like this is the outfits and personalization of your character. Outfits and style choices should be free to choose the best one that advances you in the story. It's not fun playing a game that forces you to fail/have a negative outcome. Big decisions/game altering choices should cost gems that makes it fun spending your savings but ultimately free outfit/style choices please",
        "I really like 90% of this game. However, the way the passes are done really suck. I absolutely love when the 30 days unlimited ad free pass comes up for $9.99. Without it I practically refuse to play. It doesn't seem to be available as of a few days ago. I'm glad I recently purchased. Would also be cool to have a feature where you can send passes to friends.",
        "Love this game! The only part I don't like is that all of the best options cost diamonds and you literally have to pay for them. It makes sense for an app, but it happens to often. It ruins the story because I won't buy any diamonds. I'll rate this 5 stars if they at least change it to not as often.",
        "I like the game but waiting three hours for two passes is terrible.  And we have no other option to get free passes it is either wait or pay. I feel like I'd we got more than two passes I would be okay with the wait. But waiting three hours knowing I am going to use those two tickets in less than a half hour is crazy.  Then I will lose interest in the story and forget what had happen, it isn't okay. But other than the wait for passes I really like this game.",
        "I really like the idea of the whole game.  And the episodes are pretty good in length depending on what story you use. But I think it is completely ridiculous that you have to wait 4 hours for more passes.  Overall,  if you don't mind waiting and are a very patient person then I do recommend this app for you.  However if patience is a virtue you don't have then you should find a different app.",
        "Its very addictive. But they need to give more gems and free passes. I love the Deep attraction and chain reaction trilogies. Some authors first language arent English, but the stories are still well written.  A lot of profanity used in the gang stories, so be aware of that.  But this is my fave app"

The game is incredibly fast paced so you can play up to about 4 games in 10 minutes. It's never boring and always keeps you on your toes. Both sides are fun. (I feel the sniper needs a buff but this is just my opinion). Other than that small compliant  I love this game.",
        "It was very fun testing the early access! And the thing that i noticed was the new token system. Im not saying the token system was bad, but i liked the older system better. On how there were bronze, silver, and gold stars, and the star depended how good the item was. I was wondering why you changed it. благодаря!",
        "This game has been amazing since early-access. I  have loved it for a long time and will still love it for a long time. One suggestion though. It would be cool if one could emote inside the van once you have got away or have been arrested",
        "Excellent game. Highly replayable. Fun and challenging. My only issue is that emotes switch from one side to the other when playing as a thief vs playing as a sniper. Plus, having to hit a button to fire vs just hitting the right side of the screen is a bit more difficult. Otherwise, almost perfect game.",
        "WARNING: YOU WILL BE HOOKED AS SOON AS YOU START THE GAME. The game is really cool, I love the gadgets, the replayability, variety of maps, and how this could be free to play. Even though there are alot of glitches, these improvements will make up for them",
        "It's really fun, has some great mechanics that aren't very common among mobile games, and it is simple to play. But there is one problem I have, which takes place as theif. Sometimes, as I am about to duck down behind cover, there is a short time frame where the sniper is able to hit you even though you are behind the cover. This is for the full covers, not the breakable or the half. They can also sometimes hit you when you are at the full covers, which I hate. The only time I get mad when I die in this game is when the sniper is able to shoot me while I am in full cover or within that short time frame."

        "It's like Episode's ugly cousin. Story line is okay, character look is very limited, in order to play the rest of the game you HAVE to pay a subscription fee like the game is worth it. For one month it's 7.99 and may I remind you that Netflix (10000% better) is the exact same price as that for a standard pack. Episode (story app like this) is much more cost-efficient and over all better because at the very least you can make your character resemble you, don't have to spend so much out of your pocket, and Episode also isn't prone to crashing like this one.",
        "The stories are addicting and exciting. But you make us watch several ads and THEN ask us to pay for EVERY THING extra. From clothes to hair to what to say next to new chapters. I get the world revolves around money but you are getting paid plenty with these big name ads. Let the game be more enjoyable and make it free or a set price from the start for the app. You lure people in and then ask for money if they want to continue. Nah, I'll wait an hour for the ticket. Great game concept though.",
        "I've only read 1 story so far. The story itself wasn't bad. The characters are kind of goofy looking but I like the app. You're able to earn gems as you go. It does give you only 1 ticket at a time, per hr. But it also gives you the option to watch videos to speed up the clock so you can get it sooner. Which NONE of the other apps like this do! However, at the moment, it isn't working for me. No matter how many times I try to speed up the clock, it isn't budging. It was working 2 hrs ago. So, IDK if there is a daily limit or what, because I didn't get a warning. There is something about the videos I don't like though... After you watch them, it automatically brings you to the app store to download whatever game you just watched the video for. Sooooo annoying! Otherwise, not a bad game thus far. It is a great time waster!",
        "So addictive I couldn't stop playing it. Only thing I will say is you need to get to many diamonds for the clothes and some of the decisions you have to make. X Is there any more books after Mona series study abroad ? As it did say to be continued",
        "I pay for the unlimited ticket and never got what I paid for. Customer service has been unhelpful. I have emailed them many times and have gotten nothing but surveys back. My issue has not been taken care of.",
        "I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME!!  This game is amazing and a great time killer! I've used the game in the past when they gave 2 tickets but I've recently downloaded it, they only give 1 ticket for 1 HOUR! The stories it self is good, the characters lacks some things, the stories are too short. The 'free' diamonds doesn't work, when ever I click on it, it goes black and closes the app which is frustrating. The choices in the stories are 10 to 25 GEMS which takes forever for someone like me who doesn't pay for gems. BUT other then that there isn't anything I could think of from the top of my head.  So, please fix these...."

        "Unique offering by Infinite .. I haven't seen a game like this before nor did I expect to .. you form a pot as it spins on a pottery wheel. You can widen it, narrow it, make it taller or shorter. The goal of the game becomes forming pots as per Aunt Chloe's instructions and then painting it as she dictates. You send the pot to her for cash.. and more pots to make. The controls are decent but a bit quirky at times when trying to form the pot.",
        "Fantastic and very creative game... I give it 4 stars... And leave 1 star only because its brushes are not free after african.... it is my humble request to developers that please provide some more brushes for free.... And if possible (free the whole brushes 😋)... Ha ha ha ha... Nice job developers....👍👍👍 Akash Prafulla Barik \"Baadal\" (India)",
        "Loved this game! A relaxing timekiller when you have nothing else to do. Quite addicting as well. Inspires me to do pottery in real life! The only things I don't like is that you have to buy the full version for $5, alhough if it was entirely free I'd probably get bombarded by ads.. A fun game, nonetheless!",
        "I installed it for time pass, but my 21 month old baby without even we teaching her how to play, learned it on her own, and she is an expert. She gets scores as high as 272. I know it is very bad for such small baby to play in mobile, but sh gets very upset.",
        "This game definitely deserves five stars. Here are a few reasons I love it.  1. Graphics- The quality of the app is surreal and offers the viewer a fun experience in the gameplay.  2. Gameplay- The letters/messages you receive to re-create the photo of are very intriguing in my opinion and I wish I could get the full version for more.  3. Thank You- The work that must have been put in to this game is incredible and I hope one day I can get the full version. I enjoy all of your apps and hope to see more.",
        "It's just that you have to make the full version download free. We don't have to make the payment of the Game. When we download the game in the starting of the game we get message but after that we don't. Now l'm bored 'cause the messages for making new pots are not coming...... Pls just make it what l'm saying. But baki all is a good job.............................."

        "I used to love this game, very addictive but recent updates have made the game have too many elements (clubs - who cares???) Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels \"fixed\" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.",
        "This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.",
        "I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn't really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don't know how many more points you need.",
        "This game has many issues! It continually freezes and shuts me down. I can no longer play on my tablet, which I purchased just for games, and have to use my phone. I don't like using my phone because it drains my battery. I am so ready to quit this game and return to candy crush instead. Latest updates have rendered JP and other perks useless.",
        "Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the \"boards\" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it's addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It's becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.",
        "I don't know if a review is still available  after a game has been deleted. The game was fun to play I'll say that. I didn't need 5 push notifications coming @ me in the middle of the night however. The one that came through @ 3:17 a.m. was it for me, I'm out."

Variety of different mechanics and choice of animal helpers keep it interesting, and less frustrating than the Candy Crush games. Then again, maybe it's just because everything is so darn cute! So nice to see the New Zealand birds/animals in there too, go kiwi! :)",

What a joke a bit like the stupid pig you gave us for gold bars which you made out to be free but no... Of course you have to purchase so why put that rubbish in the game! If I wanted to check if I have PPI I'd wait for a cold caller, not an in game advert! You take the living p*ss!",

Who could possibly rate this FANTASTIC  game with 1 STAR?!?!?!??🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌",

        "This is a very entertaining game that is simple to play. It has provided me with hours of fun! The only thing is that I wish there were more combinations, there are things I've tried that you'd think would make something but don't. For example, Crayon (or Pencil, or Charcoal, or Paint) + Paper does not make Art.",
        "This game is pretty addicting. I get stuck sometimes but I always find something new.  Small issue though, I it won't let me pull rust out onto the screen for some reason. I've used it before, but now it won't let me use it anymore. Perhaps it is an issue with my phone rather than a glitch in the app.",
        "This is leagues better than the original alchemy game. There were a lot of bugs but they've all more or less been patched out. It took me 2 months of playing everyday to get all of the items and combinations cleared.",
        "The interface is not so good. Big icons are not convenient, we have to scroll down long everytime, I could only imagine how much effort would it take if I had 500 items discovered. Please make icons small or a different tab just for icons or just make it like little alchemy one.",
        "I love this game so much. I'm stuck on trying to make life but it's not frustrating it's challenging and I like it. Also, for all the people getting pissed off because the items disappear and you cant 'use' them anymore it's because you can't combine them with anything anymore so it is put in your encyclopedia so that doesn't waste space for the things you can use, it's actually a very smart game mechanic. I'm pretty sure it even says that in the tutorial. I also like how they didn't take the same combination formulas from the first game and instead added new ways to achieve the same product in a more realistic way, also there is so many items to create! So I think that this is an all around great game. Good job developers. Good job indeed.",
        "Its a cool game. If you press the hint button it gives you a choice to watch a ad for help. I am not seeing in-app purchases so far and I have had this game for a while! I recommend this but not the other version. It gets a tiny bit boring after a while though. overall, GREAT GAME! Whoever made this game is great! :) :) :)"

        "Its perfectly awsomely COOL Im already level 27 and i have all of the ninjas but can u please add more space for the other ninjas? That cant get in even we need them somtimes we play it and we need a ninja and its not in the box to pick a ninja you will jut restart the game. Anyways but i still love it Ninjago is my  favorite have you guys watch the ninjago movie even there episodes. Thank you for creating this game.👍👍👍👍👍👍",
        "I'm a big fan of lego ninjago♥. Its just hands of time I fight serpentine and when master Wu spoke I saw a timeblade. When I was chilling looking at my mission's then Lloyd hacked into Zane's computer he said something I just have a bad memory.",
        "I think if you could add a few extra spaces for more ninja then everybody would be happy .the reason I'm giving this app a 4 star rating is because you can only have up to five ninja on a mission including your own .if anybody would like that to happen then give this review a thumbs up.",
        "I think the controls are horrible because I Am left handed and you've got to use your right hand to go forward and there is not much of fighting or ningargo feeling",
        "It's awesome! I am a huge fan of ninjago. I love defeating enemies, changing my look, and even having so much fun!",
        "No controller support on Android TV. Very buggy playing on a tablet. Character gets stuck behind/in objects and you have to kill the game..."

        "Perty good Edit: We're in the middle of an event and the game won't load. Finally says down for maintenance. It would be nice to get a heads up on when that happens. Gonna put a hindrance on the event that's over on Friday. Do hope it's resolved soon. Still like the game tho, but would like it better if I can play.",
        "Well guess they deleted my last post cause I complained that the game took up 1.8 gig till I uninstalled it and reinstalled it then lost my saves because of bad programming.   Don't waste your time or money on this company.",
        "Right.  First off, If you are not a fan of Idle games, then don't play. This is the epitome of an Idle game.   The Early game is pretty simple. Click, Collect, Make your way to Level 80. You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn't bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn't been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event's are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events'  All in, pretty good.",
        "Actually love the game but I am furious. I linked the game with my Facebook to get the 3g% follower boost and it ERASED EVERYTHING. I have 45 gold I was ranked 3,000 in the presidents day event had A LOT OF ENDORSEMENTS FOR IT it ERASED my progress I hate that I have to start over again. Seriously need to fix this because this sucks never would've linked the game if I knew this would happen, fix it and I'll give 5 starts",
        "This is probably the first time I'm giving only 1 star to a game, without the reason being that there are so many ads. I hate this game from the bottom of my heart. This game uses the same old overused investing format, that Kongregate has used in their previous games. Unoriginal concept. No point in playing the game. What I hate even more is how the game looks. The visual design is horrible. It makes me sick. Everything just looks so cheap and placed in the wrong spots. The design was very nice in Adventure Communist, which is why I don't understand this excuse of a proper design. C'mon, Kongregate. You're better than this.",
        "Not a bad idle game, but feels very \"pay to get anywhere at all\", let alone \"pay to win. Gold ingame seems a bit overpriced compared to most other game currencies and the offers to earn free gold don't work, either the offer just happens to no longer be there once you've done it, or it is still there and just doesn't register that you've done it, and this is after a few days of waiting, not the hour or two the app promises."

Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.",
        "I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I'm playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can't complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍",

As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.",
        "This game is really good and fun but strate after you lose all 3 of your lives it goes straight onto an add. There are loads of adds and I don't think it needs that much adds for a game like dumb ways to die, on the other hand it's a grate game and it's a laugh and a joke, I think it's a really good game☺",
        "I like it a lot this game is so good but there is one thing that really bugs me.  There is way to many ads.  Every time I play a set of games to get a good score and I click play again or main menu or practice it gives me an ad.  This really bothers me please put less ads or at least do not make them quite as long."

        "Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.",
        "I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.",
        "this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It's a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that's it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame",
        "Great game, addictive, in a good way. This is one of the few games that is addictive, but does not take up a large amount of your day, unlike some game (Clash Royale), I feel it's not Pay to Win. Great job guys, thanks for making an entertaining, relaxing, non time consuming, free to play and win game. Graphics can be bested.",
        "Funny characters, endearing cartoon aesthetic and enjoyable game play, but after a couple hunts forces you to wait over 8 minutes before you can actually play again (in order to entice you to pay to make the wait times go away). What kind of game compels you to QUIT out of BOREDOM after playing it for 5 minutes?",
        "Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn't came in two years it probably isn't. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don't pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges."

You're supposed to get free coins but about half the time you don't actually get it after you click the button. I wasted 90 coins and complete a quest and then I received nothing but it clearly thinks I completed the quest because I need to pay another 90 coins to get a new Quest. This is happen like half the time! Sometimes I get no XP for some reason. I don't know what happened to this game",
        "fix the laaags please. I have high speed internet but still facing lags. I spent a lot in this game and don't want to loose it. Still lagging :(. It works with only high speed internet. Can't play with the data packages only strong wifi.  You didn't fix this in the new edition of the game and the rush mode is not working. The new party is sucks big time. Fix fix fix",
        "I love this game on laptop but when i play it on my android mobile the display area is very small compare to its area on laptop. You must built application in a way it can shows up more area on 5 inch display screen so we can see cells comming to eat us. And it can be done effectively by showing things smaller.",
        "Sometimes when I turn well... I skid like I turn and I keep going the same way just for a short time but sometimes I skid inside of someone... It can be annoying... Please please fix it. Besides that. It's good! Thanks for the game!😁 Please fix!😆 And please add the joystick. It can be hard to control It. And also after a while it freezes  PLEASE FIX!!! It's very annoying I really  like  this game I am NOT GIVING UP! AS I SAID PLEASE FIX... Thanks like the io.   Later I HAD TO START ALL OVER AGAIN WHY WHY WHY!!! CAN YOU TELL ME WHY?!?! I LOVE THIS GAME BUT I HATE IT WHEN THIS HAPPENS NOW PLEASE FIX IT!!!!😡😡😡",
        "What is this???? After every 1 or 2 game when the main menu comes I touch screen just frozes I can't even touch any button. Neither I can play nor I can go to shop it's nothing I can do but just to quit the game. My phone is Samsung S6  Pls do something it's really irritating",
        "This is a nice idea for a game but needs a lot of work. First of i couldn't even understand how the game works. Always saying \"connection is slow\" every damn time. Controls? Terrible. Before i even learn how to move i get eaten. Please look into these and you might have a good game there."

To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed",

        "I hope in the new update you can upgrade the engine and body kits as well. That would bring back the fast and the furious Season 7 track 6 nexts to be check it says three lap but you are basicly doing lap 2 twice and it says wrong way. Third lap starts when u finish three laps and doing 4th lap counts as 3rd lap. Needs to be looked at this is cheating  u guys are doing",
        "I have a one plus 5T with 8 GB ram still the game hangs at the finish line and all my progress is lost. I have to restart the game to get it going. Please fix this I can sent you the screenshot is you want. I love your game and it would be great if these small thing is fixed swiftly !",
        "Fix the detection when you touch/hit in perfect drift mode. There's been hundreds of times where ive definately not hit and yet it ends. So Infuriating, love the game but that one detail could definitely be optimized better. The drift should not end unless you actually hit and it screws up your direction. 4/5",
        "Game is really good. Best drift game I've ever played on the phone. But there are small bugs in the game such as season 7 second perfect drift track (should be Turin) the race is not 3 laps. Even though I finish 3 laps it didn't finish the race and it gives the \"wrong way\" warning Everytime I pass from start/finish line. I hope you can fix this."

        "This game was great until about 5 days ago, that is when it started to take 4 to 5 minutes loading time for each game mode to start. Now my attention span prevents me from waiting that long to play one game. What happened game developers?.... !!UPDATE!! Okay it must have just been the servers. Because they're back up and running at 32 seconds loading time for a war. This game is great. I can dig it can you dig it",
        "They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It's definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you'll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.",
        "Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don't be fooled. This is a pay to win game.",
        "A great game that brings back the old Mech warrior days. One of the few good theme fps shooters on this platform that is \"FREE\". You can pay to win but it will cost you alot. Investing afew tens to smoother the growth? But you can still have plenty of fun without spending a dime.  Until it slowly draws you in deeper.....",
        "I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that's cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!",
        "Game plays fine. No ability to choose mode is a major letdown. I did the $20 test to see if you can actually buy anything valuable. The answer is no. The game is geared towards the have money people. Update 2/23/2018  The queing is under 10 seconds. After Lunar New Year update you can earn upgrades better.  Discounts on purchase items is better."

I really wnt to like this game and see it become better but currently it has many teething issues.",
        "Great game! Love to play it. Had 1 problem so far. Was playing a battle ship. Was rammed by a destroyer... Had all my guns on him. His ship went OVER mine which meant all my guns were now facing the wrong way. He on the other hand torp'd me to death....",
        "The game is a joke, cuz 1. the time is too short, 2. Maps are tiny, we meet enemies face to face 3. Nothing like the pc version 4. Needs all the ships got on pc version 5. ship turning is picullier to physics. 6. Low exp reward. Much lower.",
        "Good game, perfect for long term play both at home and work. Only complaint is torpedoes are over powered and hit box too large. That's why I give it 3 stars",
        "When I first started this game I didn't know what to think. But now! I really love it and it's fun, cool, makes me get a sense for the navy. Which I'm trying to go into.",
        "Destroyers are overpowered!!! I give a destroyer 2 or 3 broadsides with my tier V Kongo and only 4k damage... and then of course I get nailed with 6 to12 torpedoes that do 3k damage each. Destroyers need a massive nerf. Very bad"

        "The game is alright, but I  have some frustrations with it. For one, sometimes when you release the ball, the aim will move suddenly and cause it to hit off of your intend target. Also, it isn't cool when you start a new level and you have no available moves (you can't pop any bubbles! ), Sometimes for a number of turns, sometimes in the middle or at the end of the level. Usually it is manageable enough. Still frustrating tho. Maybe it is an international challenge of the game..  Overall a decent game",
        "Uninstalling. The controls are imprecise (ball would slip off the desired direction occasionally) and the order of the colours would make it impossible to win on occasion. I can forgive the first thing (muscle) but making it impossible to win is not forgivable.  Work on the algorithm.",
        "I used to enjoy this game when I had a minute spare. I was cruising at around level 300 enjoy the simplicity of it but not anymore! Since the introduction of the \"ice\" balls, it's become near impossible. Reading the other comment I'm glad to see that others are frustrated with the aim moving right at the last minute. I had this at 5 stars now it's 1.",
        "Games really nice good mind challenge, great for color match making if color blind. You may not know what colors your matching however, ever since i started playing i've also been getting better at matching my clothes and random day to day organising of colored items. Love the game however the ball simetimes seems to go where it wants to instead of where you released it... I noticed this a few times i would aim let go and the line would randomly jump to a new spot and the ball shots almost a completely diffrent location",
        "It is a good game but is built to take $$.  There are some levels that will not let you pass without spending $$ which I refuse to do.   I understand the need to make $$, but when it is blatantly built to take money, that is where I have an issue.  I wish I could upload the video of the level this takes place in, then you would understand what I mean. Decent game but sad for the obvious reason for the game.",

        "This so freaking awesome, a woo hoo maker! I kept mumbling awesome, awesome, when i passed a car. And this is first time i'm very exited when i managed to finish a level, even after that, i repeat again till i can surpass it perfectly. Even i haven't sleep for 2 days, felt like an alien or zombie, etc. But this game cheers me up alot. Recommended ? Yes! Good job dev, just download it guys. Lu pasti hepi dah! Keren!",
        "One of the best motorcycle game to date, weather conditions are great, bikes are great and handling is great, but the bad ai on higher difficulty level a few times are ridiculous and messes up everything.  Sometimes a truck speeds up to 150km/h just to close off that small gap, where you could slip through, but next time all cars in all lane slow down at once, so you can't pass anywhere, even though there's nothing in front of them. This is really annoying, when every second counts and there's no way to pass them for 4-7 seconds. Apart from this the game is great. The keep changing weather conditions is great too.",
        "There are some idiot missions such as combo overheading. I would give this game 5 stars if not those missions.",

        "I brought lots of upgrades and didn't play for some time. Installed on my new phone, same google account and now everything is gone. I feel completely ripped off!"

        "(REAL REVIEW! NOT A PAID REVIEWER) Really enjoying the game. It's a good time killer. Some levels are a lot of fun and actually require a little bit of skill. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is there are way too many ads. It will randomly make you watch a video to upgrade your ride or character, and/or to play a level. There's been a few times where I had enough tickets to play, and coins to upgrade my character the two points recommended, and I had to watch a video for all three. Three ads before you can even play a level is ridiculous. I understand that it's a big part of making money for the developers, but I've never had a free game with this many ads. Get rid of some of the ads and I'll gladly update my review to 5 stars.",

        "This game is the only one of it's kind that I've ever really gotten into. But I fell in love with it and have gotten some real cool friends out of it. They really have thought everything thru and keep improving the game play consistently. Other than not explaining a few parts of the game enough I really don't have any complaints.  You really don't have to spend money, as long as you are an active player an devote enough time to it. And from what I have heard about other games it's not quite as crazy of a $$$ spong as some other games my brother plays. Over all I think this if a great game and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for that new game to occupy your boredom & spare time. I give it a 9 outta 10.",
        "Fun game and unlike others u don't come back next day and find out u have to start over cause ur dead good job",
        "Wait to play or pay to play? How about not play at all? Instant uninstall for games that have time blocks you can pay to remove. What a garbage practice.",
        "I have been playing for only an hour. So far so good. I do like a good challenge and this game has peaked my interest",
        "If you pay to play you win, to many over powered players constantly attacking smaller players. I will be uninstalling soon",
        "Pretty cool it gives u just enough resources actually I think give you a pretty decent amount could be a little more though but still love the graphics design and it's pretty easy to play"

The only down side is that the spins cost alot of coins and those coins can be hard to earn. So 4.5 stars i would rate it is that was a option but its not so i rate it a a big fat 5",
        "I love this game a lot. The only problem is that when you do the Dailey spin, you only get like coins. And then with the coins you can buy another spin which is what I do. And I get even more coins. It's really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and",
        "this game is the bomb. it is stupid that they asked you is this game beautiful, of course not, people die, and crack their necks, backs, and shoulder blades. This game all in all soooooooo fun and you should totally get it. just say no if you want to write a reaport on this game because it will ask you is this game is beautiful which it is not. GOOD LUCK, good  night, new york city. at late night talk show with stephen colebert......jk",
        "Would rate give starts, but the amount of ads is absolutely ridiculous. I'm actually thinking about uninstalling please fix that. I know you want players to pay but in all actuality, it's quite stupid. Anyway, I do believe the game is quite fun",
        "Whatever they did last update broke the game for me, this is why I never buy anything in these games. No way to contact anyone to resolve any problems.  Game gets boring anyway",
        "It's a really good game and works really well. The only thing I don't like is how the cost of the daily spin goes up every time. It is quite annoying. Other than that I really enjoy playing this game. Great job guys😀"

        "This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further.",
        "Love testing my knowledge but I recommend a change. Upon entering the last letter you should have the option to view before the answer is submitted. My big fingers cause me to select the incorrect letter occasionally and then I get the wrong answer and my streak is reset. Please correct this.",
        "Several times now I've tried to type in a logo name and the app has told me I got it wrong but I thought it was right and couldn't see why I was being told I was wrong. So I hit \"solve\" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I've recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you've ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?",
        "First Level at Barbie and Twitter, even if type the words correct, the app tells me that there's a mistake. Solve shows me exactly the same word I've typed in before",
        "Several times I have tried to use a hint and it  wouldn't take it off and it was difficult and easy. When I type in the logo it would tell me I'm wrong then I hit solve and it was the same thing I wrote also and if people don't know some of the logos what is the point of the game.",
        "It's too easy to amass a huge number of hints and use them. I'd like not to be able to complete every level without doing some online searches."

        "This  was really  fun! Starts off easy but gets harder, not near the ads of the  other games I have played. Takes extra words, hints are reasonable,  earning money is reasonable.  So far the best of the word connects !! Really happy with this game, will add to my phone  and get rid of the other word connect games that seem to have ad, after ad not to mention the high amount for hints! There is one reason I didn't  give it a 5, because some of the ads get stuck and you can't  exit,  overall  4.8!",
        "I love this game! As others have stated it's very addictive! It's also challenging when you get up in the amount of games you played. My only problem is that when you're asked to watch a video to collect points, the video stops playing and and you don't collect the points. This has happened to me 5 times in a row. Other than that, I do not know what people are talking about as far as a lot of ads. I don't find that at all.",
        "Not a bad time killer - quick paced and not too taxing on the brain. I wish it had a more comprehensive dictionary so you would still get bonus points for valid words like 'cad.' No matter - still basically a four star, though almost three for the number of ads.",
        "The game isn't bad if you like word puzzles. My dislike comes from the fact that I have push notifications for this app turned off, but it somehow continues to manage to send them. It also keeps poor track of your coins. Good time killer.",
        "Child-friendly! And, as an adult? I love how am yet to see an advertisement. 😊  Unlike other word games like Word Connect, it also lets you find and play words that are not necessarily those found on the board, storing it in an \"Extra\" slot, which generates added points to your score, rather than telling you to choose the word that's only on the board.  ADDENDUM: After reading the comments, it appears there may be ads after all. Am yet to see any though. Perhaps because am still in a lower level.",
        "Game is fun. But giving me pop ups to bring me back to the game while it's not open is a nono. Especially when it takes up half the screen. I'd give 5 stars cause i had fun playong this, but this one thing is annoying. Especially with the amount of ads, it shows you just wanna push people to keep playing for that ad revenue. Won't be downloading any of your games after i delete this now."

        "Its a fun game, really, however in my opinion its too easy. I got 150 First try and 346  my second. and maybe consider adding things to unlock like different balls or hoops. other than that its a fun game to kill time",
        "The first time I played I easily got over 800, now I swear the game upped it's difficulty like crazy, I can't get past the 200s. Not sure if it's a bug, an Easter egg feature or what, or if it's because I completed challenges but I don't appreciate the inconsistency especially when playing against friends and I don't feel evenly matched :(",
        "The problem is that every time it asks me if I would like to continue I say yes and then kicks me out of the game",
        "So many words but after u got all the  things there is nothing to do bar from play on it but it a  really good game love it soooooo much",
        "I like the game and the idea of it, but the only problem I have with it, its the ads. Dear God there is a lot of ads, even when I'm in the middle of a game, an ad pops up from the bottom. Just try to lower the amount of ads especially on the challenges, I hate to be asked and forced to watch an ad everytime I fail a challenge or complete it",
        "I absolutely love the game the only.problem I'm having is when I'm playing I keep knocking the ad advert at the bottom where your thumb goes to move the net and keeps ending game and making me.lose cause of that will change rating if gets sorted"

        "I really enjoy this game, but I have found a flaw in the design. The game speeds up as you go and after a point it doesn't go faster, but after around 10,000 you notice the ball start to move forward on the screen and after about 20,000 you don't even have to move the ball to not die. It just misses the spikes. I know you might be thinking Its not on the leaderboards, but that's my next complaint. Im currently 6 on the leaderboards, but I've gotten a better score and it won't update. I quite frankly destroyed that score and it doesn't show up. Thank you for your time and I hope this helped",
        "Game is great, far too many ads, after each level AND major issues with the videos giving rewards. I watched 4 and only received 1 reward which makes the game unfair and not worth playing.",
        "I HATE the vibration when u die I almost uninstalled the app bcuz of that. I also have a problem with pop up ads. I really like the game though",
        "I think the game is good but the pop up ads make it almost impossible to play as when ever you about to start a new level pop up ads and some where even in the middle of the game and it happens to a lot of their games",
        "Fun game, but occasionally an ad will pop up while I'm playing, causing me to mess up and die. I was having a really great run when an ad popped up. Not cool.",
        "I think this game is very addictive. To all the people that say u have to many adds well i dont i can actually play the game without getting interrupted"

Also, why does the Apple version have stars and the android version doesn't? I was trying so hard to earn enough stars to buy the colour packs on my iPod, and I got quite disappointed that I can't do that on android. I guess I'll just delete the game off android since there's really no goal to the game now.",
        "Very fun and addicting but nice calm relaxing game. Ads only happen after each round and not a big deal. If you want to keep playing this game FREE then add up with the package. Quiet whinning about ads. Someonbe has to pay the creators for this game including the upkeep and updates. How else will the creator make his money? 2 choices, either gets ads or charge to download. So I can deal with the ads. It's a FREE APP.",
        "Way too many ads. I just need something for my fingers to do while listening to podcasts but this constantly interrupts my listening pretty much after every round. I really liked the game but I have had it with thw ads and am uninstalling. It's just not worth it.",
        "I really like the game but as many others have said their are too many ads. Ads after every round and sometimes in the middle of the round which makes you start over and that gets annoying. Too many of thr same ads. I also agree their needs to be a redo button. It does get a bit pintle after you hit the goal but still fun.",
        "Too many adds, and it makes me restart every time an add plays, I've only had this app for 1 min, and have already played 50 rounds... Not. Cool. I would be okay with the adds if I could at least pick up on where I last left off.",
        "I'm not quite sure what's happened to this game. It's very straightforward and strangely addictive. However, just today after Android's OS update, it performs much worse. Where before when you pick up a block, it is elevated slightly above your finger so you can see where it's going, now it's just under your finger, making this game frustratingly impossible. If this is due to an interaction with the OS update, then 1010 is due for it's own update."

Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I've tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It's the only maze puzzle app I've found worth playing! 😀💜",

        "I'm not far into it, but it's fun so far. My eyesight could be why it's not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It's still a very good game though.",
        "I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven't played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I'll have to download a separate kid version for her.",

Only things I don't like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option",
        "Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it's good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can't take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren't recognised either. I'd enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.",

        "Great game. Really fun buy id love to be able to play without having to wait for someone to challenge me or vice versa. A single player option would be fun. Also i payed 3.69$ to have no ads but i sometimes still grt the very long ad videos which i find a little annoying since i payed for no ads... But other then that great game 😊",
        "Update:  now the game won't let me start a new game.   Original post: Buggy to say the least. Paid to remove ads since it was only .99. And now the game randomly quits, and erases any games I've started when I exit from the game for any period of time. Was find until I removed the ads. Great way to treat the people paying your bills.",
        "This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!"

I have had it glitch also in the middle of my drawing. Very frustrating. Support says they're aware, but two game updates later and the app is still problematic. Typical.",

Then I  quit,  and go back in,  sometimes can get to drawing board,  but not with the word selected.  Grrrrr. Also solo challenges do not reload.  Badges are meaningless,  no clarification on how to use words. Above All combined makes this game tedious and boring.  The only fun part is watching the opponent's drawing take place.  Humorous but not worth the effort of trying to play.  Uninstalling for now.",

        "Everything costs money. You'll be playing then run out of grenades. That'll be 30g. Don't have that? Well enjoy losing until you figure out a way to win. Love this game though. Made a purchase right off for a gun. Then I saw how much grinding is involved for the upgrades. The jump between a level 2 and 3 upgrade? Then the outfits, 2nd and 3rd weapons. Man. Sorry no thank you. This shooter however is very fun but the paywall is so well thought out I am not prepared to drop that kind of money. Learned my lesson losing 1k to Megopolis.",
        "I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn't have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn't get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren't vigilant of their customers and don't take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.",
        "I love this game so much. I have been looking for a good shooting game for years and I never found one until I came across this. This is perfect. Me and my friend would spend hours on this game. I have been playing this for about 6 months now. It's perfect. I think the best thing about this game is how organized everything is. It is very self explanatory. I found everything and it was easy to do so. I also love how they update this game very often. Great game. I haven't had any problems with it. I can't wait for updates later on to come.",
        "Great game with a lot of potential.... There can be so many more additions to make this fps better. More grenade varieties? A spectator mode? Clan levels that allow more players to join when we reacher higher levels? Gun balancing changes? I feel like the Cerberus should be buffed. It is expensive, and the 3 shots at once doesn't allow for many attempts for kills. Adventure mode for more gunbucks? Death match option? Allowing us to pick the map? I understand the game is fairly new, so keep on adding changes and new improvements. Thanks for listening!",
        "Great game to play, fun and exciting. But not F2P friendly. P2W guns will always be better and it's near impossible to get end games gear for F2P. But still bearable for F2P. My advice would be maintain F2P take it as a grindy F2P games and don't spend any money. It seems this game had an issue that you might not get the item you paid for. You will be charged and not receiving the item and when you try to contact the support. Oh boy... No body will be replying. It seems it's a trend here where there take your money and kick you out.",
        "Game is really tooo gud, graphics also nice n smooth controls but u guys released only one game mode(Team death match), but in lot of fps games they provided free for all, bomb mode, Flag capture n many more modes.. If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games 😀 n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area."

When i up on the small vehicle with my  Monster Truck(heavy vehicle)  the small vehicles can't wreak. Plzzzzz do something for me. It's a request. My problems are not solved.",
        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Honesty its just like GTA which a great thing but the thing is the installation time let me share my experience to one and all reading hear... When I was downloading it at the first its done but it starts downloading once again but I am not sure is it my problem but I just wanted to share with you guys... The game is boss",
        "Best game I've ever played! In fact it is the only game I've had on my phone for 2 years. But there are some minor errors that keep occurring, such as when you are running or driving any vehicle, the control pad keeps stopping and I have to lift my thumb up and put it back down to regain control. Now I know it doesn't sound like much, it can mess up your drifts and the gas will stop as well. PLEASE FIX. Thanks",
        "It's a very great game,Nothing but love.   But I got a notification  that there is an update,I updated the game but I still can't find the new added missions in the game. Secondly I am on day 87 and my day 90 supposed  Reward changed after I downloaded the update.",
        "I don't understand why  diamonds are required to craft materials. As a F2P player it is difficult for me to craft new materials. The old updates never had this rubbish. Please fix ASAP.Will install again if it is fixed."

        "Cute game, but not without it's flaws. I forgot the reasons I deleted the game in the past, but remember them now. It drains your battery, the life refresh time is high (20 minutes) and starting at a certain level (30) you really can't progress WITHOUT friends (this is not a positive for everyone. I personally don't like it), or money, or a ton of patience. You need keys to progress. You can either buy, ask friends, or play for one every FOUR HOURS. This is the exact point where I uninstalled the game last time.",
        "I would taste this game higher if the only way you could progress wasn't by having to purchase extras. Having to waste all my extras to get through a gate with 3 keys sucks and so does knowing that really the only way through is to buy your way through.",
        "I'm uninstalling game! I was really happy with game when I started,  now there is an ad every next life and sometimes more! Same ad over and over, enough to drive you CRAZY! Also you can't answer quick text or do anything off screen without the game totally rebooting,  it's supposed to be relaxing to play on phone,  NOT IRRITATING!",
        "I would give this 5 stars, if you could select a level of difficulty, like easy, medium and hard.  It is not relaxing at all, once you pass the early levels. I hate the levels with bullies, you should be able to skip them.",
        "Was great at first, but is now so slow that it takes around five minutes to load the next level - or just to return to replay a failed level. Shame, as I've stopped playing it because of this fault.",
        "Why bother having an X on the Level Rush notification if it doesn't work so you have to press Begin and wait for the animation to finish before you can carry on with claiming the Daily Challenge. Also 'play with friends' on the tournament never does anything. Otherwise fun."

I really like this game as you can tell but I feel like I have been USED I WILL NEVER PLAY THIS GAME AGAIN IF YOU DON'T MAKE THIS RIGHT. I will give you 24HR. Then I will be done. 24 then I will be gone",
        "Great fun! Hours of excitement. If you like slots then you will like these. Piggy slots are my fav. Prolly more but haven't played them yet.......After playing Piggy's and Devil Kids, I find the play way,way too slow. Almost to the point of being boring. I know what you are thinking....But I am 66years old and the games are still too slow. Like hunny at 30f below. Great games but way too slow.",

        "Payouts are tightening up. Hate, hate hate Piggy jackpots. It is soooooooooooooooo slowwwwwwwwwwww.  But it is on speed compared to the new Incredible Superdog. Payouts are glacial, fortunately, they almost never happen.  Please do not make those free bonus spins. They suck.",
        "Enjoyable !! But frustrating sometimes, but that's gaming, still like the games.i don't like to be taken for a  ride, pay to lose it seems. Games are right on but the pay out are inconsistent and when I buy it's like win once lose twenty times. Enjoy your day",
        "So fun to play here, they are generous and good to the people who play here, whether you are a paying customer or not. I wish you success! Came back on Christmas morn 2017 STILL BEST DANG SLOTS ON GOOGLE PLAY. HAD A LOT OF FREE FUN. GREAT NEW SLOTS!!   This site has NO problems, unlike a few others (Double Down) who freezes,the game when you win big. DOUBLE U IS AWESOME!!!! SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE!!!"

        "If you've liked the first game you're probably gonna enjoy this one. It's more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it's built around microtransactions so if you're feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don't understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it's likely you're going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.",
        "Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren't aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don't expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!",
        "I love this game! One thing though, I believe that there are too many plants that cost real money to get. Could you please make some more plants that you can get them by being able to unlock them by playing the game, instead of ones where you have to use real money. Besides that, this is a really great game!",
        "Free to play games are always the same formula: Starts off addictive, gets more challenging, starts encouraging you to buy gem equivalent, forces you to buy gem equivalent. At least most other games are fair with it though, giving you a chance. PVZ 2 does not. Levels go quickly from fun to I'm done, and become impossible. I'd love to see developers or game testers try to complete later levels without gems, especially Big Wave Beach. It's a shame, as the first game remains a classic. Buy the first game and Garden Warfare if you like it. Leaf this game alone, it's a sprout at best. Oh and remember, if zombies try to break into your house, throw your money at them.",
        "Love this game so much! I am a huge PVZ fan anyway and I love playing this. You do need some boosters to get past levels, which feels a bit like cheating sometimes, but you can earn plenty of coins. There is always a new quest to play so even when I'm stuck on the other levels I can still play. This is a great game, well done devs!",
        "Ok its annoying and frustrating if you accidentally press a power up button and waste your zombie coins can you add like a thing lile when you press the power up button down below there would like something pop up like \"Are you sure your gonna use this power up?\" \"Yes or no\" to lessen accidents :("

The actual game itself is amazing despite having a hard time trying to beat the bacteria level but, what's the point of a good game concept, if the game won't work properly",

(At least you can unlock it after being a brutal pro at the game) I'm gonna enjoy playing this a good few times and unlock even MORE scenarios. Keep up the good work! I wanted to make a suggestion, but I just can't remember now. Oh well...",
        "The game is addictive but when you get to a certain point the cure kicks in and it stops giving away DNA points and it makes it hard to advance in the game. I have read the hints in the news it gives, but I still can't manage to beat the game. I want to delete the game. Butim going to continue to try. I just wanted to mention it idk if its the game or just me. I won't tell others about the game only because its frustrating to play. These games are not good for people to play that has any type of mental issue unless they want to buy a new phone.",
        "Fun game. I wish the rate of death was more consistent. 37,000,000 a day at one point, but waiting 6 months for 100,000 to die towards the end. The disease didn't change, the rate of death shouldn't decrease just because there are fewer people. Good game otherwise",
        "From beginning to end I've been pleasantly surprised and let down but mainly let down. I was all for this game when it came out but now you wanna make a quick buck on a scenario app... pay more for something that should be part of the game. Overall good game business practices not so much.",
        "I didn't buy the new plague, i might need to. The first 2 difficulty settings are easy, the 3rd not so much. Good game to me! Just have to read what it is that you spend your DNA points on and you should do just fine"

There have been several updates that I love (the new maps, new sharks, equipment, etc.) and I'm glad I'm playing it now. In game currency price for items has been balanced out which I love and the missions system is much better now. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes progression-based time-killing games like Hungry Shark World.",

The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I've had to start all over again... but the fun continues!",

        "It's a fun game and I'm enjoying it. However, I've come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.",

I lost everything a couple years ago before they had cloud saves... They're here now and aside from a logout/in they are wonderous afaik. Good stuff!",
        "This game is amazing! Everyone needs to play this. I would've given a fifth star however you need to not only buy all XXL sharks to unlock the \"!!\" Sharks but max them out. Definitely download this, just one tip. Don't delete when you have progress. I've downloaded, played, got bored, and deleted 3 times. Now I'm never deleting it. I have so much progress, if I never deleted it the first time I would have everything in the game"

I love how we're able to take care of the premies and foster them until they're adopted! 6/10 - Would play again if bored.",

        "I kind of hated this game because it seen not realistic and it Barley let you do anything yourself but it would be good of really little kids.",
        "nice, but it would be better if the babies weren't always the same. like when your done with their picture and want to play again, it shouldn't be always girl babies, and it shouldn't always be twin babies. please change that problemo. it's boring. 🤓"

However when it comes to completing the quest, resources get over quickly and as per the time we need to wait for 3hrs for getting the refill,or buy it with the diamonds.... Lower the time limit for resource production like in different expeditions..as that will unable us to play more and complete it too on time.",

        "Really enjoy the game. Not spent a penny on it yet and managing alright to do tasks etc in a reasonable time. Though I've not completed a quest yet but that could be me not getting back to the game regularly enough. That's my issue though.",
        "The idea of this game is fun, but the actual game play can be a little monotonous. Almost impossible to advance without spending money.  For all the time and effort you have to put into it, there should be a bigger pay off.",

        "As others have said, the longer you play, the worse it performs and the more space it takes up, and after a while ads start causing the game to crash. However I've managed to get around it by reinstalling every couple of weeks. Other than that it's a good little game.",
        "It's a pretty fun game, better than I thought it would be. There is one problem, you don't really need to buy \"Flooz\", but if you do. The prices are a little outrageous. Like 5$ for 100 Flooz, seems a little money hungry. And 100 Flooz for 15 days is 29$ is outrageous as well. I've played other games with better things to do besides upgrading and usually 100 \"diamonds\" of anything would last 30 and would cost 10-15$. Seems like you're trying to rip people off. Besides the money hungry creators, good game to kill time.",
        "It has bugs. Like how sometimes skills don't activate right away, and on rare occasions, not at all. The currencies are pretty fair; I don't feel like have to buy anything (sucks for the devs, but it's not like I can buy anything even if I wanted to). Events keep the game fresh, and I always feel like I have something to do at all times, so it does a good job of keeping me occupied for 20-30 minutes at a time.",
        "The first idle game that caught my attention. At first, i thought that it's just \"one of those idle games\".. But, the more I play the more i get hooked because of unique game mechanics. I might give this 5 stars in the future.",
        "I think the game would be enjoyable if it did not crash ALL the time. Get to a new level? Crash. Watch a video? Crash. Crash Them All might be a more fitting name for the only game that has ever crashed more than once on this phone.",
        "Incredible game play it for hours and love it soooo much only good things to say other than server connecting but it's no big deal love the game the style the graphics the game play is all awsome I do have some ideas for the game if your interested number one being adding carnivore and herbivore types into the game so you could have dinosaurs and number 2 is world bosses were the entire community can all defeat one boss and 3 to have the ability to friend people not through Facebook. Love the game it's so good thanks for putting so much hard work into it and adding awsome features cheers"

I enter the details, it tells me that I've already logged in, I go back to the game and it just does the same thing over and over..... Anyone know how to solve this issue? Website is no use at all",
        "Between ads completely over running gameplay and the new requirement of having to earn stars to proceed, Rovio continues to run this once great game into the ground. **Update** game now freezes randomly requiring a force close. This is beyond ridiculous. I HATE what this franchise has become. Rovio should be ashamed.",
        "Too many ads way too often. I get a few sponsored ads help keep apps free or inexpensive but the frequency here makes the app annoyingly unuseable. Sponsors need to realise that the more we consumers are harassed with unwanted advertising, the LESS we will be interested in their product. I outright boycott or blacklist such companies and products.",
        "This game used to be awesome, sadly I have just removed it due to the star issue. I used to be able to play for fun, however, due to the its current standing, one MUST achieve three stars in each level in order to play other levels. Madness! Great job for taking the fun out of a game!",
        "This latest update keeps freezing up. I have to close it out completely and restart it. I lose any powerups I was using when it freezes, too. I cannot even finish playing the mighty levels the last few days because of this issue. Very annoyed.",
        "This is nolstaga.  I totally  love this game and rovio keep on doing what you are doing wow this new profile is kinda trippy.  Aslo my boys wow yall changed the name and an added classic.  Hmm good wow y'all changed the layout and the amount of stars it really never bothered me  that Much.  But thanks anyway.  Anyway I earned the badge that said pop me/them.  Then I played a level I noticed that      rip.     the pig said pop them.  I was like WHATTTTTT I wondered what they used to say.  I thought it was something thing like Omelet it sounded like it.  Which would be totally Fugded up cuz you know the Eggs.  When I  imagine them saying pop them its kinda creepy and scary and weird. Anyway thanks rovio I totally love this Franchise/series."

It's a good freemium game, but don't bother redoing levels unless it's to earn more coins for essential upgrades. This game WILL take your money if you let it.",
        "This game is soooo fun!! Its better than Cooking Fever. I love this game!❤ the levels get harder but that's the fun of it. And the food makes me really hungry🍔! But the thing is that after a few days (when i first got the game) it didn't let me play the game, it just stayed at 89 percent. So I got the game again but it still did it😭.",
        "The game is fun when it works. Every time I unlock a new restaurant or a new region or bonus level or ANYTHING it won't download. I get a \"connection error\", and the only way to get past it is to delete the game, re-download EVERYTHING (which clocks in at over 100mb) and try again.",
        "The game really very good.. it really liked concept nd i play it for hours.. but after unlocking paris I am facing difficulty to complete the levels.. even though i play efficiently some levels just cant be completed they require special add ons or purchases.. this makes game frustrating..even after giving my best i am not able to complete levels.. if its due to any error plz correct it asap otherwise i have to delete it coz i cant go any further in this game with this nd its frustrating me.. thank u",
        "I loved this game until today so it gets 1 star. Too many glitches or prompts. Right after I spend money on in-app purchases in order to use during a stage, my game froze. Another time, a prompt for an update popped up as soon as I used an in-app purchase and froze the entire game. Keep in mind, I'd already been playing for a good while. I won't be spending any more money in this game and some levels are set up to where you'd have to spend so I guess I'll eventually be uninstalling. It's fun, addictive but glitchy and steals your money.",
        "I'm addicted!! but please, don't make the game needs to connect to the internet the whole timee :( sometimes, we do play games bcs we don't have internet access. hope can consider this :) thanks in advance"

I enjoy playing it but I get the feeling very soon I will have to spend some real pennies and when that happens I will probably stop playing.",

I had problems when you updated it before and in the end had a new phone started again and now this problem. Why does problems happen when you do and update. I have got to a good level again and I really don't want to start again. It's a shame as I really think this is or was the best game I've played.  Please sort it",

        "The Game is unmatched. My issue is in car price changes which id give no star for. Im also becoming abit bored by the game because the cars i have left to by can only be acquired via tokens or cash. Not everyone can afford to pay continuous amounts to get further in a game. Scrap the cash and reward good driving. By the way, this is the best game 🇿🇦I've ever played",
        "AWESOME man I love the game man best graphics ever! Insane gameplay I love it . I already know that Gameloft will give best graphical experience ever but the game is frikkin good .but the recent update have a slight problem. It is the details of objects takes time to form fully. But the race is done before it . Please fix this problem.",
        "You have to change the controls to tap left and right to turn. And change the sensitivity to 100%. Once that is done th controls are good.   Good game, it would have been nice to be able to play against your friends over the internet also, not just wi fi. It needs rewards in local wi fi also.. S class class cars turn with 1 second delay, which is very frustrating",
        "Best racing game on Android for me. But It we have to buy credits it the most difficult process. It will be a game-changer and very good turn if We Can sale maxed out cars which we have and get credits in Return. I guess this feature will be awesome. Love this Game",
        "I've just realized that this game is for people that have gambling addiction trates, people who will keep spending money to advance.  I got a offer to buy a car in the game, limited time offer it said only 10,000 tokens, so I looked up how much that was out of curiosity? $149! Are you for real? Someone must be on drugs to come up with these prices. I just feel sad for the ones that do pay for these so called offers. May Gameloft be cursed until you take away your greed.",
        "Why am I forced to download 1.5 gb data for this game daily?? Getting fed up man! Everyday I am downloading and the next day it asks again. Its seriously frustrating. Kindly give all updates in one download pls."

    "description" : "The Moneyville game was originally launched in 2008 and is now available as app in the following languages:Danish – PengebyNorwegian – PengebySwedish – PenningborgFinnish – RahalaaksoEstonian – RahamaaLithuanian – PinigėnaiUK / Irish - MoneyvilleMoneyville is a free, educational game for children between the ages of 5-9, but children both younger and older will also enjoy exploring Moneyville.Through games, play and activity your child will learn what money is and what its value means. He or she will also be introduced to the difference between income and expenses – to earn money and to spend money.There is a lot for your child to discover in Moneyville:- Your child will have his or her first chance to earn money at the city gates, which need to be painted.- They can also earn money at the apple stall or at the post office. - They can help the farmer feed his animals and learn about basic mathematics. - And they can use the money they earn on all kinds of fun things in Penny’s shop or travel back in time in the time machine. Moneyville gives you as a parent or teacher an easy, entertaining and alternative way to talk to your child or student about money.Moneyville has been developed in collaboration with leading experts from four different fields relevant to e-learning, including media experts, child psychologists, representatives from teaching organisations and online media experts.Moneyville is developed by Danske Bank and is a part of Danske Bank’s Financial Literacy Program. The basis of the program is a belief that a higher level of financial literacy and education not only enriches the life of the individual but also contributes to healthy economic growth in the society. The Financial Literacy Program targets children, young people, parents and teachers with the aim of preparing the ground for a healthy financial start to adult life.

It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven't bothered to update this in years.",
        "Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can't stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn't happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can't buy any of the bikes.",

Please fix this!",

        "Most puzzles are self explanatory. The odd few appeared to be impossible without some instruction. Few levels I had to skip probably around 7 levels. Couple due to pieces not moving or stuck. Very happy to be able to skip levels.  Would have been great to have a certain bank of hints for some of the  difficult ones. I found the later levels easier than the ones around 100. Max levels 120. Great fun!",
        "Some things are hidden in such a place makes it hard on note 8 due to curved screen. Level 89 doesn't work, as well as other levels where touching the same place over and over and over might get something to work.  Most puzzles are extremely easy,  it's just a matter of the game not working.",
        "Fun and challenging for awhile, but I found most of the levels after 50 impossible to figure out without a cheat sheet. Got frustrating. I'm at level 60 and about ready to throw in the towel.",
        "Not responsive to most touches. I finally got a cheat only to realize it was the game.  Ads were not frequent but had a strobe light going off (health issues) and would not turn off. Had to close out of the game every time so I just quit playing. Typo many similar more challenging games out there to try and work with this one.",
        "I play this game in 2hrs and got stuck on level 42. It's challenge your mind. It's good for you, if you like doing brain games.. It helps you think about.. Like you really have to think about it or you will get stuck. But all the above, it's a awesome awesome game.",
        "Items don't move when they are supposed to therefore making it impossible to complete each task. It is very frustrating because the game would be more fun. It would make it more enjoyable with at least 1 or 2 hints."

        "Alright, so the game is pretty good. All I ask for is more tricks, and the ability to upgrade some bonuses (coin magnet, feather hover thing, and the third one that I haven't grabbed yet.) All in all, if you could do that, it'd make the game so much greater. Apart from skipping missions and revives there's no use for coins.",
        "The thing that makes this game great is the visuals and the audio. It is absulutley beautiful and the art style works so well with the type of game. Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I'd very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there's a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style",
        "Good graphics, but can get boring after only like 3 minutes. Also the makers of the game should add a another different mode where your running away from a villager/camper and see how far you can get. You could improve or modify this mode that i have made if you want",
        "First off, I'd like to give a big thank you to the developers for this game. It's amazing.  However, I've been encountering quite a few bugs lately. One day, picking up a hover feather crashed the game. Today, I can't pick up llama horns, and the background blur that happens when you go into the workshop stayed into an actual run. I took this as a challenge and continued playing. I'm on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 9.7 running Android Marshmallow.  This is just to tip you guys off on some bugs.",
        "This was the must have game- I think, for a while. Then the newest update came out. Now it has ads you must veiw (before totally optional for more coins or an extra run) and added FTP elements. Took from a 5 star classic, to barely 2 stars. Thankfully, the base game play was untouched, and still well worth the advertisements, but I'm very sad for this move on the part of the dev team.",
        "I have 'noisy' brain and anxiety and sometimes the world is too much to bear. This game keeps me calm and collected all the time. The music and gameplay soothe me up. I do get frustrated over the goals but I have nothing but praise and love for this game. Thank you to everyone involved. You all helped a lot. Cannot wait for Alto's Odyssey for Android!"

        "Used to be my favorite game.  The latest update completely changed the character of the game.  The ball is faster, bouncier, and everything is smaller, and it all adds to just randomness.  The AI got worse at the same time, so it's not really harder... just more random.  I now find that this game stresses me out instead of helping me relax, so I have to give it up.",

Perfect shots don't always go in. The amount of times my team mates have drilled it right at the goal keeper from point blank range in an almost open goal is infuriating.",

I also love the art of all the snakes; watching them evolve into huge monsters! My only complaint is that choosing custom coats of paints for the snakes can be teddious, as some of the spots are really small. Also, adding more customizable hats would be nice, though not needed. All in all it's a really fun, addicting game. Good job!!",

        "Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren't enough. And one of them didn't work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.",
        "I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.",
        "It's fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I'm bored. I love the songs and dance moves it's awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it's awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don't know how to dance then you should download this game it's perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.",
        "It's a good game overall but the songs that are supposedly meant to be free aren't. I would rate it 5 stars but I can on play 3 songs every 24 hours. I'm trying to workout while doing this but a workout isn't a very good workout if it's only for 6 minutes. Please give us a higher coin  limit and cut the wait time down some. Then and only then will I rate it 5 stars.",
        "Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn't have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!",
        "I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn't make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun."

I en digital verden hvor mit gammeldags TV abonnement for længest er udskiftet med TV2 Play er det simpelthen ikke holdbart at man ikke har en udgave som \"synkronisere med TV2 Play\" (forsinkelse på ca 1 minut). Det gør app'en fuldstændig ubrugelig og man er efterladt i en situation hvor det eneste man kan gøre er at sidde og klikke på alle muligheder på skift, konstant i de minutter reklamerne kører.  Jeg forstår hvordan det kan være vanskeligt. En nøjagtige synkronisering er umulig når reklamerne (TV2 Play) afspiller er en anden device (fx Smart TV) end den Reklame Bingo kører på. Men så lad folk gætte en rækkefølge af reklamer og få point efter hvor mange rigtige de har. Eller sørg for brugeren kun kan gætte en gang per reklame (så når brugeren starter sit første gæt, betyder det reklame blokken er startet hus brugeren) eller hvad ved jeg.  I mangler dygtige udviklere som løser sådan nogle problemer. Forstår ikke i kan stille jer tilfredse med den løsning i har nu.",
        "Sjovt koncept, men dårlig udførelse. Som flere siger, så er signalet bagud på Play, og halvdelen af gangene kan jeg ikke indløse brikkerne, selvom jeg har set reklamen.",

Håber på at det kan løses med et lille if statement ved at blandt andet at tjekke om en bruger har TV2 PLAY og tillade delay på input"

When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..",
        "Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven't gotten very far yet. Thing I DON'T like is you don't get an average..... IF you do, I've yet to find where it is in the game. That's in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯",
        "Great graphics and realistic feel to the lanes. Controls are a bit wonky, however, and purists won't like being being able to steer the ball after it leaves your \"hand.\" LOTS of attempted upsells, but its free to play features ain't too bad on their own, either. All in all, a decent little bowling game.",
        "It's a  fun game but it's rigged. I think if you have a billion chips you shouldn't be able to play on lower lanes. I thought you were supposed to be matched up with people who are the same or close level. How is it I'm bowling against someone who is level 171 and 8 billion chips and  I'm level 43 .",
        "Amazing.  It's just fun watching the bowling hall whizz by and get a strike.  I've played and uninstalled this game, but the only reason for the uninstall part is storage.  For all of you who are new, try getting the ball between the front pin and either of the pins next to it, it usually gets strikes, but by strikes I mean doubles against level 7 Russians.",
        "This is a fun game however it allows people to cheat or it's rigged. It's no coincidence that the better I play the better my opponent plays. I think half the time we are playing a rigged computer. I spent $50 on this app in a week and I am deleting it now. Sorry crooked people that run this app."

So the clan is all low level players who can't contribute as much. Arena player's list shows everyone but the top 3 not playing all week. A ton of other issues that you can find in any ABE forum and even in the comments on posts on the ABE Facebook page. I think Rovio's stock trend shows it all.",
        "This use to be my favorite game. Have spent alot of money playing. Due to the \"white out\" have not been able to play for 3 months. Even after several updates, nothing. Tech support claims to be on the issue... Very frustrating!!!!",
        "I used to love this game, but the changes make me HATE it now. Like it's so hard to get a premium hatch ticket now, yet y'all still throw two star and three star Birds in there. The Halloween event is impossible with the numbers set so high, and the amount of skulls you receive in a battle is 5-10 max. This game has become a money pit, and I think I'm out. Rovio got greedy, and I don't appreciate it. You ruined the game for sure",
        "OK. So, it started off fun. But, now all I get is lost connection, slow connection or some other BS! I'm not going to be able to get any further because I won't pay for stuff. So, it's going to be uninstalled. Of you must, play for a week, then ditch it",
        "The game keeps closing during play causing player's to loose prizes and money. It's having more problems with every update. Support staff are pretty useless when reporting glitches.",
        "More or less meh, can do with or without. Asks frequently if you enjoy the app, if you say \"no\" then that's it. However, only if you say \"yes\" will it ask you to rate it. Pathetic that the developers don't actually want feedback. Needs some smoothing out on a few things, but Rovio doesn't care."

        "Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can't without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.",
        "Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?",
        "It would br better if you could exchange coins for diamonds, not just diamonds for coins. I also have a screen shot which shows that I should be the 1 place, yet another car which was behind me and crossed the line 1 sec later got the first place :/",
        "So many ad's, there back to back ad's. When I am finally able to select a race, guess what...another ad pops up and takes me to the play store to download it. I go back to the game and I gotta start all over again from the first screen. Ad's ad's ad's I was only able to play on the first day I downloaded it, after that..... Ad's ad's ad's                    \"AD'S!!!\".... But i did like the game when I played it",
        "Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that's excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.",
        "I one stared it because it has good graphics and what not but the only problem is this is a complete knock off of \"Asphalt 8\" features and everything. I'd say it's so much alike I'd call it plagiarizing but that's just my opinion.  Good game overall but no respect for not being something differebt in a better way ."

        "To many ads, even if they make the game free.. Pathetic. Conflicts with game when trying to back out of them and even crashes. Inconsistent game play, twitchy controls at times. Unplayable shots where one number on power scale is to hard the next one down is to soft.  Multi player has a feel of being rigged at times.  Potential for a good game but not yet in my books.",
        "Used to be so much better. Cameras are now not fluid, it doesn't show the hole prior to shot anymore. Truthfully, it was awesome before you made changes... It goes back to the old saying, \"why fix it if it isn't broken?\"",
        "Super fun game, but WAY TOO MANY crashes. I've been struggling with a level several times only for the game to crash mid-level and I lose all my progress getting booted back to the beginning. Infuriating!",
        "Awful controls, heavily focused on buying coins & watching ads just to play matches. Not recommended!",
        "This game is good. You should try to make it a lot more like golf with friends (the Steam game). Try to make the graphics look more detailed and better. Add more maps too.",
        "Some observations: ball does not rebound off rails as they should, especially the back and side rails near the hole, where the ball hits the rail and stops dead. Part of miniature golf mastery is using the rails but not in this game. And when the ball is against a rail a shot is allowed as if the rail was not present. After a shot the screen should automatically rotate close to what the next shot would be expected so as to minimize manual rotation. I was making a long swipe to rotate almost 180° and my finger hit the power slide and an errant shot was made. Most hills are not smoothly sloped but instead very angular. Hitting the bottom of the slope causes the ball to jump in ways unanticipated rather than roll. This is golf, not basketball. I uninstalled the game because it just wasn't as fun and realistic as I had hoped."

        "Really fun.  But crashes constantly on my Galaxy S5.  Then I have to force stop the app, and restart my phone to get it working, for about 5 minutes....  All have to do to avoid ads is not restart until the respawn timer clears, so they aren't that bad, and it's really cheap to turn the ads off.  I would happily do so, it the app would run for more than 5 minutes.  If it wasn't for the crashing, I would rate it 4 stars at least.",
        "Love playing this game...very addictive! I would rate it 5* if there was a reason for why you level up and why you keep spinning for little lightening bolts when you do level up  as once you have bought the small amount on offer they are no longer needed. Add more things to buy and give the game a reason for levelling up 🤘🏼",
        "Smooth game. Plenty of fire ball options and endless level options but after every death you have to watch  15 second ad. EVERY DEATH. Which just spoils the experience and all. I understand ads but like after 3 deaths that's fine. But after every death and some are unskippable. So download of you have patience. It's worth it of you have time to spend",
        "One of the most glitchy apps. The ads don't bother me, if you hate the ads so much pay the money to get rid of them. But this game constantly crashes and freezes. And half the time you will click to change your ball or rings and it won't load or do anything. This game is full of glitches. Would be an amazing game if this was attended to",
        "A wonderful aesthetically pleasing game.  Get as far as you can, with as many points as you can while unlocking different fireballs and portals. I would love to see how this game evolves in the future and i have not seen as many ad's as people claim so perhaps that issue has been resolved? Working perfectly on S8+",
        "TOO MANY ADS, every time you die you get an ad and that's just being money hungry what ever happened to games without long ads what's the point if you're gonna make a game and 1/3 of the gameplay being ads. Perhaps every 10 or 20 games, or just have those small popup ads, but don't ruin the gameplay because you want money. I'm uninstalling and I'm sure other people are as well."

Your child will play the role of the train driver, load cargo, build bridges, stop at crossings, help passengers, refuel, and lay new tracks to steer the train safely around obstacles.Copying grown-ups and their activities is important to your 2-year-old toddler’s development - and few things are as ‘grown-up’ as driving a huge steam train through the scenic countryside, full speed ahead, horns tooting.If your toddler is fascinated by trains, this simple game will provide new inspiration for hours of creative play - with or without a LEGO DUPLO train set.Features:*Bright, fun, and toddler-friendly animations and sound effects*Intuitive icons and navigation for easy game play*Cute, interactive DUPLO landscape with lots of building fun and surprises*Based on the DUPLO My First Train set and familiar animals and characters*No in-app purchases*No third party advertising*Parental gate to information about other LEGO DUPLO apps and productsAbout LEGO® DUPLO®A preschool building toy specifically designed for children ages 1 ½ - 5 – small hands and big imaginations!

        "This game is amazing, it really helps with stress, anxiety and just any and all negative emotions. With its calm, relaxing music and adorible graphics, this well thought out game is the perfect way to releave stress. I really recommend downloading this game, trust me, you'll love it!!!😁",
        "Very relaxing. I fell asleep playing this game. Though it's a bit addictive, so I don't like playing during the day. Another problem is that saving and loading the game between devices from the cloud are a bit confusing. There is no explanation and I haven't gotten it to work.",
        "PLEASE DON'T IGNORE...I need help, there appears to be a glitched achievement and it's driving me insane. I wish not to be intrusive  about it but my Ocd's  preventing me from continuing on thinking I will not be getting the other achievements. It's the Disiplined V, which is the 4000 for the virtues, I unlocked the virtue but not the achievement . I even reset my oasis twice and nothing",
        "Honestly I am quite disgusted at how many 1 star ratings there are. I agree it's boring, HOWEVER, only in some cases. I don't play for fun like I guess what most of the 1 star ratings are for. Its not meant to be played for fun but meant to try to calm down or relieve stress for anyone playing it. If you're playing for the sake of fun then yes it will be boring. DO NOT download this game if you are seeking something to entertain you. It is boring for me when I play like that. However if you play to try to find a way to calm yourself down, say you need something to distract you, it will really work. The game really works for me when I am in a mental breakdown or feeling extremely suicidal. Playing My Oasis in those state of minds has helped me to calm down instead of acting on suicidal thoughts. This game has also helped my older brother when he has a breakdowns as well because of his depression. This game IS a tap game but it is not pointless if you play the game for the reason you're supposed to play it for, which is to relax/calm down.",
        "So, I really enjoyed oasis for a while, at least until they rolled out this new update. One of ly favorite things was unlocking the animals and I had three. The movement was nice.   Now, with the update, you can only have one and choose to upgrade the amount you can have with diamonds. Do you know how irritating it is to have something suddenly locked that you already had unlocked through previous game play? Very.   I don't suspect I'll keep in installed much longer.",
        "I really like this game, but I'm giving it one star until they fix it. I have the auto cumulation for all the traits, but it's about a 30% chance it works. If I don't go in within the 24 hour mark (or I upgrade anything a good amount), it cuts my gains and makes it like I earned nothing. So, love this game, but until the bug is fixed, it's getting 1 star. It's really irritating I need to go through this after also sending them an email on what's going on."

Tried to play for more than five minutes is making the phone first freeze the screen then restart itself. Some cabs never arrive. Need a lot of bugfixes right now. Other than that it is a good game that i like.",
        "For a game so heavily reliant on ads to deliver benefits to the player, it is a gamble sometimes whether or not those ads will crash the game and therefore cost you the prizes. The game itself is all right, but this gamble drags down the experience when it doesn't work.",
        "It's like owning your own transportation service like Uber or Lyft, but in arcade Crazy Taxi meets Monopoly. If you hire drivers to your service, you not only make more money, but you expand your  territory. I love the diversity of the characters, how you have new with the classic arcade characters like Axel, Gus and Gena. And I also love the concept is modern, but has the classic arcade concept and feel with the scratch cards, gems, and money. Bonuses are earned through accomplishing objectives, and of course, ads. Thanks Sega. 👌👍❤",
        "Outstanding game. My only fuss is cars get trapped in some buildings during attempts to retrieve funds. Going back to another stage and returning to the stage I'm engaged in usually resets game play. Otherwise, great game.",
        "It's a chilled game to play. There are a bit too many ads. And it because it is just tapping, it can be a bit boring after a while. It takes long before you get somewhere new. But all by all it's a free easy game to kill time perfectly.",
        "Only game that has not begged for money and really is fun to play if you can keep up with all the fares driver's n cabs. Just try it yourself. It can be addicting if you don't take your eyes from it haha"

It's a free game, and the developer has to make a living. You can pay to get them removed, but they really aren't obtrusive at all.",

        "Nice game but beginner level 45 on Pipe connect does not seem to have a solution. Is this a glitch? I am updating my review. They responded and fixed the issue the next day! Thank you very much!",
        "A good amount of puzzles in one app, but the early stages spam ads. It might be better when you start doing harder puzzles that take more time, but it feels like the ads break the gameplay too often early. Also it asked to rate maybe 3 times in the first 20 minutes I played.",
        "This game at least has some different puzzles then puzzledom has. In fact, some of the puzzles in this one is the same then the ones in puzzledpom. In other words, some puzzles in this one is the same then the ones in puzzledom. This one has some different puzzles and so does puzzledom classic puzzles all in one, if you know what I'm saying. If you don't, that's okay. You  don't have to.",
        "Great time killer and thought provoking. I also like the small animations and effects. This game is enjoyable and has a variety of puzzles to keep you puzzled to help you think of solutions to solve each puzzle. Great job!",
        "I absolutely HATED how often this stupid game asked me to rate it. Give me some time to develop an opinion damn it! ......this game is not stupid. It's really a lot of fun. Hopefully it'll stop pissing me off now that I've left a review.",
        "I adore this game so much, great amount of games, plenty of levels to last forever with a range of levels from begginer to master. Each level has different challenges and although it's simple, it gets more difficult each time.  I adore the graphics and the simple layout so it's not too much in your face and intimidating. I kind of wish there was some sort of music and a different way to delete mistakes because it's so confusing. Pressing the back button leads to the homepage  I'd also say that there should be a different button to find difficulty levels, because I find using an 'X' would say to close the app rather than find the difficulty levels.  Still, one of my favorite apps to use. I will never stop playing it. So well done :)"

        "I love this game. Just like other reviews say, it is addicting and because there are constant tasks to complete. Plus!..unlike other games, there is no way you ruin out of coins/money. The cities bring in alot. I can't agree with one reviewer that megabucks are hard not come by.  I began with 25 I believe (now at 32) and some of the tasks to complete give megabucks without spending actual money to even purchase some.  All in all, try this game and you won't run bored of it.",
        "Great, but really needs \"sell all\" function for dealing with store house and \"pecial buildings\" components.This is a really quality game, looks amazing, works well and has good timed construction projects. However, as others mention it takes SOOOOOOO long to accrue the assets for construction and the mega bucks for expansion. You have to be VERY patient if you are not willing to part with actual cash. An idea might be to offer a conversion of coins to megabuck, maybe get 1 buck in excahge for eg 5,000,000 coins?",
        "Best game!! Very addictive, Been playing this game for over a year.. although, there are still alot to improve!  I hope the developers will include edit mode in the next update so that the players can rearrange their city..Also, I hope they will also include a 360 rotation of the city and add factories that can also create materials needed in the game like the railroad materials and steels. I am looking forward with this updates!!",
        "lnstaII 'VEARN' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won't make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It's also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII 'TOYOCASH' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.",
        "The new update is great! Really appreciate the chat system. But it could be better... maybe add some functionality to the capital buildings and states.... maybe bonuses to taxes nd pop, loans, and coop science and military missions. The prices of capital building materials is ridiculous. Fixing these will make the state system look more complete.",
        "Been playing for more than 3 years, i lost count. But this is a wonderful game which encourages teamwork and neighbor support. There are barely any paywalls in this game and  if you have hundreds of facebook friends who have this game you can easily get the materials you need to expand your city. No limits so far. I give ★★★★★s"

        "I really liked this game when it had only 20 seasons & I uninstalled it after finishing. I again installed it and started from the beginning and after completing 573 games & 1487 stars I am giving you just 2star rating because game lag all the time sometimes the ads got struck or maybe during rewind I lose my $1 but the game didn't rewind back instead crash and auto shutdown and I ahve to start the application again. Before adding 30th season please update your games stability it will be more useful.",
        "Like most other games, there is too much effort to bait you into micro transactions. The older games were so much better. It's a shame the Devs have resorted to such money grabbing standards.",
        "I like the tactic aspect of it, pretty good time waster. Took me a while to beat it, but didn't have to spend a dollar to do it. The story itself is very unrealistic and after 15 seasons I completely stopped following it and focused only on the games.",
        "There should be a full match game like this that isn't scripted. I love it! Should be an energy free mode maybe? As its a bit pay to win\\microtransaction heavy.  They've made some changes, if you like ads and Facebook popping up after everything you do, then this is the game for you, dropped my rating 1 star as a result.  Also took out the ability to watch adverts for in game currency, now you have to pay. Even more of a cash grab now.",
        "Really good game but just wish you didn't always have to go back and start from scratch on certain levels. Oh and maybe make buying the boots and haircuts etc a bit cheaper! Otherwise love it.",
        "Basically a pay to win game. Would be more enjoyable with ads rather than forcing people to wait for 15 minutes to gain less than 1 minute of gameplay as a reward. It's an enjoyable game but not enjoyable enough to pay for."

        "I like this game but there's so much cheating going on. It doesn't resister some of the moves you make or it's lagging and when you smash the minions they should fly away and not stick to the screen for ten seconds so you can't see what's coming next. Just stop cheating! Don't take 20hours to give the necessary tools when doing a double task in the jelly lab.",
        "I have a Xiaomi Redmi 4 mobile with 3 GB RAM, 1.4 GHz Octa Core. Still Game hangs, Speed enhanced with a jerk every time and then it dies. I have reset my mobile and reinstalled it but the problem still there. It's very annoying. Otherwise I love this game. It's very addictive.",
        "I love this kind of games, but this is the most incredible game i've ever played. I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E !!! I don't know & and l don't care what are u think about this game. I'm sure it's perfect for everyone. Any where, any time. I don't know why, but when l play this game l feel like l am the boss who commands to that minion who runs. I see that wonderful worlds and l feel like l'm doing all that job. When I was a little bit small, l was playing this game with my sister and the minion was ower slave. This game is very funny and, like Janise Palmer said, now l realize that l made a huge mistake. I have instaled it back and it's ok. I'm level 10 now.",
        "The game used to be fun, but not anymore.  More than that, after i did a factory reset on my phone, I've reinstalled the game, but surprise... I couldn't sync the game to my Google account. All my progress in game was lost. All the money invested in this game was lost. I have sent them emails, tickets about it but no answer what so ever. The result is ---&gt; uninstall",
        "Really cool. Its just  too WEIRD. And sometimes when I try to Dodge an obstacle it won't do it. And  when the lanes bend its really Hard for me. And why do you Have to watch an ad to get free revives, get some tokens, refill the Battery for the special Mission and to open the green and blue prize pod AND to Double bananas you collect? GREAT GAME I JUST HATE THE ADS.",
        "This game is awesome and funny I guess. I'm trying to think of something to complain about (I love complaining) but I can't!! Oh wait........... You could make things like characters and stuff less expensive. It's  Ike....I go on SHOP and it says stuff like (random minion) 1234 tokens!!  Dats 2many bro!"

        "It was a good game, until new update. The car body now go to scrap and not in the selling list, thus reduced the profit earning. Also in buildings needs to be repaired, materiap required is of huge quantity. Graphics needs to be better. Game play is easier to understand. Also in bank no complete cash statement is available, like complete diamond spend statement is available and not cash one.  Will surely give 5 star after fixing above points",
        "So far, not bad.  Update:  gathered enough parts to repair the university and it won't unlock.  I emailed the developer and haven't heard back.  It is such a cool concept with little to no support or point.  Why gather the materials if we can't use them?  Plus, it took weeks to get the stuff.  Like most cool games, nothing more than a good concept.",
        "You had my attention, and now you have my money. Yes, this is a good game. However, it costs too much real money to advance this game. There are many missing pieces and too much to acquire to be able to progress. Maybe instead of making it so in depth, take it down a notch. Let people use junked cars to fix cars and sell them, if this is already an option make it easier to do so. I think this is a good game just too in depth and not enough give to make it entertaining and fun at this time.",
        "Great time killer... Love it so far and only been playing since yesterday... Already level 11 and got quite a few things however I gave 4 stars because I spent 10 diamonds on the bank which showed the stock market but didn't tell me it was coming soon until I paid for it... I like that this game doesn't make you pay real cash and gives you tokens just to win more cash, diamonds, energy etc so please don't ruin the game in the future and make us pay 2 play =)",
        "The game is over good. It's definitely fun for your car enthusiasts but I am now level 11 and I can't obtain \"glass\" to build any buildings... The game is getting boring because I can't move up, it's pretty much scrap cars and sell parts... I don't want to rate this game too high because I believe it still is a work in progress, but yes it's a good game and I would recommend it",
        "It's a decent concept. Good time killer for a little while. I don't know why all these games take energy. Just let me play the damn game. And the constantly fluctuating prices to sell the parts got old REAL QUICK! Apparently the creators of this game have never been to a salvage yard in their life."

They always happened at the beginning and I hate it. I don't think you should not install it its not fun.",

The only thing is that I was hoping for some sort of introduction to the game, to tell me how to play etc. Also, I was hoping to be able to choose what kind of ball i use, the black one is plain and kind of boring.

        "This is very nice game, but problem is all time it's will show the upgrade the card's.. So do some change.. game and graphic are really good.. but card updation is boring, I will give one opinion please change the updation of card's system....... And energy need to play its taken so much time.. So we are not playing these game for long..... Please change some of these problem.... Except the card updation system and energy systems... The game is really challenging. please improve some changes",
        "All good and I've completed all ur levels in 10days. Now I'm awaiting for ur new levels and one more which I'm surprised is that.. I'm expecting some stories to end it. I've understood so far that there are other side people who are building some thing and they r trying to stop us but I have not understood why these 2 group are fighting and who is the leader in my group and theirs too. U need to make some more realistic stories so that we can take it part of action movie.. Thanks otherwise",
        "This is my most honest review..Never have I ever played a game truly this fantastic where you literally don't have to spend real money if you could wait 4 hrs for every chest. Gameplay is amazing and then there are events which make the experience even more enthralling. Give this piece a go.",
        "Great graphics, good storyline, campaign mode is challenging. It would be better if more scenarios could be added for skirmishes. Overall enjoyed it. I will recommend even for those who don't wish to spend money on games.",
        "It's really very nice game and good missions.The controls are very easy. Actually I don't like shooting games,but after seeing this I really felt awesome and got interested in shooting games."

I only needed the clues for the very last level because I'm familiar with Bart's mind by now. &lt;3 I think it's great that clues are available though and that they don't give everything away right away. It's a big bummer when that happens on other games. Love, your die-hard fan! Please make another one soon!",

And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.",
        "Good, but has some bugs I'm sorry if I'm being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall",
        "It's good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn't too much skill involved but it's a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I've lost countless games because it doesn't stop or doesn't back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!",
        "Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it's a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can't go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I'm out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!",
        "Shalom there, The game is awesome. I liked it very much and hoping that in the future they will be more cars to be added. I really hope that \"military helicopter\" can shoot something, it is funny...so idle. Last thing, a HOVERCRAFT can go \"river mode\" ! Wrecked... because of...water. Hope you'll add the \" police boats \" in next update. Overall, abundant of thanks and good luck.",
        "I LOVE THIS GAME. It just need's some work to do. Like, you guys need to fix the glitch of the lines by the road. And you need to fix when we explode the oil truck and fall on the ground and you disapear. And can u guys please add some new prizes like to change the color of ur car. And when I have 100 dollars u can spend it on colors  theirs a button to choose what prize you want. Like say I get the color blue for a red car. And I like the red car so I go to the prize machins and choose to buy a color than I have the button to change the color of ur car. That will make the game a lot better. And I'm sure when u do it there will be more downloads."

And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.",
        "This is really hard. I can't buy the full game as I am only 9, but I think I am missing out on a lot. Please add check points to normal mode as some levels are basically impossible",
        "This game stress me out but the next day when I play it I beat the lv in one go and fills my heart up with joy! So what if the control's are sensitive? I know they are.. but if you take a day and give it another go you know what happens and you do great!",
        "I love this game just...can you fix one glitch? On the final level final area the wave is bugged ...when I tap it goes down by itself! Can you please fix it? I was trying over 3 hours to make it but I can' t because of the glitch :( Please fix it.",
        "Got all the way to the end,  and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow,  and ended up having to restart all of the levels,  fix this,  it doesn't happen with the other geometry dash games,  just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted...  Fix then 5 stars",
        "When I heard that this was out, I rushed to the Play Store, freed up my storage and installed this app. This is fantastic, as I had been craving for 2.1. I finally have a little sneak peek, although…                                           A) No Spider in main levels (Challenge excused) B) Ads…ugh                                                        C) No Account Loading (2.1 fixed)                                      D) Levels too easy and short                               It’s still great!"

        "Now these days, to be powerful is cards. And it's really sad to see it in one of my favorite fighting game. I have a galaxy s8 plus and when I put the controls on large, it feels like there on medium. If your playing duel and your opponent has 5 power points ahead of you, just call it a lost. Do better. Battlefront 2 is about to be banned in Germany because of the card system. I hope you look into it.  Edited: it's still the same. It feels like a pay to win. I'm going back to shadow fight 2. You know. The good one.",
        "I really like playing the game. It has great animations smooth gameplay and isn't too easy or hard. The one thing I dont like is you can't sell your old equipment or skills. If there was a shop to sell them or add runes to them or be able to combine them to make either new or more powerful ones of the sane type I would give this game 5 stars.hopefully the Devs will take this and add this feature in a update. Speaking of updates, I just installed the latest one it was like 403MB but nothing changed! What was the update for then?",
        "Hey NEKKI i have the best suggestion ever. WHY DON'T YOU add a grab button separately or at least give the option. Also make the side quest more satisfying. Just giving me commons just isn't going to work. Please nerf the herlad faction. 1 its crit chance is to stupidly high 17 percent is to much. Its also so quick and has long range",
        "The game is a lot of fun but there's one big problem the only way to advance in the story mode is by leveling up and getting better armor but the only way to level up is in story mode so your other option is spend real money on better equipment. So it's kinda just a money grab. If that was fixed I'd give it 10 stars",
        "Amazing graphics,  smooth gameplay.  But the biggest problem is upgrading,  why the hell does a common chest need 3 hrs to open?  Do you want us to keep playing or play only around 5 times the whole day?  And only four slots for chests and then 3 hrs to open?",
        "I've been playing this game for a while now off and on again and I realized some things about the \"online\" features. First off, no online game can be paused. In a \"multiplayer\" match u can clearly pause the game if u feel the call of nature, or ur mom is telling u to take the trash out, but U CAN'T PAUSE REAL PEOPLE!!! It doesn't work. Their online matchmaking duels are fake, and I am starting to be very irritated with the game developers."

        "Deleted my gplus page for many reasons! Unfortunately! The only way i can officially save my game progress and be able to back it up? Is to sign in hence the gplus pop up! I'm on the fence. This game is not bad at all.....so far. We'll see! I can't wait too long to decide though! A new series has a time limit, Thanks for that!",
        "why do u keep showing use pictures of cars that have decals and graffiti on them even though we can't put decals or car skins on are car in the mod shop I t even shows on the picture that says tons of customisation with a car with graffiti but no in mod shop there's no decals its just solid colors? :( why? I still like game though I just hope u add that",
        "Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won't reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.",
        "Goog game, adddictive infact. But I don't understand the concept of PATANJALI adds. Whenever i choose to see adds to reduce the waiting time, you comeup with Patanjali adds of 10 and 20 seconds and the irritating part is the time doesn't gets reduced even after watching the whole add. Please fix this. When you say reduce wait time by watching add, you need to actually reduce the waiting time after the add instead of insisting to watch the add again and again.",
        "When I started playing this game I really enjoyed it. But now I realise that in order to progress, you MUST spend REAL money. I am a family man, with a wife and 6 children, I just wanted a game that I could play when kids are in bed and wife is in bath, I don't have cash to spend on games, the worst thing is the 7 Day events, you cannot beat them without spending money. Very disappointed. Good game but don't expect to progress very far if you don't want to spend money."

Not only they ripped off peak games they ripped off the music from Genies and Gems from Jam City. I will uninstall!",

I seriously and kindly request to the developer to restore those sounds which were there in old versions because I seriously loved it. I wish those sounds can come back which makes the game more amazing.   And ofcourse I still continue to play this and have hope for those sounds to be back."

        "Awsome game. Completed all levels without any hack jzt waited  for hope   ( the lives ) evrbdy shld try this. Sry i gonna uninstall this app only bcoz i finished all levels. Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.",
        "The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don't get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new \"enemies\". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you've lost some lives. But that's not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.",
        "I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It's more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.",
        "Remember the old days when platformers taught you through trial and error how to interact with new game mechanics? If you don't like that, you'll hate this game. So much fun, so creative, and once you start to get down one of the new features, it ramps it up and keeps you learning creatively how to beat the level. I love this game, it's a fantastic platformer that will challenge you to learn as you go instead of giving you a tutorial every time something new comes up.",
        "Completed all but just couldn't get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I've ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.",
        "I love this game 😍😍 it is my favourite but.... I don't like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it's a great idea😋😋 btw i loved it 😍😍😍 ill give it 5 stars then😊😊"

Awesome😒 Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don't reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie's handling. You killed it, literally. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.",
        "Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I've never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.",
        "Lost all in app purchases which amounts to stealing. Beware of doing in app purchases. Way to many ads. App also crashes a lot. Support said they would help then didn't respond after that. If my son was able to lose his progress and the money we sunk in the game because he was using multiple devices and didn't know what Cloud and Local meant which cause him to lose his progress then mabe this game shouldn't be labeled E for Everyone. Change the rating to Teen if they have to know what cloud means or risk losing there in app purchases.  Google change the rating on this game.",

This obviously frustrates little man and I'm sure I'm not the only one this has happened to. Other than that, we think it's a great game.",

        "It appears that I have reached a certain point where my free play is being met with bot resistance. I've gained over ten million in one day and lost it all and more in suck outs. This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you'd have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun",
        "Pretty much agree with most if not all the nagative reviews. And thanks to a fellow reviewer am switching to zynga poker. The amount of ads is rediculous. Let me just so no to 6 different ads in a row as soon as i log in. Ill be sure to not contact your \"concierge\" and move on to something better. Maybe an app that actually appriciates feedback.",
        "It would be better if they offered more free chips. Rather than bombarding us Every time we log in with there outrageous prices. Also a flush draw Every other hand and usually someone hits. Barely won a hand since the negative review also. Complete B.S game. I agree with all negative reviews here. 4.5 rating? Haha, most reviews are negative.  Done and done.",
        "Platika...I know you said the game was functioning normally in accordance with the rules. I however have several screen shots proving it is not. I would be happy to send them. Still dont know how the rules would dictate a straight beating a flush? Maybe you can enlighten me?",
        "They don't prey on data mining your phone. First review I was livid about odds not feeling right, I was a baaad player. WSOP is the best coded poker game. It buffers well for each person's delay. Best real play and lots ways for easy chip recovery if you don't want ante up.",
        "Every hand a player is able to run the timer out. It's annoying and makes the game longer than it has to be. If a player let's the timer run out 3 times in a row they should be kicked off the table. Please fix this problem .Other than that cool game"

Even all the member of the house use chinese, brazilian, its better if all language translate according the language we choose in game from the option",
        "A great game and extremely addictive once you really get into it. Well thought out. It can be very time consuming but that is what makes it great. The grind to level up Heroes makes me want to come back and carry on, unlock other heroes and further upgrade my Kingdom. My only issue is the fact that resources are hardly able to be kept. Being under constant attack from other groups and unable to allow my Kingdoms walls to regenerate properly before I am able to move again seems to be a recurring issue and one I do feel needs to be looked at and tweaked. Nonetheless, I'm impressed with the game. Continue with the good updates and this game could be one of the best mobile games out there.",
        "DON'T PLAY THIS GAME.. THEY SCUM PPL!!.. They nothing more then thife..  I purchased hero from shop but didn't receive anything. I even did everything as they discribe in forum and try to contact with dev too but no one respond.. There are lots of player are like me who lost money and many of account disactive for no reason too..THIS GAME IS FULL OF GREEDY &SUCK!!.. ITS HUGE PAY TO WIN.  DON'T INSTALL OR YOU WILL REGRET IT!!",
        "This game is destroyed by money. Every realm has at least one player who spends thousands of dollars and just skews the gameplay away from a fair contest. Wouldn't hesitate to give a 5 if there was a cap on spending",
        "It was fun at first, but impossible to keep up with paying players.  I've tried two different realms and was the same both times. If you're willing and able to cough up thousands of dollars to play a mobile, then this is your game.  Otherwise just pass it on by and find something else.",
        "The game was pretty nice, all the ones who are speaking different kind of language they can as well translate, but there is one problem. I can't edit the message for the clan, i wonder if it is a bug or not. Once i became lord of a clan because a former lord turn me into a lord then he said to me to edit the message of the box. I tried to edit then it cannot edit, pls. fix this problem"

        "Amazing app! My sister broke my old piano 2 years ago and I gave up. When I started thinking that I need to start again in my piano career, I started looking for piano apps that I could play my own music. Unfortunately, a lot of the apps didn't work for me until I came across this one. Just to say thanks for making this great app. :)",
        "This, after 6 years of playing piano has narrowed all my work down to half the size.. I've been a musical genius, and then tragedy struck, and I lost my ability completely half my life... wasted. But this app helped me to relearn how to play. Thank you. Thank you immensely",
        "Fun to noodle around on, but significant delay when using Bluetooth speakers or headphone (since I haven't this issue with other apps I can only surmise it is exclusive to this app) which isn't great considering wireless audio is quickly becoming the standard.",
        "This app is so good! I've never had a piano and wanted to learn but couldn't but I started writing my own songs on this app and it's so good. The graphics are like a real piano and I love the magic tiles and everything about this app!!! ❤❤❤",

        "Enjoyable game. Don't have to spend money on diamonds unless you're after a top look. Best played when linked to FB which means you can borrow from friends' closets. Would rate 5 stars but recently I am having issues opening results in my in box. Every time I receive a result the page opens halfway then I have to exit the game and reload. Playing on an Asus ZenPad, anyone having the same issue or have a solution pls?",
        "I have been playing Covet for 4 yrs every single day! Being in the fashion industry I find it so interesting that the products you dress your models in are real items you can buy in real life. They have a great collection of brands but Im excited to see more.   And contrary to popular belief you dont have to spend a dime to play. My strategy for this is I play the daily challenge with either past seasonal clothes or i borrow from my fashion house. If your vision and outfit is great you will win the free item regardless of whether it is in season or not. By doing this you save $500 a day and i wait till a covet series comes along and play it till my heart and imagination is content.   Take it from a Covet junkie, you will be hooked for years!",
        "This is the best fashion game by far however there are a few small issues. 1) the same people with the highest level of hair and make-up always win more than anyone 2) you need to win more diamonds and money given how much you have to spend on daily challenges and 3) you need a shopping cart option during challenges so you don't have to go back and find the last item you liked.  Its a great game of you can afford to by diamonds with your debit card.",
        "Great pass time and fun to play. For a while I do nothing just for the daily diamonds but I don't mind because the game is just overall fun to play! Maybe it would be better ifyou earned more cash for entering style challenges but... STILL FUN😉",
        "Best game EVER!! I love this game sooo much! The only problem is that you don't get to move on to the next level fast enough. I do hate that so much.And also e everything costs diamonds and u don't get alot of that.  But other than that, good game!! Highly recommended.",
        "Loved the game when I first started to play. Beautiful clothes. Great model looks,  a LOT of fun. Until you get further in. Everything is so expensive and what you get for diamonds in a day is very little. It was disappointing to say the least. I had a few friends who played and could borrow from their closets but none of them play anymore. Probably for the same reason I am about to stop playing myself.Give better incentives and give better prizes and maybe I will play again. Bummed out, the game has great potential"

        "Was an awesome game Very addictive game! Was well done.. until the update. Needs more pens and new themes as I have thousands of coins but nothing left to unlock. Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don't register as pineapple hits for the counters. There's a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it",
        "Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.",
        "Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.",
        "Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.",
        "The games controls,  features,  graphic are really good and can't get your eyes off the screen once dart playing BUT, They are advertising companies that pop up there add moment we open the app... And whenever huge pineapple is on the move these things pop up please patch this immediately.",
        "BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn't have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What's bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I'm not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game."

When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the \"mine\" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it's nicely done!",
        "I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.",
        "Overall the app is really great. It's the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you're not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.",
        "Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it's just my phone. Also I'm not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)",
        "Input delays keep getting me killed. Instead of marking a bomb my input sets it off. I'd prefer two different inputs for marking or removing tiles.  I'm using a stylus too so I know it's not an issue of accidentally hitting the wrong tile.",

Why is it i had completed some of the achievements but it still shows zero progress??i don't know if it is just only me but i really want this to be fix or any solution can the developer suggests. It is a big deal to me since I enjoy playing games with a purpose to achieve something haha btw GREAT GAME!",

What I am trying say is sometimes the game freezes and I am coming upon some glitchey reactions. I would really appreciate if you made the game a little more calm or just review some things you can edit. I would like to keep contact with you. So if you have any suggestions on how you can make the game a little better just let me know. I'm looking forward to some edits here so I hope you can figure something out. I'm not trying to be bossy, I'd just wanted a little arrangement for your game. So just keep working hard on your games. Thank you very much! Okay now I gotta play the game. Bye!",

ITS BEEN COUPLE WEEKS AND NO NEW LEVELS HAVE BEEN ADDED, SO RATING IS NOW GOING DOWN. FIX THIS PLEASE! I love this game but I'm on level 1190 and there is not another level after this. It did this before on a lower level and after a few days there were more levels. I shouldn't have to wait for levels to load up or the game itself reload levels.... my husband is going to catch up to me!!! Fix this please!",

I do suffer from that first race was on Dec 312017 as of Feb 22, 2018 I have 208 hrs on the track 23 in the garage own 22 cars and spent over a Benjamin on it in less than a month. Ya gotta have some smarts to play and win. Money helps with extras. Only time I've had a issue with it was this morning a season ended I was upgrading a Tier 5 car and paid with game money and didn't receive part. Still a 10 star game... Great job Developers!!",
        "Really really addicted. Yes you know when your good. Yes you do.  Ok honest? Expand on the shop.  Tweaking the appearance and performance of the rides.  Everyone has their own way of saying, yes that's how I would if I really could.  You end up creating a bond or developing a relationship  with it.  Take it to the next level!  Gear ratios and n02 pushezes and grip are all good but let's envelop.  I know I would play more if I could truly express my kickass whip that represents  me that I have to drive!  You have a clean and immersive game. Less is more.  Thank you",

Hopefully I don't have many issues in the future but this one time moment has definitely filled me with confidence that in future, zynga will fairly sort things out.",
        "Very cool game with good graphics but beware for this game is based around paying to play. The purchases aren't cheap either. If you're not careful you could find yourself spending hundreds yet still not getting what you need to beat the bosses. So if you're into forking up your hard earned cash by all means enjoy.",
        "Game is really great! Amazing graphics, amazing cars, lots of continuous fun! A few bugs and connection issues which can be frustrating at times especially when your team depends on you for points. Though I believe they'll eventually fix these issues as this is the BEST racing game out there and it's only getting BETTER!",
        "Love the new updates where you can carry on the trials without having to go back to the garage. It would be nice to able to trade up your keys i.e 500 bronze for 10 silver or 100 silver for 1 gold. And the stage 6 upgrades be not double up or get stage 6 upgrades relevant to the cars you have."

        "I have only had this game for a few days, so I can't write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it's up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.",
        "Most awesome wolf simulator game I have ever played! The graphics are absolutely beautiful, and the controls are pretty good. Although getting attacked by several animals at once when you only go for one makes completing missions pretty hard. And you should be able to run from a fight if you're losing, instead of having animals come at you until you're dead. All in all a great game play experience though. I love it!",
        "Man i love this game!!! So much better than wolfquest!!! I do hope tht this game soon be added new things like more animal to play as, better in performance. The ad free guys...keep it up!!! Just wondering if there's a add as mate system in multiplayer in the future? Anyways....this is the best wolf game tht i played!!! Do hope tht you guys one day add more animals to play as (like a snow leopard for example)",
        "Could you add more animals to play as? And a world idea could be a dessert. I love this game, and the others you've made, so I know you will make awesome updates soon! Keep up the good work. If you fixed the glitch were you eat and jump at the same time you fly, if you fixed that can you please put it back. It was fun... XD",
        "Love it but pleeeeeaaaase make it possible to play as a boar or a rabbit or deer. Also I think it would be really nice to have a hunger and thirst bar because there is no real point in drinking. That way if you dont have enough food or water you start to lose health.  Also I don't think we really need stamina from the food we eat.  These are just suggestions but I really really love this game.  Best simulator out there.",
        "It just lags now. The new update made it to where my chat, my character, and my animations won't work. I run about as fast as a turtle, and I am not pregnant. Please fix!!!! I love this game. I have a few questions if you don't mind... Can you guys add in multi-player mode, like single player mode, that we can pick up our pups, it would be cool to add that option in the top left menu. Thank you guys so much!! Love the games!!"

        "I like it a lot but I hate how the drawings are so linked with pokemon go. I hate pokemon go!!!!! The graphics are okay but I wish they were a bit better quality. It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn't like how easy the drawings were and I don't think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn't recommend this game if you don't like colouring. It's ok!!!!",
        "I think there should be more cartoons to draw and color. And it should not always be right colors to trace it in. Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn't color the whole background, because what if you didn't want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!",
        "I love this app! It's sooo good. And its brilliant for when your bored. But its a little hard sometimes to go over the lines with our fingers as the lines are so thin. But overall I think it's a fantastic app!",
        "I love this game but i don't like the characters tho .but it's fine . I like the way you can colour it in and then do the glow pen around it and at the end it looks amazing . You just colour and then press the pencil button ontop of the rubber in the pictures right bottom corner and then do the glow pen thing . Some people may don't know so that's why they don't like it . It's good when your travelling or when your bored . O THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!I like it",
        "It's a great app however it keeps crashing and I have to start the drawing all over again. The whole app stops and my drawing starts over and it's really annoying. If this gets fixed I will definitely rate 5 stars",

I went back to retrieve my guns but it took them out of my inventory and didn't give them back. The third time was today when my friend was trading me some knives. We both accepted the trade and I never got the knives but my friend got everything I put in.(He has Iphone) Can you please fix that in the next update? I would appreciate it if I was able to successfully trade.",
        "One of the best and closest to CS GO games out there. Cant stop playing even if you're poor but getting better is the fun part!",
        "Would like to see the new clutch case added into the game game, but keep improving EDIT: Thanks for adding the clutch case, took me forever to unlock, Keep up the great work again :)",
        "It's simple and it has a lot of depth for a clicker game. The gameplay will be fairly familiar if you have ever played a clicker game and have a basic understanding of how the whole cs:go skin system works. The controls are great, the game runs smoothly and it has never lagged or crashed (for me at least). The adds in the game are put really tastefully, you are never forced to watch them you can only choose to do so for a really slight bonus/advantage. If you really want to you can play the game without watching any adds what so ever. The micro transactions are really minor, they don't give you a huge advantage, they aren't forced on you and you don't need them to get far in the game (unlike most mobile games). The micro transactions are kind of just there for if you want to support the developers. Overall a great game 10/10",
        "The reason I give this a three star IS BECAUSE A DRAGON LORE WAS LOST IN TRADING SO NOW IT'S GONE Edit: nvm I was just being retarded this game is great lol",

        "Amazing addictive game. Try it out! Not too many ads, and just the right amount of challenge without pulling your hair out. Sometimes there's a hidden dot in the title, or ones that are almost the same color as the background, but it's not bad enough to lose a star.",
        "Updated with no fix...  problem still persists.  No exit button and controls for the back button are very wonky. Need to add dedicated exit button or fix what happens when you tap / swipe the blank park of the screen. Trying to bring the controls up from their hidden state selects options is frustrating. You end up starting games. Very unpolished controls, imo.",
        "Cool game, only bad thing is that tutorial levels are rated as bronze so you can never have all gold.. I tried doing the same tutorial three times in a row, then it is counted as gold, but when you exit the game and enter again that it is bronze again",
        "Interesting puzzle type game.  Using rope is a bit challenging on small screens.  It used way too much background data which is not have related at all.  My phone gets hot when using the app.  Uninstalling",
        "Different and fun. Not too hard but still challenging.  Daily challenges are impossible to complete though (bug?) , so don't bother with them (hence my only giving 3 stars)",
        "This right here is a work of genius.  My only wish is for an undo button, for when you accidentally touch a part of the screen and it places a spot/cut/bridge in an unwinnable spot.  Especially annoying during daily challenge that you can't re-do.  Also, I would like to be able to retry any level, such as the daily or randoms, even if it wouldn't \"count\". I'm convinced every so often there is an unwinable level, but you can't even test it or let the devs know because once you fail it goes away permanently.  Still, a great, great game... I really hope there is a V2 some day."

This can be done by a special doctor - dentist. We present to your attention an exciting game for children - a dentist (vet clinic). In this entertaining game, your child is a real dentist, under the guidance of which there is a hospital for animals. The kid is entrusted with a very important and responsible task - the treatment of teeth of his four-footed pups, whose teeth began to ache heavily because of their love for sweets. You have to treat them in a real dental office, use various medical instruments, such as tongs, scalpels, Burmashin and many others, to clean your four-legged friends of teeth from plaque, align them, do operations, remove cavities and fill them. After all, they all just need your help. For her, the animals will be grateful to you and very grateful. Developing games for children, such as a veterinarian, contribute to the overall development of your child.

        "I used to play this game a long time ago with my brother. I thought since after all these years so many new updates have come, the game must feel different. But it's the same. I love the tune that plays as you play it. It's so nostalgic. My brother isn't anymore with me but playing this game makes me really very happy. It's just like I am back in those old days. Specially for me, as it has so many memories, this game is the absolute best.",
        "I have a problem with my account. My punk zombird was maxed out. Level 3. Then when I opened the game, my punk zombird was gone... I obtained that by waiting patiently and gathering 90 diamonds. I had to watch 3 15-30 sec long video for 2 diamonds each. After watching the 3 vids, I had to wait another 8 hours for it to be available again. It took me a month to obtain that bird and then all of a sudden it dissapears?! I obtained it again but I had to start all over again. I uninstalled this app because of that issue.",
        "The game is really addictive. but repeated zombie birds are generated and diamonds are getting wasted. Please change that. One bird one time please. One bird should be at max 3 level not another set. It's wasting my internet to watch video to get diamonds for collecting birds",
        "I personally loved this game. First off,  u cant jump for high periods of time cause u to run into the bombs. Secondly, whats sup with these prices? Thats ridiculous. You cant level up with prices that high and u have to buy 💎 gems and coins just to get a level up... But tum... Very great game overall.",
        "I love this game cause it kills our time when were bored. Yep, we, my mom also is addicted to this game hahaha, shes always getting my phone and play this game whenever im sleeping. Love it, I recommend this game to everyone💖 you'll be definitely love this game. MobiGame you slaaaay hahaha",
        "I was confident to delete the app from my phone cos it says that the game will be saved on my fb acc. But only the highest score remained and the potion got back to 1. I was already at 56! Deym! Ayusin nyo buhay nyo! Sayang effort ko! Aba!"

        "Cute and delightful, the game is well worth some time. It's addictive gameplay is marred by the tap mechanics in so many other games.",
        "The game is alright. What attracted me to this evolution game in particular was how the phoenixes looked. I killed a few hours on this game, and I decided it's not for me. The ads are also way too frequent. I get that you guys have bills to pay, but I literally get an ad each time I go to Mars. There are also a few grammatical errors here and there, as well as an audio error I noticed. When I go to change the colors of my phoenixes and get interrupted by an ad (everytime I might add), the menu music and the main page music overlap each other. This wouldn't be that big of a deal if it didn't happen every single time I opened up that menu. The game itself can get boring after a while as well, so I'd only recommend this game if you have absolutely nothing better to do. Overall, it's an okay game, but it's absolutely swamped with ads and that really kills it for me.",
        "After 2 min in the game my first thought was: wow so nice and simple. No stress.",
        "Compared to other versions of these games i've played, thus one is one of the best. I like the designs better than other versions. Gameplay is the same but that's fine, I don't mind it. Overall good game."

        "A very fun and addictive game. I make bows all day, but it's nice to be able to shoot from my couch at night.  The influence of wind on the arrow is accurate when it comes to drift. A little costly on the upgrades for those that don't buy their way to the top, but all games are that way.",
        "Starts off ok but completely rigged to deplete your coins and to get you to spend money. Bow repairs and inconsistent wind effects among a couple of tactics. Also payed to upgrade my bow and sights and it was gone next time I logged in.",
        "Ok game, but bingo mode is a huge pain.  My shots filled out the opponent's card better than mine.  Stupid way to lose a lot of progress/coins.",
        "Love the game, BUT there's a glitch in chest bow where it locks up for 1 shot, multiple times a day. After you shoot without being able to aim, the bow works normal until the next jam. Looked for a place to submit info for possible fix, BUT game doesn't provide a place for feedback. This is only place to air complaints :(",
        "It's really pathetic that apps like this only allow Facebook login... At least provide Google login too.... Not everyone uses Facebook.... Google should make it mandatory on Google play store apps to provide Google login....",
        "Just started playing a few days ago and never really been good at these style of games  .but this game is very fun and I have already made it to top 70 in my state a lil longer and I'll make my way higher I definitely recommend this game to anyone"

        "This has been my fav gameeee I swear this game you will love, and fun with.Its so easy to play, in the first time I play, i got of a score of, 131 how cool is thattt!!!. I cant even image what the new score would be in the future. I swear DOWNLOAD this game u wont regrett!!!!💕",
        "Its a really great game and I really recommend it! The only problems I had was the controls are a little weird and there a little bit of too much ads but I dont mind it but I'd rather you fix it! Thanks for making me happy! ♡",
        "Really good game to sit and relax but would be good if the balls could go faster than 2x speed. If you have high points then it takes a while for every turn to watch them bounce around.",
        "Downloaded this game just to kill some time. It was fun at first but then once I started to play the challenge mode it would not let me see the whole screen during some challenges. So there is no way to win at the challenges that require you finish in a limited number of moves.",
        "Should be an option to lock targeting  and then fire, many shots were messed up from lifting my fingure at a very slight angle.  Also check points should last longer than once. Making one mistake at lvl 190+ and then having to go back to zero was so frustrating it was the main reason i uninstalled.  Terrible shame honestly, the game could have been really fun and is an original idea"

Really developer?, ya cant wait a tad longer to stop the game and make us stare at a cat puzzle? The worst. I didnt even play it long enough to appteciate the poor controlls. Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.",
        "Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)",
        "I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn't have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it's Definitely Not a game you'd wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!",

And when it comes to Movement just in General....my Main Problem, But NOT the Only Problem was the Movement in Exactness of where I'm Trying to Move my Guy (My/the Shooter) just Stinks!! - The Game itself....I Love It!!!",
        "Good game and all but the pictures shown for the view isn't what it seems, and this game has some flaws, such as inaccurate hitmarkers. When an enemy shoots from behind me, for some reason, it points to the front, I almost died one time, pressed medkits, I got back up, and I couldn't turn the camera for the rest of the game. Also, add the guns that are actually in the pictures... :/",

        "The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I'd like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.",
        "Thanks for new upgrade . Even when the game was slow i didn't stop playing. I love this game. It's not only a game for me...i am a President of my club and i have to lead my members... in less than one year i reached level 50 and almost all land expanded...just  you have to understand how to play... be smart... some advice for beginners  start participate in mayor competition...this way you will grow faster",
        "Great game. But what I miss are written below.   1. Direct search & contact any city.   2. Invite a city to be friend from within game.   3. Direct private message with a city from within Game.   4. Make a city tagged as favourite city or liked city.   5. Want a clean viewing mode of own city without those construction hats and other info symbols on top of  building being constructed.  I think they are massively missed. And if you can provide these facilities then it will be the best game of it's class.",
        "Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It's very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again",
        "I love this game but I want to tell you. You Simcity global HQ building have a problem . And I think all through the world of simcity player face this problem . Your global HQ trade only  View u wanted things like if I want Cement than I searched one HQ building than HQ bulid view me More  And more same thing like burger and sugar and franch FRi and etc things  And few other things like glass and etc I want that the HQ building show one type. Of things like if cement 1 and 2 glass 3 matel 4 cap etc etc than like I want so sir please 😅 try",
        "Game is basic in its features. The worst part of the game is the trade hq. Rather than letting you buy directly off the hq menue you have to load the other players city. If your phone doesnt load it as fast as someone else they can snipe the goods you need to buy."

        "First off, I'd like to say that this game was a great idea. The idea of taking a clicker game and turning it into an esports theme was amazing. However, once I downloaded it, I was flooded with ads. I understand that free games need a way to make money, but this is an example of what NOT to do. Every time you click to open a certain menu, you have a 50% chance of being shown an ad (or at least it felt that way). If there wasn't a crazy amount of ads, then I'd give this game a better rating, but, until ads are regulated, I am leaving a 1 star review and uninstalling.",
        "I really enjoyed this game. The graphic were nice and the controls were clean. But i couldn't go 2 minutes without a ad. It constantly interrupted my tapping and would open the play store. I understand some ads comes with the territory of mobile games, but this was too much. 😔",
        "It was fun but every time I went to do anything an ad popped up. If I was lucky it would be 10-20 seconds but on several occasions I got 1-3 minute ads and it made it really hard to progress. I also was unable to buy the ad thing so I see no more ads. Until that gets put in I'm not playing this game it is fun though but the ads are excessive",
        "I am not a fake reviewer, I'll be honest all the way. This game is one of the best clickers I've ever played. But, be warned. Unless you plan on paying to remove ads, the ads will destroy your desire to play this game. Ads will pop up by just navigating your screens. Not sure yet if buying the cheapest diamonds package will remove ads. But after one more day I might try it.",
        "Runs slow and freezes alot,  way to many ads,  barley get to play more ads then the game it's self and have to spend money to remove ads very very disappointed and very very annoying,  and it's not my phone for I just got this phone 4 days ago.  Reported the issues but I don't think they will fix the problem at least anytime soon.  Very disappointed for I use to love this game I play it 24/7 but I am getting to the point I want to uninstall this game because of the issues I'm having with this game app.",
        "Game was a decent clicker. I couldn't enjoy it for more than two minutes without another awful ad popping up. I am all for watching an ad for bonuses and power ups but I was having ads randomly in the middle of clicking it between screens. Installed it after ten minutes.   They have an \"ad free\" option but when you click it it comes up with an error!"

        "This is a great game... You should play it if you like gymnastics and if you are board,You   should download this game... Is very fun... I liked it... But it still needs a bit more to improve.. I would love it even more if you had more stuff.. And if you didnt had to pay for anything  at all.. Also, please just open the spa and the other stuff you cant get unless you pay!",
        "I downloaded this game for my little sister and the first thing she said was that there are way too many adverts and I agree because whenever she clicked on say the dress up or nail salon or gym and adverts would always come up. The game also lags too much even though she has a brand new IPad. However at this time I would not recommend this game. My sister said that she would play the game again if you reduce and have a limited amount of adverts. As well as the advert problems the game keeps telling me to buy everything and it pops up every time I think when you press the 'X' button it shouldn't show again. Please fix this now. As much as my sister loves this game the adverts really annoy her. Would not recommend this game!!",
        "This is from my daughter, \"I like the game but there's some things about it I kind of don't understand. Some of the controls are a little difficult like the one where you have to tap 1 or tap 2 when she's practicing. And its fun. Some of it I like a lot.\"   This is from me, \"the app is annoying until you buy it. It downloaded a ton of icons (ads for other games) to my picture gallery without informing me. My daughter likes the game a lot and it's fun, but a bit intrusive with the free version. The gameplay is good overall.\"",
        "The main thing I didn't like about it is how little things you can do unless you spend like 10 bucks especially seeing as this is a game that looks like it's targeted towards children $10 is pretty expensive just to be able to play a gymnastics",
        "It's a cool game, it just could be better and maybe there could be some other things in the update. Don't take it seriously! I'm not trying to be mean but maybe there could be some other leotards and the update and some more hair dues because all of those buns and people may not like that's just buns people may want the braids that you always have in your other games. I mean the French braids and they keep going down into a braid, all those things would be nice!",
        "I love the game,but I don't know how to take off the tights or skirts if I don't want them on. The reason I downloaded this app is because I started gymnastics class and I love it and every time after school I get on my phone and play this game and  it makes me want to go to the gym."

It was super fun and interactive at first then it gives you the option to pay to continue to play or to complete free offers to unlock the game for free.  I have found that you can complete as many offers ad you want but the game won't ever unlock and emailing the support web site doesn't do any good either. They don't ever respond and it is a complete waste of time.  Don't waste your time on this game.  Go out and find yourself something worth playing because this surely isn't it.",

After buying you eventually get to the accordion level just before leaving the prison roof only for one (or 2 on some phones) ball being outside the play area which makes the mini game impossible.

        "Definitely a game for car buffs. It requires using your \"mind\" to win. I'm not to sure about my rating yet. But, will definitely change if needed. It's unlike any game I've played & I like it! Someone wrote a review that this is a lazy person's game... LMAØ, I wish they would show me the games they play while they are running, swimming & mountain climbing \"while\" they play, smh HAHA!",
        "First download crashed and wouldn't load. Had to reinstall the game and Hutch games couldn't recover my profile so had to start again from scratch. I've played through several updates and fixes but the same issues remain, car X beats car y when it shouldnt. Hutch in game support agree there is a problem and send to devs but nothing gets fixed. The whole game seems flawed. To be competitive to you will have to spend about £50 a month. I enjoy the premise but the game is poorly executed.",
        "I love the concept and it's been great to see how far this game has come, but I've been playing since beta and nearly every update wipes my save data and forces me to restart. Luckily, I don't get too far into the game each time, but it is frustrating and enough of a buzz kill for me to drop two stars. If there was a cloud system implemented for saves this game would be a five star in my book",
        "This is an amazing game and I think Hutch Games did an amazing job putting the collecting and racing features of the game together. Buying packs is very expensive, but in some ways it is a nice challenge to work hard to get the thrill of opening a pack. I love being able to collect and race so many real cars. For a suggestion however, I think it would add a lot to the game if Hutch Games made it so there was a section where you could put the cars that your keeping only for collecting. It would just be easier to get them away from the cards that your using to race.",
        "Incredible game. Awesome concept. Two complaints to developers. High speed loop-when you win, it starts detracting points. And also certain mph based drag races,I run out of road but the challenging car gets like 60 miles of road. Besides these, fantastic game.",
        "I think this game is amazing! And is perfectly good in every way!! I can't stop playing and look forward to getting new cars. There is just one tiny error that bugs me a bit but I can cope with it. The error is the color of the Ford fiesta xr2. When you race someone else and they have this vehicle on the card the car is black with a tiny red trim on the side but when it's on the track it is completely red. I do hope you can will fix this small mistake but apart from that this game is great!!! Thanks for reading :)"

        "Such a shame. The game is great, really enjoyed the concept however it is a prime example of how monetisation strategy can ruin a game. Gems too difficult to earn without buying them, and purposely easy to accidentally spend them. Too many ads too. I'd rather have paid for the game. Deleted it after a  day or so.",
        "Not What It Used To Be  The second to last update I did for this app switched the aim of the ball to slightly off from where you point it. So now have to compensate (guess a bit) when you're aiming which makes play more challenging.  Likewise, levels beyond about 440 are becoming impossible to beat w/o saving like a weeks with of bonuses to use on each level. Beating one level a week is hardly fun anymore! I may be uninstalling this app soon.",
        "Everything has been great till about 1 month ago when the graph is slowed downed. After you start off there's delays in the line of balls and very unsettling it's not continuous anymore.",
        "Game has so much potential and is a blast. I'm giving it a bad rating because gems are insanely expensive and they have so many buttons to hit to \"use 200 gems to remove 3 lines\" as one example or another to lose 200 by placing the button right above the back button on a phone. Super lame move on devs to intentionally take insanely expensive gems from us by mistake. No confirmation or anything, just boom, gone. Lacks ethics to say the least rinow",
        "Games fine. I refuse to rate a game well when it's annoying ads start pushing political agenda against gun owners. Will go elsewhere",
        "Great game.   But one of the adverts is a virus.   The IG Academy advert wrecked my game and now my phone's being a pain in the ass"

        "Well, I loved the looks of it. Seemed really fun so I downloaded it. Then I spent 30 min downloading the patches, to find out at the very end I didnt have enough space on my phone. Uninstalled as much as I could, and still didn't have enough space... Could have said in details of the game how much space it REALLY takes up... Would have been really nice to know.  -a not so happy consumer",
        "So, far really love to play. I only just started though. The controls are hard but that's probably because I'm playing on a tablet and I got small hands. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to continue playing this. For some reason it makes my tablet terrifyingly hot to the point I'm concerned. I'll hold on to the app for now in case it gets better in the future.",
        "An amazing mmo that really does a great job of handling farming, the game play although has an auto feature still utilizes the controls. The depth of all the items and armor and weapons is awesome. I've been really happy playing this game. The clans are great. The 30 vs 30 opensiege is a nice feature. This game is super fun even for the people that want to play for free. Netmarble does a great job with daily rewards, login bonuses, and events that all allow for players to get great items for free!! Best game I've played in a long while. Only thing is constant crashes and bad story line. The game keeps me turning it back on and I haven't went one day without logging in.",
        "Addicting game with auto-questing and battling. You can choose to do it manually, which I do for boss fights. I don't have to buy anything from the shop, in fact, you get free gear every day! The graphics are amazing for a mobile game with it being an MMO. I have a Note 8, so it does run really well. I play with my monitor using SideSync for full screen awesomeness. There is a lot to do for all types of players, being in a guild doing dungeons reminds me of the old-school MMORPGs of sieging and doing weekly raids.",
        "The game had me hooked as I spent a week trying to find a character and job class I liked. Keep in mind that you will be doing a lot of grinding, but leveling is not surprisingly unreasonable.  There are some aspects that will make you believe you have to pay to win, but it is not necessary. Although it would be cool to help the devs or too. All in all love the game and can't seem to put it down ( I let it auto-grind while I live my life. Haha).",
        "Everything about this game is really good, but since this update today I can't even open the game it keeps closes and sending me to my home screen on my phone... Doesn't give me a error report or any messages just closes the app. Id really like to continue playing please fix . Galaxy S8+"

        "If there is anything that would make me quit playing this game, it would be ads. I don't mind ads but ads are just way too much and take away the fun of this game.  Apart from that game also freezes sometimes and there are some glitches too.",
        "I liked the older versions of this game, but this one is horrible. There's ads constantly, any time you resume playing from the screen going to sleep, or if you wreck there's one right across the middle of the screen!  Every time it connects to the server, it takes whole minutes to load. Sometimes I set my phone down, the screen goes to sleep and then i have to watch another ad! If I was waiting for it to load an ad in the first place, I have to watch that one first, then a second one as punishment for the screen time out. 😒😒 Not cool Loading times plus ad videos constantly, equates to more than time spent playing. It's miserable. LG V20 on Tmo and 100Mbps wifi",
        "Great game. Only after the latest update, it stopped registering my race wins and best times and although I did win many, they're not marked with a star and I can't move any level up.",
        "Really fun game. Lots of levels. Really like tournament and duels. I feel like there's some cheating in the tournaments. When I watch the videos some people seem to not be touching the ground. That's pretty lame. Other than that great game",
        "That's crazy you allow hackers to have the highest score and also show the video. Say that person isn't cheating and I'll show you a video where he shows how he does it. A-hole.",
        "Fun...until you had to beat an opponent to proceed to next level. These opponents are too much of a jump up on the difficulty of that level. So can't pass...no longer fun...uninstalling"

The number of coins needed to continue a level with 5 extra moves is a bit much compared to the number received when you complete the level (300 vs 25-30 or so). I understand, though. It can't be too easy or else it would be boring & nobody would ever spend any $ to advance!😁",

Also there when the tiger got out of his habitat and it's not ment to get out and it destroyed everything I've done and I had to start from the very first level",
        "I love this game. Its great; perfect.... But there are a few errors in this game. In the levels, when I move it to the side I want, it will move to the other side, because of that I have lost in about 5 levels. I hope you fix the errors. It will be really appreciated by me."

        "So I'm changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it's a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I'd rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!",
        "This game is fun but I don't know if it's a bug or they're doing it on purpose but it seems like you can never win the extra challenges they do to win prizes.  I have watched the game say I lost when there's no way the computer opponent could have gotten enough points to be me. I messaged the game creators about it and never got a response. I'm about to uninstall this game.",
        "I have downloaded and uninstalled it and did the same process over again and I still can't play it. It keeps telling me that it needs an active internet connection to play. Well, I can play my other internet based mobile games and I am writing this review from the same mobile device and everything else that requires internet is working so it is a fault in the game itself. It's a shame because I really wanted to play this but now I am going to uninstall it and not bother with it again because it is frustrating me. If the issue gets fixed somehow then I may think about playing it.",
        "GAME CODE reveals ROLLS ARE NOT RANDOM - they're pulled from a table of predertirmined outcomes, designed to MILK YOU FOR MONEY at a set rate, based on PvP, reg. Game, Event, Boss, etc.  Just like slot machines & video poker (which i programme).  You must 'assemble' high scoring games, like a puzzle, with majority of yahtzees sitting after 4 or 8 rolls (1 or 7 bonus 'dice'(money) spent)... Like a choose your own adventure book that can cost Hundreds of Dollars.",
        "I'll give this game more than one star once the showdowns are less about the computer clearing and more about real challenge.  Once you start a showdown the computer conveniently never gets a bad roll.  Which wouldn't be a big deal except you have to wait to challenge them again unless you want to pay for extra dice which is used to unlock everything else.  Kinda cheap.",
        "Why am I losing over half of my games? This has happened twice! I have to forfeit several games and when I do all the people start a new game with me. Sorta suspicious. The game has been lagging and freezing also. Otherwise it's a great time passer!"

        "So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn't find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren't extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don't know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I'm not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.",
        "Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it's not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I've survived 24 nights but I don't even have the achievements for\"survive 5 nights\". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don't because some of the zombie achievements I'm not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I'm currently at 59. GG!",
        "Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh",
        "I wish there were more commands. Like maybe you could command the miners to garrison while the rest of the troops guard. Also, redesign the swordwrath helmet. It looks like someone spray painted their hair gold and then glued jewels on it. I also wish there could be more types of zombies. The idea of endless is cool but please add the zombies to the campaign.",
        "It's nice how you've mashed together Stick War and Stick Empires together to make this masterpiece. I know its only meant to be a remake of the original Stick War, so I shouldn't expect too much updates, but it would be cool if there was multiplayer on Legacy. Keep the games coming!!!",
        "This is one of the most awesome game of all time and thanks to the creators you can play it on mobile too. But it still lack some awesome components, 1. Add Chaos Empire, 2. Add multiplayer!!! Overall still AWESOME!!!"

        "I really enjoyed the game when I could play it. It took a very long time for the game to load, and a lot of the time it would freeze at 32% or freeze in the middle of me playing the game. Please fix the glitches and it will be my favorite game.",
        "Login bonuses gone? Great job guys. PVP too punishing now. Win a game it's +50pts, lose a game -50pts when it used to be -35. Now your effort is meaningless. Take it from me, don't spend your money here, it won't pay off.",
        "It was fun for a while, but you never get mythical cards. There is no player trading. This game could have been one of the best but they didn't put alot into it. Unless you got alot of money your not going to get the best cards.",
        "Fun game, but only loads half the time. It can load in a few seconds, few minutes, or not at all. No way to tell how it'll feel today. I've paid money for daily rewards. I can't login to the game again. Thanks daily rewards that I paid for are wasted. Seriously?"

        "This game is perfect for anyone who loves magic, fantasy, collecting, and a whole new level of adorable! Dragonvale takes everything to the next level! I highly recommend it, as it is a amazing game, my most played, and I hope everyone else enjoys it just as much as I do. Five stars! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Edit 2: I was re-organizing my islands by Element the other day, and I had just finished the Plant Island. I put down a Oversized Oak Tree, and immediately, a image flashed through my mind: a young girl, sitting on a branch of the oak tree, a book in one hand, a baby Plant dragon sitting next to her. Stretched out in front of them was my Plant Island, the dragons freely soaring, the other islands in the distance. And that sparked a inspiration in my head. I just wanted to ask; can I write a Dragonvale book, which takes place at my park? Please let me know !  :)",
        "Cmon Backflip! Okay look I love Dragonvale, I've been playing it forever. First off I lost my amazing park a while back and that really sucked. But now I am restarting and I go to buy the beginners pack for 9.99 and it says there was an error and i wont be charged...come to find out it did charge me and i didnt receive anything! Please help",
        "I have been playing for a while. After events you get a day to turn in your event specific currency for the prizes, even though the event has ended. Well for Gardenia's event, it turned in all my roses before I could exchange them. I had over 25,000 and was so pumped to get the new dragons. Now I don't have any roses and 25,000,000 extra coins i don't need. Please help. This is a very frustrating bug.",
        "I really love collecting all of the dragons and the fact that you can theme/decorate your park too. But the amount of types of decorations are unbalanced, the majority that you can currently buy in the market are just plant and earth type while there are very few decorations of the other types (such as air, cold, etc).",
        "When I first had it it was super fun. Then I saw a game I wanted so I deleted it I did that before and got it back I could log into facebook and go to my old island. But this time I could not. I was so far and looking forward to seeimg my dragons but it did not let me go to my old island. It left me im tears that I had to do what I did all over again. So I deleted this stupid game and gave this. If I could rate 0 I would",
        "its ok, and you might think you cant li e without it, but trust me.... after a while year of playing, which is what i have waited to wrote this review, the game play becomes very repetitive. sure try it out, its fun, but not something for the rest of your life. dont put money into it, you will regret ir later."

        "Great app. Would really like a tab of all the puzzles you've completed in one place. Please add!! That would be great! Unfortunately last 2 times I've started a puzzle it doesn't save my progress. I've gotten to 80% and 40% complete on the same puzzles & it didn't save my progress. Had to restart the same puzzle twice now. I haven't started a new puzzle since. Don't want to waste my time redoing puzzles I've already done just because my progress wasn't saved. Very frustrating. Before this it was a great app!",
        "You guys did a wonderful job on this game. The only thing I don't like is how expensive it is to unlock everything. But I'll settle for the 5 dollar make my own jigsaw puzzles out of my own pictures. And I'll add in closing the pictures you already have available is excellent! Keep up the good work!",
        "Since the latest update game keeps freezing up so have to uninstall and reinstall constantly. Or an ad pops up freezes game and same thing. Also points I've earned keep disappearing. It will say 3 when I open the game. Play 1 game and go back to select another and it says I have 0 points when it should say 2. This happens way too often. I love this game but very frustrated with it right now. I love the pictures, ther game layout, ease of play and all the options. Please fix these problems. Thanks!!",
        "The game is great, I love the tools it gives you like being able to see a ghost image of the finished puzzle.  BUT the advertisements make it lag so bad I have to turn my phone to airplain mode.",
        "It's fun and addictive. However, lately I've been getting flashing after working on a puzzle for a few minutes and have to shut it down it's so distracting. Also, lately the ads go in a loop; after watching the video, it goes to the game to add, then back and forth, endlessly sometimes.",
        "Since the new update I am unable to play.  It will not load a puzzle, just gives a message that puzzle has stopped, do you want to report.  Unable to report."

With that said, the biggest downside, IMO, is that rewards are few, & far between, and there is no way to get gold bars without paying for them.  These become rather needed the further you get and for certain individual, and more difficult, \"puzzles\".  It can become too expensive to play (if one really want to get somewhere in this game).",

This completely ruins all the hard work I did getting my board state the way it was, and makes it impossible to recover. I'm playing up to the 16K range, and it has these issues usually after I've gotten the 4K blocks. 2/6/2018",

When i was building on that high score, the screen glitched and swiped a number of times, ruining the order of the numbers. This has happened on multiple occasions only in this app. It's not such a big problem for people that are newer, but when you've got big numbers, such as 8192, it makes the game unplayable.",

I would assume that they have been \"hacked\" somehow to display these fake scores.  The developer should cap the high score at the number that is literally the highest possible score (based on the size of the board)"

Since playing the game more I've decided that there's not enough gas for me to be able to enjoy the game like I want to. I think the car should either hold more, or gas should be easier to get. This is just a game that already has inconsistencies with reality. Otherwise I love the game",

Lots of chances to save up radios for hero calls and love the different types of game especially the guild.  Haven't spent a penny on it and don't think you need to if you have a little patience and use your resources wisely.",

It started out as a really awesome game until I found out that the developers only care about getting your money and after they get your money they don't give you what you paid for and you spend a week fighting with the developers to get what you purchase. After you get to a certain level in the game you can either buy the gems so you can continue your progress or stay stuck where you are. I am uninstalling this game and I suggest that you don't waste your time with this game.",

Theres so many Heroic dragons and legendaries that are level 30+, and now they all use the right \"hits\" everytime, and when you don't have any \"good\" dragons, it is very hard to win. Previous battle system was rly good, when those dragons used random hits.",

        "The AI spam SO much! All they do is throw a suriken at you till you die. They won't even let you get up! 2 hits and I die yet I hit them like 10 times! There should be unlimited energy who wants to spend $20 for unlimited energy. Plus the controls are trash.",
        "Such a bad game. Nekki never gets enough of money so they show ads nearly after every fight. You can't earn gems from watching videos as it's never available. Tapjoy offers have been completed, but never awarded. All the weapons gets worser as you level up. Nekki wants you to BUY the good weapons. Bad game. Shadow fight 3 is worser than this one.",
        "Great game, my only problem is that it took a long time grinding for the money you need to buy items. It took me about 5 hours of grinding just to upgrade each weapon/armor, 6 hours to buy new ones. Still a great game, loved the way it's in shadows, making it harder to tell who you are.",
        "Let me just say I don't mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high",
        "The game crashes unexpectedly even in the middle of a fight and when I return the energy I used for the fight when it crashed is already consumed when I didn't even finish it.  It evwn crashes in the middle of a raid =(    The game is good but I hope the crashing is fixed. I restart my phone and it works smoothly after that but I can't have my phone restartung every time I want to play. Please fix this",
        "This game is requires you to spend cash if you wanna get strong or atleast equivalent to the game difficulty scaling. It requires spending more gold or gems rather than actual skills with over priced weapons and gears. The controls are not sensitive and clunky. Overall. Could have been a great game but greedy developers."

        "This a great game all around. The controls are tight and the gameplay is fast paced, and the music  and art style are both incredible.  All that being said, the best part about this game is the narrative. I can't remember the last time I played a mobile game that told an actual story. Data Wing really goes above and beyond to deliver a full fledged experience for the player.  Thanks Dan! You've set the bar high for the rest of the mobile  gaming community and I can't wait to see what you've got in store.",
        "This game is ingenious and amazing, and the script is beautiful and gameplay is simple and straightforward, timeless, and fun, with increasing difficulty, but also, able to go back and compete against yourself for more Rewards. The user interface is spot-on, and the graphics are perfect. They scale well to any resolution and any aspect ratio, taking up the entire screen without any letterboxing. The actual gameplay is simply a 2 button gameplay, left and right, and yet, this game kept me busy for hours. It's addicting, but doesn't require you to consistently visit the app. It does not nag you in any way.  I have not seen a single advertisement, and the developer does not have any big paywall or reward system for paying. You will not need to spend any money on this.",
        "I think it is a good idea done well. I havent had any problems so far and the game os more than i expected. I thought the game would just be full of mindless levels but it is not. It even has a cool story and i cant wait to see how it plays out. There ia a cool mechanic wherd you get a speed boost the closer you are to the walls. I really enjoyed the game and i think it deserves 5 stars. This is the only mobile game i loved so much i actually made a review for.",
        "This is the best game ever, that I have ever played 1. I loved the story (You will know what I mean when you have played) 2. The controls are very strange and frustrate some people. But I think that's what make the game challenging 3. THE MUSIC. I loved the choices they have made with the music. It's really good love it 4. The graphics are really good couldn't ask for more 5. Really like the secrets   PS. Would like if you could at some kind of multiplayer when you have beaten the game  - Love Ln'TCore",
        "Vey cool! Haven't finished it yet, though. The only thing that would make this better would be if the controls were a little bit better and more responsive  (which I know is hard to do on mobile or tablets), and some of the levels are nearly impossible  (at least for me). Nonetheless, I like it! Keep it up with the good work!",
        "Saw this before and saw 4.9 out of 5 with over 80,000 reviews. That's... unheard of on the store. So I came back to try it out. Completely worth it. Gameplay is flawless, visuals are gorgeously retro and vaporwave, the soundtrack is all retrowave from various artists, and the story is really good too. It's not often I rate games, and even then I'm not excited when writing them. For this one I can't praise this game enough. Perfect retro-styled racing gem on Google Play."

Frustrated at looking for bizarre words that are not even English? Struggled with grids that are inappropriate for your device or difficult to read? Word Search Ultimate solves all these problems. You can configure:1) Grid size    Specify exactly how many columns and rows to use (from 3 to 20). Even non square grids (e.g. 12x15) are possible.2) Screen layout    Choose how much screen space for the grid and how much for the word list, using our unique movable split bar.3) Difficulty of the game    Specify approximate proportion of words that are written diagonally, backwards or vertically (e.g. allow no diagonal or backwards words, ideal for introducing children to Word Search).4) Difficulty of the words    Specify the size of the dictionary to generate a game, from the 500 most common words (good for kids and language students), up to 80,000 words.5) Maximum # of words    Choose the maximum number of words to find in one game, from 1 to 150. This will provide enough words to fill a 20x20 grid.6) Minimum & Maximum word length    This helps avoid searching for many small words (a common problem in word apps). Also useful for specifying really difficult games (e.g. set both minimum and maximum word length to three).7) Highlighting    Mark the already found words, or keep the grid unmarked and easy to read.8) Word list layout    The word list can be arranged in columns for easy reading, or close to each other to minimize screen space.9) Language    Choose the language of the word list, from a large range of downloadable dictionaries.  24 languages are currently available (see below).10) Orientation    Can be played in portrait or landscape mode. Just rotate your device and the display adjusts automatically.11) Word categories    Choose the words to find from a range of categories; e.g. animals, food etc.This app gives you the ultimate power to play the game just the way you want.Each game is assigned a difficulty level from 0 (easy) to 9 (very hard). The difficulty level is determined by the settings. Each difficulty level maintains the high scores (measured by fastest time to complete the game). The game displays the best 20 scores for each difficulty level.Compare your high scores with others around the world by using Google Play's \"Game Services\".Other features unique to this app:1) Two methods of selecting words: (i) the classic swipe (ii) by touching the first and last letter of the word from the grid.2) Game aid if you are having difficulty. You can choose to reveal a word that you cannot find.3) View the definition of the word from an online source (e.g. Wiktionary), optimized for viewing on a small screen.4) When you play with a word list in a foreign language, the word definition will (where possible) be in your own language. This is great for language learning!Additional Features planned for a future version of this app:1) Blind mode.  The word list is hidden. Instead you must find the words within the grid.

        "I absolutely love love LOVE this game. Im no bot i swear. This game is so addictive. Gameplay is great. A few suggestions however. Sometimes i find my \"sword\" just going right through some fish, and it doesnt kill them. Also, maybe switch up some ways to get Stars. I find myself saving so much to get the 99k sword fish and never buy any other fishes. I feel like the players should work their way up slowly and not have to play with only the \"daily reward\" fishes. Just my suggestion  Thank you guys!",
        "You guys have so much potential and you can do allot I know it! Dab on the HATERS (even though there hating you because they can't make a game and hate ads) but one thing WHY IS ALL CHARACTERS 99.99$ I know other games do it but still lower price and I will rate 5",
        "Great game, good servers, rarely any lag, and addicting. However, the price for characters is pretty steep, their not even worth buying since you'll get better daily characters by the time you have enough stars to buy a good character. Save up for the end game characters. Also, the left joystick is fairly close to the edge of the screen and makes it a little hard to stay on the screen. You get use to it after a while but it would be nice to have other control setups or custom controls.",
        "Great game. Just the spawns on Kill the King and stuff suck since people can spawn right in you. Also, it is kinda rigged when you have the default fish vs someone with one of the best ones.",
        "Great game, its so addicting!  But there is only 1 problem, theres so much lag. Pls fix!! :)",
        "It's a great game but crashes every 5 minutes and this really upsets me sometimes when I'm on a spree😖, please fix this"

        "I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.",
        "I really, really love this game, but, I keep losing my ball count and I don't understand why this is happening. For instance, I have 90 balls and I'm supposed to have 92, I don't get the 92. I will give 5 stars until the bug is fixed. The ads I don't care about because that only happens at the end of each game which is ok. Please fix this so I can give you 5 stars.  Update- I figured out why I keep losing my count with my balls. Everytime I get the balls by the number blocks, it wouldn't count them😐 I could get a lot further if this was fixed. If this keeps on happening, I'm going to uninstall this game. I hope it doesn't come to that because I really love this game. Please fix asap!!",
        "If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.",
        "It's good at first but you'll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.",
        "Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I'm not spoiling it, but I will tell you it's a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don't know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.",
        "Both my husband and I have this game.  I opted to pay for the no ads though, he did not.  DO NOT do this!  He is able to get \"continues\" for watching adds and can keep climbing up the levels.  I cannot since I purchased no adds.  I get to continue once and that's all since I have stopped ads from allowing me to get the extra chances.  I wish I would have known this beforehand. Otherwise, this game is seriously fun and addicting."

        "Alright if you like ads more than gameplay. Stuck with 30 second ads after 20 secs of play. Don't mind some ads, but this is overkill. Pass.",
        "Edit: Ruined it because if the ads. I understand why you have them, but I was willing to watch them IF I felt like doing another round or not. Having the choice to watch one or not was nice. Now you're just forced to after death. Sorry, that's never a good idea. And no, save your copy pasted response, I don't want it. It's not genuine, and it's just a plead for us to buy the ad removal thing.  Original: The core gameplay loop is cool. It's fun, I'll keep booting it up. But it would benefit greatly by a better tutorial. As someone else said before, the ball tends to fly off and lose momentum in ways I can't seem to figure out. Might be a failing on my part, but at times it feels like gravity changes the rules at random and I'm left floating hopelessly as the void swallows me up. I'm not really sure what the optimal way to survive is",
        "It's a great game, for users complaining about ads, it's called ad blocker. When devs force a billion ads and make it unplayable, I use adaway, game is great after, but without adaway, don't bother!",
        "The game itself is a lot of fun, it's challenging and addictive but with ads this game is a nightmare, they massively hinder your ability to progress and learn the game which is very frustrating. I made the in app purchase to remove the ads and without them the game is flawless. I think if the ads were reworked to be slightly less regular (i.e. not every time you lose) more people would be able to appreciate the game and might be more inclined to make the in aop purchase to remove them rather than getting annoyed at them before they've had a chance to enjoy the game."

I like this game because you can do roleplay and I'm a girl and there is girl skins which is amazing but can you start with a girl skin and a boy skin to be fair with the girls  Pls do these. Love your company :-) but can you add a roleplay mode that would be great DO MORE:-) but now on my new tablet it won't let me play it please fix that and reply",
        "Good. However, the apple versioned platform overwhelms us by many advantages: They can earn coins and cash quicker n easier. They get options on what currency they use to purchase things. They get to higher leagues easier. Their weapon description overpasses ours as ours literally gives us damage and capacity whereas theirs comes with fire rate, trait etc.",
        "I love this game but I have a couple of requests 1st. Could you add u YouTuber skin back like boy,girl,animal then YouTuber 2nd. Could you add a button that you can press that alows you to make your own custom paint job for any vehicle that would be amazing 3rd. Can you make and road that ends come back into the city at the other side example the road behind the hospital 4th. Could add like 5 houses around the city that you can go into 5th. More vehicles   If you agree with what I have sead in this comment like so the developer can see!",
        "I love this game. But for the next update, u should give each skin there own special ability. Like the flash and hulk skins. Give the flash super speed, give hulk super strength and etc. So that everyone can get a different type of advantage. Plz make this happen next update also make a goku skin. So u can turn super saiyan. And have other transformation. So can u plz have every skin to have different abilities that match the skin",
        "I have been playing the game for 6 or 5 years and it has been the best game i have played. So, i  think you have to make this game better in the next update.Here r my suggestions 1 make the graphics better. 2 day and night shift. 3police attacks bandit in adventure mode.4 add a clan.  I hope u will add these in the next update.Also too many players that hacked their health so plz fix it.Thx",
        "This Game Is Awesome Ilove It Somuch I could Play it With My friends Keep It Up I think That You Should Add some New Weapons Like Lightsaber And You Should Make The People Drive Cars .Why  Peoples Does Not Drive Car?. Well But thats not good make the people drive thanks Keep It Up."

        "After using it for more 2 weeks here is my review;  This is a great time killer and addictive too. Nice collections of tools, items, etc. But when we tried to play using wifi this lagged like anything. Dead slow and we had no fun of playing and competing. The developer may look into this or give us any guidance for smooth 1vs1 play via wifi.",
        "I just started playing this game and I don't think it's live matches. The opponents have ai style movements. I'd like to play against other players in the matches. I've been crushing the ai and want to try real people. But all in all it is very fun. Best badminton game I've played yet. And most realistic too. I've played badminton for about 15 years so it's nice to finally find a good badminton game.",
        "It lags everytime we use the multiplayer and the developer needs to look on the Bluetooth connection as well. Super lag. :( please update this coz I love this game a lot!  Update:  Wow! Thanks for giving me heads up! I seriously appreciate for looking into this. :) keep up the good work!",
        "decent minimalist animation, so game is smooth since u are against ai/bot. pretty much wont lose, when u have unlock all item and stats. need an update for tournament against real player. and additional moves or trick to create a bit complexity and thrill to the game. if u like something easy and relaxing this is the game.",
        "Game was too easy. 99.4% winrate and just passed 6500 trophies. I was expecting more but unlocking elite level tournament was all. Even after winning elite tournament nothing happened. Its a bottomless pit, there is no more progression after reaching 6500 trophies and winning elite level. Basic games nowadays have at least a multiplayer mode with leaderboard for trophies. That would be a big game changer for this but for now, no purpose in this game at all"

Maybe every 40 levels add a mill purchase option. When selling on the market, we need an option for a blind add or a neighborhood only sell or trade.. make these upgrades and so far game would be perfect!",
        "It's great to be able to buy from other farms in theory. But there are WAY too many times that you click on something and it's either sold or not even in the roadside stand at all. The for sale paper needs to update quicker.  Also, it's very hard to accumulate any 'west bucks' in this game and you need them to do almost anything, so the game is a big money suck too. I'm deleting it.",
        "I love these type of games just like hayday. I have noticed it freezes and takes ages to load the newspaper. Also would be helpful if it could tell you who needs help in the newspaper would help filling orders quicker. Also I have noticed alot of people selling the same parts and harder to get others and it's extremely rare to get the land parts without paying",
        "The game doesnt give enough case vs things to buy or fix.  Also have issues with getting product into the alloted spaces.  I thought it was my screen but had it cleaned thoroughly and it still happens.  It takes several attempts!!!  The story is cute.  The graphics are cute as well.  Ive noticed it has a couple of choices from other games Ive played on older phones. I would suggest the game to others but get the issues fixed and itll be a 5star game.",
        "I love playing these games. I'm not sure why we are rating gameplay they offer apps not a game. It's crazy how they ask us to rate game at the beginning of game. We haven't learned the bad points. This game makes us pay for treasure chest instead of giving us to them free like most games. Which means we have to pay for everything. Totally not fair. Takes the fun out of game.",
        "Was totally looking forward to playing this game, the graphics were so cute that I couldnt help but download, but I havent even gotten past the tutorial and its frozen? The game started panning to the billboard right after you sell your first visitor the cream and then it just froze and now it won't let me continue on."

        "If you don't continue to buy skills or bags in the game they will cheat you and make you lose. But constantly asking me to buy something is annoying. Also, good graphics but control are not good enough. It malfunctions and player with bad connection has advantage and wins game and money.  That's problematic.",
        "Well... sometimes when I play some people I think mite be hacking the game or cheating. they don't miss one shot and I make none or sometimes one or two, that is the only down side but other than that it's a good game (suggesten have people by gold or game coins with the money in the game)",
        "The game would be better if you could do anything with the cash you win besides just play in different courts.  Making the player use gold bars for EVERYthing is lame.  I'd rather watch an occasional add and be able to buy cool gear with my cash..",
        "The new bags won after a win are meant to get you to spend real money to open them up quicker by using gold. It's so obvious a money grab for mini games, it's sad. Also, the more real money you pay to get a better in game basketball, the more skills you'll have to beat anyone. That's why so many people scream about cheaters. There aren't any cheaters, just those who paid real money to pad the pockets of miniclip and make the game a true pay-to-win clustermuck.",
        "Rigged,when you have clearly beaten the block attempt in challenge mode,your shot gets blocked or when you make a move the opponent steals,when you try the same it doesn't work. Fix this then the game would be better.",
        "I liked the game more personally before the recent update. I have a newer phone & since game play mostly in shooting basket race is glitchy, along with buying things on the app, I hate that you can only have room for so many bags it makes it me want to stop playing after a bit. I can see waiting 15 min, 30, 45min, maybe an hour but not up to 12 hours. I used to like being able to buy the standard bag for old gold bar gave me something to look forward too if I won gold in a match."

        "It started great and I was so looking forward to exploring all the rooms in the mansion. Unfortunately, after a short period of good progress it started putting in lots of delaying features: Read a letter, meet the neighbors, give the neighbors tea, read a book, look for another book. At this rate I'll never get to see another room. So now that I reached the level where I would have to pay them if I want to win any more games, I'm just going to uninstall.",
        "I really like the game but some of the tasks are so annoying (take a nap, read letter, open book and stuff like this). Still playing it and still enjoying it. Will suggest more options for the furniture and definitely options if we don't want to put some of the things, to can take it away. Because the game is obligating us to put things yes or yes even if you don't want it. So for me would be nice to have the option for \"new\" one or \"take it away\".",
        "I have not been able to play for 3 days now. Everytime I log on I can not click the play button even after I go into the app and force stop. It is hard to level up and the power ups don't always work. I have also lost items after winning them. I do not recommend this game sadly because I did find it fun at first.",
        "I really like this game.  I would give it five stars if you change a couple of things.  We should be able to create our own character,  there should be a player code that we could type in to go to a friends mansion.  But other than those things this is a great game that is a lot of fun for all ages!",
        "Haven't been able to log in to play for two days now. It's like the game is stuck. I've tried to force stop, restart my phone. Nothing works. I'd hate to uninstall because I've put a lot into this game. Please help!!",
        "Finally found a game I enjoy  so I thought.  I like each level is competitive until you get to levels that are impossible.  Like an idiot spent real money for extras guess what still stuck at same level, has been over a week same level.  Just another game will be deleted."

        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info.",
        "Great way to spend down time at work or at home. Really enjoy playing as characters from both light and dark side teaming up and defeating others. It does take awhile to get charcters leveled up. However can spend some money if you don't want to grind. However I find it rewarding grinding each day to get what i want.",
        "Good game but be warned to really get any good characters you're either going to have to pay lots of real money or you'll find yourself grinding forever the same nodes to upgrade the characters that you have. With that said this game is a big improvement over heroes of dragon age of which in many ways this game is modeled after . It seems very clear that some of the devs from that game migrated to this game to start it up. The last update at 02-26-18 freezes at loading screen and then force closes come on devs get on this!"

You can't do that. but, I still think that this game is very cool!!!! I give this game a 5 star even though my review is about the 3d camera.",
        "Happy, then let down. I loved the app. It's exactly like minecraft. However, After about an hour of game play it kept freezing up every 5 minutes or so. Every time it froze up I would have to exit to my home screen then re-enter.",
        "It's gr8 and all, but there are some things that I want. First is crouching, it's impossible to build bridges if I'm always falling, Second is sound FX, for me it's too quiet and the fact of footsteps and moos and oinks and clucks is very good. Last IS everyone's game enemy, ADS, ads pop up in a few seconds and when building my first house you can forget what part you were on. PLEASE ADD OR FIX THESE THINGS!!!",
        "It's very good I play this game a lot 10 out of 10 well done. It will be better if u add skins to it well Done thumbs up for u",

        "I've been playing this game for only a total of 10 minutes, but so far, it has been enjoyable. The game delivers on exactly what it presents to be. It is a crisp, clean, smooth running, first person target shooting game. It is simple in design and very easy to play. Touch your screen, drag to aim, align your sight on target, and release to fire. The sound of the rifle firing is very enjoyable, as are the \"hit target\" sounds, the reward/level up music, and the \"successful stage\" jingles. If my opinion changes after further examination, I will be certain to edit this review accordingly.",
        "Lots of fun. Simple yet difficult to master. I play everyday. I like the variety of targets. Purchasing option doesnt work. I tried to buy $4.99 of coins in the app. It took my money  but it never added the coins to my score. Google Play credited the amount back to me. Good app overall.",
        "This Is A Good/Fun Game To Play If You Are Bored. I Just Downloaded It A Few Minutes And I'm Already Up In Ranks. I Love Arcery And Guns. This Game Puts Both Of Them Together That's Good For Me. I Rated This Game A Full 5☆",
        "It is about slowly balancing your gun to release and take the shot within a set time limit but not quite as easy when you actually try. This makes it a challenge to perfect hand eye coordination so that makes for a good game.",
        "This Game was very exiting and relaxing  and spend time with shooting king with archers I like Guns  and the bullet was very Big and the level is 100000 I think I will pay every day First higher stakes multiplayer and it appeared with the opponent cheated the time ran out from the shoot but the Game was froze. But the Game was very interesting and exiting I like shooting very much",
        "First higher stakes multiplayer and it appeared that the opponent cheated. The time ran out for them to shoot but the game then froze. I was able to change guns, sent emotes, etc. and I was connected to a stable internet connection. I waited 20 minutes until finally sending the game yo the background so I could google if it was a cheat. Low behold I instantly lost all of my coins. Dont waste your time with this game, poorly made and cheaters will take all of your coins in multiplayer."

        "Very easy, boring and full of unskippable ads for no reward. Not a very clever game as some have suggested, this gives the player no sense of accomplishment nor any legitimate challenge unless you do not speak English.",
        "Well guys.. I just broke the game 😂 it was the 'HEADLIGHT' puzzle where I got stuck. I requested for a hint and I accidentally tapped out the E in it and now it's completely gone. There's no letter E no more in there. You should check this out. (So I requested a hint twice, went wrong on the word and then tapped E, and poof, it's gone) and maybe you should make a reset puzzle button for situations like this. 😃",
        "Such stupid examples for words! We can't actually think it could be something like that. There is no relevance in pictures & answers. Guys, I request you to NOT download this. You'll definitely get irritated in less than five minutes!",
        "Just got really boring. In a group of 10 puzzles there was; 1 that was a clever brain teaser, about 7 that were just way too easy and severely lacked creativity, and at least 2 that were just genuinely terrible often making little to no sense whatsoever and then it just turned into a game of hangman with unlimited guesses. Clearly this was made by a team or individual who thinks that they are supper clever and witty but in reality just wanted to make a few easy bucks by showering people with adds and a completely unnecessary currency system.",
        "Its a great gane but is always glitching out.For example I have three leters after I use a hint,then I earn a hint and the other letter just disapears and it did not go onto the word or phrase."

        "The game itself is very fun to play and very entertaining, however, the points system is a bit off. The reason for that is it not about the distant (which I like about) it about how many overtake you can take in a single game. That is what I dislike about this game. Also the cars... Not a lot of cars (need more). Few questions: Will there be such thing as upgrade speed or car customization? Will there be special event like special map that the highest rank get some kind of reward? And lastly will there be a competition of ranking ?  If all the that happening in the future this game definitely deserved 5 stars .",

I then pressed to race button again and again and nothing happened other than me losing all of my energy. I don't know why this happened but I'd like compensation, thank you.",

It connects and puts me in a race sometimes but nobody is there.... or sometimes it just glitches before putting me in to the race.......... sort it out. I'm deleting this bull.",

        "Maybe the reason people think its boring. It's probably because they are boring and lame. I beat the first level without a problem, they didn't because they feel like everything should be easy and they shouldn't have to work hard for anything. The game is challenging and fun if you like a challenge. If your a lame, whinny, expect nothing to be hard, and can't handle a challenge as tough as making toast, then this game isn't for you.",
        "The game controls are very annoying. The character won't go where you want him to. During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don't want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn't want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.",
        "These other reviewers are jerks! Lol. The game is awesome! And my 4 year old can even play it well!  I like it so much, I'm downloading it onto my phone (4 yr old plays it on my old phone)  just to see how far I can get lol",
        "This game is stupid because you have to get a part of the key just to get more lives and the bad guys are technically cheating because they have guns I made it to the last level and it was impossible to beat the boss because he puts fire everywhere on the second level the guy keeps shooting you so it took me an hour to get off that stupid level  it took me about five days to get of the last level but I suggest that you just play the first level. This was a ripoff it doesn't make sense to wait that long for a stupid freaking game I'm to cool for that dumb game. Another thing that is stupid about the game is the remote controls its confusing because they all look the same they should put the names of what that control does in the buttons.

        "I recently switched to mobile gaming only, and I have a g stylo phone and a Nvidia shield k1 tablet. On my phone I get network error (I'm data only) and my tablet says the game isn't compatible. It's marshmallow OS on the shield tablet and the thing can run borderlands 2 natively so I know it's not a hardware issue. This game looks cool. Wish I could find out for sure. And no, I'm not running a speed test.",
        "Requires some patience but is a really fun game. Don't expect to fly through the tutorial but they make it fun learning the steps. What I enjoy the most, is its NOT lagging down my processor with ads. Only thing I wish is that the home base was a little more organized.",
        "The features of the game are cool.. i like all the pvp dungeons.. but most of the dungeons with event goes in certain time and limited.. if i miss them..then i hardly get the purpose of installing this game meaning.. nothing else to do.. it's getting boring for player like me who wants to spend hours online but no more rewarding pvp dungeons available overnight.. maybe create some entertaining 24 hours pvp features? I can tell many players tend to be inactive for more than 1 day...so hope for more crowded and better LOD..",
        "I just realized this evening that this game uses the microphone feature to spy on the players and listen to their conversations without their consent. After joining one event I could clearly hear conversations of other players (not about game and I'm sure without them even knowing that they were being listened to) while I was having my sound turned off, even after leaving that particular event and when having my game in the background the sounds didn't stop until I turned off the game. This game should be called Legacy of Spies, nice try 👍🏻",
        "Love the game, would give 5 stars, but lost 2 high-level characters and quite a bit of $ due to lack of anything resembling customer service. If you have to reinstall for any reason, and can't remember your password, be prepared to lose all progress because if you can't sign in right the first time, there's no way to sign out, or to contact someone to help recover your character.",
        "I love playing the game but there are so many updates all the time. And when they do their bimonthly update you have to download new package and then some gameplay features dont work. I have had a couple things not work from last update. I tried to contact support and they havent replied at all. Its been three days now. Im an everyday player who spends real money in game. Would rate higher if someone would help me out.."

No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It's TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred",

The only thing stopping it getting the 5* rating is that the ads on it are sometimes several minutes long and at times when they have finished you can't return to the game. I don't mind watching them as I know that's what funds it, but they are putting me off playing now.",

        "It's a pretty amazing game, like league of legends but what makes it amazing is that you can play it on your phone. The only problem is the prices of the heroes and skins. Most of the heroes are 32k battle points.. So it would be fair if it was at least 5k cheaper than that. Also the game lags sometimes which interups gameplay which can cause you to unexpectedly die.  For anyone who is reading this, I highly recommend this game to anyone.  It's amazing and extremely addictive!!",
        "I think this game is great! I play It Almost Everyday And My Mum Always Has To Scold Me For Playing Too Much! Its Addictive And Fun To Play! Just A Few Things You Guys Could Work On. 1)I Hope That You Guys Will Let Us BE ABLE To Sell Hereos And I Bet Others Agree. 2)I Also Hope You Guys MAKE IT EASIER For Us To Get BP'S I Really Really Hope You Guys Get To Fulfill My Request! Its a good game!",
        "I gave the game another chance after my last review because the game is fun but it is my last time.. I am uninstalling and never again playing mlbb. I got afkers on my team in 4 consecutive classic games, and I still get feeders even though my rank is quite high.. why do I get paired up with feeders, I have no clue.  Goodbye mlbb, was great when I acually got a decent team and is actually capable of winning instead of having no chance at all and get trashtalked by opponents thinking they are all that.",
        "Not enough with unskippable tutorials now you want us to level up till lvl 8 to be able to change account? Here's some suggestion, make a button just before the tutorial, for login purposes for those who have old accounts. I mean, people sometimes reset their phone and you want us to play till level 8 again just so we can play old account? Be realistic developers.",
        "I like the game. My low rating is because I had to reset my phone and now have to go 8 lvl again just to reload into my account. It's bad enough you are forced to play the practice modes over again but lvl 8 is almost to ranked again. Why put that time in again. Lvl 5 maybe/understandable. But you've made me not want to play this game anymore and it's sad because I enjoyed it",
        "Quite simply a super fun game. This game does exactly what it is supposed to, which is provide a fun portable moba experience condensed into short bursts of fun. This is one of the few games where even losing is a fun experience for me. Pros - wide range of heroes, fun over the top cartoon graphics, multiple game modes, great community and incredible speed of matchmaking that still some how retains quality of matchups. Cons - I am personally not a fan of the joystick based control system, the heroes require quite a bit of time playing before you can get enough in game currency to unlock them. So if you haven't already started playing this game then you are definitely missing out"

        "I love this game, it's simple and sweet. However, there was a middle row in the item-picking menu in which I had invested many coins into to help me level up faster. Today, when I logged in, the row simply disappeared without a trace. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the backgrounding of my app, but nothing seemed to fix it. Now I only have the Training row and the Fun stuff row. It took me quite a while to get those coins and I'd really appreciate it if you brought the row back or gave me a solution to get it back. If it helps, you should also know that the 'I' on every icon which used to let you see how an item was used has also vanished. Please fix this, thank you.",
        "I wish I could give this game 10 stars. It's amazing all around.  It's adorable and fun. The graphics are amazing too without any glitches so far. Haven't noticed any bugs either. The developer's done amazing. It does get repetitive after a while but so far by the time it happens something new unlocks so it's still fun. Can't wait to see what else you guys do to improve the game play since everything else has been flawless so far. Great job, keep up the great work!",
        "This game is super cute! I love my lil ninja friend! Lol. Nice story, and plenty to do to keep you busy. Will def take time to master, but it def has the potential to keep you interested in playing. Even got my wife playing it, and she usually only keeps games for a day or 2, cuz she gets bored with them. I think she'll play this one a little longer than most of the other games she's tried. I'm really happy i found this game!!",
        "This one is probably my favourite, with minecraft and clash of clans. If you don't have this Virtual Friend game, then it is you who is missing out. Install and enjoy. There's nothing bad about this game, and if Naturalmotion do want me to suggest an add-on, then maybe enable me to link the game with a new device. I was LVL 52 once but I lost it. Now I'm level 17. Hope you liked the suggestion. :)",
        "You should add a dog and a cat wearing ninja suit they can be like the chicken and the squirrel the dog can run around you and bark and find bones and sell them for coins and the cat can find fish and sell it for coins. It just sounds like a good idea  the dog should be a husky or a smaller dog like a beagle so it is small like the other animals and it can sleep with the ninja the cat can just be a cat please look into this *^* looking forward to this",
        "This is a great game that I've played off and on over the years. I just redownloaded it, and it'd still fun to play. My only gripe is that there's no place to save your progress. Cloud, Facebook, etc. I hate having to start from level 1 every time I have to wipe/switch phones. Even an account that saves your data would be great. Fix this and it'll be 5 stars all the way for me."

        "I'm really fond of this game and love the gameplay and quick paced matches. The new update is AMAZING!   There are a few things that would make this game extra perfect for me!   Must have character customisation. This would be of big amazing to me. Char customisation makes me bind more to certain characters. The rings we get don't have much value to them except for upgrading the characters.  Could have non-ranked matches. I would love the option to play/practice against rivals or my own friends.   Should have quick chat responses. Would like to communicate before and after the match with simple reactions. Like Good luck and I win, tee-hee!",
        "This is one of the best mobile games I have played I a while. I probobly have a bias sense I love Sonic so much. However, if one thing could be added I would say it should be a converter for the Red Star rings to normal rings. Unless you want them to be payed for. I don't really care either way I'll just buy the Red Star rings but I brought up that idea because I currently have 23,000 rings just kinda waiting to be spent. Maybe incorporate phone backgrounds or some customizations for the game that cost extra rings? Thankyou so much for the new update and if anyone I'd debating on installing it just get it. You'll have fun, trust me.",
        "Please add a custom character, there is one in the main game so there should be one here to. Also please add infinite, cubot, orbot, and eggman. Also some more variety of music and areas would be good. Thank you for reading and for the great game! :)  (Edit): we need a friending system and to be able to customize our characters so that we have SOMETHING to spend rings on. And Espio needs some serious buffing because right now, he is pathetic.",
        "Until the previous update, everything ran fine. But now, with the Cream update, the game lags a TON. I get frozen on one frame while everything's still happening. I start off in first, then the framerate drops to 0 temporarily while I'm bombarded with obstacles I can't see to do a thing about. Fix these performance issues and I'll put my rating back to 5 stars.",
        "To many ads unless you make some kind of purchase. Loading screens seem to take longer than I'd like. You can't at this time play with friends as Opponents are automatically chosen. There is still some characters ability noise in the game even if you have music and sound off. I'd like to see characters abilities not to be so similar, but it isn't taking away from the game at the moment for me. With all that said though the graphics are great, the game is fun, and it's worth the $1.99 purchase I made.",
        "This game is if Sonic Dash mixed with Racing. And I LOVE IT!!! One suggestion I have that I don't think many online multiplayer games have, add some sort of singleplayer mode. Otherwise, great game! I like that it's free with ads being removable via in game purchases (which I did), controls, graphics, and soundtrack are outstanding, overall, I love the game, and I look forward to more updates in the future."

Bonus spins could be a little fairer, you rarely spin much over 5000. Overall i love the style of the game with the different games and levels you can play.",

After you collect everything, there's nothing else you can do, I believe there are many ideas that Voodoo can implement.",
        "Every now and then the application would randomly shut down and have to be restarted. You cannot have more than 2.15 billion points to spend at a time but you can earn as many points as you would like, but you still don't have more than 2.15 billion points to spend. This game is still very addictive, I am level 1,000 for shooter speed and level 600 for shooting power.",
        "It's a great game but there is too many ads. Every time a games ends, it pops to and ad. The game is s good play and you can just sit in the middle, do nothing and not move to collecting points to up grade. That's because the course repeats, not very challenging.",
        "The gameplay is pretty good. Although it doesn't feel like you're .aking any progress because the game will just keep getting harder. The reason why i rated it 1 star, is because of the ads. There is an ad every single tome after you die. I just couldnt take the ads",
        "It's freezing up on me for the past 3 days . my score is 1.03 million. it's like they don't want you to get any higher . here I am asking to please fix this game. I had a high score of 20.8 billion and does not let me get pass 2 .15 billion it didn't give me the points",
        "Constantly force stopping. Cannot finish a game without the game closing on me.  Update: uninstalled and reinstalled game and did not fix the problem. Uninstalling until game is fixed. Other then that game has potential.  Update 2: after installing the game again, it finally worked. But now I'm uninstalling the game for good.  After scoring over 7b points in 1 game, the game only gave me just over 2b points. Game is garbage. Do not download this game!"

        "Played many times and game play is ok and its quick to connect to opponents. But the dice suck!! Not sour grapes but all to often when you are in an unbeatable position the opponent will throw 4 doubles or exactly the right sequence of dice to win. This im sure is to encourage payment of coins. Not the best because of this bit could be.  Its a shame it ruins the fun totally!! Edited as the dice really are pants! Ive played many backgammon games online and they do not re-act like these do. There is definatly an issue that needs to be resolved as they don't drop as they should. I am sure the other reviews are accurate regarding the dice",
        "Liked playing it till an update caused it to crash on loading at 94%. A fault that others have reported and BeachBum have decided not to fix. Today i have discovered 'Backgammon Live' by Come2play  with 4.4 rating. It has all  the same addictive features as this app but better done :) So goodbye 'lord of the board' . I'm killing u off my tablet.",
        "I've been playing this on my computer & 2 other cell phone for months. Since Xmas update I have installed & uninstalled from my cell 35x & the screen locks every time at 94% & won't play. PLEASE FIX!  Game was the best I've found & I really enjoyed playing it.  Almost Impossible to use skills against unbelievable - impossible rolls & Dbls. Some players know how to hack game.  I Played in clubs professionally 38 yrs.  When I'm winning other players roll 6-7 dbls in a row & win with impossible odds at the end of the game. 14 dbls in 1 game - NOT in real life. Never in life rolled 10 dbls in 1 game.",
        "Really?? Its absolutly riggged!!, cant believe people rate it 5 stars... first you win, they ask u to rate it and them you lose with impossible dice combinations... dont waste your time and money with this app.",
        "Game play OK but spoilt by too many \"lucky rolls\" which cannot be random. Too often only possible roll to change game is thrown.",
        "The game is rigged and they steal 25% of all your winnings... They're after your credit card like starved vampires after fresh blood! AVOID IT"

Two, you can't even get coins for completing a level and the daily wheel is rigged cause you can't get anything good. Three, if you watch a video for a reward or life, it never gives you anything. And four, they don't give you enough moves for each level, there are too many ads and everything's so overpriced. Hate this bullcrap game😡"

Also would be cool to save more than 1 custom ball.  And some of the achievements aren't registering...other than that great game, very simple.",

        "This game is terrible. The aim is off, it lags. The graphics are the only good thing about it. Immediate delete after 5 minutes, don't waste your time",
        "Would give 0 stars because it's showing false gameplay, well it is from the same game but they don't show the bricks going down. It would be better if the bricks stayed in one spot and not move. You clear out that row of bricks and then another row of bricks appeared. That would be much better and less stressful",

Players and teams will be ranked for the match in the order they are eliminated.The safe zone changes randomly in each match, providing players with a fresher, more intense experience each time.Remember, find a weapon and supplies as quickly as you can and then move to the island’s safe zone.This is not just a game, this is battle for survival!!!PLEASE NOTE!

Last Battleground: Survival is free to download and play, however some game items can also be purchased for real money.

        "Great game. NEEDS:  *Multi player game. Compete vs friends *The same minimum bid on every unit. Regardless of what its contents are. As the level goes up, maybe the minimum increases slightly.  *Tools!!!! Ive never seen a pawn shop without tools. We need tools *Cars, go carts, motorcyles, 4wheelers. Wheres that stuff at?. *Guns, no guns either. Like civil war era type items, unless these are all avaliable at much higher levels.",
        "Overall this game is fun. Only bad thing to say is there is way too many ads. I believe it discourages you from playing the game longer due yo an ad every like 30 seconds",
        "Really liked this game to start off. Good fun to play but it starts to get near impossible to unlock the next areas without purchasing in-game money which really annoyed me. Have to keep repeating the same levels over and over hoping you eventually get enough money gathered up. It's more likely you will just purchase in-game money from them or in my case, get bored repeating levels and end up un-installing",
        "Game was going ok the bam , hit a brick wall and all of a sudden bidding went stupid.. you either go backwards because you don't win any bids or you lose thousands on the ones you do \" win \" on.  Very disappointing.   Clearly set up for those buying players who spend money to play.",
        "Was fun for a while got to level 27 and to make enough money to go to the next city would take easily a month playing several times a day. So dumb.",
        "New update won't allow to open Dallas, asks for clearing Miami first. But all was completed months ago!! Phone is samsung j710 fn 2016 year. Android 7.0 if this helps. After fix i'll correct rating, all was perfect before this update."

And addictive including this one it's fun and ever since the first play I've been hooked there are barely any adds and the graphics are phenomenal. I play it all the time plz don't change this, if u do your going to loose my five stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟.",
        "Most of my apps are from Ketchapp. Their creativity and style of games have just been wanting me to download more and more! Right now, Ketchapp is one of my most favourite game groups ever! Keep making more! I don't have any improvements, which means that their games are top notch!",
        "Patheitc. Being such a fast paced game you cannot have the blocks starting to move a split second before you're going to pass it. Makes the game pretty impossible from the first level. For something that was supposed to be fun, is more frustrating. You need severe luck on your side to get a win. Recommended do not download",
        "Its a good concept, but you need to update it, and make sure the blocks no longer move. Right now, it is by far the most luck based skill game. It is impossible to dodge the moving blocks, so if they are to move, they should move much slower",
        "Good, but difficulty is a bit tough. Unless I was a Jedi, it feels like I'm starting on what should be a hard level. The AI is way too slow as well. I wish you could could change the color of your ball and race online with others in real time.",
        "I think it is a great way for amiee to get design for her Xbox 360 and help her get over with her anger with her sister and to help her to figure out what's the matter but what is the most important thing is to be a fantastic family together but why are we so lonely.... Well i think it is a great opportunity to make new friends to life"

        "Its Cool but there is a lot of Flaws,  like the Gem system? 9.9  I can't update my special if I don't use Gem?   Upgrade system,  cost a lot and I earn little per completing stages so?  Gg!    More like play to win game!  Then every stage,  has 5sec adds..  I can't even have option to say NO?..  So 4 star coz it made me like it!  It has potential but it needs major changes tho~",
        "The time for upgrades only increments when the game is running and the phone is unlocked. That is ridiculous.  Upgrades take too long and the gold to buy them is gained too slowly during game play.  If I go check my mail, talk on the phone, dock the phone for the night, etc, no time passes on the upgrades. If there is 6 hours left on the upgrade when I go to sleep, there is still 6 hours left when I go back and check the game in the morning.",
        "Terrible game. Set up horribly. Plenty of room for more towers and easier gameplay. Little room for personal strategy which in turn guides you to purchase crystals with real money to beat the game... another garbage excuse tor a tower defense",
        "Fun for about a month. They have a ridiculous gem system like clash of clans. After a month it becomes a choice of grind or buy $100s worth of gems. There are also excessive ads at every possible opportunity.",
        "Pay to win single player ad viewer disguised as a game. Ridiculous amount of ads everywhere and upgrade system. If they out a fraction of the amount of time into balancing the game as they do trying to find a new spot to spam you with ads it may not be that bad as another generic TD clone.",
        "This game has only one problem: farming gold is slow.  Edit. I quit the game because of impossible gold farm requirements.\\ Can't upgrade anymore, even tho I auto farm lv 1 endless to infinity and level 2 to stage 200! I have to leave my phone on charger overnight....every night!  The most expensive upgrades cost 99,000 and are taking me 2-3 days to obtain such amount of gold!"

        "Amazing game, great time-killer. I discovered a game breaker: if you go into the settings after you die, the number of coins you got in that level, [the number in the brackets] becomes equal to the total number of coins. Keep going back and forth into the settings, and the game will eventually ask if you want to triple the coins by watching a video. Instead of tripling the number of coins you got in that level, the number of total coins you have gets tripled.  Instantly triple your wallet every run.  I want the devs to see this and see if they can patch it because I really like this game and I want the coins I earn to be legit.  Thanks for your time, Mike C.",
        "It has a progression system, but it's completely worthless. The only reason to try to win belts is to get weapons that serve no purpose. You can win most of them by paying 200 coins and getting a random one, but you can, for some odd reason, get duplicates. Not to mention the fact that coin combos actually do nothing, not even useless cosmetic items, nothing. I think adding function to the weapons (e.g. Making long swords slightly longer range or making small weapons quicker) could add more depth and more of a reason to play the game. Overall: It's a good timekiller.",
        "Great game. Best for killing time. Great concept. Need to add a  counter for counting the number of people killed, otherwise awesome. Also there is not much incentive to play to win belts. Make playing with boss again free. Add new opponents (not bosses but the minions) . Make the game a little less challenging. Also remove the brief stun completely",
        "Really fun game. Nice graphics and simple controls. More depth to combat system would be nice. There is no point in achieving coin combos. It does not affect the amount of coins won. Add a multiplier for coin combos, as well as a score multiplier for chaining combos together without missing enemies or coins. Don't allow duplicate items to be won. Very annoying to grind and grind for coins, only to get a duplicate you can't do anything with. Lastly, an option to pay to disable ads would be nice.",
        "The game gives you an unskippable mission to get kills with a certain type of weapon and then will never give you that weapon. I've opened over 100 chests and never got a two handed sword, so my options are pay real money for the the weapon (what they want) or delete this cancer app. I get you have to make money but there are better ways than stopping all progression and ruining the fun. Overall good game 6.7/10",
        "Need to fix glitches in the lunges. Stunned when picking up a coin or going through it in to a enemy when instead of stopping. Random stuns even you have a successful strike. And you need to put more green and red guys in sooner. Also theres a glitch where the black dot turns grey and you strike but its too early."

        "Overall, the game is pretty cool. But, I feel much more can be added though. Great game. Just more needs to be added. It's a great app I wish the devs could make like, Sandbox modes where you can build your own... Em... Coasters? I dunno. You had to verify them first. Annnd in order to verify them you had to complete them yourself. Then you could publish them. And maybe a two player mode? Not sure how that's gonna work out. That's all that could be added. Most of all. 3 and a half out of 5 stars.",
        "The only way to play online is Facebook and Google play! First, you can make a 3rd option for an in-game name, like in Clash Of Clans,  and make the Google play account optional if you don't want to download Google play (not meaning that Google play is bad). Many people can not even think of any name that is not already taken in Google play (including me). It still is a good game,just it needs some more work.",
        "Don't get me wrong, it's amazing and seems to be fun, but there's one thing that ruins it all. Whenever I open the game, everything shifts to the right quite a bit, so I can't see about one fifth of the screen, which doesn't allow me to use the button control setup, and some other things. Would love to see this get fixed, as the game has some nice potential.",
        "Love this game for the cool clip art graphics with all the chaos. Relly funny when they crash. Lol i just dont like the constant ads gou have to watcg when ever you have to open a prize chest and when you win. I mean you win and then you gotta watch a clip for 30 secs, then it feels like you lose. Lol",
        "Thankyou gor being creative i wish you add more challenge : crash crush. That is like just crush using vlad and rufus (example) and then crush make them crush so who is the winner. Using that game we can know who is the stronger",
        "Boring. Levels are too short. Game does not require much skills, you just need to learn levels and you can win. I did not figure out a way to upgrade characters and the game is not worth time to do it"

        "One big problem... You can't see where you're going. The character is right in the middle of the screen and you can't see what's coming at you... Aside from that, the game is fun and challenging. A better game like this is Smash Hit. Try that instead.",
        "Really fun game,  unfortunately it's a bit buggy for me.  My phone is an Oppo A57 and when I watched an ad to win gold by choosing one of four cards,  the game showed me what I won but didn't continue and it stayed on that screen,  so I exited the game, and when I opened it again the screen was all glitchy for a sec, then everything worked normally and I still got my gold.",
        "SOMEBODY SAVE ME IM DIYING OF KWAWINESSSSS!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍  BUT. whenever I spin the lucky wheel, it always 40 g. Please do something with the lucky wheel.  😯😯😐  ALSO, add some powerups like magnet or slow down or this that.  Oyherwise the game is kewl😋😋",
        "Its good and all but this game is really design for us to tilt our phone,not using our fingers to help guide the fluffy away from the danger and not to mention,blocking the screen.Another issue with using this method to guide the fluffy is that the sensitivity of my phone is crazy,especially if the touchscreen is oily because of the sweat from my hands.Please add the option for tilting because this one is just too adorable to be frustating when guiding them with the finger movements.",

        "This is a great game with good ideas. Don't listen to those people who say it's bad as its not. There are some flaws, mainly in the fact that there are only a few maps so more maps would be nice. Also, it would be nice if you could change the name or if there is a way, tell me. There are other slightly bad things but overall a great game.",
        "Great concept the only thing wrong with it is the slow movement's that happens some Times during the game hope  that you all fix it. Another thing is the lack of stages there are only four to three stages and all of them are with ice add more and I guarantee your that your ratings is going to rise. Finally the option to change your name at the main screen and better control's than just jumping. Would love to play it once these issues are fixed and I don't mean to be harsh hope you all got my opinions",
        "This game is good awful DO NOT INSTALL. The graphics are the only decent thing in this game and they are ripped off of the real game. The controls rarely work. The ads are always in the way. The AI's are OP and there is no point in playing the game. Its a much better idea to just buy the real game on steam instead. 100x better",
        "This is a knockoff of StickMan Fight The Game, and the controls are shjt and apparently when you kill everyone the retared AI win.",
        "The graphics are perfect for the style, but attacks should be more under your contract with weapons, and variation without. I also can't find the Bluetooth multiplayer hinted by the Bluetooth connection permissions. Is that a later feature? If so please add soon!",

        "I really love this game. Of course it WANTS you to spend real money on it, but you don't really have to to make progress. Just set stuff up then go back to it later. As per other reviews it does take a while to load, but due to the excellent graphics, music and overall feeling of happiness I get playing this - they are forgiven.",
        "SO HAPPY!😀😀😀😀😀😀 This is really fun! It is really magical. I love disney ever since I saw this game. Just it lags when we collect rewards and it kicks me off. Rather than that it is perfect! Great game, I need more games like this! Why do companies  do not make more games like this ?! I had been playing since the second month it came out! So 2 years. Who cares about money I do not use my real money and I am progressing a lot! Maybe it is some phones and tablets. When I do not need the characters I put them in long missions and get a bunch of magic. SO HAPPY!",
        "Okay, this is probably the most honest review I will ever take the time to write. The game is beautiful and entertaining...just like everything Disney does. The other thing Disney does EXTREMELY well is suck money from you (I live in Orlando - I KNOW this, Man). I'm not proud of what I'm about to say but I just spent $30 on essentially a \"Russian Roulette\" for Alice in Wonderland characters. It's like this...the game is entertaining and enjoyable to an extent...but if you're money concisious don't download this game. I've played a lot of app games and this one FAR surpasses the need for real money. The game is entertaining and fun if you semi/kinda love Disney stuff because of nostalgia or whatever...but if you're a die-hard Disney fanatic...this game will bankrupt you. So, fear it.",
        "I've given it 5 stars but really it would be 4.5 stars. The prices of things in this game are stupidly high and they don't make it easy for you to get money and gems. It will take you months just to save up to expand one square in the kingdom.",
        "I really love this game. My only complaint is when they have special release items every 2 hours or every 4 hours. They release 24 hours a day, so if you want to rank high on the leaderboard you have to wake up multiple times a night to play! I'm sleep deprived!",
        "OK I love this game, however have a problem, I recently broke my phone had to send it of to get fixed. Have uploaded this game to my iPad have clicked it over to the correct game to keep my level however gets right to the loading section then kicks me out. My iPad is up to date, can you please fix this bug. I haven't played for a few games, the tempary phone I have won't let me play either. Please fix.."

I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it's the same on all of them",
        "I would give it 5 stars, I made an in app purchase to remove ads, but after the game updated non Sega ads started showing again and it asked me to make another purchase in order to remove the non Sega ads AGAIN... love the game, hate the ads...",
        "Ads are back. I paid for a red ring bundle, which did remove them for a while, but they're back. The only reason I made a real purchase was so that I wouldn't have ads, so can someone please remove the ads from my account. On another note, I really like this, and nice to see Shadow playable again.",

        "I've never had this problem untill tonight. When I start a guild boss battle. It starts off fine. About 15-20 seconds into the battle. It goes super fast. Almost like a battle fast forward. Making me miss my skills useage etc. What the hell?",
        "The game is completely different to COC, the game has an original idea, and I have even seen some nockoffs of this game. I highly recommend.  Note: this game has a free to play model that advertises microtransactons but they are not required to have fun in the game.",

        "Great game but the matchmaking for guild clash is ridiculous because I can't see how my guild who are 308th can be matched with a guild that's 118th and 97th!!! This definitely needs fixing!!!",
        "Hello!  I just love your game but  I want to share my opinion on the development of this game :-        1.)you should add street view or something like that to make the game more exiting.                        2.) You should make a animated movie series or short video clips to make the game more popular.    3.) You should add new themes and new experience eggs.                   4.) You should add hindi language option in language  settings.                                             5.) You should improve graphics to make game more realistic and   new.                                                       I hope guys you will at least try all these things.I have faith on you and please make a MAGICAL animated  movie series please please please."

        "Play this game if you have all kinds of money and just want to pay to win. There is little fun to be had outside of that.  Update: the developers listened to feedback and have been adding numerous ways to get advantages for free. Here is some respect for listening to your users. Rating increased!",
        "I overall enjoy the game.  I did the tavern and did a volley for rewards. It showed I won one thing and it gave me another. I took a screen shot of it, sent it to customer service to be compensated.  They say, sorry it was a display error you got the correct rewards. Ummm, no I didn't! It showed I won a valor stone and they gave me a champion stone.  I even had the screen shots to prove it!!  Very unhappy with it and the customer service.  It's not my fault the game glitched, and I should be compensated with what it showed I won. It is NOT my fault the game had a display error.  I have spent money on this game ( more than I will admit) but after the way this was handled,  I will not spend another dime.  Although they probably don't care, as they have shown me already, it is just very disappointing. The way they treat the folks that put the money in their pockets....",
        "I maintain my stance that this game is pay to win. Peaceful, nonpaying lords are punished harshly by higher level lords that just teleport next to you and raid your city until you have nothing left. This problem has been made even worse with the killing event. It lasts 4 whole days and invites so much violence and destruction that small peaceful cities are completely set back to square one by larger more powerful lords. I appreciated the hours I spent into this game, but I cannot support what the developers are doing at this time.",
        "Great game. New problem with update. I can't enter the magic spire. Every time I try, game crashes.",
        "This is the most addictive game I ever played.  Super cool and really fun to play every moment is worth the play. Plus you get to meet so many people all over the world. You become great friends or earth rivals. Thank you for an awesome game and for the interaction with the developers.",
        "Can get expensive... and be sure to keep track of purchases because on numerous occasions i have been double sometimes tripple billed."

About the ads, one pops out each time you finish a game, so I'm not to bothered by it. Also, theres no videos too watch in order to earn coins or diamonds because none are needed. I just love it. Its stress free.",
        "I really enjoy playing this game. It helps me to relax while I am watching TV, or even using in split mode while watching a video or something. It's a bit different then the way I originally used to play Klondike, but still a great game and easy to get used to quickly! I don't mind the 5 second or so ads between games. It's the price you pay to get a good, free game. It's not like they play constantly and during a game there is usually an ad on the bottom screen but it will quickly move if you go to start a new game or need to access the other options.",
        "I would have scored higher except there is suddenly super annoying music being played that there is no option to turn off. The ads also now autoplay loud music. I agree with another poster who said it starting to seem like you lose more so you see more ads. I liked this because it was good for a quick game while getting ready to sleep. The music ruins this. I'm going to try another app now.",
        "I love the game solitaire played it on many different computers over the years. Downloaded three other version on my phone. All of which I deleted almost straight away because they were finicky and I didn't like the format. This one is easy to use and no glitches. So far so good.",
        "It won't allow me to add my own pic for background. Maybe too big of a file but I know other solitare let me. I also wish there wasn't commercials after the win or lose because they interrupt my music but I hear you guys make money that way so let it be. I'll continue to play because I like solitare and the commercials only pause my music and don't cut it completely off to play the commercial, like other apps.",
        "Terrible ads. So bad they hid the menu bar behind an ad banner so you click the ads just to access settings. Pretty sure they recently increased losing deal rate to make more ad videos play. So many other solitaire aps available so skip this one."

However, players should not have to pay to get gold bars from piggy bank especially since the player has already \"paid for them\" by earning them on levels. Players should be able to use them once earned.",
        "I think Candy Crush as well as Jelly and Soda crush are very entertaining games with literally thousands of levels to play. The levels are imaginative with different scenarios so they don't become boring. So as an avid player of these games I would give them a 4 out of 5 stars because there are some levels that can freeze your progress and become frustrating. All in all, keep up the great ideas for future games.",
        "I'm uninstalling this game today because I've been stuck on the 532 for 6 months. It's hard and boring and the way the jellies drop so slowly annoys the hell out of me. Used to like it before the update that changed the speed of the drops but this level is so dull.",
        "The jelly concept kind of grosses me out. Also, these levels are too difficult. It's not right that I'm on level 15 and am spending 4 or more tries to beat the level.",
        "The level where you have to remove the queen's jelly is horrible. Candy Crush Jelly actually cheats you to prevent you from winning.   Two years later and the game still cheats you.",

        "The AI is just too fast. Even when u are playing other humans, the AI will take over when a person wits and then win the game in 2 turns.  Humans just can't physically make that many moves during a turn with only 30 seconds and so many bugs.  Worst game ever!",
        "Not ready for use. Good try tho. For those who like to play this for a couple of hours, it gets annoying real fast.   When players leave the table, the Ai will take over and basicly beat everybody there. Instead of the Ai playing, just return the tiles to the group and we play with one player less.   Also, there is a 30 second time limit, which works mostly great, however, sometimes you need more time to move all the tiles arround. It would be nice to use your unused time (up to 2 minutes max or so) for those times you need a few extra seconds.  Also, when moving tiles on the board, sometimes the tiles wont stay in place and wont snap to the right spot. This happens mostly when the board is pretty full.  This could have been an awesome game...",
        "Ridiculous how the computer players play. Somehow they are able to move almost every tile on the board to win in less than 30sec. Not possible for humans and very frustrating",
        "It would be nice if u could chat while u play. Alot of people cheat by holding chips and unload. There should be something if u have a move then u have to play it.",
        "I love the game but there have been times when I have tried to move ties and they will not move or will not connect. 3 times in a row in one game!"

        "I dont know why you chosen Retro style graphic and i hope for a change. There is a lot of IRANIAN players but PING is over 250ms and too much delay. Add iran flag. Google play sign-in is not working. Add more skins. Events are just bunch of objectives and prizes, add more artworks and stuff for events. Other things are good for now. Thanks for the revolutionary IO game. Congratulation on 10million downloads 💝",
        "YOU GUYS ACTUALLY LISTENED!!! Im so happy right now because when I saw theres a new update, I immediately downloaded it to see if I can play it without crashing. I can actually play it now with my friends! A little bit of framrate drop but still... I can play this wonderful game. Im going to totally recommend this game to my friends. The devs of this game are the best devs in the Google Play Store. Again, Im truely greatful and I thank you guys. :D",
        "Simple gameplay, no punishments for going AFK, simple ranked system, a little bit of P2W with new heroes and awaken system, but still based around skill, as a 4th awaken level BarBarQ can beat a 5th awaken one. Some things that we dont have counterplay to seem like complete BS at first, but once we find counterplay, it makes for an even match",
        "It is the best game I've ever played! With simple graphics and gameplays, you won't notice how long you've played! Generous with presents daily and very recommended to spend time. However with the new update, I can't connect and it stayed on connecting. Tried to change internet source, but to no avail it's still there.  I would like to ask the developers, to reply as soon  as possible, on what should I do to get rid of this problem.",
        "Hello! I've seen this game many times from the ads and I tried installing it and later found that this game was really intertaining and fun. Anyways, I am having problems with the game's connectivity to the internet. I am using 4G in playing the game and it seems that it does not connect very well, other online games connect well to the internet. I think that is the only issue I have in mind. Just hoping for more smoothness though.. But I love the game, it is worth the time playing. Thank you!!"

        "This game is really fun, challenging at times & exercises and has a great variety of important brain exercises. My only qualm with this game is that everytime you level up a full screen ad gets in the way. Usually they can be closed out easily but not always. Regardless, it's the best free brain training app I have used and it really keeps you sharp!😀",
        "Its rlly a good game for brain training!! Idk why but i didnt find any bug, glitch, or smthing like they all saying. It works well in my device. This is the best app for training your brain. Ofc its not easy, its so challenging, in a good way. I rlly struggle in quick searching and some stages, but its just so addicting and so great!! I recommend you to download it!!!",
        "Additive and helpful. Its not an over night cure so people expecting that need help instead lol. It doesn't deserve a low rating. Yes theres add but it's to be expected with a free game. Having adult a.d.d and huge memory issues.. i can i liked this game. 100 doors is anther good one.",
        "It's fun. My problem is on the attention one we are suppose to click stop once the red dot is on the brain and I do. There is plenty of time to click it  but it tells me i missed it. No matter how many times I click it while the red dot is still on the brain. If I press it 10 times then the screen that tells me I've failed comes up 10 times. Driving me insane.",
        "I love it!!! The games are interesting. Now I am on \"memory match\" game which was initially locked and it keeps on freezing and promotes me to next level without me completing the level well. Besides that, I would highly recommended it to others, it's worth installing.",
        "There's a glitch in \"Quick Decision Skill\" game. It is based on whether the previous and current object is same or not. When I click on the peach-moon-type object as same, it gives error, though I click on Same when two moons appear consecutively in the game. This way I'll not be able to clear the levels."

        "I got to level 7 on big fish casino to get 60 gold. yet when I went back to reap my rewards I was startled! then my feeling of \"startled-ness\" changed to one of despair. For when I went back I realized I wasted all that time going to level 7 on big fish games and instead of having 60 gems I have 60 minutes of wasted time. Great game. Horrible reward system. I will rate the game 5 like it should be when I receive 60 gold. Unfortunately I like the game so I will continue to playing. I am level 27 after all.",
        "prices in the game are not well distributed. you can unlock new players only with gold but gold is obtained so hard. on the other hand, money is useless after some point. you can only use upgrading players but it also requires gold. you can obtain golds with watching ads and playing every tournament over and over again to level up and gain gold but after some point you cannot unlock new players (therefore cannot unlock new tournaments) because it requires so much gold. the game forces you to buy golds. fun game but only a short period of time",
        "It is the best game I have played so far but I wish the creator adds that you can fight people online in this game because it doesn't make sense that in  basketball PVP you can go against people online . Why not add online in this game and creator if you are reading this comment can you please add more bags add like a legendary you buy the legendary bag it has like 1,00000000000000 gold .bag for 1,00000 cash and in the legendary bag add like 1,00000000000gold like this game so much",

        "I DONT LIKE THE UPDATE THAT GIVES YOU MORE TIME AFTER FORCE OF CARDS . IT ALLOWS PEOPLE WAYY!!!!! TO MUCH TIME TO COMPLETE THE BOARD. AND IT WAS MORE COMPETETIVE B4. I DONT WANT MY RANKING TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF LUCK.  +Ima a REAL RISK FAN. I have purchased everymap package available. Its fair priced and affordable.The new maps are too easy in my opinion. MAKE MORE MAPS I'LL PAY idc jus MAKE them MORE Challenging",
        "This game is great but it could be so much better.   1. The expert AI is too easy to beat. Risk players normally gang up on an opponent, if they are dominating. There should be a legendary option.  2. It would be nice to have a match summary and timeline at the end of a game.    3. There should be an auto-save game feature when playing against the AI, in case the game drops out.  Edit: They seem to have addressed my third point.",
        "This is a very frustrating game. Every single time I play my turn (in a multi-player game that is) I get disconnected! .. and I've to replay it again .. only to get disconnected again! and so on and so on till my time runs out. Sometimes in the middle of all this 'replaying' I even lose my troops to other players .. VERY FRUSTRATING! And No .. I've both a very good data and wifi connections.",
        "Was fine for a couple weeks.... Then it started freezing up in the middle of my games.... All of them. I'm using a LG V30+ with 128g ram so it's definitely not a lack of storage issue.   I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone who likes uninterrupted gameplay.",
        "I joined to get the one free game per day. Be aware, that if you do not subscribe (like me), the dice are loaded...  I actually had an army of 9 or 10 roll over against an army of 1 on quite a few occasions... statistically highly improbable.",
        "Its just a very slow moving game.  I could only play won game and I had enough. Got bored of it.  They don't really teach you how to play either. I know how to play the real version.  Just got to learn to strategize on your own, obviously.  And lastly, you need to play when you have lots of down time. I am uninstalling it now."

        "Works. Music and SFX are imo top notch. Keeps my attention for 5-10 minutes every few hours. Diamonds are a tad pricey. Overall from me, a solid 4 out of five.  Would like to see sales for diamonds... I don't mind throwing a few bucks here and there for a game/app on a phone. Prices are a little steep IMO.....",
        "It's a good time killer. The thing that makes me think about deleting this app is how it keeps overriding my phone. I keep turning notifications off for this app, but the game will turn them back on again. It's so annoying to have my phone buzz just to find out its just this stupid game telling me my scientists are done or waiting for a task.",
        "Good fun until you figure out that you only need to build area 52 up. At level 500 it jumps by 5000000% or something stupid. Meaning can clear a planet in just hours. Needs a different hook to it. After a few planets it's a bit stale.  The choices to buy in multiples of needs moving. With fat fingers I've caught the research aswel as hitting Max a few times",
        "Usual game where numbers get ridiculous and good at killing time. Very good features and well balanced - so far. Like with many of these games nearer the later stages the completion time can be calculated and nobody wants to tap for 211 years to complete the next round. Hopefully this game sidesteps that.",
        "Update to previous review: Devs seem on it. After the last update there seemed to be a bug or two. A couple of us let them know and they fixed it within a week. Good game, come and go on your own time, well maintained. Thanks guys!  --------- I'd have to agree about the slow down for the red bacteria after the update. It used to come between 1.5 and 3 mins. Now I can go 10 minutes looking at the screen before one comes. It makes the game more of a waste of time than fun. Other than that, I was really liking it. Played it more than most games.",
        "Yes it's a tapper buy done is a very unique way and totally worth your time. The fact that your goal is to destroy planets and that you are sending all your energy to the planet makes sense that you have to start back up. Been playing for almost 3 months and I keep checking back in to destroy planets."

After some good hours it get's really repetitive... Right know it feels like nobody takes care about rhis game anymore. No more patches, updates, no new stuff. It's a shame. This game has some potential but it's getting wasted here.",

People who complain about that aren't appreciating how much the adds and endless re-charges and in-app purchases hurt good game design and make a game worse. It's only a single purchase, not an endless string of them."

        "Fun game, good time killer, great graphics. Unfortunately,  like with many other games, they sucker you in with rewards at the start only for you to soon hit a paywall. It's  either grind and hope you get lucky or give into the many game ads promoting cash purchases. Anything involving actually online play (co-op, PvP etc) seems to freeze or have crazy lag. Good game, definitely has room for improvement.",
        "It's a good cover-based shooter, with some pretty creative characters and a good pace for quick battles. The unlock system is more than fair, with the ability to save currencies for that one big purchase. I enjoy the ability to play at my own pace without sacrificing my life to the game (cough*Kabam*cough) and I'm having a lot of fun. I've noticed that PVP tends to favor Savage, when he activates Spray and Pray once, half the opposing team dies. Twice, and the round is over. Otherwise a very well done and enjoyable game.",
        "I really enjoy the action this game brings along with good looks and simple controls. Too many times development teams get caught up in the visuals or complex control schemes and forget about what gamers really love and that's not having a complex control panel with nice smooth transition from level to level. Thank you for making this game a joy to play every time I turn it on.",
        "Nice game ...the only problem  I say would be its pay to win philosophy. Yeah it's easy in the beginning but the gear gets really scarce to if your really trying to win it'll be next to impossible to do so with out swiping that good 'ol debit card. Otherwise it's a fun and awesome game. That is in the beginning....",
        "Good concept. Good game. Many glitches. For a game that's touted for and based on pvp it makes no sense that %80 of the time the game freezes going into a pvp battle. It's okay though, you can close it and then immediately reopen it to a message that tells you that you died. Fix your freezing problems and I'd give you 4 stars.",
        "Really solid graphics and game play for mobile. Doesn't want to work with my Bluetooth controller. As a free game they have really doubled down on the shards and multiple currencies to try to get you to spend. You really need to grind if you want to unlock anything without paying."
