     [ 'Honestly i really enjoy the game thus far thank you for all the recent updates niantic... but there is one thing that has been bothering me and that is 1v1 with friends and trading... both features were shown in the original trailer... yet again i love the care your giving the game niantic i truly praise it but i would like to know whats happening with my 2 listed thoughts',
       'Please have more legendary raid events with gen 1 and 2 Pokemon for new and returning players who want to collect everything. With regards to using GPS and joystick cheats you guys actually benefit by getting more players from rural areas or dangerous areas playing and spending money. Besides you still have to do all the hard work minus the walking so it technically isn\'t that unfair to others especially since everyone is level 40 these days with legendary Pokemon. The game is already balanced just needs more events. Please consider a premium service to pay for where we can use a joystick in game. We can pay monthly or something so everyone benefits.',
       'thx for niantic that always listened our sugesttion, but i wish we can trade or battling with other player around the world by staying at poke center or else... - and btw you should update the new gym and new pokestop... since when i was on holiday in Indonesia theres not so much pokestop and gym around :( even there are many landmark in there - another suggestion plz maked some item that can be used to summon legendary/raid battle in location that we want, so its much easier  for the communities to do raid battle in specific location',
       'I love pokemon go and always get pulled back into playing it. I\'m still getting use to the updates after not playing for a while and am disapointed in the gyms. While I love being able to use them like pokestops, I wish to recall my pokeon from the gym. I love I a rural area and my poor Vaporeon has been at a gym for 13 days. THIRTEEN. I want my pokemon to come back please.',
       'The game has been majorly revamped and has benefited from it. It\'s so much better to see that content and events are happening more often. Hopefully we\'ll see the first wave of gen 4 by April or May and a nice egg event will happen to get a higher chance of a baby Pokemon from gen 4. Keep up the great work only downside is legendaries. I can\'t get them as not enough people in my area play Pokemon go and I\'m not travelling for a Pokemon. Can we have a legendary event for one week you can get 3* legendary raids? That would make it easier.',
       'I love the game but There are fixes and patches that should have been implemented. That people have been asking for but Niantic won\'t deliver. Ex: There are small bugs everywhere especially in gyms and raids and medals.  They never added trading There is no direct PvP No ingenuity (they could have added Pokemon centers or more pokeball types) Thanks Niantic.' ],

     [ 'Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.',
       'Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I\'ve progressed it\'s just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I\'m not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!',
       'I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I\'ve already dumped into this game and the devs didn\'t give me my in game rewards. I\'ve submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.',
       'Wasn\'t sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to "farm gold,xp,mats". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it\'s an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don\'t be jealous, just play your game and have fun.',
       'Honestly gameplay and all is good but the game is so p2w it\'s not funny, it would cost u over a hundred dollars just to complete every reward for new Valentine\'s event. If you like this game play private server instead this version is a giant cash grab. Not competitive for f2p at all',
       'Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an "annoying add". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It\'s simple, it\'s fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend.' ],

But IGG not only panders and gives better deals to Chinese people, cheaper packs etc. But literally 99% of all mega guilds and players are Chinese or Vietnamese. If your not asain don\'t play this game  you\'ll end up like me playing forever just to quit because of the obvious discrimination IGG holds with its playerbase',
       'Do NOT go for high level military research without searching monster hunting, and Do NOT go for T4 if you not going to spent thousands of dollars. Even if you don\'t mind to wait 200 days, you will not able to afford it (lvl 10 military Def, Atk, Health cost 100m gold each). DO NOT GO FOR HIGH MILITARY AND T4 WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE GAME.',
       'This game is fun but be prepared for the mother of all Pay2win games.  These folks at IGG are experts at crafting new and exciting ways at fleecing their customers of every cent they can.  You CANNOT compete if u dont pay and pay often.  Players here ...just regular people... dump hundreds of rl $$$ regularly.  You have been warned.',

       'If you like spending mad money to be an Internet tough guy this is the game for you.  Of you have tons of time to kill to be a punching bag for pay to play Internet tough guys it may also be the game for you.  If the computer random stuff kills off your troops don\'t expect to get tech support, it will always be reviewed in 1-3 days, even the next time you ask, another 1-3 days.',

     [ 'I love decorating the rooms but I am having to pay too much to get enough points to do it.   I also don\'t like that each room requires more points to do the tasks than the previous room.  I have changed my rating to low because you end up spending too much of your own money to get powerful to get your stars to complete the tasks.  They also lose your purchases.  I bought a desk chair yesterday and now it is missing and the task is gone too.  Rip off.',
       'Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it\'s advertised too much, but it\'s definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That\'s slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.',
       'Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I\'ll be playing this for a long time! I\'m working on the living room right now, getting close to level 600. Can\'t wait to see what the new character, Jerry, has in store for us! Thank you Playrix!',

Sometimes I find myself Having a Hard Time With Certain Levels. I Could be On that Level for Days or a Few Weeks. I think with Some Improvement that Would make People Play. This Game More. But I Must Say Hat\'s Off to The Developers',
       'The levels in the game got insanely difficult on the first day after downloading and playing the game. Some of these levels take a days just to beat one and you only get one star which doesn\'t do anything.  I can appreciate that someone from the team responded to what I have to say.   The scarf game makes levels a bit better, when you have the lives to play coninously for an hour.',
       'I gave it three stars because not too far along in the game, it turns into a "pay to win" game. Some boards simply don\'t give you enough moves, so you\'re forced to use coins to continue or retry and lose a life.  I don\'t mind hard games, but I detest micro transactions being needed so soon into it.. I\'m at level 24, that\'s it, and already the board doesn\'t even give you a fighting chance to beat it without using coins.' ],

       'Great game. The games are more fun than Candy crush and much more fair. For example, they let you make moves you can\'t play in Candy crush and timed rounds don\'t start until you touch the screen. Also, while some of the games are really challenging, you don\'t get stuck on them for days and days.  There are no gems or gold bars, etc. You don\'t have to slowly earn some kind of premium currency or pay real money to get special prizes.',
       'This is my favorite game. Absolutely love playing it whenever I can. However, why did the the flower growing from beating levels suddenly switch from starting on Friday, so we can enjoy it over the weekend to starting during the beginning of the week. Did not get to use my 6 hours of unlimited lives like I have been since this started. I would very much like if it could be switched back to the original timeline. Enjoy unlimited lives and contests over the weekend when it\'s more likely more users will have the time.',
       'I think that we should get more  coins for winning the levels. I find that the game can cost me money that I don\'t have, so I will spend less time playing your game. I love this game alot but why play if you are not getting enjoyment because it costs to much to play. (Otherwise I love the game) I also never got my horse, please give me my horse, I really need that horse btw. I already had a name for her to. I was going to call her daisy. The name goes great with the garden theme. (If you hadnt realized thst already) Please please send me daisy, I love her already. Peace.' ],

You have to do certain things to obtain the necessary items to put together, but for some reason with the current one you don\'t get enough of one item, and too much of another. It would be great if you could trade within your alliance for things like this.',
       'I played Game of War for appx 3 years.  The game started out great, everyone was on a somewhat even playing field. The game advanced to quick and left thousands of players behind. Other Players and I felt we could never keep up.  I hope this game advances at much more slower rate.  We all spend money to enjoy the game!    Don\'t be gready like GOW.  Thank you in advance.

In fact just to unlock some features you must spend at least .99 which is fine by me since I love to spend on this game anyways. I have been playing koa from the start and when this game came out I jumped on the bandwagon in the first 50 kingdom servers. So with that said yes it is LOTS of fun, I love my GoG family and definitely addicting LOL see you on the burning war field ;)',
       'It is a fun game and is the most indepth game I\'ve ever played. That all being said, unless you have a ton of money and a lot of time there is no way this game is worth it. I\'ve spend over $100 and play multiple times per day and I still find it hard to level up my estate. Even in an alliance unless they\'re all very high level it isn\'t much help. I\'m sure they\'re are much better games in this genre then Guns of Glory. To me it seems like a game for wealthy people and made by a company to just make money.',
       'What a great game!  Need to have introductory levels for newcomers, though.  You build your kingdom up and larger kingdom\'s just rush in and destroy you.  When you recover, they come right back.  Level into the attack mode, so people will enjoy the game more.  I am uninstalling after 6 weeks of running an Alliance, because it\'s just not worth the trouble.  Great concept, fantastic graphics!',
       'ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE GAME!!  Been playing for about 3 1/2 months now and I\'m addicted. You do NOT have to spend money to play and to level up., unlike some of the others I\'ve played where you can\'t level up unless you use cash money.  Love that there are moderator\'s to make sure people are acting right too.  Thank you Guns of Glory for keeping me happy everyday ☺🙂☺🙄❤❤❤' ],

     [ 'Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can\'t play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.',
       'One of the few games that I don\'t mind spending a bit i.e. $10+ every month. Requires team guild effort to achieve stuffs together definitely gives a good feeling. Event is weekly and community is lively. Card\'s artwork feels like Rage of Bahamut but using matching puzzle style to deal damage. Skills of card matter as well increasing the complexity and fun. Only thing to improve would be cheaper ingame currency to encourage more people to have better decks thus higher activity rates.',
       'It\'s a lot other games of this type. I haven\'t been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you\'re looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn\'t find any more connections, that would be great!',
       'Hey love the game and clearly has lots of effort pit into it. I can\'t say anything bad about it but I\'m having trouble with a high server load and I wasn\'t able to get on after multiple attempts. Would love for clarification for my problem and if I\'m the only one experiencing it',
       'My big complain is that I cannot enable notifications, I\'m on a pixel phone and it is no where to be found in the settings menu, I just uninstall and reinstall the game to see if it shows up. It\'s really inconvenient as a guild leader to not be able to get notifications. Thank you',

Thank you my supercell friend.this game oh almost,st forgot.bbbbbbbeest 2 v 2 game on mobile,!!!!!',
       'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'Well after playing it for so many months. It now has not let me play for about a  week out of no where, it loads to 50% and then it asks to try again later I have uninstalled it many times and retried time after time. All of my other games work just not this one. Don\'t really know what to do. It sucks because this is my favorite game too.',
       'This is  the best game ever. And supercell, can u add google + sign in so that people who don\'t use facebook can also have friends.. Also I have like 8 leggie right now and I am so happy. And the new clan battle is awesome, it is the best. I wish it is permanent. Anyways clan battle is so fun to play and who ever created it.. U r awesome. Keep up the good work Supercell. Love you so much and ur games.😙😙😙❤❤❤❤😀😁😁😊😊😊',
       'Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn\'t one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you\'re better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖' ],

     [ 'This game is actually really good, one of the best gacha games out there at the moment. I\'m giving one star for now because it\'s currently unplayable for me. When I try to open the app, I get a black screen for half a second, then I\'m booted back to home screen.',
       'One piece story plus the game itself makes it really fun. One problem: for some reason when I\'m trying to buy gems, the game doesn\'t properly update on how much balance I actually have on google play, therefore preventing me from purchasing it when I actually do have enough money.... Please fix.',
       'It\'s a great game in all manner but the inventoy system needs a complete change. Putting items and characters in the same inventory makes no sense and makes it impossible to store important itmes. Please make a separate inventory for items and manuals and it will be perfect.',
       'It\'s awesome but could you put the time of the game somewhere in the corner to see?  I lost 50 gems for nothing cuz I didn\'t know the exact time.. As some might find it annoying then maybe optional if it\'s possible',
       'Reached my 400th day today and am still unsure whether to continue or not- 3rd anniversary was a big rip off. For sth which suppose to be a celebration event it did only one thing to consider to quit this game for good.',
       'Great job on pumping new content out at a reasonable rate but seriously guys, fix those sugo rates because theyre horrible. The fact that a person will do pulls and not get a single new unit even though they have "increased rates" is stupid and honestly pretty shady.' ],

       'Been playing this for almost 3 years. No good runes, no good mobs. I get bored even more. Nothing new, the same mobs over and over. Too time consuming to sesrch for runes.  Ould have reached conqurer but because of bad rune as unable to find good runes. Friends keep getting new, good OP mobs and im still stuck here with everything the same thing. Just like how boring life is.',
       'The event doesn\'t work for me, there\'s some kind of bug saying the page can\'t be loaded. Fix it please! Also, the summon rates dropped very very rapidly. I have wasted literally tens of mystery scrolls and never got a 3+ monster! This seems to happen only @ Asian server and not Europe tho! Like, seriously what\'s going on here??',
       'Give it a chance.. I didn\'t really like it at first it was very tedious. Just at the beginning, it gets fun. Now I\'ve played for 2 years. Always events going on and ways to get free resources. It\'s possible to play all the time free to play I do.',
       'Love this game. It does take time to prgress but thats good, and atleast with everything that goes on and regular events it keeps it interesting. Can be frustrating especially when you get a load of mystical scrolls and you keep getting the same rubbish 3 star monsters. Yes things are expensive, but then you can still make your way through without paying. Thanks for the great game',

And evem being moved to sd card; i always have to delete more and more stuff on my phone to the point this game is the only app allowed on my phone. While fixing bugs n such... Why not work on the updates taking less room. No reason in the WORLD a game should take up so much space. FIX AND ILL GIVE 5* RATING.' ],

I only play for fun. But it sucks hurse dick.',

       'Slotomania is not a game any more...it is a money making scheme for someone....It is just no more fun to play....if you want you can dish out so manny big wins but if you want to be nasty if you don\'t get rated when you get asked for it you can forget to win anything.....The Quest is one big joke because you will not allow us to complete it. The hole game is one big joke you controle everything...I am not going to let you upset me any more like this by making me lose all my coins for not giving you 5 stars....Like i said Slotomania is not a game any more it is a money making bussnis!!!!!!!!! If you want me to win then i win but if you want me to lose then i lose......I sepose i am going to lose very big now!!!!!!',
       'RIG-OMANIA! is even worse this sloto card campaign!! They say it\'s an ACE game-but NEVER give out an ace pack, or rarely even any random cards during play of an "ACE game"!!! This will prob be deleted, since they only post the "rosy" reviews, get a different game =this one has LOST any glory it used to have!!!',

       'One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.',

     [ 'I think this is an exceptionally well made game. This truly is a great golf game. Here\'s where it falls flat... I feel as if you must spend money in order to receive all the benefits that the game had to offer.  If you have 8Ball pool, then this will make sense to you. You can still curve your shot, even if you don\'t pay for anything in the game. In this game, however, you cannot adjust the curve at all when you use the basic ball. I feel as if it is closer to "Pay to Win" than other games of similar nature.',
       'Stop changing the winf its getting boring now !!  I mastered the wind only for ypu to make it not work in in some games or even make the wind twice as strong as the value stated. You should be matched on games played not trophies. Otherwise the good players who go up the trophies quickly always play people with better clubs. The game goes easy on you if you\'re not good at it which defeats the point of getting good',
       'Good Game Ever, But suck provider ever... I can\'t believed I play with unknown character with 200 some games total but I have total game of 4000s but is he\'s in yellow color level and he controlled high hail wind on me so he could beat me right on the spot.. I don\'t know why they do this  horrible play on me I spend more than 100 of Dollars to purchase chest and other stuffs to become great player but they turn against my happiness in this wonderful game I love so much, Oh well no more buy chest this time no matter what.. Probably try another game from another provider...',
       'Thanks to this update In have now lost my second account, an account I have paid money on. I would account back or a minimum of my money refunded. Until this issue is resolved I will leave my rating at 1 and not put any more money into this game. Terrible update!',
       'Why are you matching opponents who have played 2k, 4k or even 8k games with me when I have played less than 250? This game is beyond unfair. I can nowhere near match the capabilities of the clubs. Deleted!',

       'how awful. need to buy building upgrades. building upgrades do nothing. buildings do nothing. literally do nothing. how do you get money? spin a slot machine. Thats the only way. There is no actual game here. And what happens when you run out of spins and realize you still need millions more money to upgrade worthless buildings? give them real money. this game is so lazy it might as well be classified as a scam.',

     [ 'Good game but be warned to really get any good characters you\'re either going to have to pay lots of real money or you\'ll find yourself grinding forever the same nodes to upgrade the characters that you have. With that said this game is a big improvement over heroes of dragon age of which in many ways this game is modeled after . It seems very clear that some of the devs from that game migrated to this game to start it up. The last update at 02-26-18 freezes at loading screen and then force closes come on devs get on this!',
       'I love this game but an issue im having since the newest update os why im giving 2 stars at the moment. Ever since the update the game will not load. Says "loading cantina" then closes the app completely. Im gonna end up getting kicked out of my guild...please fix this! Soon as its fixed it will return it to 5 stars bc the overall game is badass!',
       'I played this on and off since it started but now I am back full-time and it has always been improving and growing. Big star wars fan and can\'t get enough of it? This is the next best thing. The game is very complex so I suggest if you are only starting out, check out starter guides on youtube on how to have the best head start  and enjoy! 🎉',
       'My game had been freezing after last update. I ended up turning wifi off and using mobile data once it got to the update it asjed if i wanted to switch back to wifi. I did this turned off mobile data and it has worked now. On android hope this helps some other people out',
       'Some aspects of the game are very balanced and competitive, other areas (CLS, Jedi Rey) are just for the pay2play. The best way to enjoy this game is with a great guild. There are now a fair amount of ways to do that. It would be nice if the gear bottlenecks were fixed and also add another way to help support lower level players,they just get overwhelmed...Maybe donations that increase drop rates, splicing gear or smuggler runs. Bounty Hunts, that award credits or gear. There are endless ways to improve this game and it does happen, little by little, over years. The only way to play this game is with patients, even if you are will to drop tons of money on this game you will not be competitive in a day, week or month.',
       'Graphics are good, turn based matches are decent to play.  Not a casual game, you have to be pretty devoted, takes a lot of time to play with so many daily events.  Character packs can be pretty expensive if you want to buy them rather than grind (think £80 for a couple of characters, then the cost to level them, talking hundreds).  All the best characters coming out now are behind a pretty steep pay wall.  If you go on holiday or mover over time zones, the payout times remain the same meaning you either have to play at strange local times or dump your account.  Lots of people have complained but it is just ignored.  Lose a * for that region bug and another for ignoring it.' ],

     [ 'It\'s a fun game but the developers have made it difficult to advance high level characters unless you want to buy "chances" to get the necessary items to advance.  When I first started playing the game the items were easier to get, now the items are VERY rare to get and more difficult to get. Most of the reward items are basic items you get just from playing the basic levels.  There\'s no real incentive to getting the treasures chests because they don\'t give valuable items.',
       'It feel like developer tries to cash is as much as possible. You can\'t develop without paying. You saving crystals just to get 3* hero to feed it to your 4*. Game don\'t stop when you receive phone call so you easily can loose alliance energy without doing any attack.',
       'It\'s a fun game. The challenges and levels are interesting and keep getting harder. But if you resource well and plan your strategies, you can play a lot smoother.   Only thing I don\'t like is the recent update... I now cannot play my regular levels. I can only do the Titan challenge and the raids... please fix ♡',
       'I really enjoy this game. Being in a powerful alliance really helps. What frustrates me the most is the inability to obtain 6 star characters. I have tried paying for epic summons, nope. Upgraded my Castle and training yard to level 20. Nothing but 3 stat and an occasional (duplicate) 4 star character. I feel like I should be at endgame status by now. I lose Raids often because in the Platinum tier, most people already have all 5 star characters. What\'s the incentive to keep playing?? Tap Sports Baseball 17, for example, give random gifts of high level players that encourages players to continue playing their game.  Please allow us easier access to top tier 5 star characters!!!',
       'You totally ruined the raids.  Now it always puts you against higher players and gives them massive turns.  You messed it up it your newest update. No way to win and totally unbalanced.  You waste massive food never to get anyone your level and lose massive trophies. Bad bad bad',
       'I\'ve been playing for a couple months now, and at least for the last month or so the game has definitely plateaued. All of my heroes are near max level, and I need some four stars to progress, so I\'m stuck just training over and over hoping for the best, with a two day wait between draws, and a sub 5% chance of success.   Really fun for the beginning, but like all mobile games, it relies on you paying to access higher level content.' ],

It\'s the only Blizzard game u can play on Mobile. I\'m a legend (highest skill tier) ranked and totally F2P so the people who say this game is pay to win or random luck do not understand the game. Paying for is meant for helping you finish your collection fast. Overall highly recommended.',
       'I used to play the old tcg and this not  close to be a good card game. All it is is monster with power, moslty no spell, no artifact, no nothing. This game is boring and is lagging so much on the cellphone. Shadowverse is ways better for a similar formula, has a really good storyline and a waaaaay more generous. When you buy card for HS you get mostly nothing. They had the chance to do something good, everyone love the lore of warcraft, but they BS it.',

IGG is still unbelievably money hungry for their newest released things - but I guess it\'s better to wait for everything or pay for it upfront. I chose option 1. Thank you IGG for making rolling a little more fair.',
       'I\'ve played for 3 years and this game has just gone way downhill, this is the biggest pay to win game that exists. It\'s enjoyable to see people have the ability to buy what I worked so hard during the last 3 years for a mere $10. I haven\'t enjoyed this game in months, it\'s a chore to still play. Download only if you\'re willing to drop a fortune.',
       'WTH HAS HAPPENED?? Been playing for 3+ years and have NOT EVER seen the game "rolling" system so broken. I have not rolled anything worth a $$@ in almost 3 MONTHS. Don\'t give me the it\'s random thing. I have never had anything like this until after an update a couple months back. You have obviously changed the system and it is apparently to screw the long timers in favor of generating more $$ but it\'s only making long timers like me BORED and frustrated!! I\'m not spending any more money until it\'s fixed. Tired of wasting cash!',
       'nice game for the others saying that this is a copy of coc it has a lot of difference this game is more easy to play than coc. coc is a hard game more time o upgrade more time on things in this in only 5 m its fast becouse it is free and you already have a hero if you start the game in coc you ned to be th lvl 7 to get it or 8 idk but dont say that coc an cc is the same becouse your wrong of saying that they are the same (^_^)',

It doesn\'t take any internet and the animals in details so good and the graphics. If you\'re ever bored you should download this game and play it all the time.',

       'Sometimes it feels like the difficulty of the levels is way off. Levels labeled "hard" or "super hard" are many times much easier than standard levels. I do enjoy the amount of unlimited lives given, and the speed at which lives are replenished, however. Overall, a good time-passer',
       'Guys, you have a glitch that needs fixed. Side game (right now the ignite game) causes app to close every time. Also... Inserting the gold in the piggy bank takes way too long. Speeding up that process or allowing a skip feature would be nice.',
       'It\'s been at least 3 or 4 weeks since I\'ve been able to accept any lives given by friends. For a game that has so many downloads, developers sure have an issue addressing mad fixing it. I\'ve list roughly 100 lives to this issue. Please fix it!!!',
       'I adore this game. However, I have had 7 gold bars for over a year and every time I win a level that awards lots of gold bars the game tells me my bank is full... even though everything costs at least 9 gold bars. According to my math I should have over 100 bars. I would settle for two at this point.' ],

Sent off request to support a number of times with proof and no reply, and after a week still no reward.   So if you are downloading this to get reward from another app don\'t bother as you won\'t get it',
       'I like the game but it is hard for players who can\'t buy a lot of packs. Some slight tweaks to make it not so slanted towards big spenders.  Maybe make some exchange rate for silver to gold without changing the silver availability or price. Someway that gold can be acquired beside the little in the ground. I understand the game has to make a profit and so you should but more people would continue to play instead of giving up Anyway just a couple of thoughts. Got plenty more on just general gameplay  that I think would be useful. Again, not hating as I like and play the game.',
       'Still got trouble with the game, as it still freezing up somtimes and cannot attack other jarls like this. The game is no good like this as if I uninstall it I will loose all that I have achieved. Doing this review, texting this mail is smooth running but when I go into the game it starts to freeze up. Can you please help me as other people in my clan are let down by me.  I did rate the game, as very good when first downloaded but now it is rubbish.',

Vikings is not a bad game on itself but I feel cheated when I\'m promised something and IronSource does not honor their part of the bargain. IronSource said the Plarium did not verify my completion of the offer, so I won\'t play it anymore nor try other Plarium content nor IronSource advertised games. The actual content is fine, but the business practices are deplorable.',

     [ 'Someone needs to be fired or at least schooled on currency exchange rates. They offer 2 packs for 5 and 20 then except for rare sales which offer 49 and 79 dollar packs everything is 100 dollars google should step in and pull this game off the google play market for a square enix licensed product they have enough backing to have actual microtransactions not be a game exclusive to rich people who use 100 dollar bills as toilet paper...',
       'Please understand that there is really nothing free about this game except the install. While the gameplay WAS very promising at first, purchaseable bonus packs take any strategy completely out of the game. Now, in addition, each new element of the game that has been released in recent weeks requires cash to unlock. I can only use about half of the games features now. Bummer. If you\'re willing to pay, have a blast with this game. Otherwise leave it alone!',
       'I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.',
       'This game has potential to be fun but it\'s completely ruined because IT\'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don\'t get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it\'s full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it\'s a complete money bucket!',
       'This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.',
       'The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it\'s free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15' ],

It\'s not identical to other games of this type, as the challenges are similar yet different. The scenario of the game is basic with the others. I have a variety when it comes to games, this one has similar sound affects to other games that I, personally, downloaded. (But they\'re also from the same makers.) This game is over all.... Good so far.. I would recommend, linked my account to this game and invited friends and family. (I only do so, if the game/app is worthy. I\'m a picky bull!!!!) Overall, you\'ll have fun! Cute toys and  unique power ups, with a slightly (10%) twist.',

Can you please make changes',

Sometime when I run the game it\'s not response (all animation are moving, but it isn\'t resopnse when I press the screen) , so I have to close it and run it again many times till it response.

     [ 'The game had me hooked as I spent a week trying to find a character and job class I liked. Keep in mind that you will be doing a lot of grinding, but leveling is not surprisingly unreasonable.  There are some aspects that will make you believe you have to pay to win, but it is not necessary. Although it would be cool to help the devs or too. All in all love the game and can\'t seem to put it down ( I let it auto-grind while I live my life. Haha).',
       'Well, I loved the looks of it. Seemed really fun so I downloaded it. Then I spent 30 min downloading the patches, to find out at the very end I didnt have enough space on my phone. Uninstalled as much as I could, and still didn\'t have enough space... Could have said in details of the game how much space it REALLY takes up... Would have been really nice to know.  -a not so happy consumer',
       'So, far really love to play. I only just started though. The controls are hard but that\'s probably because I\'m playing on a tablet and I got small hands. Unfortunately, I don\'t think I\'ll be able to continue playing this. For some reason it makes my tablet terrifyingly hot to the point I\'m concerned. I\'ll hold on to the app for now in case it gets better in the future.',
       'An amazing mmo that really does a great job of handling farming, the game play although has an auto feature still utilizes the controls. The depth of all the items and armor and weapons is awesome. I\'ve been really happy playing this game. The clans are great. The 30 vs 30 opensiege is a nice feature. This game is super fun even for the people that want to play for free. Netmarble does a great job with daily rewards, login bonuses, and events that all allow for players to get great items for free!! Best game I\'ve played in a long while. Only thing is constant crashes and bad story line. The game keeps me turning it back on and I haven\'t went one day without logging in.',
       'Addicting game with auto-questing and battling. You can choose to do it manually, which I do for boss fights. I don\'t have to buy anything from the shop, in fact, you get free gear every day! The graphics are amazing for a mobile game with it being an MMO. I have a Note 8, so it does run really well. I play with my monitor using SideSync for full screen awesomeness. There is a lot to do for all types of players, being in a guild doing dungeons reminds me of the old-school MMORPGs of sieging and doing weekly raids.',
       'Everything about this game is really good, but since this update today I can\'t even open the game it keeps closes and sending me to my home screen on my phone... Doesn\'t give me a error report or any messages just closes the app. Id really like to continue playing please fix . Galaxy S8+' ],

     [ 'This is a wonderful, well made, fun game!  Also highly addictive.    Really enjoy it a lot.      With that said, the biggest downside, IMO, is that rewards are few, & far between, and there is no way to get gold bars without paying for them.  These become rather needed the further you get and for certain individual, and more difficult, "puzzles".  It can become too expensive to play (if one really want to get somewhere in this game).',
       'Fun and addictive game.  I really like it.  The aim and control of the wand can be improved as it often misfires and the bubble is not where it was aimed for.  Great adventures and quests. I know longer get the daily award for some reason.  And you have to wait a long time for a new life (30 mins).',
       'Addictive but too rigged. The rules are inconsistent which spoils it a bit. Eg.  Sometimes the fairies burst one bubble of the same colour and sometimes all. There are other inconsistencies. The other irritation is noisy push notifications can\'t be turned off.',
       'Love this game. Would like some competition at some point. Also, I wish there were more challenges like the Halloween treats one. It was really fun. Not too sure about the latest updates though, the owls are almost camouflaged now. But great game!',
       'This game is fun , but I don\'t like the fact that you have to pay for things take for example I have a full piggy bank but I am certainly not going to pay to retrieve them. Also the game cheats as many a time I should have completed a level but my shot went in a totally different direction . A free to play game should be just that and all coins ,gold bars etc should be able to be retrieved to help you on your journey through the game. Oh and by the way the star rating thing it just shot right of the page and on to the next bit before I got a chance my overall rating for the game is three stars . What has happened to the daily reward haven\'t had that for a while.  Still have a full piggy bank butvlije I said before should be able to retrieve the gold bars without having to pay to do so .',
       'Still playing but it took me over 3 weeks to get through level 143 because I refuse to waste money buying gold or power.  Finally the algorithm let me win.  I do love popping bubbles while resisting the temptation to spend $$. Hate the change in the owls.  They look more like angry birds.' ],

     [ 'This game is lots of fun and feels like fire emblem. Lots to do and more strategy then you\'d expect. Only issue I have is that the pricing structure for orbs and the RNG of summons don\'t make sense. Feels like I can\'t support the game financially even if I wanted to because I know I\'d likely get nothing from any summoning pools I did and even the most expensive orb amount would only let you do a few summoning pools. They are generous with free orbs though.',
       'Mostly good, but lagged occasionally. The pricing for unlocking potential to a 5 star costs way too many feathers. I feel if you could purchase feathers, then the pricing would seem a bit more fair, though a better solution would be to either slightly lower the amount needed or slightly raise the amount earned from things other than arena and events',
       'Do you like spending a long time plotting out team builds and careful moves, while also seeing a wide cast of interesting characters whose relationships you can shape?  You\'ll like Fire Emblem series, then.  OK, now do you ALSO like casual tap games?  Yeah, because that\'s what this is, now.  A genre mash-up so stupid almost nobody can enjoy it.',
       'It\'s fun to pick up and play but limits of 10 teams of 4 ruins replayability considering how many playable characters there are. It\'s tedious swapping characters in and out, especially when you have spent time levelling some over others.  Having an unlimited amount of teams or increasing the number of members per team would be very welcome. Otherwise, having so many characters left unused or having to sell is a big miss.',
       'I\'ve never played any Fire Emblem before. This was shown to me by a buddy who has similar  taste in games as me. This game is incredible; super fun. It\'s a great way to pass the time. The only thing I don\'t like is that you have to be connected to Internet all the time. I wish you could play offline.',
       'So. I\'ll try to keep this short.  I really like it as a game to pass the time or to keep me busy. The art style is amazing, gameplay is still the same yet fun as the others and such.  But my issue is the reward orbs.. Actually, orbs in general. You only get one per story stage and such, no matter how far you gotten or the difficulty setting, which makes it hard to get more than one summon.  And I think they tried to make it where everyone has to work for it, cause the prices to buy a few orbs is pretty pricey in my case. If they made the story stages and such give more orbs when you get further and such, it would feel more rewarding.  And to add onto it, levelling up.. It\'s sort of a semi grind and patience, but I think there\'s a easy fix that I haven\'t found yet.  Either way, it\'s still a fun game in my view. Would play it as a game to pass the time.' ],

If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy?

I also recoomend to have a time limit for coc, like coc automatically switch off if the user plays coc more than 1 hour. Long Live COC!',
       'Its an awesome game. The new concept of supercell id is cool but switching is little time taking. I Would request you guys to make it easier or add some shortcut to switch accounts.

Otherwise the concept is really good it saves RAM of phone as u dnt need play games and services updated. 😀' ],

Only problem is that friend invitations are limited, which means you can\'t add new guild members as you play longer... It is ridiculous to artificially limit invites without also providing a mechanism to add new. For example, lose a guild member, gain an invitation. Or, gain a guild member, gain an invite.' ],

     [ 'I never had to pay a single cent for this game, and it\'s working out perfectly fine for me. Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don\'t like my non-responsive faction members and I\'m worried once I leave my faction I couldn\'t join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.',
       'Game is really good! Currently level 10 & I am doing pretty good. (For what I think) It\'s a fun game to play you can get free coins which makes it more fun and fair for players that can\'t pay for anything, except patience. I do wish it\'ll be easier to level up characters. But it\'s pretty easy. Just so difficult to get more characters to pay for level ups.',
       'This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn\'t make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!',
       'Awesome game based on the comics. The only set back is that I can\'t seem to be able to download the content for the third chapter on the story map. It goes so far into the download and then stops.   I have already uninstalled and reinstalled the game three times. And I have even deleted unused/unwanted files from my phone to free up some extra space, and it hasn\'t made any difference.   I don\'t know what else I can do.',
       'Do not waste your time and/or money on this game. Scopely has presented you with a pay to win nightmare. Only the top 2% of spenders get catered to in terms of toons and weapons, and top factions band together to destroy the experience for everyone else. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!',
       'No one from the support team will respond. My game was unistalled and reinstall and I lost 2 years worth of data. Can\'t remember sync it and I know scopely can do it for me. I\'ve provided everything they need and still nothing via email or in-game support. Will change my rating if this is sorted' ],

You know the formula: spend money, build fast, get stomped by the kiddies with access to daddy\'s credit card who spend thousands of $$$.    Guaranteed to trigger the easily offended due to scantily clad women.  Hilariously bad "Engrish" text throughout the game.    Just get your currency for whatever other game it is you play as fast as possible and move on.',
       'They keep killing you to make more money. You can grow as much as you wish, whether you pay or not, these devs will just create more fake accounts to create revenue. Very unethical practices and immaturity is at the peak too. They have absolutely no professionalism. They openly admit that you can\'t beat them at their own game and will tell you in a very shameless way that the money is all they care about. Kids with ego keep buying stuff and they keep fuelling racial hate through their Chinese profanity all the time. Literally the worst game devs I\'ve ever seen. Would be 5 stars if this was not a fraud scheme of a game.',

I am enjoying this immensely.  Edit after (time seems like forever,)  I am really enjoying this,  Negotiated a couple of Peace Treaties, built my crew and strength, I am getting to be a force to reckon with... But there are still bigger fish, frustrating  Would love a feature to hunt the attacker, but then that would backfire too,   Great game...lots of challenges and opportunities for growth,  Highly recommended   *****',

       'This game would be amazing if they took away the 10 different flashing and bouncing icons from the main screen that are there just to try and sell you something. Global chat is a NIGHTMARE. Nothing but kids and teenagers talking about sex and asking for nude pics of each other on Instagram. If you can block all that out, more power to you, and enjoy what would probably be a pretty fun game otherwise. I tried it for a few days and am uninstalling it for the reasons I mentioned above.',
       'Nice game. I just thought that the Babe game part should be a bit more easier and less difficult coz its hard to score the chicks when your way up to level 11 and getting to the yatch. But the rest of the gameplay is fun and challenging. Overall... its a Good Fun Game. Awesome.' ],

Would rate higher if someone would help me out..',

     [ 'Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I\'m 32 and play this often so it\'s not just for kids . Give it a try it\'s very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen 😉',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.',
       'Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can\'t do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!',
       'I Loooove Fishdom!!!😁 I\'m absolutely addicted to this wonderfully fun & challenging game. The graphics are very cute & entertaining. The only issue i have is that I\'m up in levels 180+ & there\'s just NO way to make the amount of coins to purchase ALL the decos/plants i earn. Most are priced too high.',
       'I love this game, its very challenging. The only thing I don\'t like is that your aquariums end up way overcrowded with stuff before you can move to the next aquarium. Of course you can move on to the next one as soon as its unlocked, but I won\'t move on until I have all 3 stars. So honestly, I guess this is just my issue. I probably should have given it 5 stars, because my issue is the only reason I didn\'t.',
       'So far I like it. But not on a very high level well see how this progresses. Well now I\'m on a level that I keep losing  by one  or ten mainly bcuz all the graphics  are stationed in the exact space so. And while it\'s true u don\'t need WiFi to play u do need it for ur daily prize which u really need.' ],

The people I\'ve met on this game were pretty kind, the battle simulating is a nice touch which I haven\'t seen anywhere else. Sad that I only get to see like 3/4 models of the same monsters though.',
       'This is a war game where no one wants ts to fight. Don\'t try attacking anyone bigger than you. They won\'t fight you back, they will just attack your buildings, which you won\'t be able to defend. It costs real money to avoid having them destroyed. Spend your time and money somewhere else.',

And this game seems great to where you don\'t have to spend much and actually enjoy the game. The graphics on her are amazing. I would suggest playing this game to all. 👍👊',

If your not prepared to spend a lot of money your just going to get wiped out by those who do or their hacker friends. This game isn\'t worth the time and data needed to play until there is a level and fair playing field.',

     [ 'It\'s a pretty amazing game, like league of legends but what makes it amazing is that you can play it on your phone. The only problem is the prices of the heroes and skins. Most of the heroes are 32k battle points.. So it would be fair if it was at least 5k cheaper than that. Also the game lags sometimes which interups gameplay which can cause you to unexpectedly die.  For anyone who is reading this, I highly recommend this game to anyone.  It\'s amazing and extremely addictive!!',
       'I think this game is great! I play It Almost Everyday And My Mum Always Has To Scold Me For Playing Too Much! Its Addictive And Fun To Play! Just A Few Things You Guys Could Work On. 1)I Hope That You Guys Will Let Us BE ABLE To Sell Hereos And I Bet Others Agree. 2)I Also Hope You Guys MAKE IT EASIER For Us To Get BP\'S I Really Really Hope You Guys Get To Fulfill My Request! Its a good game!',
       'Not enough with unskippable tutorials now you want us to level up till lvl 8 to be able to change account? Here\'s some suggestion, make a button just before the tutorial, for login purposes for those who have old accounts. I mean, people sometimes reset their phone and you want us to play till level 8 again just so we can play old account? Be realistic developers.',
       'Quite simply a super fun game. This game does exactly what it is supposed to, which is provide a fun portable moba experience condensed into short bursts of fun. This is one of the few games where even losing is a fun experience for me. Pros - wide range of heroes, fun over the top cartoon graphics, multiple game modes, great community and incredible speed of matchmaking that still some how retains quality of matchups. Cons - I am personally not a fan of the joystick based control system, the heroes require quite a bit of time playing before you can get enough in game currency to unlock them. So if you haven\'t already started playing this game then you are definitely missing out',
       'Being Honest this game hasnt really been up to date with others competitors. One thing I think would be lovely is a training camp/single player bot practices to do with new heros. Maybe a small revamp to the art style like 5% realism. And to decrease the amount of gold heros cost, really turns down the tone to play more for new heros',
       'Edit from my earlier review.  I re-downloaded this game after giving yall some time to work through some issues Id been having.  Lo and behold... All of my progress is gone. I was a high level with numerous heroes and skins I cant get anymore. Yet when I relog in from my google account and my FB account, it still has me at this new level with none of my stuff. What the heck yall.' ],

And some items I\'ve purchased don\'t work it gives a message saying they couldn\'t find it in the warehouse. But the game never gave me my gems back and of money. NEED TO FIX IT',
       'Creative...I have noticed that a majority of winning designs are poor in design and get 5 Stars. I don\'t think voters are taking the time to vote for the best of two and are just punching the = sign to get through the process. Would like ability to buy table, wall art and floor plants with both diamonds and cash. More videos to earn diamonds. Fix the video for diamonds feature-it keeps sticking in the "loading" mode. A more equal purchase/design ability would be appreciated. Increase daily reward and diamonds.',
       'I love this game!! "it helps a lot" with my shopping addiction because I feel like I\'m buying real merchandise. I really enjoy the updates and how you guys added more room to be designed!!!! Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))',
       'I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.',
       'Great application. Very enjoyable. Only complaint wish app had more international design furniture to match the themes and settings. Also need to fix the bug so that the design loading screen appears.  This is the only app that I have to reset my tablet to get my results, since the last update I have had this issue. I have made an inquiry adressing this issue and it still has not been fixed. I have changed my rating because of this issue, once it has been addressed and fixed I may change my opinion.',
       'Entertaining, enjoyable and inspiring! Brings out  your creativity in utilizing your available resources and in maximizing your limited funds. The game makes you travel around the globe.

     [ 'l was enjoying the game a lot and would have given it 5 stars. l spent a long time to get enough bricks to  build a level 7 home so dragons only needed 7 mins sleep.. NOW    only  the same 5 of my 30 dragons get out and this is making collecting bricks and healing power very slow. l have not seen all my green dragons and moon dragons( the hardest workers) for 2 days now. developers please help or l will stop playing. TY.',
       'I would love to give this game 5 stars but 99% of the ground I\'ve uncovered is covered by "treasure chests" and there\'s no way to get rid of them or contact the game makers for help. I\'ve completely run out of space and can\'t play anymore. The chests should disappear after 3 - 5 days if they\'re not opened.',
       'Love this game. Graphics are great and so much to do. Keeps me going for ages. Main concern and the reason I\'ve not rated 5 star is the time it takes to get each token. When some levels take 7 and it takes half a day to fill up it\'s a major pain. Then you do a level that needs 4 and the next also 4 it takes the p*ss. Would be great to have a higher limit without getting charged or for them to fill up quicker. If this was done I would rate 5 star all round.',
       'I really want to love this game but the time mechanics in it are just too much. An hour for one game token and most of the maps after the tutorials cost more than one token to play. I have to wait 3 hours to play one round? I really like this game, the merging mechanics are addicting and fun! I find my self between kicking myself for popping something early and getting excited for getting close to going just one more level up, but I almost have to literally forget about the game in order to get any sort of meaningful play time out of this game.',
       'I really loved this game when I first started playing it. But you are making me hate it by making the challenges way too difficult to complete in the time frame period or forcing me to spend money to buy gems to help me defeat the challenge levels but then I still can\'t beat them. Yes, most people like a challenge but when you make the challenge so difficult that it takes you days or weeks to get through it, it loses its hold on you and you start getting frustrated and angry instead of wanting to play the game.',
       'Reason I changed from 5 star rating to 4 stars is before a recent update, you only needed 1 dragon chalice to play any level. Got changed to needing more than 1 on most levels, which wouldn\'t be so bad if they didn\'t make you wait 1 hour to get 1 dragon chalice back. Used to only be a 15 minute wait between chalice\'s. If it goes back to old way......5 stars again! Still a great game' ],

     [ 'I love the game and the vast amount of playable characters, however the sound effects overall aren\'t great but the gameplay is very good. One problem I do have however is that there are in models (such as thanos and Kang) but you can\'t play as them. Personally thanos is easily my favorite marvel character and the fact that I can\'t use him is a little upsetting. But overall its a great game with monthly updates and great new characters! Can\'t wait for more!',
       'Hi. Instead of writing a review, I\'d like to suggest a few things. I\'d love to see these changes in game: Please add these characters-  Fantastic Four, MCU Captain America, MCU Winter Soldier, Scarlet Spiderman, Spider woman, Lizard, Apocalypse,x force wolverine, Wasp, Penance, Nova, Quicksilver, Nick Fury, Silver surfer, Doctor Doom, Galactus .            Edit:  1.Change the type of Juggernaut from Mystic to Mutant. Because he is a mutant 2. Add a range mechanics like you did in Transformers Forged to Fight 3. Please buff Superior Iron man and the regular one too. They shouldn\'t be this weak',
       'Love marvel and this is the most descent game ever been created in the history of mobile games plus I got 5 star scarlet witch and she is OP as hell bruh she is amazing. But however I love black panther the best and hulk is lame as hell.😁😁😁',
       'I was doing trial of infinite when maintainance popped up and now 6 daily boosts and 1 lesser hero boost is wasted. Also i wnt be able to finisH quest without em. Thanks kabam',
       'In short I am a 415K+ rated player and this latest "update."  I use the term "update" sparingly, is total trash. If I could only rate this game and company lower than zero I absolutely would!!!!',

     [ 'Enjoyable game, lots of freebies.  I now need to change up my review.i had made a purchase in the game during a "Spin and Win" promotion, that purchase stated that I would receive 10m chips for every 2k league points, at end of promotion, I did not receive any of my chips as promised per promotion advertising. I followed the process of getting in touch with Huuuge Casino and was told once that someone would be in touch with me, as of this listing I still have not heard back from anyone.',
       'I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won\'t give up.. And I\'m not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won\'t put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I\'ll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.',
       'So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em\' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.',
       'DO NOT BOTHER  playing this game. IT IS PAY TO PLAY. It used to be a really great game. Have met some really great people. Huge makes constant updates and each time they do, they pay less. People are leaving in droves to go to other games. YOU BLEW IT HUUGE!!',
       'I really enjoyed playing early on , payouts were nice and I really like the club I\'m in. Lately I\'ve noticed I don\'t get paid for all my winning spins, sometimes they would have been big payouts. Hit the same exact thing a few spins later and it will pay so I have to wind up buying more chips. Just like a real casino I don\'t expect to always win, but if I do hit something even a real casino pays so that needs t o be addressed.',
       'HORRIBLE. The graphics and slots are cool. But what fun is a game that is almost impossible to win at. I say that because I play 5 different accounts and 3 I haven\'t won anything nice in almost 6 months and 2 it\'s been about 3. Bad luck you keep telling me, I say it\'s all the updates you have done. You guys ruined what was once a fun game. If you looking to have fun and win, look some place else. I\'ve been trying for months to establish a descent chip count, not happening on this game' ],

If u do add this (u should) make it as rare as Emerald but make it have tools and armor. These should be as good as diamond but as enchantable as gold. If you do add it (plz) I should also have a little less durability than diamond. Plz consider. (Also it took me for ever to think of what to say) ps. Emerald tool and armor would be cool too',

     [ 'I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I\'m a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events.',
       'I love the game. From its cute and addictive style to its unique and original dress up gameplay, it turned me from a dress up hater to lover. But I feel like there\'s a Paywall especially during events, and diamonds are forced to be bought, but they can be earned, which is good. But so far, you seem to have listened to feedback, from the skin tones to the bug fixes. But I love it still.',
       'In depth in both gameplay and attention to details of awarded items. Continuous hours not required but with once a day of incentive activities. Controls are  sometimes unstable. If a glitch does happen, its fixed fast and your also awarded for time spent. Very happy customer. Enjoyed the best dress up game I\'ve played so far. Thank you makers!',
       'Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted',
       'I never write reviews, but this game really deserves a high one. I got this game because my friend Emily adores it, and I have been playing NON STOP. It\'s so beautiful and high quality for just a dress up game. It\'s absolutely wonderful. My favorite thing is that you can really enjoy the game without having to use real money on in app purchases. Yeah, you can if you want to, but your experience isn\'t less if you don\'t. A high quality and fun game. I adore it',
       'I had seen many ads for it and was kind of interested, but I didn\'t think a dress-up game could be that fun. One day I couldn\'t find any games I wanted to play, so I decided to give it a shot. To my surprise, I am really enjoying it! So if you\'ve had any inkling of interest in this game, give it a shot. You might enjoying as much as I have.' ],

     [ 'This is an updated comment. I already loved the game just thought it needed better controls. Have to say after the update I gave it a perfect score. It\'s sleek smooth and just all around fun. It\'s very clear they took consumer complaints into consideration and it\'s good to see. Highly recommend if you love GOT and these style of games. Only negative is the farther you advance into the game the more I get the feel of a page of wind kind of situation which is sad but it\'s still worth it.',
       'The game is super sluggish gets very annoying. The rss are way to low and not able to be gotten and when you do farm you get almost nothing total waste of time. There needs to be a system to see where\'re you and your guild ranks in your world.and the basic rss your own keep gives you are way to low for a game of this type 12 hours should not produce only 6k wood at lvl 20',
       'Had issues as of 22/02/18 again. World and War room access constantly loading. Before then, the tool bar on the right flashing and lagging. Since update at 18:00 on 22/02/18 have not been able to log back on. I have submitted tickets about this issue before and the reply via email is that the ticket has been closed. Go to support via website and forum and tired every step and more. No help.',
       'I finally decided to uninstall it after realising that if you don\'t spend, you don\'t win. Eventually you just become a Farm for the high-spenders they come attack you and there you go, back to square one and back to more spending.',

       'Game glitches constantly. People in k63 are using bots to cheat. WB won\'t do anything about the cheating! Forces people to spend huge sums of real money to be able to gain power to play the game. Features are placed in the game but not active; some are no longer listed as "under development" but still don\'t work. Game should have undergone a lot more work before being released. Upgrade requirements for resources are impossible to meet without buying them. Resource nodes only go up to 130k and requirements for upgrades are in the millions. Poor to little planning went into this game.' ],

     [ 'This is actually one of my favorite Final Fantasy titles. Graphics are gorgeous. The story is pretty deep and well written. The number of playable characters is astounding and most don\'t recycle moves. The devs update it regularly and are active in communicating with the community. A few things are kinda "broken", like the arena. And Microtransactions aren\'t overpowering, but they\'re there... 4/5',
       'Hi Gumi. I only started like last week of November. But I became an instant addict with this game. It has a lot of potential to be the best game on the mobile market. However, recent events and actions of the company stained the gameplay and soul of the players. It\'s like the events are not planned anymore, just putting something for us. And then this recent cash summon banner. This type of move is disrecpectful to us. I hope you can still turn it around. We will be waiting and I will still be playing to see what will happen. Thank you for this wonderful game.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game since shortly after launch, and I love the gameplay and nostalgia it has to offer. However, the company has lately been predatory with low value bundles, which at first glance, might look like a good deal to a newer player. I would warn new players not to buy anything in-game until they get their act together.  Also, the game has been more buggy than usual lately, but I\'ll let that slide and hope it gets better.  In short, this is a 5 star game run by a 1 star company.',
       'This recent GUMI bundle offer really put a bad taste on the game for me. It really was not a favorable cash bundle for loyal customers in my opinion. I wish the banner was only 20 dollars or less or provided the loyal customer the choice of which 5* character they wanted guaranteed.  GUMI, please change this business practice and take care of the great community instead of continuing down this path of bringing the game down in customer loyalty and fun!!. The quality of the events, rewards, etc have dropped.',
       'After all the previous issues of bugs, hacking, etc, the game has really picked up its slack. The game is so muchs smoother now and seems like more effort has gone in to it. Drop rates still seem low, since the 3x boost I still receive basics, but that\'s not a huge issue as theres always a free giveaway every week. Overall the game is finally enjoyable without constant issues',
       'I like the game but the summon rates are just messed up. My friends sat down with me and watched, on multiple occasions, where I would do like ten or 11 summons all at once and Id get 10 or 11 of the same unit. Ive summoned enough gokens to get 2 of his tmrs, same with yuri and conrad. While these tmrs are good, I would like to have more than a pool of ten units to summon from, Im just sayin 🙄' ],

     [ 'This game needs the ability to gain more township cash. I have spent way too much real money to buy township cash and im not doing so again at this rate. Farmville isnt this bad and hard to expand.  You cant expand the barn without waiting on products by train or paying in township cash to expand. And that costs over a couple hundred township cash for each expansion. Getting a dollar or two here and there takes forever to collect. Plus the expansion makes small expansions so it doesnt help much.   If something dont change i may quit the game. I enjoy it and would like to continue but at this rate i dont see much point. I cant afford to pay more money to play.',
       'The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen',
       'RSYFJH Great game very addictive, and I don\'t know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats\'s kind of ridiculous. That\'s the only bad thing I have to say about this game.',
       'BEST GAME EVER! It\'s my biggest game but even though I have an old phone the game still runs really smoothly. There\'s always something to do, it never gets boring. I\'ve been playing for 8 months. Super easy to use and learn. It\'s addictive. You also don\'t feel pressured to make purchases like other games.',
       'I love this game. Amazing sound effects, graphics. You guys did a great job that\'s for sure! But still couldn\'t give it a five star because of the lastest update. The entire screen goes black after playing the game for 5-6 minutes. That\'s pretty irritating not to mention how much slower the phone gets as well. Didn\'t have these issues with the last update. Fix it please!',
       'I think this game is really great and addictive, especially when you start playing tge regetta. I  love my coop members, they are a great team.  I just wish they would let us cancel orders in factories, because often you order stuff but then a train arrives and your priorities change...' ],

The lag will prevent you from using spells and being able to fully compete against the enemy. When this happens it takes days to heal your troops. Fix the lag and this has the potential of being a 5 star game',

       'A great game and extremely addictive once you really get into it. Well thought out. It can be very time consuming but that is what makes it great. The grind to level up Heroes makes me want to come back and carry on, unlock other heroes and further upgrade my Kingdom. My only issue is the fact that resources are hardly able to be kept. Being under constant attack from other groups and unable to allow my Kingdoms walls to regenerate properly before I am able to move again seems to be a recurring issue and one I do feel needs to be looked at and tweaked. Nonetheless, I\'m impressed with the game. Continue with the good updates and this game could be one of the best mobile games out there.',

     [ 'This game was great until about 5 days ago, that is when it started to take 4 to 5 minutes loading time for each game mode to start. Now my attention span prevents me from waiting that long to play one game. What happened game developers?.... !!UPDATE!! Okay it must have just been the servers. Because they\'re back up and running at 32 seconds loading time for a war. This game is great. I can dig it can you dig it',
       'They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It\'s definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you\'ll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.',
       'Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don\'t be fooled. This is a pay to win game.',
       'A great game that brings back the old Mech warrior days. One of the few good theme fps shooters on this platform that is "FREE". You can pay to win but it will cost you alot. Investing afew tens to smoother the growth? But you can still have plenty of fun without spending a dime.  Until it slowly draws you in deeper.....',
       'I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that\'s cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!',
       'Game plays fine. No ability to choose mode is a major letdown. I did the $20 test to see if you can actually buy anything valuable. The answer is no. The game is geared towards the have money people. Update 2/23/2018  The queing is under 10 seconds. After Lunar New Year update you can earn upgrades better.  Discounts on purchase items is better.' ],

Everyone has their own way of saying, yes that\'s how I would if I really could.  You end up creating a bond or developing a relationship  with it.  Take it to the next level!  Gear ratios and n02 pushezes and grip are all good but let\'s envelop.  I know I would play more if I could truly express my kickass whip that represents  me that I have to drive!  You have a clean and immersive game. Less is more.  Thank you',
       'Customer support has won me over. They have literally provided the best resolution can think of for the game removing all my fusion parts. Hopefully I don\'t have many issues in the future but this one time moment has definitely filled me with confidence that in future, zynga will fairly sort things out.',
       'Best Drag racing game in Google play store. If you have a addictive personality don\'t play it. I do suffer from that first race was on Dec 312017 as of Feb 22, 2018 I have 208 hrs on the track 23 in the garage own 22 cars and spent over a Benjamin on it in less than a month. Ya gotta have some smarts to play and win. Money helps with extras. Only time I\'ve had a issue with it was this morning a season ended I was upgrading a Tier 5 car and paid with game money and didn\'t receive part. Still a 10 star game... Great job Developers!!',
       'Game is really great! Amazing graphics, amazing cars, lots of continuous fun! A few bugs and connection issues which can be frustrating at times especially when your team depends on you for points. Though I believe they\'ll eventually fix these issues as this is the BEST racing game out there and it\'s only getting BETTER!',
       'Love the new updates where you can carry on the trials without having to go back to the garage. It would be nice to able to trade up your keys i.e 500 bronze for 10 silver or 100 silver for 1 gold. And the stage 6 upgrades be not double up or get stage 6 upgrades relevant to the cars you have.',
       'I love this game! It\'s really addicting quick. Since it has an online feature, there is basically no end to how much fun you can have with it. I think it would be much better if you could add your own body upgrades. As in body kits, spoilers, etc. It would allow the players to have very personalized vehicles.' ],

       'Good game BUT so damn annoying when your team have to play 3 matches in 1 day. Not enough rest player limited video limited resources to heal player. Add more disappointment have do more training. End of season all player downgraded have to spend more money buying new one. Winning prize.....cheapskate .. stupid developer!',
       'Biggest problem are managers who purposely tank every season get rewarded by keeping a stronger team while managers who try to play as the game was intended get "punished" every new season. No need to spend any money on this game, just tank on purpose. The only "fair" competition is the league. Cup, champions and association tournaments are a joke infested with tankers. Worse part of all is Nordeus does nothing about it. Players lose morale regardless if they win a match, they even lose morale overnight. I played this game for over 2 years hoping it would get better. It is time to let go.',
       'Its not the best football manager game an enthusiast would like to try. The game is designed to make a win or loss based on ensuring in-game puchases ..called \'lucky\' apparently . Plus you really dont have good gaming controls while you are inside a live match. Needs improvement to make it more real and fun to be indulged in.',
       'I don\'t understand players morale policy in this game!?! When I beat opponent with 4:0, some of players drops one morale point, even if they had excellent stats. Shouldn\'t morale rise after good game. Most annoying is losing morale overnight. WHY????',
       'The time lapse between games is extremely quick, & improbable to real life! Also the amount  of training needed (4 times) between each match seems excessive!, there are some great elements  to this game, but not being able to rest PLAYERS  QUICKLY  enough! Unless you spend real money is not a TRUE reflection of the abilities of individuals  squads set up!' ],

     [ '**UPDATE** Is an awesome game. Could use a few more perks (ie. Weapons and hard to get items) in drop boxes and yellow zones.Now the down side is if you die in a level your last position is no longer there to try and recoup some of your items. Players killing you as you open trunks in inventory. Oh ya and the free spin box...give random prizes instead of coins and rope. People will get really into it if perks are awesome. Great game could be the best with a couple tweaks. Awesome job.',
       'Alright, so I don\'t normally write reviews, but I feel like this one is deserved. The games concept is great, as with most post-apocalyptic zombie games, surviving and building a base is the main goal. Great. However, it is a micro-transaction based game, meaning you have to pay for packages if you actually want to enjoy it to the fullest. Am I saying you can t enjoy it otherwise? No, I do and I don\'t pay for the packages, however, my house constantly gets destroyed, I\'m killed by other players who do pay, and my game progression is massively slow. So, I don\'t really recommend this game, if you actually want to "play" the game.',
       'This game is highly addictive. The challenges are hard but not impossible. You need patience...and planning. The Chinese new year\'s event made me used to the shortened energy usage, now that it\'s back to normal, just doesn\'t seem to be enough. But maybe that\'s where the patience comes in. Great game overall, really enjoying it.',
       'Love playing but almost impossible to make much progress.  Weapons and armor wear out way too fast, spend all my time gathering resources but never quite get everything i need. Very frustrating. Almost ready to delete it.',
       'Overall great game. Not really a fan of buying Lottery type tems in the shop ( I won\'t spend money on a CHANCE to get something good). Also I think items that you purchase are a little high in price due to the fact that they break so quickly ( Keep it a little cheaper and people will buy more). I think the food and water need is a little on the extreme side. You\'re constantly eating and drinking to stay alive. I think they should make food that is crafted last longer than something you just picked up and eat same with water versus drinks that are made. Love the fact that there is no save. It really makes it feel like a survival game. If you make a mistake you lose your stuff. Also like the fact that you can go and recover items if you die in an event or a bunker. I don\'t think I would play if you lost everything every time. With a few little tweaks to the game this could be one of the best ever.',
       'An excellent survival game. Controls are easy to use with cool, unique and smooth running graphics, even on low spec phones like mine. In gameplay, the travel duration is just a bit too long. This makes a lot of first time players loose interest in the first few stages of the game.' ],
    recentChanges: 
     [ '— Now you can change your appearance. Hair length or skin color - no problem! And you can finally play as a female character!',
       '— Sometimes Dealer will  contact you via radio and ask for certain things to make a deal.',
       '— Increased chances of “clean” boxes drop on the locations indicated on the floppy with coordinates.' ],

     [ 'I\'ve been playing on and off since the 2nd year anniversary. All around this game is awesome.  I would love more ways to grind for dragon stones tho. I\'m happy to pay for them when i can but working for them is always better.  I have a couple requests. Since you\'re bringing back old events. Can we have the one for Epic Battle! Arise, Otherworld Challengers medals. I would love to finally dokkan awaken super saiyan goku (angel) (super kaioken)  Also, is there a way we could get notifications when certain items like medals are on sale/ in Baba\'s shop?',
       'A great game many things to do. Very fun if you like dragon ball. Can be a little to hard if you don\'t want to buy dragon stones. I don\'t really know where else to write this but I have been having a problem with the evil emperor of the universe event. At the end of the event it says it gave me medals and in inventory it says I have more than enough medals, but when I go to awaken a character it says I don\'t have any. Please help',
       'I\'ve been playing this game since it first came out I even have a jp account this game is by far the greatest of all time that I myself have ever played. With this game I get to use some of my favorite characters of all time and one of my most recent acquired cards Goku Black rose which is also my favorite villain of all time. This game gives great experience and fun to whomever is the player. Spectacular Game Bandai! I can\'t wait to summon on the new super vegito banner wish me luck:).',
       'Somethings that would be nice LR reverse medals that revert LR\'s to thier base form so you can unlock thier potential easier. More ways to unlock medals like maybe some kind special treasurer where you can juts buy any medals. More LR\'s. There are far to many borly\'s so plz stop adding more. These are just a few nitpics but I like the game',
       'The Game is amazing . No glitches. ,story line fits perfectly,  there is nothing wrong with the in game and the gameplay of it. The only trouble I am having recently all day is that the downloading on the recent update is not workibg. Im standing right next to my internet box and it says my internet is Excellent. But every time i try to download this game it is just saying. "Download Fail" Please fix',
       'Dear bandai namco i hope you read my review. Recently a new data was available for loading although my network was stable and the app was updated instead of using 800 mb of data it still requires much more data. I don\'t know how much data will it require please fix this as i am not able to play this game' ],

     [ 'Dear EA Sports: We really want to get the icon Ronaldinho but its changed and its very hard. Before we were required to have an 89 ovr+ team with atleast 5 Brazilian players but now it has completely changed. Now we are required to have a 98 ovr+ team with atleast 6 Brazilian players. I hope you make the icons a bit more easier. Thanks☺',
       'Fut can not be developed with this building team. Football is one of the most attractive games but how this fut goes? In Vs attack mode, what the hell meaning do chances have? Players must creat chances by themselves not the game. You must let them play whole game and create the chances by themselves. EA is a big builder in football games and develop a lot but have you ever thought how your fut only stands at this place?',
       'The game is nice for every football fan.... Nice controls and good graphics...events are awesome... There r different game modes.. the only thing that I don\'t like after the recent update is that while playing campaign mode there are many stages which requires u to be in certain lvl in VS mode.... I think both the modes should be independent.. otherwise it\'s a fabulous game... The most awesome football game in play store right now.',
       'overall its an awesome game great experience. but Its hard for free to play players to complete and go through the events..... the icons are too difficult to get please make them a bit earlier to get, it will be awesome to have them in the team.... its difficult to get elite players in a pack of 500 fp totw pack n few others packs too... the vs attack mode is great.... EA please make sure that the free to play players to get a good experience of getting new and better players....',
       'Very good game , addictive..I love to play this game.. Events are fun.. But not at all happy with the team hero, if you play for 3 month also you won\'t be able to proceed further.. Very very slow process, icons are very much hard to get It will be much better if individual player stats added like goals, passes. It will be more fun if you guys fix it',
       'Fifa mobile is a soccer game that lets you be a manager and manage the best team. This game have well made graphics and gameplay. The events are fun, campaigns are exciting and attack vs attack are addicting but, no games are perfect in this case it is hard for free to player to complete the team hero event and daily microtransaction are needed. I hope EA will adress this issue.' ],

     [ 'While there is some advantage to buying packs, it is not so huge you cannot defend. Packs are much cheaper than Game of War. This game is pretty well worth it.  The best advantage you can give yourself if you\'re going to spend money is definitely the diamond mine.  You can get free gems and everything from the game as well.  Make sure you\'re in an excellent alliance.  I play on server 70, my alliance is Strength and Honor  I can teach you to play for free.  Remember, if you\'re going to change your name, open your growth packs.  Then tap your monarch, tap details and the green switches allows you to change your picture (nothing worse than being a chick with a dude avatar) and the quill and parchment allows you to change your name.  If you\'d like to join me for more helpful info, come to server 70, you get two migration tokens for accounts less than 3 days old and below keep 6.  Have fun and enjoy the game.',
       'Customer service is not responding, I have played for over a year, and they don\'t help with any problems.  I have had a ticket in for over 10 days with no response.  Many players are quitting and they don\'t care.  Once a business quits supporting customer service, the writing is on the wall.  I will not spend another dollar on a dieing company.',
       'What a fun game. I put up a 24 hour shield which disappeared after 7 hours. When I went to put up another one, my city buff said I had 17 hours remaining. So I was attacked, all troops killed, oh and then my city was force ported. An additional fun feature is help and support. When you contact them, they don\'t reply, but delete all trace of your complaint. Unfortunately for me, I had already paid for three packages. So if you\'re looking for glitches, being ripped off and being treated with contempt, this is the game for you.',
       'The app has glitches. This glitches will make you lose troops that you spent lots of hours or money to train, but when you report it get no response back. They only care about your money. The only good thing I got out of this game is the friends, but there\'s others way of communicating',
       'Awesome game, fun time killer and is extremely addictive. Only downside is those build times man, they take forever and I\'m only half way to the highest keep! Other than that, I haven\'t had a problem ever!',
       'Compared to other similar games, Evony does well in terms of decreasing the gap between spenders and f2p players until the recent update which screwed over smaller players. However, the most cancerous part of this game, like others, is Customer Support. In a game where people spend a large quantity of money I expect better responses for glitches and other bugs caused by the game that cause us to lose what we spent for with no compensation and instead being told that we, the players, are at fault and not the game.' ],

I have played this game for over 2 years and have found the game has constantly been getting greedier and greedier with the amount of spending required to get some of the  characters. After spending +400 RL dollars to get one character it did not even drop the character and show how cheap and money hungry this company is. The customer service team did not care about the concerns and said "its about luck" however this is game is less about luck and more about a  company trying to get themselves rich over enjoyong a game.

YOU WILL LOSE ANYTHING you did in this game and ANY of the money you spend will NOT be refunded.  Do you think they would refund you if they lose the game?

     [ 'Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn\'t hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv',
       'First of all It\'s joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add "Edit and changing names"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱',
       '"Cusion shot on 8 ball" games are great, woukd be cool if one was created at a lower buy-in though.  I think its currently like 8 million needed to play a bank the 8ball game.  I personally like the No Guidline 9ball games,but would love a cheaper bank the 8 game.    Also, well done on adding the upgrade-able cue sticks.  That alone, i think, has made this game much much better.',
       'I realize y\'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don\'t pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I\'m pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It\'s a pretty good app and I\'ve sent many people to download your app.',
       '8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don\'t win any games until those coins are over and I\'m only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don\'t know why this is happening but it sucks because it\'s putting me off the game.. it\'s like 8 ball is making sure I\'m losing hence the rate 3',
       'Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don\'t decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don\'t mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don\'t actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.' ],

Unfortunately, after a short period of good progress it started putting in lots of delaying features: Read a letter, meet the neighbors, give the neighbors tea, read a book, look for another book.

       'I have not been able to play for 3 days now. Everytime I log on I can not click the play button even after I go into the app and force stop. It is hard to level up and the power ups don\'t always work. I have also lost items after winning them. I do not recommend this game sadly because I did find it fun at first.',
       'Oh, what can I say? Frustrating beyond words yet I keep coming back to it. I mutter to the screen \'why does she need a rug, when she\'s already got the carpet?!\' and I just need one more star to get the rug and the level is, argh, impossible without spending real money which I haven\'t got. And yet I keep on coming back to waste 5 more lives ... Oh well, patience is a virtue.',
       'I really like this game.  I would give it five stars if you change a couple of things.  We should be able to create our own character,  there should be a player code that we could type in to go to a friends mansion.  But other than those things this is a great game that is a lot of fun for all ages!',
       'I like the game but some of the tasks are sometimes annoying. I\'d rather have more design elements than waste stars repairing a tablet that some idiot damaged. Seriously, the levels are tough which makes stupid tasks really irritating.  If you want to stretch the game that way please make the levels easier, its really annoying.',
       'Haven\'t been able to log in to play for two days now. It\'s like the game is stuck. I\'ve tried to force stop, restart my phone. Nothing works. I\'d hate to uninstall because I\'ve put a lot into this game. Please help!!' ],

You can only get so far, then you a required to spend actual cash to continue playing. If you want to max out your base you better have DEEP pockets. This is not a joke, if you want to be a serious player, it will cost you around $300 a week just to keep up. Only the rich get anywhere in this game.',
       'Mobile Strike has reset game.   Nothing below cyber troops are being supported , no RSS .   Also.  One cyber Titan can zero anything that has highest normal T52 troops and best bio titans...... without sending a commander Once u reach building level 1100 offered for less than 19.99 USDyou will have no access to packs less than $100 USD and no access to RSS for older troops',
       'I use to have one of the strongest bases in MKST.. Mistress Vixen..nickname Vix.  Anyhow i have spent easily around $3,000 us dollar on this game. And one day my shield lapsed and I got zeroed after about 40 plus hits. I quit playing. I started back and spent  littke money cause I missed my alliance people I started to consider family after almost a year of play.  Anyhow now they came out with cybernetics and the packs for that are $99.00 everytime. I\'m sorry this has went to far. This is a pay to play game 100%.',
       'Lots to do to increase your power, tons of new buildings giving massive power boosts, just wait a little bit & you may get lucky with a $99 pack being reduced to $19. Make sure you have plenty of money for this game. If you don\'t have the money, then starting out new, you\'ll be at a stand still around HQ level 20 & commander level 50, with only increasing power by researching, training more troops, & building traps for your wall. This game has been slowing down a lot lately though, not sure if it\'s the game or my phone causing it.',
       'U spend money to get ready for war.I think I am ready too go to cp and look at the other players base and think I am going to die. Their lvl and power are bigger than mine, so I spend more money an that still don\'t help for the event this game is starting to suck. My res base I have never spent no then on it and I have it Hq lvl 350 what is up with that. Helping a base who has not spent no money. Help the people who has spent money',
       'I had a problem with my peace shield  dropping for no reason. Mobile Strike says it\'s because I activated a boost reduction of food rss. I received no notification of this other. Thanks shield was replaced. Gave me no explanation as to why it had been replaced. I don\'t have Titans blue print no need for me to activate Titan boost . Game glitching and I was attacked when my 30 day shield dropped for no reason. MS did nothing about it. MS gives awful customer service. I spend my hard earned money every month. I should get what I pay for.' ],

     [ 'The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I\'d like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.',
       'Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It\'s very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again',
       'Thanks for new upgrade . Even when the game was slow i didn\'t stop playing. I love this game. It\'s not only a game for me...i am a President of my club and i have to lead my members... in less than one year i reached level 50 and almost all land expanded...just  you have to understand how to play... be smart... some advice for beginners  start participate in mayor competition...this way you will grow faster',
       'I absolutely love this game. I play it all throughout the day. I\'ve made really good friends with the people in my club, and we are all over the somewhat new "club wars" feature. There was a lag, but it was recently fixed. There\'s always something to do in this game, and you can play at your own pace. You don\'t have to spend real money to play the game, but I\'ll admit that I spend a dollar every now and then for the 30 days of green buck income. I love this game so much that I\'ve even started a second city on another device with my other email.',
       'The more stuff is added the lagier it gets. Game freezes when buying items, when going over your city, with the chat, loading the flobsl trade, travelling to other cities and basicly everything nowadays. Requires multiple restarts of the game and reboots of my phone regularly to keep jt playable nowadays. It used to be really good and smooth, but it only gets worse each update and no improvement in sight. I only play now because I made some good friends in my club, but the actual fun is long gone. :(',
       'Game is basic in its features. The worst part of the game is the trade hq. Rather than letting you buy directly off the hq menue you have to load the other players city. If your phone doesnt load it as fast as someone else they can snipe the goods you need to buy.' ],

     [ 'It feels like it was a soccer game that they changed a few thing to make it a hockey game.  That said it\'s not too bad.  I don\'t understand the finance part and there is no where to explain it.  The transfer portion is odd too.  The player got way more expensive with the last update.  It is irritating that I can\'t afford to sign my prospects once they are fully realized.  If I develop a 71 rated prospect it will cost me $700000 to sign him.  That is approximately 300 coins.  I could just let him walk and use those coins to sign 2 73 rated players... It makes no sense.  I have to forgo upgrades to afford to sign prospects.',
       'I like the game. You can do good if you put some thought into it. My only  complaint, is that I didn\'t make it to the next level at season end which is fine but why did I get reset at the minimum for that level and I check the standings and there are teams that already have enough points to make the next level?  I\'m 15-0 in my season and still 100 pts behind the leading team and not even in the top 1000.',
       'I\'m really confused as to why I can only win games if I\'m 10+ overall better than my opponent. If we are even close to the same rating I get my butt kicked. It\'s absolutely ridiculous and seriously makes the game not fun.',
       'Not a bad game, but I\'ve noticed lately that the "reimbursed" money from voided contracts doesn\'t get added to my in-game wallet. Which is annoying since I need it to sign players.',
       'Game updates hurt you. Increased value of players to sign yet, left my teams wallet short. No fun when, updates cost me more money.',
       'Abritrary garbage.  Great concept, poor execution.  Built a solid team and still lose even when ratings are better then opponents consistently.  Out shoot the opponent 97-8 and still lose.  Recommended if you need an exercise in futility in your life.' ],

       'I love the game play and graphics. But I payed for adidas female clothing and an aquarium previously on the game, and then when I restarted, they have gone. I spend £3 on it in total and I actually spent more money on other things that didn\'t come back in the next game, but it\'s understandable because they were lifestyle points and you know it\'s currency not clothing or furniture. I uninstall sims sometimes a bit of always go back and before my items were there, but now they\'re not and that really frustrated me. I actually ended up in 2017 spending  £10 on sims freeplay and that\'s the only money I think I will ever spend on ot now because if you restart,  you don\'t get anything you wanted. Please fix this because I spent that money and I could\'ve bought something else with it but I didn\'t because I like sims.',
       'First, I don\'t like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don\'t like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you\'re just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!',
       'Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools "playable",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it\'d be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.',
       'Love it addictive,if u like the sims on the pc you will like this.If you are a patient person you don\'t need to spend money either. Update it has lost stars as I don\'t want to spend money and now you need vip to get to the next stages of things. Disappointed with this. If you didn\'t have to pay for anything it would be 5 stars.',
       'im not sure what\'s the cause of the problem but what i know is the sims\' act a lil bit freaky. i just redownloaded this game bcs i cant log in this game before bcs i just updated it. before this, the sims is ok, but now they act really awkward. when they\'re walking, they legs dont even move! it\'s like they\'re flying, plus when they\'re doing any action like "clean the dishes", they dont move, they just stand still in front of the sink. this is freaky. please reply to my review bcs i really want to know more about this. i really like this game except what i said above. this game is really addicting:).' ],

Customer service team is just as bad they can\'t help you unless they see you spend lots of money on this game. Your better off elsewhere so give this a miss. That 4.4 rating is utter rubbish!!',
       'The possibility of atacking much weaker players is lame. Either restrict it by city lvl, either by power. Or implement curse system-when weak player is atacked by stronger one-e.g four times and more power - victim can curse aggressor, and destroy minus one lvl for most expensive in time construction/research. And most annoying bug - aggressor must not be able to use disguise/shield for 1 week after he attacks weaker player, and cool down shield also shouldn\'t be enabled for him.',

Graphics and music are really atmospheric, the artists did a great job, mechanics seem to have potential, though it\'s nothing like homm3. It\'s a shame the microtransactions ruin it.',
       'I really liked it at first but then the constant pressure to buy stuff keep looming.  Especially the events where it is impossible to geteven the lowest reward without cash boosts.  Ea the edicts you can only get new ones every 4 hours and there are rewards for just accomplishing a certain number of them. But the reward gauge wikl reset with the edicts so unless you use cash to refresh edicts you can never get the rewards.   This game seems to be designed to favor whales where ftp are meant to be farmed. I mean the vip system still grants massive amount of advantages and events are just to reward spending. Even if you save uo the boosts you get you can never catch up.',
       'I found myself having to edit my initial review. At first I was enjoying this game, however after multiple technical problems with the game, their customer service does not efficiently compensate their players.  I would tell new players to not invest in this game as you will be let down in the end.  In response to Wargaming Mobile: I\'ve been in direct contact with your support group through the game. I\'ve had two weeks of correspondence regarding the issue and have laid out the details in full. I will not be doing that again on this thread. Basically though it revolves around Wargaming not holding themselves accountable for their errors and compensating their players, especially those that were dumb enough (including myself) to buy packages.' ],

     [ 'This is not another Clash of Clans clone, but definitely pushes the boundaries of the clan genre. Good graphics, fun gameplay, and balanced in terms of units vs. defences for your island. While diamonds can be purchased by real-world money, the game doesn\'t trap you into needing them. The weekly mini-game missions help keep things fresh and assist in moving your base up the tech tree if you\'re patient. SuperCell is continually expanding the game to keep it interesting. Definitely worth a download!',
       'I really wish you could change your name more the once. You should be able to get 2 name changes. I started with my regular name and then changed it. I don\'t care for my in game name anymore. I just want to change the spelling. Is there any way you guys can make that happen please. We are also.looking fornsome good players to join our task force come and look for us the name is skippy71601',
       'Very addictive and always checking on my base, upgrades etc. Strategic game play, however too much pressure to buy diamonds as it takes FOREVER! !! for some things to upgrade. Seriously. ..2 days for an upgrade??? Only other issue is the limited time "special abilities"...they\'re fun but it makes it far too easy for someone to raid your base and take all resources needed to get the upgrades. Lots of fun and love the graphics',
       'I have played this game since it has come out and I have seen all of the changes and they have shaped that game for better over the years the game has been out it has improved and is one of my best games I have ever played. But the down side is that it is really hard to get resources at first but then before you know it you are full and you have nothing to do about it. Also when getting the heros they should make that base a bit easier because the lower level people can\'t attack till the have a lot better troops.',
       'Great game, but too slow. While I love the lack of pay to win, I\'d wish for a way to speed up resource gathering: I\'ve cleared out every similar level player in my area, and spend days waiting for RSS to build up so I can upgrade. Which is necessary before I can access a larger zone. No point buying speedup gems, as I\'ve never anything to use them on!',
       'To be honest, boom beach is da best game I have ever played!!!! My headquarters is lvl 10 but lol my dad\'s is lvl 21 and I feel sorry for my Bro (lvl 6 hq). Thx so much supercell! ☺ I think it\'s better than gta v!' ],

     [ 'Well, I still liked Duel Generations better, and wish that that game would work again, but I have to admit that visually and game play wise Deul Links is pretty amazing. Especially for a free game. I haven\'t gotten very far into it yet, but so far it\'s intuitive and just really slick looking. However, there is one reason I still would prefer Generations, and that is because I loved the inclusion of ALL versions of Yu-Gi-Oh, not just the first series. I grew up with 5DS  and Zexal more than anything, and I wish that those series could be incorporated into the game somehow. I\'d love to be able to play as Kite or Astral or something.',
       'this truly an amazing game, there\'s really only a couple of things, why reduce the monster and spell/trap zones to only 3 cards? I wouldn\'t say it\'s bad, I just don\'t see why you\'d need to do it.. plus the average deck size of yugioh is between 40 and 50 cards, why limit us to only a max of 30 cards? (not including the 5 for extra  decks) but all in all its a great game! Finally got my six samurai deck!😄 also, I think it\'d be an awesome idea to put in a way for duelists to redeem the codes on the cards they\'ve purchased IRL. I bet that\'d get even more duelists to play! Just a thought though😊',
       'Never played Yugioh this is the first time in this game and it is easily accessible with this game to get into this card game. I liked Yugioh better than the other TCG game like Pokémon,Hearthstone,Magic etc and I thought they are kind of more complicated for me because of their sourcing system like mana and energy while its all about monster cards, traps and spells etc. Very good card game and newbie friendly in general both those wanting to get into Yugioh and card gaming in general :D',
       'Found Yu-Gi-Oh on Netflix last week and decided to rewatch it. A few episodes in, and my love for the show rekindled, I got eager to play the game myself. I used to play with Yu-Go-Oh cards when I was a kid but it\'s been about 12 years since then and so all my old cards are in the loft, not that I know anyone IRL anymore who would fancy a game anyway, and not accessible right now... plus I had forgotten most of the rules too. But this app is just what I was looking for: a way to relearn the rules and have a bit of fun. Perfect for whatever skill level you\'re at with the game!',
       'Just sad if only they could fix the  zone to 5 monsters spell and trap cards. Plus the starting with 5 cards and the original deck size and life points to 8000 it would be soo good. Hope you do that and fix it im sure more ppl would  play this if you do',
       'Trash, true fans would never say this game is great. Only 3 monster and spell/trap zones and the person that goes first only starts with 4 cards? Really? Not to mention the terrible camera angles and rigged matches. If you\'re a competitive player that doesn\'t like to get bs, don\'t play this.' ],

There are many aggressive players that assault you early on in the game and unless you pay money it becomes difficult to maintain a stable civilization.

Love you guys and I will never quit playing!',

It seems OK, but there\'s not a whole lot of variations from other games in this category. Wish the developers of these games would add a new feature or two just to make it stand out. I\'m going to keep playing but if it doesn\'t get better after a while I\'ll probably unistall.',

     [ 'I think this game is brilliant. An absolute pleasure to play and I never get bored. This game should be voted one of the best games ever. Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can\'t join my sister and were only five levels apart.',
       'Ok It said Hey wanna play? Update your game..... Then when I come to update it it said it\'s updated AND IT IS..Pg2d u r bassically restricting me from playing the multiplayer battles. re u serious rn? Icant play cause i have to update the game when i already did.... Bassically waist of my money to buy new weopons when i cant use them.',
       'This game is the best I have ever played on a phone tons of maps, game modes, hundreds of guns, different tools, gear, and lots of skins. There is just so many things you can do. I also like it because it is a challenge something I would play. That\'s why I rated this game 5 stars.',
       'It\'s fun because I  git to play with school friends, and the gaming is amazing so keep up the good work! But I hate the new update with levels to upgrade you wepons! On upgrade costs more than the gun! Not   every one in the game is rich you know!',
       'This game is great! Even though you have to constantly farm for wins, but it does pay off. I\'m a level 12 in Ruby rank with 👌 guns. I used to have a candy cane baton that killed instantly upon impact, but it\'s not as effective against gold armor. R. I. P. Strategy',
       'I really like it. It\'s fun and entertaining, a highly suggested game in my opinion. Although i would like it if the sandbox mini game had more maps, and more freedom to choose those maps as well. It would also be very appreciated if we could play games with lower leveled players because i really wanna play co-op games with my friend, but she just started the game and it says insufficient levels. It would also be nice if the options of private servers were back in sandbox and you could choose what teams you wanna join in team fight. But otherwise, it\'s really great and easy to play 😄' ],

Finally reached legendary 32, I\'ve unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so.

     [ 'I love playing slot machine games, and Pop Slots feels like the only game that does not immediately shoot me down when I get a little crazy/ ambitious with my betting. It is the ONLY game I have ever played where I\'ve hit the jackpots on multiple occasions. Now maybe it\'s all completely luck on my part, but it feels like a game that doesn\'t immediately take all of your money faster than you can collect it. It\'s very easy to level up with a good win streak, and those hourly and daily bonus grow pretty quickly. Love this game!',
       'Used to be fun to play when there were decent rewards. For some reason the comp room rewards are gone besides small discount options. Ticket rewards are available for shows nobody would want to pay to see.  I have been playing for a few years now and have saved up quite few loyalty points. I guess we are playing for an occasional comp buffet. What a shame',
       'I like this game..but once i got to a certain level my daily bonus stopped going up.  It has reamined the same and it would be a little more exciting if it would increase the higher you go.  Win or lose is ok with me, it\'s something to pass free time.',
       'Game is really fun to play probably my favorite, and is the best slot machine app. I\'ve been playing at least 5 years But have recently stopped because it\'s not fun if you hardly win. And I totally get that it\'s supposed to be like Vegas, Win some could lose a lot. But it\'s just a game, it\'s for entertainment and I get that you can redeem the gold chips for real rewards in Vegas, but that\'s not why I play. I play because the games and different casinos are fun along with the bonuses. I spend 11 million just to play the pirate gem bonus and only win back 5 million. I could really care less how frequent the gold chips are, you only get 1 in 4ish balloons anyway. I just want to PLAYYY. Especially the bonuses, but it takes forever sometimes for them to be triggered in some casinos. Any chance it can change?',
       'Great game at first but when you progress you pretty much play for 10 minutes wait for bonus. Started purchasing chips and then they seem to go quicker! I like that is not all win win but damn, throw a dog a bone every once in a while. Basically you throw money away paying for chips and NEVER, and I repeat, NEVER win!',
       'I\'m sick of only being able to play for ten minutes at a time. Would love this game more if I can actually play it but you hardly can win coins, and if you do it\'s a quarter of what you spent on spinning it, and can hardly get coins. If you had more ways to get extra coins rather than paying like watching an ad, or something then that would be cool. Or if they made it so one could not lose 500k in ten minutes while only winning a total of like 5k that would be great cuz I would actually then enjoy it.' ],

Thank you for making this this really relifes my stress in stuff....',
       'I love this game, but in the last couple of updates the Fiend of Fortune keeps popping up with no close button. This mostly happens when I first start the app. I have to close the app and reopen. It\'s really annoying, please fix it!',
       'great and addicting. im not sure but is the automatic choose fiend limited? because I could only use it in a few levels then it doesnt work and disappears in the menu. so i thought i have to update the app. after updating i could use it again then again it wont work after a few levels. after the latest update it still wont work. so its either a limited feature oooor its a bug. it\'s just very annoying especially if you had a streak then losses it because you had the wrong fiends because you though it would automatically choose the right one. another is that it automatically spins the wheel even though i didnt tap it. buuut overall still a great game. been playing for years.',
       'I love the game but my phone screen is broke so i had to get a new phone and i went from level 367 to 1. I am very disappointed',
       'Great game to pass the time.  It gets more difficult to pass levels unless you make purchases in the game to help advance in levels',
       'I find the fact that the game is geared toward making you pay money to advance easier, appalling. My 4 year old grandson would love to play this game, but the fact that it is so difficult to  advance he would get very upset. By the way he is autistic. I will continue to play for a short time in hopes that this issue is addressed.' ],

My cons however is: arena battles are way too long.     : more clarification should be emphasize on "finish daily or unfurnished daily", I can\'t seem to understand when my daily is completed by looking at the daily chart.  : too much pay to play going on. Mix it up a little plz.   Pros. Great story line.            Epic fighting styles.             Awesome mounts.             Super clean graphics.              Will keep u entertained.',

You get new armor but your actual appearance doesn\'t change except with outfits, but everyone has those so at the end of the day your character does not feel unique at all. The combat and navigation are on point though. Overall a good game but just lack of personal input.',

     [ 'Great, but really needs "sell all" function for dealing with store house and "pecial buildings" components.This is a really quality game, looks amazing, works well and has good timed construction projects. However, as others mention it takes SOOOOOOO long to accrue the assets for construction and the mega bucks for expansion. You have to be VERY patient if you are not willing to part with actual cash. An idea might be to offer a conversion of coins to megabuck, maybe get 1 buck in excahge for eg 5,000,000 coins?',
       'lnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'I love this game. Just like other reviews say, it is addicting and because there are constant tasks to complete. Plus!..unlike other games, there is no way you ruin out of coins/money. The cities bring in alot. I can\'t agree with one reviewer that megabucks are hard not come by.  I began with 25 I believe (now at 32) and some of the tasks to complete give megabucks without spending actual money to even purchase some.  All in all, try this game and you won\'t run bored of it.',
       'The new update is great! Really appreciate the chat system. But it could be better... maybe add some functionality to the capital buildings and states.... maybe bonuses to taxes nd pop, loans, and coop science and military missions. The prices of capital building materials is ridiculous. Fixing these will make the state system look more complete.',
       'Best game!! Very addictive, Been playing this game for over a year.. although, there are still alot to improve!  I hope the developers will include edit mode in the next update so that the players can rearrange their city..Also, I hope they will also include a 360 rotation of the city and add factories that can also create materials needed in the game like the railroad materials and steels. I am looking forward with this updates!!',
       'Been playing for more than 3 years, i lost count. But this is a wonderful game which encourages teamwork and neighbor support. There are barely any paywalls in this game and  if you have hundreds of facebook friends who have this game you can easily get the materials you need to expand your city. No limits so far.

     [ 'I used to love this game, very addictive but recent updates have made the game have too many elements (clubs - who cares???) Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels "fixed" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.',
       'This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.',
       'I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn\'t really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don\'t know how many more points you need.',
       'This game has many issues! It continually freezes and shuts me down. I can no longer play on my tablet, which I purchased just for games, and have to use my phone. I don\'t like using my phone because it drains my battery. I am so ready to quit this game and return to candy crush instead. Latest updates have rendered JP and other perks useless.',
       'Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the "boards" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it\'s addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It\'s becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.',
       'I really liked playing as mindless entertainment despite what I consider to be unreasonable costs of the games as you advance in levels  and even tolerated the forced ads when they began. Unfortunately 2 days ago   it refused to load and continues to ask to retry or restart.  My connections are optimal and no updates pending.   Have tried to contact support to no avail. Disappointing.' ],

     [ 'Hate the new update. What\'s with you and all these chibi things? You\'ve done it before and based on the review, your players love the Mature and Realistic style much better. So why you changed back again? You have totally Lost your Identity and Uniqueness as LoA game.  If you planned on doing this, why don\'t you do it in the first place? so we don\'t have to waste our time and money!',
       'What\'s with the chibi hero icons? 😭 The artwork was so good and everything works smoothly before the update. Also, during battle, it\'s lagging. In my  opinion, the previous one is way better than current. I\'ve been a fan of different LoA versions, please don\'t ruin this one. 😟',
       'I *HATE* the new style. The reason why I liked this game in the first place was because there were no chibi characters. Dominion has no instructions and seems rather useless - but could be developed into something cool. The team formation doesn\'t have a way to sort your characters (I wish it was ordered by BR). I can get used to the new layout but for right now adjusting is hard. Thanks for developing the game more but please go back to the original character designs.',
       'Update on 2/23 made the game worse. Originally i gave this game a 5 star but with this update it feels more like a 3 star if not 2 star game. I get that you have to update games to keep it fun but sometimes you shouldn\'t change something just for the sake of change. Why not add content instead of trying to fix something that isn\'t broken.',
       'I started playing this game few days ago and I liked it so much. The graphics, controls, story all we\'re very interesting and addictive. Until the developers decided to update this game and completely ruin it and making it just like other mainstream RPG genere with ordinary graphics.   They just completely removed the story of the game and now every stage looks like I\'m playing some Angry Bird infact even that game has some story to every level.   In conclusion, this game was more fun before the update but now it\'s like ordinary RPG.',
       'Originally sold on the realism of artwork, then slapped in the face with ugly-by-comparison cartoon representations after last update. If they want a game with this style, go make one. Don\'t suddenly apply it into a game people are already invested in and were sold on realism in character visuals. Every preview image for the download page is now practically a lie. Might come back, despite the complete lack of foresight and consideration to the players, should they properly change the artwork back. Otherwise I\'ll be uninstalling and thinking twice before ever touching another GTarcade related game.' ],

Why you ask? Because number 1 and 2 above will waste your overpriced purchase quickly.',

When you see the game itself changing the color of treats several times during one game to give you a move, you know you\'re not imagining that this level is designed to screw you over into making fruitless purchases to overcome it.',

     [ 'Let\'s be honest. This game is very similar to every other choice game. You have to wait 3 hrs for another ticket and I don\'t mind that BUT the storylines are CHEESY! Like damn, I don\'t even feel  the chemistry between the characters, you all should work on that. Also, the why you all draw the Black characters is simply awful. Work on the way you color the lips and draw the face. I hate to say it, but overall, this game is basic. It\'s a work in progress, READ your reviews and actually listen to what they are saying.',
       'It\'s pretty good. I am going to save this application for now. Right now I am reading the Campus hacker story. I really do like the humor in it but I kind of find the characters rude LOL. I\'m only on the first book so I don\'t want to give up yet. I have four other reading applications and this one honestly is my least favorite as of right now but I would definitely recommend it and give it a shot.',
       'I think this and most of the game since choices came out are all rip offs of episode choose your story. Now I\'m not saying they are bad apps or stories I just wish some of these people knew about episode. Though I have to admit this game is pretty fun.',
       'In the past I loved my shelf, now I kinda like it. Untold Darkness was amazing... Then I read Untold Darkness 2, I was very unhappy about it. I had hoped it was a continuation of the first, but it restarted just like the first. One of the things that got me upset was that it changed things, like not knowing Eugene, and Eddie, also I disliked how I had to meet everyone else again.  I really think there shoud be a continuation of the first Untold Darkness though, it\'s my favorite.',
       'I kinda liked it. I finished untold darkness book 1 before giving up. I also started reading a couple others to be fair. I didn\'t really like untold darkness until later on in the book, and was eager to start the second but very disappointed in the second one. I felt like my choices didn\'t really effect the outcome.',

Make a new map for interserver , you can manage that new map , how many server a week can be macth , maybe 3 or 4 server , once in a week you create a quest in that interserver for players (solo quest) and team quest, and even the phanteon interserver war ! .  With this interserver map , you don\'t have to merge server so often.   2. Make a new map , make the world bigger , and add more details individuals activity , such as swimming , fishing (maybe for pet feed)   or even farming !   This game are beautiful , this game are the best ! . But if you improve it to be greater , that\'s will be more awesome !   I don\'t care about the game size , just make it happen , please!',

     [ 'This game is amazing! Everyone needs to play this. I would\'ve given a fifth star however you need to not only buy all XXL sharks to unlock the "!!" Sharks but max them out. Definitely download this, just one tip. Don\'t delete when you have progress. I\'ve downloaded, played, got bored, and deleted 3 times. Now I\'m never deleting it. I have so much progress, if I never deleted it the first time I would have everything in the game',
       'Finally! For the the longest time I\'ve been waited, the gaming performance has been improved! No more annoying lag and the gameplay feel a lot smoother now and I am so happy about it. But the graphics still needs to be improved because it doesn\'t look too good and some minor bug needs to be fixed.',
       'Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it\'s so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I\'ve had to start all over again... but the fun continues!',
       'This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don\'t play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don\'t make us wait foreverrrr!',
       'It\'s a fun game and I\'m enjoying it. However, I\'ve come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.',
       'Everything is lagging. From exploring the sea to chomping down the humans and fishes. It was great before but it is getting very very lagging. For example, Swimming towards a school of fish but instead of eating them, shark just swam through them. All sharks are lagging. Glitching here and there. Please fix this!' ],

     [ 'Used to play the original on pc over like ten years ago and loved it. I saw the game in app store and downloaded straight away. Amazing little gane. It is a proper time killer and very easy to get stuck into and understand. It\'s just a shame there is no shops you can buy equipment from with the soulbound Penya.',
       'It\'s not as pay to win as everyone is saying, yes it\'s quicker but with normal grinding and combining of lower items you can easily get anything. Vip points are earned in game and don\'t need to be bought also. Yes the auto quest and kill makes it easy but it\'s for minimal gameplay later on as you must actually control and move correctly to clear harder content and bosses. It\'s not like the pc version of it but then again it\'s an app and I think they did great.',
       'Good game in general . solid contains. looking forward to Rappelz the rift :D when can we expect an early access? Btw for the gender limitation u can probably take exemple from other mmorpg here in the store like OAC or Crusaders of lights as exemple but many can have gender and more customize and classes. Hope to see more in the future but Great Game . keep the hard work 😉',
       'Awesome game. But it\'s just that I really didn\'t felt it enjoyable I mean I am a Hardcore MMORPG player but this game just didn\'t felt right. Maybe because i didn\'t even did much but crossed level 80+ and I didn\'t have to use my brain on it and didn\'t did much and got everything easily. Or maybe I\'m more into SAOIF type gamer. I don\'t know. That\'s why 4star.',
       'Its an ok game but doesn\'t compare to the real game itself. I\'m disappointed with the controls. I have to use the joystick to move around or auto, and it doesn\'t respond well. It could use some work but not bad. But I did get bored in just 2 days.',
       'Not a bad game at all and it is ok as a take on mobile for Flyff. My only complain would be the camera controll. Other than that nothing else( I wish there we\'re 2H greatswords though)' ],

       'There is lots of good things about this game but I think we need more elements and characters and higher star ratings or new ratings more cooler looks to characters like evolving them more with more evolving them to more stages plus more things to do in the game like boss arena or like some more types of reward things with hard battle boss mode and such still love it tho keep it up',
       'Very nice game but crashes ALOT unfortunately on Nvidia Shield K1 and long loading time after each crash some battles impossible due to crashing almost guaranteed for longer fights',
       'Last update sucks ... its all about luck to earn 4star creatures',
       'Great Game! Lots of fun!',
       'I\'ve always liked the design of the different factions and creatures in the HOMM series of games, so it\'s nice to find a game which focuses more on them.  Graphics are great and the menus are easy to navigate. My only grievance is that the RNG aspects of the game can let you down more often than not, but it\'s not a deal-breaker for me. Awesome game, I definitely recommend giving it a try!' ],

    description: 'Eternium is an amazingly fun and beautifully crafted Action RPG, reminiscent of the great classics.Eternium stands out from other mobile Action RPGs by its effortless “tap to move” and innovative “swipe to cast” controls, and its player-friendly “no paywalls, never pay to win” philosophy.With the exception of a couple of online-only features, the game can also be played offline after the content download completes.Drawing signs to cast spells is easy and rewarding. The tap-to-move control is more natural and relaxing than thumbsticks, and it’s also truer to the vintage point-and-click Action RPG experience.The game can be really played for free, as more than 90% of our players do. Purchases are completely optional. Gems, the game’s main currency, can be collected from enemies and quests. There is no limiting stamina or energy. The best things in the game are obtained by playing, not paying.Eternium has been launched in 2014, and is actively being improved by the original development team. Through years of polishing, and feedback from millions of players, the quality of the game has steadily increased, making it now one of the highest rated games on all app stores.As of fall 2017, major new features are in advanced stages of development, including real-time multiplayer, town portal, and a fourth world.Enjoy the visceral satisfaction of responsive, fast-paced combat, with spectacular special effects, pleasing sounds, rewarding damage numbers, all set against immersive backdrops and atmospheric, inspiring music scores.Play as a Mage, Warrior or Bounty Hunter, wielding a sword, axe, staff or gun. Level up to learn new abilities and increase your attributes.Battle skeletons, zombies, automatons, aliens, demons, dragons and many other creatures, across three beautifully hand-crafted worlds, or in endless generated levels.Venture into dark caves and dungeons, explore forests, villages and graveyards, lay siege to demon controlled castles, brave snowy mountain peaks, travel to the moon to slay strange creatures among craters and canyons, and beyond, to the deserts, pyramids and jungles of the red planet.Open treasure chests to loot gold, gemstones and battle gear. Equip shiny breastplates, menacing helmets and hoods, spiked shoulder pads, mysterious cloaks or capes. Protect yourself with a shield, or choose to wield two weapons as a warrior.Rescue your tank, healer and ranger companions who will join you in battle. Use their abilities together with yours to create rewarding and powerful tactical combos.Experience a refreshing storyline, filled with interplanetary intrigue and seasoned with funny characters. Hunt your arch-enemy, Ragadam, across the worlds, while trying to uncover and undo his twisted plans.Progress from common to rare, epic and legendary gear. Find gemstones that fit in your armor’s sockets. Craft socketed rings and amulets, and fuse three of them into a higher quality one.Unleash awesome offensive abilities, such as Whirlwind, Shockwave, Arc Lightning or Blizzard, control the enemy crowd with Frost Nova, Vortex, Silence, or sneak and assassinate with Smokescreen, Traps and Snipe.Each hero class has access to about 20 abilities (skills or spells), and each of your three companions has four more. The game starts simple, but culminates in a flurry of tactical possibilities at high levels.Once your hero reaches level 70, your experience points go into Champion Levels, which are unlimited and yield steady stat upgrades. Champion Levels are also inherited by your new heroes, so they will have an easier time growing up.Aside from the three story acts, an endless progression of beautiful, randomly generated levels awaits in the Trials of Valor game mode.Eternium is crafted with passion by a small band of old-school RPG fans, who love making the game they always wanted to play.',

     [ 'What a great game this really is, there isn\'t many RPG\'s you\'ll find like this on the Play Store. I recall playing this 3 years ago and a lot has changed, but still a vital element is missing; multiplayer. I see within the game description that it was promised for 2017 but after downloading and playing I can\'t see any multiplayer feature. Apart from that, it\'s a really well polished game and seems to offer a lot of content and replayability and I really do hope they bring us multiplayer. I also purchased a limited time offer for £0.89 and it offered a lot that\'s for sure!   Runs well on max settings on my Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra on Android 7.0',
       'The gameplay is the best ive seen for an android RPG Diablo type game. Slick graphics, awesome sound track and effects, no slowdown and you can play offline!! Absolutely love the game. Only down side is the worry of repetitivness of the game but i guess only time will tell',
       'Incredible game. Very intuitive and unique with the swipe to cast system. The graphics are quite nice and the amount of memory the game uses is very acceptable for the quality you get. Music is very relaxing and well done. Level and NPC design are great, really feel like I\'m playing an old school medieval RPG. Absolutely 0 need to buy gems, the game gives them to you for just killing normal monsters. My only gripe would be to maybe add a fourth class? If not more in future updates. Otherwise, fantastic game, well put together, well written story, great opening scene and whoever did that voice over should be looking to do more! Thank you for making a true RPG for true RPG fans, keep it up!',
       'The game is addictive. I was hoping to play it offline all the time but you need and internet connection to upgrade skills and craft its annoying because I don\'t have wifi and I use mobile data. Still it gives me the feels of Diablo all over again.',
       'Absolutely love this game. I downloaded it 2 hours ago and havent stopped playing. I play on an S7 Edge and this game plays flawlessly.  I haven\'t been forced to watch any ads.  You can choose to watch them for bonus gems but don\'t have to. The game play is very responsive. When you touch a destination or an enemy it responds without any hitches.  I like that their are different levels of difficulty you can choose. The amount of weapons and armor you can collect or craft is endless, with rune upgrades possible. Great game guys... keep up the good work. 5* for me!',
       'I love this game. It could use some improvement, but there is nothing in the current  version that would warrant less than 5 stars... particularly for an android game. If you loved Diablo; then you will definitely want to play this. And, BTW, you really don\'t need to spend money to play or win this game. But it will help you ALOT if you spend $20. Just wait for one of the special offers that come up. Otherwise, just conserve your gems and DO click the ?-Cubes. It is worth a 30 second add to get 5 gems. And I easily collect around 100 gems per day of play clicking those. Also, DO NOT, waste gems on the large golden treasure chests. You have to pay gems, a lot of gems, to get the treasure and none of them are worth the grossly exorbitant gem fee.' ],

My game won\'t load past 42% on the boot up screen, was working fine last night, went to bed and hasn\'t worked since I woke up. Y\'all seriously need to figure out the problem since I have many people complain bout it',

       'I usually don\'t write reviews but I\'ll make an exception this time. I really hate when there aren\'t videos available I\'ve checked the settings recently and I was not connected to Google for some reason. I did not disconnect myself, why the game disconnect me from Google Play Store I\'m very disappointed.',

       'Great game until you hit an ucloseable ad, or ads dont load.  also, the legendary chest is a rip off. I have bought 4 and they say 50% chance of legemdary item.  Nope, the only 1 I have gotten came from a common.  So spend your premium currency on something more productive.',

Just wish yoou could use the store on more than the love island. Would love to see the island\'s stay open until finished. Hope they add more special items and get upgrades to specials. The name is cute, and so are the little characters.',
       'I absolutely love this game but you guys need to ease up on how many crystals you need to build your wells or either that let us mine our own on the big island. It is taking FOREVVVVER for those zombies to mine so why not let us mine the big island ourselves. It would also be a humongous help to all us players of this game if you would put in a daily bonus wheel where we could spin it and earn zombie bucks and other things. Other than that this game is awesome. ☺ You need guys need to find a way to let us earn zombie bucks or let us buy them with our own coins we earn ourselves.',

     [ 'This game is perfect for those who played any moba style game. 2 buddies of mine play this the same we used to back in the first 2 years of league of legends. Short games, almost no existence of any real "pay to win". No heavy dedication required to get started. Great for the casual and hardcore gamer. Not for those who haven\'t even seen a moba style game before. Just needs more items to buy in game, but can\'t expect perfection from the start. Overall 4.7 from me',
       'Cool game very fun few negative though. Snowballing is way to easy one death and you basically lose lane. The controls need to be better they need a target lock mode. Its hard to keep on your target even with hero icons on. Being able to only use the jungle talent if you have a jungling item on sucks. its so hard to comeback if any bit behind as i said snowballing is to large.',
       'The connection and reconnecting sucks, I always end up idle or AFK because apparently my connection sucks but it\'s perfectly fine. Reconnecting takes forever and by the time it\'s done the game is already over and I\'m reported for AFK when it\'s not even my fault the game\'s connection sucks.   Other than that the game is fun to play and a good time consumer but they need to work on better connection. I kept on getting warnings for my AFK when the game kept on glitching and it affected my phone so I had to restart the whole thing.',
       'Way better than Mobile Legends. I use to be  Mobile Legends Die-Hard All the way but this is the best MOBA out there. I have no idea why this does not have 50+million downloads. ? Do Not Judge By Front cover. PLAY THIS AND SEE WHEN YOU REACH RANKED MATCHES MY FELLOW MOBA PLAYERS.',
       'Game is an absolute blast.... when it works. I am constantly getting diced in lobbies right before a game starts meaning the game punishes me for something that is server side. I know my Internet connection is fine because I hopped on LoL and discord just to check my ping and it is at a stable 40 whilst this game says I\'ll have over 500. Because of this it makes it hard to enjoy because of the credibility system. If this issue gets fixed I will change my review to a 5 star because the gameplay is superb for a mobile game and a moba',
       'Played both the international version (arena of valor) and the Chinese version (honor of kings). It is the better mobile moba in the market with great control and smooth gameplay. Having DC heros in the roster is a big plus.   Downside is the lack of content compared to the Chinese version. Sure it\'s a fairly new game, but if this game wants to be as successful as honor of kings it need a lot more content to keep players engaged. More meaningful events (not the crappy one that give you 5 gold for winning matches), way better skins (seriously check out the skins in honor of kings, so much better) thats actually appealing to people. And please let people unlock arcana pages with gems instead of paying real money.' ],

     [ 'It\'s like Episode\'s ugly cousin. Story line is okay, character look is very limited, in order to play the rest of the game you HAVE to pay a subscription fee like the game is worth it. For one month it\'s 7.99 and may I remind you that Netflix (10000% better) is the exact same price as that for a standard pack. Episode (story app like this) is much more cost-efficient and over all better because at the very least you can make your character resemble you, don\'t have to spend so much out of your pocket, and Episode also isn\'t prone to crashing like this one.',
       'Subscribed for a month..cost me $9.99.  Not bad I thought...until the game stopped working in the middle of a story. Had to restart game and it went to loading page....stayed at 10% and will Not load any further. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling ...no luck! Asking for my money back . Funny how it stopped working a couple hours after I paid!!!',
       'I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME!!  This game is amazing and a great time killer! I\'ve used the game in the past when they gave 2 tickets but I\'ve recently downloaded it, they only give 1 ticket for 1 HOUR! The stories it self is good, the characters lacks some things, the stories are too short. The \'free\' diamonds doesn\'t work, when ever I click on it, it goes black and closes the app which is frustrating. The choices in the stories are 10 to 25 GEMS which takes forever for someone like me who doesn\'t pay for gems. BUT other then that there isn\'t anything I could think of from the top of my head.  So, please fix these....',
       'One ticket is too little.. plus the stories for each ticket are soooo short... other apps have it longer and you get 2 tickets minimum before the next ticket arrives.. and owh... can the characters have more options in terms of looks? Especially the guys... boring.. Plus why cant we keep the clothes that we already purchased? Stories are ok.. similar most of them..',
       'Not a bad game I like the stories. The only thing is you only get 1 ticket to read with. On the plus side you can speed up time til the next ticket',
       'The stories are great but unless you invest a ton of money into the game you don\'t really have a choice how the story will turn out. Whenever it pops up to give you a choice, the more favorable one is 20 diamonds which you will only possibly get if you buy them. It ruins the whole concept of the game.' ],

     [ 'I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn\'t have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn\'t get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren\'t vigilant of their customers and don\'t take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.',
       'I love this game so much. I have been looking for a good shooting game for years and I never found one until I came across this. This is perfect. Me and my friend would spend hours on this game. I have been playing this for about 6 months now. It\'s perfect. I think the best thing about this game is how organized everything is. It is very self explanatory. I found everything and it was easy to do so. I also love how they update this game very often. Great game. I haven\'t had any problems with it. I can\'t wait for updates later on to come.',
       'Game is really tooo gud, graphics also nice n smooth controls but u guys released only one game mode(Team death match), but in lot of fps games they provided free for all, bomb mode, Flag capture n many more modes.. If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games 😀 n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area.',
       'The best shooting game ever. Lobed each and every single thing about this game but there a little suggestion that we can see the player if they are online or not but how is this if we can see there live going on matches? That concept will be great and games lag sometimes so if you can fix this and add my suggestion in guns of boom that will be hell great!! #the best game',
       'I was loving it and have spent alot of money but this update made it to where i can\'t even open it back up. Please fix because i loved this game and have invested time and money and if i don\'t get to play it anymore sometime soon I\'m not coming today back. Please fix very soon i was trying earn a special gun but I\'m not sure if that\'ll be an option if an when it gets fixed',
       'Played this game on my old 6S and S7 edge without any problems. Now that I have a Pixel 2 XL, controls have a major glitch. Seems to go nuts on its own or sticks too one side of the screen. Happens every match, almost unplayable. Very disappointing!' ],

     [ 'Amazing and a unique type of game. The currency is all obtainable even as a free to play. Cool looking dragons and the movement in the game more lively than just pictures. I\'ve played many app before this and I would say that this is top 1 so far. The only problem is the game will stop and crash. I don\'t know the reason but I\'ve tried in another device and also stops working. Overall the game is magnificent and I definitely recommend it to everyone!',
       'Awesome! I really like the game. Top 5 game? Worth it! I\'ve played some similar game but this one is the best. The graphic is great and the dragons are cute. The resources are not too hard to get. The best part is the drag-skill! It\'s really different. Each dragon have their skill effect with different area form. You have to drag it right. A long way to be a master tamer. So enjoy the process!',
       'Pretty well made game afterall, all currency ingame can be obtained in fairly free and quick way. The game also offers really big help/supply for newbies. Spend a few (for me 3)days and you can already get 3 times of 11 advanced draw. Can get a little bit of grindy but not pay to win either. The flaws being some English translation error and extreme flashy visual effects, and the lack of (limited even) variety of the dragons and campaign plot.',
       'Great game.. I\'ve played all the others, but one huge problem. I keep randomly having an issue that my app acts as if there is a pop up (that never actually pops up) in the middle of battles, lagging out my game. Every 10 or so minutes the app crashes as well. It would be a great game to keep on my phone.. if it would actually stay open.',
       'Very clean, polished game. Took awhile to get used to it but I really enjoy it now.its easily free to play as well once you reach level 20. You can get somewhere around 1.2k gems a day just by playing. You can also get gems by just questing.',
       'Good games guys but the summon rate for a 5 star is too low. Im one of the top players on the server. When i do get a 5 star its one that i already have. Also the log in event is not working for the American server. Even if you pay. Its a waste cuz rates are too low. So don\'t' ],

     [ 'Game is horrible,everything is rng based,and i mean everything. Gacha is the worst compared to any game released and i dont mean spend 30$ and complain,spent over a thousand in 2 momths to try for 1 of 2 main healers and still nothing combined with regular diamond income,meaning none of the top connects are doable. Arenas and events are all pvp or ranked vs top players where you stand no chance what so ever. Overall this games horrible and not worth your time or money.',
       'It\'s a fantastic game. The only problem I have come across is the summoning function. When I was able to do my first summon, I got a few rare characters and I was happy about that. Then I saw this summoning event where I could get some special units, so I saved up the in-game currency to summon them. When I did summon, I got some of the same characters I had summon before. To back up my suspicions, I restarted the game several times to get the currency to summon again and kept getting the same seven "Super Rare" units. The game itself is almost a solid 5 for me but the odds of getting a promoted unit through a summon will probably disappoint.',

     [ 'Some of the troops are simply overwhelming, e.g. Dragon, while some spells make the troops overwhelming, e.g. Protection on Black Night, Giant Growth on Black Night / Dragon, which generally make no chance of countering (countering is an element for good strategy game). A few suggestions to balance the cards’ power and have good strategy game:   1. Giant Growth: reduce the power-up to 30%, or add time limit to the spell, or disallow the spell to cards with mana 7 and above (unfortunately Unchained Demon with only 3 mana will be spared from this).  2. Dragon: reduce the speed to 2, or reduce the power / health / attack range.   3. Protection: disallow the spell to cards with mana 7 and above, or add time limit to the spell.   4. Vempire: reduce the attack / health / speed, increase health loss %.',
       'I like it ALOT, but unless you can get lucky with good cards as a new player it wont be fun for a while. There is alot of umbalance between newer cards and stock cards, you can get screwed unless you\'re absolitely professional with default cards',

     [ 'My only issue with this game is that u almost have to end up purchasing tix to continue to play. The further u move on in the game, the more tix each card costs & ur only given a certain amount thru a daily reward. App should provide ways to earn more tix, either thru a daily spin or higher rewards. *(since app developer replied to this review, I changed my review to 4 stars)',
       'Just played my first 4-5 rounds and this ROCKS! Not too fast. I love it! Fair Payouts but 1st, 2nd, etc same as others. Graphics work!  All Around impression... Awesome-ness. Update: I\'ve been here atleast  5mos... long enough to know this still ROCKS!',
       'I really like this Bingo  game.  A few upgrades and it will  be better than all the other Bingo games.  I love the amount of tickets it gives you to play.  I love the extra stuff you can earn and not have to pay for.  A couple of things that would  make this game better would be all 4 cards on one screen in tablet mode, the power ups being applied automatically  and being able to daub that last number that\'s  called cause usually that\'s the one needed for Bingo.  Otherwise its great.  I hope  you find this useful.  I understand  if you can\'t  fix all three of these but the first 2 are more important  than the last and i understand  there can only be a certain amount of bingos i guess.  Thank you.  Real close to being a 5 but those 3 issues really hold me back as I\'m  sure it does others as well.',
       'I like this game VERY much. But my tickets keep disappearing! I just earned 200 tickets for feeding the dog. My tickets got added on. Then i clicked on Candy Crush. Then i clicked on 4 cards. And it said i didn\'t have enough tickets! It cost 240 in Candy Crush. I had almost 300 tick. When i looked at the top, i only had 131. What happened to all my tickets that quick?!?!? I\'m about to uninstall now. Its not the FIRST time this happened. But it will be the last! #GoodbyeBingo',
       'This used to be my favorite bingo game and then they updated it about a month ago (give or take a few days). Before the update, I was able to level up daily or every other but, now, it takes me a GOOD week or more to level up. That was my ONLY way to gain more tickets to continue playing without purchasing. I barely have enough to play 2 (4 cards each) rounds each day! REALLY stinks! Guess I will be uninstalling and going back to playing Bingo Blitz!',
       'It\'s been nice...I\'m happy to share: they heard us. We can earn power now, the games are fun, excellent pace. Thank you "Dataverse", I appreciate your changes 💯 ☠☠☠☠☠ UPDATE: n again 1/11. again: I ventured and came back. I can buy credit in January. Cuz we HAVE to have boosts to play long. Here I go !Update. I like a lot. Spent 20 but you simply can\'t spend enough.  must buy boosts too. Boosts get stuck' ],

Maybe every 40 levels add a mill purchase option. When selling on the market, we need an option for a blind add or a neighborhood only sell or trade.. make these upgrades and so far game would be perfect!',
       'It\'s great to be able to buy from other farms in theory. But there are WAY too many times that you click on something and it\'s either sold or not even in the roadside stand at all. The for sale paper needs to update quicker.  Also, it\'s very hard to accumulate any \'west bucks\' in this game and you need them to do almost anything, so the game is a big money suck too. I\'m deleting it.',
       'Update......I have learned there is a chat feature AND a neighborhood group you can create.....so excited to get to level 19!!!! Would give it a solid 5 stars if we could have an actual chat option with friends. Looking for a new game to get away from FV2, but can\'t find one with the same chat availability.  Add this and I am hooked!',
       'I love these type of games just like hayday. I have noticed it freezes and takes ages to load the newspaper. Also would be helpful if it could tell you who needs help in the newspaper would help filling orders quicker. Also I have noticed alot of people selling the same parts and harder to get others and it\'s extremely rare to get the land parts without paying',
       'The game doesnt give enough case vs things to buy or fix.  Also have issues with getting product into the alloted spaces.  I thought it was my screen but had it cleaned thoroughly and it still happens.  It takes several attempts!!!  The story is cute.  The graphics are cute as well.  Ive noticed it has a couple of choices from other games Ive played on older phones. I would suggest the game to others but get the issues fixed and itll be a 5star game.',
       'I love playing these games. I\'m not sure why we are rating gameplay they offer apps not a game. It\'s crazy how they ask us to rate game at the beginning of game. We haven\'t learned the bad points. This game makes us pay for treasure chest instead of giving us to them free like most games. Which means we have to pay for everything. Totally not fair. Takes the fun out of game.' ],

     [ 'Good game, easy to play and graphics are clean and bright. My only complaints are that I wish you would earn boosters when you matched 4 in a row or in a square or something other than 5 in a row. Also, it would be nice to be able to use the boosters together. As of right now, it only happens if they happen to set the other off if it happens to be right by it.',
       'The game is fun easy yet challenging. There\'s not enough ways to get the emeralde for as much energy as u use to play the game. I feel there should be more ways to get the emeralds one needs to play the games, other than having to use cash every time one needs energy. Makes me not want to play. It\'s not a free game if you force one to spend money to play. Just saying...',

       'I\'m a player for a year and a half.  It\'s fun.  There isn\'t a chat capability, so you DON\'T get to ask for tips on how to beat a game.  I\'ve been trying to win a RIVER PEARL for months.  It isn\'t winnable.  You have to buy it if you want to complete over a dozen collections.   The cost of 1 is crazy for 49 emeralds EACH.   It makes me frustrated and angry for this. The game is addictive and challenging.  You upgrade each group of games that gradually get more difficult.  It\'s fun.  The collection pieces and the resources you win are quite often the same ones, and not the ones you need  They came up with daily challenges that you win half the time.' ],

Now stage mode is a joke, it\'s so hard that is not worth it. Please fix this, either increase the rewards or reduce the dificulty.  Also a good idea would be to add a market where you could sell/exchange materials for other materials.',

Before the update its fine now I\'m dying like crazy from 4000 health to 0 in one hit doesn\'t make sense. FIX THIS PLEASE was lots of fun with new mode now dying real fast for tons of health lot less fun :(',

The video promoting this game has absolutely nothing to do with the game. That\'s false advertisement and they can probably expect to be sued by blizzard soon for stealing their graphics to promote a game that had nothing to even do with those graphics. Noticing alot of games are always showing videos of what the game is until you download it and realize it had nothing to do with it.',

       'Don\'t bother. Two words to describe this game: CASH GRAB.The game has lost its appeal. Servers crash and they refuse to compensate you for their problems. They make changes to certain aspects of gameplay, then claim nothing changed. They remove features of the game, then leave us wondering why. You\'ll never see a change log either with updates. There is only one thing they want. Money.',
       'Lately the game it\'s very slow. Sometimes it\'s freezing for minutes. After restarting with force stop cache  clearance of the game, can do up to five moves than it\'s freezes again. Hello admins it takes 30 seconds to access a mercenary op. Clear the bugs please. 04.12.2017  Thanks for useless response. There is not an option for the issues I\'ve asked. Hey people try the link I was given  05.12.2017 My app setup it\'s on my quick lunch to do the force stop after every 3-4 game moves. Left the game for 10 min to get going still frozen.

       'I like space games, so I like the idea. Graphics are good in your town, but outside missions are lame because all your ship does is shoot  then its over and you lose troops. The idea of How? And Why? pops in my mind. Just a touch up on that and I would love the game. A little action outside your town besides other  players would be nice...',
       'I enjoyed the original version of Plarium\'s Total Domination on desktop, and have had a similar experience here. It would have been nice, however to have some sort of bonus connected to all the time I\'ve spent cultivating 70 levels and all the elite fixin\'s that I have on my original version\'s acct. But still very clean game with much to do, and the adjustment in build times is a good bit faster.',

Especially at garrison,  Plarium should make total sectors that players invade .  Iike button scroll u make it at hire troops .  I will rate it 5* if this u can make it.  *_* ..... Boooooooooom' ],

     [ 'I m so excited to unveil what happens next, the energy drains hell too quick. I would love if the energy is increased to a lot more because that is effecting the gameplay and annoys me a lot personally. Leaving this issue, the game is fantastic. I have always loved choice games and this current gameplay is the best of all experiences . I wish to read more through your stories..... ❤',
       'I think this game is really good. I just have one problem. Even though it says my energy is full, it feels like I have nothing. And also the mini game 100 energy seems to last longer than the initial 300 you receive. If you could fix this taht would be great. And if it\'s designed like this can you make energy spending more efficient?',
       'The story-writing is really well done and the art is gorgeous. My only problem is that if you don\'t plan on spending money to buy energy, the story moves really slow even if you get full points on the card mini game and watch the offered video ad. I guess that\'s the idea, though, since it tempts one to spend the money to keep reading. I also get really confused with the plot, itself. Sometimes the direction it goes doesn\'t make sense to me and also, the choices sometimes do something I wasn\'t expecting at all given the wording.',
       'This game really addictive!! The only problem is they don\'t give you enough energy.😒you either have to buy energy or play a mini game to get more energy. The highest energy points that you can get is 100. Plus the 30 points if you watch a video. Other than that the game is AMAZING. The graphics are realistic. It has a lot of romance too. You should definitely download this game if you\'re not bothered about the energy points.',
       'It is really annoying having to play a mini game to get energy in order to proceed in the story. Especially because that mini game is nothing that can be learned by playing more often, it\'s solely based on luck. And getting maximum energy in it, it still only lets you proceed for like 1 minute of the story. Quite annoying because the story itself would\'ve been interesting.',
       'Interesting story so far and great art but the energy runs out far to fast for you to really get very far, even at the beginning which is when the story needs to be able to draw the reader in so you want to come back and read more. Which is why I almost didn\'t continue and was thinking about just giving it up.  Not to mention the ads completely break up the flow of the story and you don\'t and can\'t even get energy from them.  So for these reason I give it a 3 even though I want to rate it as 5, but it\'s just to irradiating to ignore.' ],

     [ 'The game in itself is in no way a Final Fantasy Game, apart from containing many of the series favorite characters. It is however a very enjoyable and addictive game, keeping you returning for just one more battle.  I haven\'t found any bugs so far, works perfect but does require a constant internet connection.',
       'Good game. Lots of characters to choose from and they are obtainable for FREE. Which is different from FFBE. The only problem im having is its hard to get specific character weapons for each character in story. Specifically the 25 gear draw. I\'ve been obtaining only 3-4 of the 25 story character weapons and I still don\'t have the weapon I\'m looking for. Also it\'ll be hard to obtain the same copy of the weapon to limit break it. And it Cost a lot of gems just to obtain one. Hopefully the game will add higher chance and still have the opportunity to get those weapons since its expiring tomorrow.',
       'It\'s very nostalgic to see all the famous characters in a game together and in a game that works. This game is awesome and addicting. I haven\'t spent any money on the game and I can still get stuff done and not get blocked by something stupid to pay for like most games. Grinding is kindve a nightmare for when you unlock later characters you want to use but the writing and gameplay is solid. Love this game and I highly recommend it to any FF fan.',
       'Loved the game from when I downloaded it and played the hell out of it none stop for days pretty much. However, after doing the latest update today, the game has lost all functionality and is unable to even begin. I\'ve attempted to load it several times, and have even uninstalled it and then reinstalled it multiple times but it still won\'t work. Love the game, its one of the best games on the app store but I\'m pretty much furious now that the game just won\'t work for me any more and I\'m not the only one this has happened to.',
       'For a phone game this has been the first one to actually grab me in a really long time. It\'s a great time killer it\'s super addictive and I even find myself stopping to focus on it during some of the harder fights. Everything\'s very rewarding and while I wish that the microtransactions were a lot cheaper all in all it\'s a really good game.',
       ':( I was excited but after downloading was met with a black glitchy screen. Uninstalled and reinstalled twice no luck. Gonna wait a few days and try again. Not hating on the game at all, just gonna wait a bit.  EDIT: Now that it has been patched it works perfectly, I love this game. Thanks you so much.' ],

Maybe a later update brings a fix..................',

Then when you complain, he purposely delays any response for 48 hours because that takes you outside of the Google Play store Return Policy...thus forcing you to either continue to not be responded to OR contest the entire transaction as fraud through your bank.

It takes days to rebuild from a single attack and you get attacked 2-3 times a day from upper levels.  They should lose honor or get nothing for attacking anyone with -5 levels from their level, or something like that, but they don\'t.  You end up getting picked on and can never build up to defend yourself.  It is SO frustrating.  Plus there is no customer service or any way to ask questions or submit suggestions.' ],

     [ 'This is an updated version. My last post was from I think September or maybe October, but this game is truly AMAZING!!! The story line itself is great as well as the side story\'s that you can read as well. This game has changed so much from when I started playing this game in August. The events are great but I think the developers can give a little bit better rewards then just XP juice and more jewels as well as heart stamina, but other than that the game is perfect no glitches and non of that stuff. The one year anniversary was amazing thank you for that!! I can\'t wait for season 10 and the future seasons of Moe Ninja Girls!!!',
       'There really isn\'t anything negative to say about "Moe! Ninja Girls" the story is great, every character is deep and likeable, even if you\'re a free player each chapter is long enough to keep you coming back and paying is definitely worth it,too. It looks great and sounds great to boot. I honestly don\'t like mobile games at all but this is amazing and would be even it were a console or pc game. To me this is THE perfect app on mobile so download it now! And devs: I hope you continue to support the game because if you guys keep making seasons,I\'ll keep playing. Love you guys! &lt;3',
       'The story is really the best part of the whole game. The ninja fighting seems to be arbitrary , as you can have high stats and still lose a match. Collecting new gear is fun but you don\'t get as much new gear as you would like. Sometimes the game stretches the abilities of my Amazon fire eight and crashes under Google Play add in. This story definitely makes it worthwhile playing though it\'s funny and titillating!  ;-)',
       'Amazing story! Great characters. Other similar apps dont compare. Im playing completely free so far, just finished Season 1, and many awesome event stories. Well worth my time. Yes you have to wait 4 hours between chapters, but who cares. Its actually a nice pace.',
       'Cute anime girls. Only things is that the gameplay was really simple. I\'ve played some dating games before and usually there\'s more options or they appear more frequently. And the ninja fight mini game was also simple. I don\'t know. This game seems to get good reviews so maybe it\'s just me.',
       'This game really gets me. Everytime something happens without having to choose an answer it still makes me feel like it would be something I would do. And all the characters have their own type of characteristics, unlike other games I play that are like this that have all the characters acting the same way.' ],

Every time I would submit for help I would get a generic answer. Once I threatened to quit the game for good the answer changed. The problem hasn\'t been resolved but they are "working" on it. If it isn\'t resolved soon my time and money will find a new game!  New update as of 2/15/18. I invest money in this game but I am not able to utilize the upgraded hero\'s...they have disappeared.

     [ 'I know the update on The Book of Dragons came out a long time ago, but I still can\'t make sense of it. The old book of Dragons was a lot easier to understand. If you filtered it to show only searchable dragons, then it would show in order what you unlock. I\'m not sure, but from what I understand is that the dragons are now arranged in time to search. That\'s neat and all, but could you please come out with a filter for dragon unlocsks by Lvl?  Dragons unlocked at a later Lvl is usually better. With the current filter, you can find a dragon which collect 14 mill wood/hour with dragons collecting 1.05 mill wood because it is arranged by time to search. Again, please release a filter option by Lvl unlocked? Thanks for your help!',

Why, thank you , it\'s good to know that I will be able to keep 5000 iron AND LOSE 25K WHEN I CLAIM THE PACK IN MY MAIL. Now I have to keep the mail iron and collect more over days on end to make the next iron storage upgrade.... seriously??? At least divide the iron into packs of say 3k each so that it\'s usable. The fact that the iron storage was downgraded is bad enough, but 30k iron in email when storage is reduced to 10k sucks!!!!  Update: claimed the extra iron. It ended up split into packs of 5000 iron in mail. Little happier now' ],

     [ 'Game is very fun. Good third person view, controlling  your ship is easy. Matches can end quickly if your teamed with a bunch of people who rush in. Only problem with the game is that the option to increase match reward by 50% by watching a video crashes the game. It goes to a black screen with a white number 15 circled in the bottom left hand corner. Have to close out and relaunch. I get my reward but sucks having to do that.',
       'Please make the shooter ship or its turbo faster to balance the game. The global rank is dominated by two fast running Speeders and Enforcers. The end game always comes to draw (4-4) when the shooter face against one these two(2) ships with shorter health points. These two(2) ships just run and run because they know the shooter can\'t chase anyone of these two ships which makes the game really boring. Please think about this matter to balance the game.',
       'Fun when the match is fair and your team works together well. From what I heard, the system will make sure you maintain 50% win rate, basically that means some times you win the game with little efforts, others time you will be in team that cannot shoot and fixer that don\'t fix, imagine getting wiped out within 2 mins. Be prepared to lose more than 10 rounds straight in a row.',
       'Rovio is one of the most money hungry group of people. Nobody will address ur ingame issues. They may ban u for no reason and when u email them, they reply after 1 month. No point of putting money into Rovio games. Free to play players, only rock.',
       'Brilliant game according to me. I have given 4 stars just because of an ad "healthify weight loss coach". Whenever this add appears the whole game freeze and i have to restart it again and due to this i lose all my progress. Plz do fix this problem. Good luck',
       'Game is great, lots of fun. Have to reload game EVERY TIME  I try to watch an ad & get my gold & sugar. Having trouble with  game again,cycling between gun is buggy.  Please fix. Hey Devs do you ever check out your game? YOU HAVE MANY BUGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED!!! Now after update game is Glitchy, still too many PROBLEMS. dropping another star.  Please fix your game...' ],

     [ 'Even though the descriptions and dialogues in the game are bit off it doesn\'t completely take away from the experience of the game. It still does have some bugs, like the dialogues for instance, but the game is really addictive. It\'s one of very few games that I\'ve been playing religiously for the past few months, probably longer. That\'s the one of the main reasons why I\'m giving 5 *\'s. The game has an ENORMOUS amount of potential, I think if the devs got licensing rights then it would improve the game so much more. One thing I really do not like about the game is that it is kind of a pay-to-win game. You have to spend real money to advance quicker or become stronger in the game faster. Other than the cons, it really is a fun and addictive game. If you love anime, if you love fan service, if you love action games, if you just love Bleach in general then you will definitely love this game.',
       'Not very good it fell short of the other apps...it still missing half the content of the others while making it impossible without paying to collect keys.. shard collecting is lacking ...unless you want to pay for anything halfway decernt gameplay you won\'t find it here',
       'Only installing because i spent hundreds in the last one. Devs only care about your money, don\'t fix or take forever to fix issues, and the game is basically pay to win. Yiu can still get decently for free, but don\'t expect to get to the top that way. Take the 1 star reviews seriously... A lot of ppl stopped playing because of this games BS...',
       'After figuring out how to reinstall the game. . . and still having my account. I\'m so relieved to still be abke to play this amazing game. . . keep up the good work guys. But you need to put the reinstall instructions in the original game sign in error. I went through a lot before I figured it out. Love the apology gifts tho. Thanks dev team.',
       'For those who lost their progress, you have to choose the right server in the home menu. It should be there. Anyways, weird way to make an update but this game is pretty okay. Flash sales and stam refill should be the only things you spend magatamas on. Roulette is a waste. Overall it\'s pretty good.',
       'The devs don\'t care about their player base. They just want you to spend your money. I will rate more stars once you fix the MANY problems with the game' ],

     [ 'I\'ve played CE for almost a week now. I like the art and concept of the game. Interesting idea of heroes. I highly recommend it if you enjoy playing idle rpg games like dungeon rush and idle heroes. The only problem that I noticed so far is there\'s limited things to do. More content is required for extended gameplay, otherwise 15-20 minutes everyday is more than enough to do everything there is to do. A 5 star, nevertheless. I don\'t see any reason to be a VIP yet.',
       'Dev\'s other game, Epic Summoners, and this one, are essentially clones of other games. But, as games like Grim Dawn are essentially clones of Diablo, yet do the genre justice, so do these games. You will find so many familiar mechanics to other popular games. Done well, my only issue being the "need" to spend cash to truly advance. Other than that, art is awesome, enjoyable, and worth at least a download and playtime.',
       'I wouldn\'t even call this a game, you\'ll "play" 20-30 mins worth a day and all your doing is collecting things and put them into slots. The graphics and art are actually really good that\'s why I download this in the 1st place.',
       'Pay to progress, simple as that. Servers are dead as no one wants to fork out cash for every event that on the whole offer no real game play. Remaining players have spent hundreds and lord it over people like children. Emphasis on paying is madness, it costs £20 for 10 scrolls. You need 600 for top tier reward... Played a shameful amount and without paying you get nowhere. But drop rates and RNG is so poor you don\'t want to pay.',
       '15 minutes after starting game and I\'m still not able to do anything just follow tutorial squares... Maybe this game is just a tutorial. I got level 12 by just pressing yellow tutorial squares. It\'s like when teacher tell you to write on board 2+2=4 without letting you to solve it on your own. And after that you just follow instructions, will teacher give you certificate of nuclear physics. I don\'t know when tutorial ends, but I have enough, and I am uninstalling this "click here" game.',
       'Really great graphics, and they spent a lot of time and effort on the look of this game. For an idle game, it\'s gorgeous! That drew me in to a type of game I don\'t usually play. So far, I haven\'t paid, but I think I will put some into it, since I\'m enjoying it so much. Its not necessary though, at this level, anyway.' ],

     [ 'I absolutely love the story line and I\'ve spent more on the game than I\'d like to admit. But spending money doesn\'t really get you much farther because the energy goes so quickly. I think you would get far better reviews and more happy customers if you got rid of the energy system and upped the ads for more revenue from that standpoint. Then you could keep the micro transactions for the secret scenes. This way you\'d still be making money,  but your customer retention would go up. I have so many ideas that would help this app out and I\'d love to share them as I love this story. If you are interested in what I have to say please reply',
       'It\'s really a good game. It\'s awesome! But that energies are my main problem! Don\'t you think that...... only 300 energies that means only 30 lines are not enough and too little for a day..!?..!???!.. and 10 energies per line isn\'t too much!!??! Please make it down to 5 energies for each lines...and only for dialogues.. And if you give 500 or 100 energies (if 1 line cost 5 energies then there will be only 100 or 200 lines. Not much for a whole day!!!!!) and take 10 hours to get free energies again then the game will be perfect!! Everyone can\'t buy energies (including me)! You know! Please consider this case sympathetically.!.!..  I beg you.....!....',
       'It\'s exactly what I was hoping for. The 300 energy per day is just enough for me, since I don\'t like getting sucked into the story for too long. The controls are simple, and I like the game exactly as it is. My only issue is that the dialogue takes a long time to load sometimes. I wish the game would just pre-download one chapter at a time.',
       'Lovely story line... love story that keeps you coming back everyday.... at times we are urged to buy energies.. however the energy provided gives sufficient dosage of the story each day... sad that it\'s going to get to the end...  And i wish I could go back and re read certain moments which is not possible.... apart from it.. this is amazing...',
       'I love the game. Wish we didnt have to pay for every secret scene and had a little bit more energies before having to wait for more or buy some. Would be great if we had more options for free energy. Love the story and characters. Hurry with season two already!!!  Im anxious to see further stories on ryan and the character Lol ❤.',
       'I think there are lots of chapters and the energy for really slow. So I am practically making a tortoise speed progress through the story, when normally I can finish many pages in a book (reading). Someone should do something about pacing up the story. And not to mention secret scenes later on can only be played by purchasing the paid version of the game!' ],

       'It might not seem so, but has highly strategic gameplay and very good management, good sound overall and beautiful artwork. You don\'t need to spend tons money on it, but, progress can be quite slow - especially evolving heroes. A lot of it is based on chance, which is not the best, but not the worst kind of chance. A bit confused why it is impossible to praise clan members same or lower level - surely low-level players could use the little gold unlike the high-levels, and high-level players would use the food. Once you get to lvl 100, you actually end up with having almost no way to get food and might as well stop playing.',

The first 4 days or so, you level up fast enough to build a surplus of energy, then you struggle to do anything after the honeymoon is over.',

     [ 'I enjoy the game itself, smooth running and kills a bit of time, with lovely graphics. Been playing for a day or 2, little black squares pop up often. The screen freezes on the hq. If you could positing each operator where you like, would make the game very good. The developers need to sort the bugs out and the black squares with software freezing.',
       'To anyone having the "already logged in on another device" issue: I fixed this on my Samsung Galaxy S4 Active by going to the app information and hitting the "clear cache" and "clear data" buttons. Apparently that worked. Can\'t guarantee it\'ll work for everyone but try this if you have an android! :-) This game is awesome!',
       'The game is really good. To spend your time, it\'s kinda addictive. The only drawback I found with this game is that the cost of upgrades when compared to the payouts after the missions is way too less. This is good game but needs improvements on this. Hoping that you\'ll will work on it. Also the wait time between missions is way too much time. Needs improvement on this as well.',
       'Cool game in general, you don\'t have to spend real money to play or advance, but it helps. My only real complaint is constant "Connection Error" messages. One after another, sometimes in the middle of a mission or right after completing one before it saves. I\'ve had to stop playing before for over an hour, error code after error code after error code. Close app and reopen, error code, even when on Wi-Fi. Next time I\'m deleting the app.',
       'Its a good game over all but i would like to be able to pick where the vehicles are from dont get me wrobg i like the euro sounds but i would like to be able to pick and choose like the Canadian RCMP cop cars and EMS and FD. The other big thing is why is the video play back for the adds keep crashing pleae fix this as i wpuld like to get some more blue money.   Thanks alot hope you read this :)',
       'UPDATE now I keep getting connection error....!! Awesome game. New job wait time is a little too long but I understand they need to make money. The game is very playable without spending money still. Haven\'t had a forced add yet so that\'s alway a plus.' ],

     [ 'Game has so much potential and is a blast. I\'m giving it a bad rating because gems are insanely expensive and they have so many buttons to hit to "use 200 gems to remove 3 lines" as one example or another to lose 200 by placing the button right above the back button on a phone. Super lame move on devs to intentionally take insanely expensive gems from us by mistake. No confirmation or anything, just boom, gone. Lacks ethics to say the least rinow',
       'Such a shame. The game is great, really enjoyed the concept however it is a prime example of how monetisation strategy can ruin a game. Gems too difficult to earn without buying them, and purposely easy to accidentally spend them. Too many ads too. I\'d rather have paid for the game. Deleted it after a  day or so.',
       'Not What It Used To Be  The second to last update I did for this app switched the aim of the ball to slightly off from where you point it. So now have to compensate (guess a bit) when you\'re aiming which makes play more challenging.  Likewise, levels beyond about 440 are becoming impossible to beat w/o saving like a weeks with of bonuses to use on each level. Beating one level a week is hardly fun anymore! I may be uninstalling this app soon.',
       'Games fine. I refuse to rate a game well when it\'s annoying ads start pushing political agenda against gun owners. Will go elsewhere',
       'Great game.   But one of the adverts is a virus.   The IG Academy advert wrecked my game and now my phone\'s being a pain in the ass',
       'I really this game, plenty of challenging levels, very addictive for sure. I just got a new phone and was bummed to have to start all over (had gotten to level 360) but my new phone came with an updated/better version so now I\'m stoked on it all over again. Sometimes I wanna quit this game but I never do.' ],

     [ 'I have been playing this for over a year and got to level 600s. All of a sudden no free gifts to help beat a level which are almost impossible to beat. Now is when you need the freebies! And tickets? What good are They? I think it\'s time for an uninstall since the level I\'m on now I\'ve been trying for days to beat! Impossible and no longer fun. Should be fun not stressful.',
       'I have re rated this as I had to reset my tablet. I then logged back into the game only to have to start all over again as I don\'t do Facebook. This game needs its own log in. Also every time I complete a level I get adds. What ever has happened it is spoiling the fun of the game.',
       'Lost my gifts from completing the task for tier 6 level.  And they disappeared. Please fix or I\'m uninstalling. I worked to hard to complete and not be rewarded. It was for collecting butterflies.  Tooooooo many glitches. Please fix if ya want better ratings. Sick of the bullcrap time to uninstall and save some data',
       'Love this game! Stupid toto barking on the menu drives me nuts though! Lots of challenges for bonus items and the game keeps evolving. Sometimes little glitches when using lollipops, but mostly free of problems like freezing etc. Hopefully I can keep enjoying the game as long as I have enjoyed the film.',
       'Ok, I\'ve been playing this game for awhile not as much anymore.  Not getting moves like I used too get for my daily prize, Judy non sense like tickets. What do I need the tickets for?  Can I buy stuff with them?  What? I have no idea what the tickets are for.  Pleaser put the moves back, at least I can use them.',
       'I have been trying for a while to pass the level I\'m on.  I send help to friends they had unlimited lives and still didn\'t pass it.  Come on I like a challenge  but this is ridiculous.   I like playing but if I have to spend all my lives and not level up I will just play candy crush....because your getting just like that game...' ],

     [ 'Out of the blue... a random msg appeared on my phone. "I have a question. Do you want to come back to the clan?" What followed was a quick download of a game I had never heard of and after a very short crash course (1-100) I was joining my friends from days of old and blasting through monsters like they were made of cardboard. I agree with their F2P setup and after playing for the last 7 days (having some real fun) I have bought some packs in game to show my support (and for VIP) of this solid offering and hope that support stays as hot as it has been so far.

       'As others have said, the longer you play, the worse it performs and the more space it takes up, and after a while ads start causing the game to crash. However I\'ve managed to get around it by reinstalling every couple of weeks. Other than that it\'s a good little game.',
       'It\'s a pretty fun game, better than I thought it would be. There is one problem, you don\'t really need to buy "Flooz", but if you do. The prices are a little outrageous. Like 5$ for 100 Flooz, seems a little money hungry. And 100 Flooz for 15 days is 29$ is outrageous as well. I\'ve played other games with better things to do besides upgrading and usually 100 "diamonds" of anything would last 30 and would cost 10-15$. Seems like you\'re trying to rip people off. Besides the money hungry creators, good game to kill time.',
       'I think the game would be enjoyable if it did not crash ALL the time. Get to a new level? Crash. Watch a video? Crash. Crash Them All might be a more fitting name for the only game that has ever crashed more than once on this phone.',
       'Love the game. Me and the hubby play it all the time. I like all bosses, expeditions, dungeons.  Only would add one thing... Make it where you can get credit for something other than Facebook.',
       'Incredible game play it for hours and love it soooo much only good things to say other than server connecting but it\'s no big deal love the game the style the graphics the game play is all awsome I do have some ideas for the game if your interested number one being adding carnivore and herbivore types into the game so you could have dinosaurs and number 2 is world bosses were the entire community can all defeat one boss and 3 to have the ability to friend people not through Facebook. Love the game it\'s so good thanks for putting so much hard work into it and adding awsome features cheers' ],

     [ 'This game is perfect for anyone who loves magic, fantasy, collecting, and a whole new level of adorable! Dragonvale takes everything to the next level! I highly recommend it, as it is a amazing game, my most played, and I hope everyone else enjoys it just as much as I do. Five stars! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Edit 2: I was re-organizing my islands by Element the other day, and I had just finished the Plant Island. I put down a Oversized Oak Tree, and immediately, a image flashed through my mind: a young girl, sitting on a branch of the oak tree, a book in one hand, a baby Plant dragon sitting next to her. Stretched out in front of them was my Plant Island, the dragons freely soaring, the other islands in the distance. And that sparked a inspiration in my head. I just wanted to ask; can I write a Dragonvale book, which takes place at my park? Please let me know !  :)',
       'Cmon Backflip! Okay look I love Dragonvale, I\'ve been playing it forever. First off I lost my amazing park a while back and that really sucked. But now I am restarting and I go to buy the beginners pack for 9.99 and it says there was an error and i wont be charged...come to find out it did charge me and i didnt receive anything! Please help',
       'I have been playing for a while. After events you get a day to turn in your event specific currency for the prizes, even though the event has ended. Well for Gardenia\'s event, it turned in all my roses before I could exchange them. I had over 25,000 and was so pumped to get the new dragons. Now I don\'t have any roses and 25,000,000 extra coins i don\'t need. Please help. This is a very frustrating bug.',
       'I really love collecting all of the dragons and the fact that you can theme/decorate your park too. But the amount of types of decorations are unbalanced, the majority that you can currently buy in the market are just plant and earth type while there are very few decorations of the other types (such as air, cold, etc).',
       'When I first had it it was super fun. Then I saw a game I wanted so I deleted it I did that before and got it back I could log into facebook and go to my old island. But this time I could not. I was so far and looking forward to seeimg my dragons but it did not let me go to my old island. It left me im tears that I had to do what I did all over again. So I deleted this stupid game and gave this. If I could rate 0 I would',
       'its ok, and you might think you cant li e without it, but trust me.... after a while year of playing, which is what i have waited to wrote this review, the game play becomes very repetitive. sure try it out, its fun, but not something for the rest of your life. dont put money into it, you will regret ir later.' ],

Would be obvious but most have 10 alternate accounts making it harder to see how dead it has become. The select army function has been broke for months even tho they have updated to make map look like snow and buildings animate faster. Pointless... Lag is even worse and now impossible to do anything when attacked you have to exit game and reload to hopefully have anything left. Theres been multiple hacks making armys instant return to there death. Nothing waz done to fix it. Very expensive packages are rigged to only give one commander but imply that you recieve the 32 needed to complete one. Experimentals fail even at 110% chance success. The players are great community and support slightly improved. It is a very complex game with many things to keep u busy forever.

       'ATTENTION NEW PLAYERS- All of the board skins will be unlocked through normal gameplay. This is not something that is explained by the developers, or something that you will see during normal gameplay within the first week or so. I feel that this is done to influence the likelihood of new players buying the in game flair currency. It worked on me, and I\'d hate to see the withholding of information work on you too.  That being said the game is fun, it\'s an easy way to pass time and runs pretty well. There are a few graphical hiccups which is a bit of a disappointment. I use an LG G6 so I\'ve got decent specs.',
       'This game is very fun I have a lot friends I go against. I\'m the top dog guy highest level and most money bla bla. But I\'ve had a problem that every time I get any money that I\'m saving either to level up or upgrade a building gets stolen from other people that I do not know. So almost every time I get close to what I need it gets stolen less than an hour later. Like again game is reeally fun and addicting but you guys need to put a time that it takes for someone to visit your board or a time it takes before some random steals money from you. Because I can not even level up due to every time I\'m 10,000 away it gets stolen to the point that I\'m at 8,000-13,000. It gets very frustrating when you get late in the game and need t o save up because building cost a whole lot to upgrade.',

You just stole another game called it something different. It better be taken off or legal action will be taken into account here noone bother with it.  Pokemon idle if you pay you get what you see that you played.  This one they steal your money as everyone is finding out the ways',

I would like to invest money in this but worried about tht CON. Other than that this is a very addictive throwback to a certain degree XD end up spending more time thn I realized on this game feels like I\'m on an old game boy pokemon game congratulations and many thanks for the creation of this amazing game. But admin plz fix and respond. Thankyou',

The battleships and details are amazing and even better when you\'re in battle. To all future fleet commanders download and enjoy plus I\'ve been playing this for over a year or so now and it still is my go to game. So if you\'re new to Rpg try this one. All hands to battle station\'s.',

All the time game crashes and stalls, Samsung galaxy S7 was locked several times. Game is developed for crazy profit  and normally you should pay to have fun  otherwise some one will but not you.',
       'The game seems to go through faze\'s some times good some times just ok. If you only speak english it can be very taxing, not to friendly at times. Has a very clicky higher archery . If you fall out with them you can have wasted all the money you put into the game.',

       'The translator needs fixing,  it\'s ok but could be a lot better,diamonds keep vanishing and there are other issues in game I don\'t like, it seems some legiins have preferential treatment regarding tasks and rewards. Other issues with the chat keyboard freezing or not working properly.' ],

     [ 'This game is awesome. The girls are beautiful and the songs are nice. There are a couple of errors I be having with the game though. I would have liked if they had subtitles to the songs so we know what they are singing. Also give us a chance to earn more gems and scouting tickets.The scouting I think is also not fair. I would scout single ten times and not get anything but a rare. While my friends do single scouts and get ur and SSR. YOU won\'t get goods cards unless you pay or do the 11 scout. The pricings also could be improved',
       'Warning! This game is freakin\' addictive. Good graphic with cute characters. Recommended for anyone who loves idol genre ... Suggestion: please fix the lagging. The circle disappear sometimes during the live show. Sometimes the app even doesn\'t recognize my finger touch that makes me miss a circle. But overall. It\'s a good game  .... ALL HAIL PRINTEMPS AND GUILTY KISS',
       'I love the game definitely but with the new update, it keeps telling me that there\'s a transmission error then when it went through and finished connecting, it said that the data transfer was successful. I haven\'t transfered anything to a new device or anything like that. The only options I\'m given is to contact support and start a new game in which I definitely don\'t want to do. It isn\'t my connection because everything else on my phone that requires WiFi is fine and I can use it. Is this because of the new update?',
       'I love the game and it\'s wonderful!!  But...  I had i don\'t know like a glitch or something.  When started to play the rhythm game while I playing suddenly the icon that I should press came faster all or a sudden. But the song is still OK.  After the glitch it becames back to normal.  This happen me for 3 times on the same day. Please fix it. And Thank you.',
       'It\'s so addicting and a fabulous rhythm game. One thing I\'m really picky on is that you press the circle on the beat and this is the only game so far that has stayed true to all the notes being on the EXACT beat. Other games don\'t do that and it bothers me to no end bc I don\'t know when to press but this game is great and I love it dearly. Also cute girls.',
       'Firstly, Illegal access means you have rooted the phone. Secondly, Lovecas are supposed to be hard to collect its the game\'s premium currency so don\'t whine about why you don\'t get enough Lovecas cause that\'s what noob players do only. Thirdly, SRs and URs is also supposed to be hard to get too, because there wouldn\'t be any fun without them.' ],

       'It takes a bit of getting used to but when you do its ok. As a beginner it forces you to use week 2\'s but I play strong 2\'s. My biggest gripe is that the "read more" section states that it comes with unlimited practice deals but this is not true and each practice game costs a "deal credit". This means you run out of free credits quickly which means the app is not really free and ongoing use will cost you the monthly subscription.' ],

     [ 'So I\'m changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it\'s a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I\'d rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!',
       'GAME CODE reveals ROLLS ARE NOT RANDOM - they\'re pulled from a table of predertirmined outcomes, designed to MILK YOU FOR MONEY at a set rate, based on PvP, reg. Game, Event, Boss, etc.  Just like slot machines & video poker (which i programme).  You must \'assemble\' high scoring games, like a puzzle, with majority of yahtzees sitting after 4 or 8 rolls (1 or 7 bonus \'dice\'(money) spent)... Like a choose your own adventure book that can cost Hundreds of Dollars.',
       'Scopely is the most greedy, disgusting company I have ever seen. The ads they have littered into the game play literally crash the game at least 4 times during a match. You will see about 10 ads on top of the crashing per game; you could be in mid roll and the ad will ruin it. So desperate for money.. Don\'t support scopelys terrible practices.',
       'This game cheats! Don\'t get me wrong, I love it and am going to keep playing. But WAY more often than it should, it tallies up your opponents score wrong to make you lose. I count and take screen shots. If you get upset at things like that, it isn\'t for you. But if you don\'t care that much, like me, it\'s absolute fun! Adorable names given! Awesome dice to win! Very entertaining! Battle real people or the game! Just don\'t be a sore loser even when mathematically your a winner!',
       'I\'ll give this game more than one star once the showdowns are less about the computer clearing and more about real challenge.  Once you start a showdown the computer conveniently never gets a bad roll.  Which wouldn\'t be a big deal except you have to wait to challenge them again unless you want to pay for extra dice which is used to unlock everything else.  Kinda cheap.',
       'Horrible game, stupid graphics looks like a preschooler did it, games are definitely rigged you hardly ever beat the house. To much stuff going on on this board you have no clue where to go to get to anything. The old game was easier to navigate. You should give people the option to keep the old game.' ],

Its no fun anymore because you have to spend and then it takes a week to do everything you have to do. By then its spend again to catch up. This is great, don\'t touch it. Fast to load, fun to play.',
       'Dont kbow if the developers have given up in the game. The packa needs to be a lot better. Also customer service should respond the mail. Been over a week now and no reply. Makes me rhink that they have given up on the game',
       'It\'s great app it has execution of player vs computer and vs people  . The graphics are unbelievable.  The music is good and the rewards out way any negatives so far this game is very addictive  and fun and is living up to its hype Play for pay looks good but I have not participated in this part yet still building my new Alliance and looking for recruits come and play it\'s loads of fun !!',
       'I\'m liking the fact it\'s new enough not to have to play horrible catch-up and still lose. Plus I like that it\'s similar to both game of war and clash of kings.',
       'Yes. There are glitches. And yes, many things could be better or easier. But the developers do have a open ear for all of our complaints. And every time if you was right with your complain, you got a generous compensation. You got a response from a REAL PERSON. And not a preformed series mail. Madman isn\'t MZ. They don\'t have these big, fat servers like them. They aren\'t Multi Billionaires and a big number on the stock exchange like them. They don\'t spend millions of Dollars for an advertising medium like Kate Upton. GoK is the best game, I\'ve ever played. I love that slow growing of this game. I don\'t need a few BTTTTT power or a stronghold like a high-rise! I don\'t need 20 Heroes and T50 troops. And I don\'t WANT to spend $500 EVERY MONTH for damned upgrades! A game should be a game and not a full time job! And that\'s, what GoK does. I love it. ❤',

     [ 'If you\'ve liked the first game you\'re probably gonna enjoy this one. It\'s more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it\'s built around microtransactions so if you\'re feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don\'t understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it\'s likely you\'re going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren\'t aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don\'t expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!',
       'I love this game! One thing though, I believe that there are too many plants that cost real money to get. Could you please make some more plants that you can get them by being able to unlock them by playing the game, instead of ones where you have to use real money. Besides that, this is a really great game!',
       'Free to play games are always the same formula: Starts off addictive, gets more challenging, starts encouraging you to buy gem equivalent, forces you to buy gem equivalent. At least most other games are fair with it though, giving you a chance. PVZ 2 does not. Levels go quickly from fun to I\'m done, and become impossible. I\'d love to see developers or game testers try to complete later levels without gems, especially Big Wave Beach. It\'s a shame, as the first game remains a classic. Buy the first game and Garden Warfare if you like it. Leaf this game alone, it\'s a sprout at best. Oh and remember, if zombies try to break into your house, throw your money at them.',
       'Love this game so much! I am a huge PVZ fan anyway and I love playing this. You do need some boosters to get past levels, which feels a bit like cheating sometimes, but you can earn plenty of coins. There is always a new quest to play so even when I\'m stuck on the other levels I can still play. This is a great game, well done devs!',
       'BEST EVER GAME I HAD PLAYED IN MY LIFE!!!!!  Great game! Too addictive and it is the best favourite game ever and the hardest edition you will ever find in it. Even challenging. I am the biggest obsessed fan of pvz! Try it once you will find tons of fun and challenges and even gameplay and graphics!' ],

The characters are great and the story line changes on each route so it keeps you interested. And you don\'t have to spend money to enjoy everything in this game. An hourglass takes a while to get but it\'s worth it to use them to get the extra stories. I enjoyed the Christmas add on.',
       'Nice description, nice plot. Likable characters with spot on music. What more could I ask for? (Edit on 9/7: I downed the rating not because it\'s a bad game, but because although I had an account for this game, I lost all my data when I logged in. I had saved 270+ hourglasses so I could do the secret endings but well. That went down the toilet. I won\'t be trying again until I get interested (and over this) in this game again. Other than that I fully recommend this game.)',

The chatrooms are very interesting to read and the visual novels are always something to look forward to!

       'Update: I said that I only rated 4 stars because sometimes I missed the chat room because I didn\'t get any notification, right? But now, after I updated the game I get notifications about the chat, and not just once but twice! I got double notifications lol I\'m so happy, thank you! And thanks for the 20 hourglasses after the update. Now I give you full 5 stars! I LOVE this game! 😘  I\'d love to give 5 stars, I mean this game is amazing and almost perfect! Just sad that sometimes I missed the chat because I didn\'t get the notification. So, I have to check the game often. But I really enjoy playing this game, which doesn\'t feel like game at all. I feel like I\'m chatting and talking with real people! And it says something, cause I just installed this yesterday. Highly recommended! Try it and you\'ll love it!',

But now every time I try to log onto my account it says \'Network error try again\' even when my wifi connection is perfectly fine. I\'d give this five stars if it gets fixed. Till then, since I can\'t play it, it\'s only 1 star.',

     [ 'This game is very fun and addicting. My only complaint is there isn\'t enough variation in the astromons. Some of them you can tell they are based off of a certain elemental character that\'s say...water but then the fire version is the same looking just red instead of blue. It\'s strange. Maybe change up how they look a bit more like in Pokemon with all of eevee evolutions. But then again it\'s a free game and I have been having a blast playing it. Thank you.',
       'As a beginner in the game, all the interaction menus and stuff you need to get to, or just wanna check out, take way to long to get to, as they\'re complicated and hold a lot of the game in them. It\'d be great if there were an easier way to figure out what they do, to get the most out of the game as a newbie, instead of going through 30 tutorials of their own to find out. Otherwise, I love the gameplay, characters, and art. Great game all in all.',
       'Its really fun to play! I\'ve had it for  4 days now and everyday you can spend at least 2 hours playing without it being boring AT ALL! I really like this game and hope that it will be updated for a long time. (I only wanted to say: Could you come up with a better name? At this point putting super in the name of a game doesn\'t really make it sound to great... When I see a game with super in the title I expect it to be awful or OK but not really fun. So seeing as I feel that this name does not represent the game well I would like to ask you to reconsider to a more attractive name.) Thanks for reading👍.',
       'To be perfectly honest, when I first downloaded the game I noticed someone mention in the reviews section that it\'s like Pokemon. At that time I was craving a good Pokemon like adventure rpg and that is why I downloaded it. But it is the furthest from the truth. Sure there are some similarities in a way that you raise monsters, level them up but that\'s about it. This game is not lacking in originality. Probably that is why it managed to keep me hooked for more than a few months as of this moment. It is definitely not another pathetic attempt at blatantly ripping off Pokemon. This game has its own unique art style, beautiful graphics, balanced system, well done mechanics and original ideas, player rewarding system based on the amount of time and effort they put in. There\'s always fun events going on keeping the player base interested. All of this while being not too much of a chore. The only thing I probably miss is the actual sense of adventure, traveling with your monsters. It already has an engaging story going for it. If they could implement an open world adventure with its current game mechanics and system which already works quite well, we could have a perfect game on our hand. But I realize it\'s easier said than done as it would require a tremendous amount of time and effort to achieve that. Anyway, when all is said and done it is quite the remarkable idle phone rpg that doesn\'t feel too much of a chore and you are amply rewarded for your time and effort without getting blocked by a pay wall. So I would highly suggest it to anyone looking for a game that they can commit to for a long time and even if one\'s not into long term commitments, it\'s still a fun game to check out and pass the time.',
       'Game is ok. but like every asian game is insta fillled with korean top players and clans that have every hero full developed. so feel free to skip  it or gave them money your pick. 4:33 release games every week for some quick bucks',
       'Great game. It\'s a little strange how the storyline cannot be re-read once it is completed though... Aside from that, the art is quite good, rating from cute to uh, voloptuous, and the thing that really appealed to me was the lack of clutter on the main screen. It\'s quite clean and easy to navigate. Highly recommend.' ],

       'Got too allgegro madness. And got stuck with the no face cards. 14 cards is alot to get. In fairway blast the card suits stick until a new none face card comes up, or reshuffles them. I find with this game they dont stick when the next card is turned over. So your run ends. And the run cards you ave accumulated as returned back to one agan.',
       'It\'s a fun game!! can keep you very entertained only thing that sucks is if you have it on PC or iOS there are way more features and it\'s way better than the Android version!!😢 So the side note is for the developers at Big Fish Games....... So I think we\'ve all waited way too long it\'s time to step it up and come out with a greater Android version at least make it as good as the iOS version!!!!!?????',
       'People will tell you that it\'s good for your brain or that it\'s fun, but that really isn\'t true, especially since it won\'t even allow you to turn off hints. Immediately after you make a move, you can\'t even think for yourself and try it alone. It\'s annoying. Don\'t get it. Go to a different solitary game.',
       'I love solitaire games, but this game is impossible. The first rounds will be easy, and then you\'re hit with ridiculous difficulty and straight up unwinnable games, that is, unless you spend money to get power ups that shouldn\'t even be necessary. 100% pay to win game. Which I find very sketchy. I\'ll never download anything from these developers ever again.',
       'PLEASE change where the 5 extra card for 2000 bucks is! I love this game but when you\'re short on money and you accidentally press it.... aaaaarggh. I\'m pretty sure others don\'t like where it is either. Could be a perfect game. And I spend hours a day on it as I\'m bedbound. Please...' ],

I am happy to see that there is a new level where you have to find the letters for the words behind the question marks. But, please make this game more fun by giving players a way to earn coins or boosters.',
       'It\'s a great game. Has it\'s hick-ups, specially with the free lives (I haven\'t had one in over 300 levels) but it\'s fun. Look forward to every new release',
       'One of best word games I\'ve played.  Uniquely challenging but easy to learn.  I hate to use the term addicting but I really do love this game!',
       'I love this game AND I hate it too! Very mixed emotions! I\'m at level 298 despite not getting many "good" extras/freebies on the days I can remember to spin their stupid wheeel. Unlike almost every other King game, there\'s no reward for playing daily. None for completing so many levels. And there are helper ppl u can choose from at beginning of level. They can be boosted up and work better by gathering stars. But I\'ve gotten tons of stars. They don\'t go towards boosting characters. I check them all, none of them ever get more stars. I don\'t like that. And nothing from Facebook friends. And the level booster you can add at beginning of level is equivalent of $10!! Which I\'ve already spent @least $15-$20, a dollar at a time on 5 more moves to finish off levels. Love this game despite all that. But can\'t get over feeling ripped off or cheated cuz of all these little things. Really wish they\'d level the playing field and make that rigged to rip u off wheel available all day not just 12-2.',

       'Oh my god, this is definitely the best game on the appstore. I thought I was never going to see another game that was not a arcade or a god awful clicker game ever again. Ponos if you\'re reading this thank you so much for bringing something new to the appstore. It is based on strategy which you rarely see. It\'s not as fun or addictive as other games, but it still deserves a point for being fresh. The title speaks for itself, you make cats battle. And the aren\'t even there which is proof of how confident Ponos is with their game. They clearly have experience and if I\'m wrong I would be blown away. Overall I believe it\'s good to see something fresh and I want this to continue so keep it up.',
       'I love all of the units and levels! However, I do have one issue, and that is that there is no cloud save. I had an account where I had beaten all cyclones, main chapters, and through ururun wolf stage. I also had 6 ubers and all rare cats hyper maxed. This account was accidentally deleted, leaving me back at the start of the game. Even with this one flaw, it is still probably my favorite mobile game.',
       'PONOS I LOOOOOVE THIS GAME. I have played since 2014, and I have not stopped(switched devices). I only have one thing to say: My energy is not recovering, even though my device time hadn\'t changed.  Thanks for an amazing game which never disappoints.',
       'PONOS, thank you for making this game. The only problem is 1. I just wasted ALL my cat food on tales of nekoluga and I only got rare cats and it said 100% chance To get one of the Lugas and it didn\'t give me one. I also had to watch 750 ads to afford it. What a waste of time. I WANT more cat food. Also why did u have to make ch. 2 moon hard. I\'ve been stuck on it for weeks. I\'m complaining about this because I NEEDED TO EVOLVE TECOLUGA so I could beat the moon. The moon is insane and tesalan whatever is also insane. PONOS, I want 6,000 cat food PLZ. At least give me tecoluga and 2M XP, PONOS if your reading this please GOD PLEASE give me what I asked for.' ],

     [ 'I was trying to take advantage of the first time deal. I purchased a deal and for some reason Google play didn\'t allow me to complete the charge. The next day I look in my bank account and I have been charged for what Google play said I couldn\'t do and I was charged another $4 when I didn\'t even click on anything. I want my money back. That is real shady that you would charge someone for a service that didn\'t even go through. And where did a $4 charge come from. And there is no way to ask through support to get that back so I\'m taking this here where others can see. Don\'t spend money here or there will be random charged in your bank account.',
       'Definitely not worth it. Was fun at first, but after the updated quests, the game took a serious nosedive in quality. Now you HAVE to beat the opponent in order to get anything, otherwise you\'re out 1000 gold. Before, you would get something just for playing. The new PvP just sucks.',
       'The forced ads are so frequent and annoying. Pvp either freezes and steals your coins or you win and lose coins. Probably over 100,000 coins lost this way. Game has potential and is fun, but company took this fun game and made it not worth playing',
       'Pretty decent game, shame you need to pay gems for the second last ship. The PvP is fun but half the time reduces my gold when I win. Cannot see the devs replying to any messages so unsure if they care',
       'Th game is fun and addicting. Way to many ads!!! Ahhhh My gold counter doesnt always register after endless mode is over. Gives me dble gold if i watch ad but doesnt register after endless battle sometimes. Would gave better review but that sux when it happens. Fix!!!!',
       'its frustrating on the pvp. you get disconnected and automatically lose. and sometimes they put you against someone who has better ships and level. they need to make it even and offer each player the same ships and same power ups at the same time. sometimes I get no power ups until round 3 and my opponent is already on level 7 because he gets better ships and power ups.' ],

     [ 'Just updated the game to it latest version  like an hour ago it\'s having problems keeps on crashing in middle of a fight, it also crash sometimes when i open it. Please fix this issue.   Other then that the game is quite amazing wish it had more fighter\'s though hopefully in the next updates new fighters will be added in the game.',
       'They app wont even stay up and running the ammount of times the app crashes is insane. Controls wise its a pretty typical fighting game. Idk much past that sonce the app refuses to stay open. In its current state the game is unplayable. If theres any change then ill change my review but for now dont bother',
       'You guys need to improve alot in graphics, smoth animation and quick response of controls.. Because of tekken game\'s cult following arround the world. This game can become no1 if the said aspects are improved. Thanks and good job devs.',
       'I didn\'t expect it will be this bad 😫. Is this cards game or Tekken?. I thought it will have 8 way overlap pad so we can do most of the actions. Because this kind of control what makes the game exciting. But you guys made it with cards. I\'m really so disappointed 😥.',
       'I\'d lost my progress in before the bug fix, even purchased the gems. But now started over. Game is smoother than before. The loading time, the packs opening time, also the time for matches could be trimmed. Also there should be the replay of finishing attack. On Snapdragon 835 adreno 540, it\'s really fluid fast. Sometimes the splash screen in the start freezes, and the screen smudges for a while till loading. Also if you are opening the dojo vault, and you get daily login gift. Both get stuck and not able to retrieve any. There should be tab for daily bonus and time remaining for next gift.',
       'Jst upset that cant give it a zero. The game is pretty good, and is interesting to play but after the latest update , that is v1.0.2 it keeps crashing and I\'ve to reopen it. Seriously dont provide updates if you guys are unable to make it worthwhile.' ],

     [ 'Two big parts of what I love about this game are its inclusivity in terms of skin tone and gender representation.   There are four different skin tones available to everybody in every situation. While there are many more variations in reality, it\'s refreshing to have more options than one.   Some items have gendered words in the their titles, but that doesn\'t restrict their usage at all. It\'s possible to mix and match anything and everything, regardless of each item\'s implied target gender.   I\'m not sure if these positive aspects were intended or not, but they make me feel included, which is more than I can say for most games.',
       'This game is cute, but be prepared there will be a lot of things that require in app purchases. I myself am a free player and its just pain. Some of the events are fun, really wish that there was more. We should be able to earn coins, like short videos for a certain amount of coins daily.',
       'WHAT THE HELL?! Why the hell don\'t I never get last day bonus- you know, when you\'re supposed to get 5 premium gacha tickets? I swear to god this game sucks more each time I see it.',
       'Fun app but I wish there was more interaction with other members. Also, there is a bug that doesn\'t allow the last 48 ticket to load and skips right to day one. It\'s a bad bug, so please fix it. I log in daily and still don\'t get my items',
       'Played for years and saw how much more unfair it is becoming, little by little.  If you\'re a free player, accept the fact you\'re probably not getting anything you want and definitely won\'t be at the top and maybe you can have some fun. Yes, apparently new players now get a lot of tickets and free stuff, but don\'t get used to it - that\'s just the bait to reel you in.  You\'re not exactly guaranteed to get anything if you pay every event/gacha//week as well, so keep that in mind before installing. This is the greediest game I\'ve ever seen.',

     [ 'The game is great.  Runs smooth.  It isn\'t country locked but the translator works great.  However,  if I could make any recommendations,  I would ask the developers to put in a realm chat instead of a global one. I would also make the private messages shorter instead of long chains. Maybe a feedback option in the  menu.',
       'Aside from looking cool, the controls and small graphics are annoying and cumbersome on this particular game.  Having to building 20 resource buildings and individually upgrade them is a royal pain and also very stupid with the timeframe it takes to upgrade each. My device wouls literally be pinging all day.  The icing on the cake was them begging for a 5 star rating by offering reward to do so.',
       'Its great game but the customer care service is awefull. The bundles are so cheap in some countries and so expensive in Europe and America. Plus the technical problems, I got zeroed twice because I couldnt loggin. The customer care is a joke, they ignore you or ask you to wait then wait etc....',
       'Make available better gears to all. I have lots of T5 but my gear is not same good like many few ppl in my realm for example they have 2000% range attack while I have 1050% so I do not have chance to win. If you are not sort it is just a waste of time. Without chance to win I do not want to play just for farming weak players is not intresting.',
       'Some things are a bit vague - like how to get Influence Points once you\'re in charge of a castle. And the lady at the top is rather... useless. But everything else works brilliantly.',
       'This game is a lot different from other RTS games, here if you want, you can play f2p as well. But even spending only 40€ and waiting for the right packs and being active for about a month u can get t5 (highest tier) and have the full expirence of the game as i did. recommend it a lot' ],

Performance is the worst is all i can say. Not strictly pay to win but almost still fun while free and has been for years. I just hope it works decently on your device as performance has just gotten worse over the years on my dozens of devices.

       'Not up to todays standard in gaming (not even mobile gaming!) 100 % pay to win! Story mode, team-fights and some PvP (incl. empire wars), offer less than competitors do. Ocassional appearing events will bore you, latest when played for the third time! Graphics are average. Summing up: The game modes & stages are not attractive, fair or interesting! Tier 2 classes didnt bring more flexebility, instead further inbalanced wars. Since high ranked PvPs are rewarded per season, top boss-fighters should receive similar. One could see over all those gaming issues and still have fun with this game, BUT the aggressively hostile community & chat atmosphere gives this product the rest! A childish product that attracts childish minds! Be sure to protect minors from that inacceptable environment!!! All ranking calculations seem quite strange, as late entries always have unfair advantages. I dont get in what reality people live that introduce earnings and progression upon PvP-losses?!? - everybody knows that the high ranks are earned through purchases anyway, trying to be everybodies darling now? Maybe you should remove pre-selected PvP-lists, and stop rigging the competition instead! No game anywhere in the world rewards for loosing, nobody can take such actions serious, and therefore I still can only evaluate mobile gaming much childisher than real competetive console- & PC-gaming! My advice: You are better off with a competitors game! PS: spare me those ignorant standard review replies, this game is of such low quality, you dont need to outline this further by giving awkward suggestion replying to reviews! All regarding this negative ranking is all detailed, outlined and explained in this review, maybe read it before annoying me with an additional review reply!!',

Do not blame the devs for your impatience or inability to see the strategy in the game. This game can be completely F2P if you have patience. I do no blame the devs for wanting to get paid for releasing a quality product.

     [ 'So I played it on my iPhone e and loved it. Recently o got a new phone and it\'s am android. I connected to my Nintendo account and loaded it up. My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I\'m not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr',
       'Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I\'m paying £9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn\'t make it worth the price being asked.',
       'I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',
       'This would have got 5 stars had I been able to share it with my 2 kids via family share. I refuse to pay £30 for all 3 of us to have access to all the levels.  Great game though. Fun, quick and easy to play. Many hours spent between us. So many levels too.',
       'Super Mario run is a great smartphone game it has the very addicting toad rally and remix ten and the simple, but very rewarding controls. The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars',
       'I beat world 1, and I have to pay for the rest of the game? Really? This is stupid.. If you\'re going to have a game you need to pay for, market it as such, not the ol bait and switch. Very deceitful.. At least make a trial game or demo game not lure someone in and then tell them they need to pay to finish the game' ],

       'It would get a higher rating if there wasn\'t energy involved. And you pretty much have to pay real money to get weapons. I was hoping you would be able to use the money acquired in the game, but for most stuff you need "gold". Take a long time to aquire gold unless you buy it. I\'m almost done the second region and I think I\'m losing interest. I love to hunt so I was excited about this game but it definitely could be A LOT better. Hope there\'s updates to make getting weapons easier',
       'Awesome game but. It should have that animation effect which shows you the parts of guns while upgrading them. It was so cool in that previous version. In previous version Whenever we upgrade it feels like we are really purchasing the gun\'s accessories. Game is great but as a user almost all will mis this thing... If u wnt to improve ur game than this comment is worth a million for you..  so just go for the fix bro. Best wishes',
       'Awesome updates! I love this game, probably too much. The only problem is for some reason, the app crashes very frequently on my T-Mobile Galaxy S8 Plus. I\'ve cleared the cache and checked for updates to Play Services. If you could look into this further, it would be tremendously appreciated. Otherwise, excellent work, thank you kindly.',
       'I absolutely love this game. The only issue I have encountered is when I tried to play this 2018 version that says its compatible through my Chrome cast device version 2016 displayed on my tv and would not go past the play hunt screen. Please tell me if there is something I\'m not doing right.',
       'This would of got a 4 maybe even 5 stars. If I could still play it. I enjoyed myself and finished the first region on the game, closed it out and came back later and it wouldn\'t let me connect. It just said cannot connect to severs. And I haven\'t been able to get back in. Please fix this. I enjoy this game' ],

     [ 'Yes this is addictive, yes it\'s fun, and it\'s great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don\'t have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it\'s not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it\'s clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.',
       'Way way WAYYY too laggy. It\'s an easy casual game though. I wouldn\'t say it\'s "fun" but it does pass the time and make you want to achieve the little goals. Only goal, make more money in game. That\'s it and you achieve that by not even playing the game so there\'s no challenge whatsoever. Uninstalled after first day reaching about 500 Trillion and force closing 100 times.',
       'This game is enjoyable, but like many have said, it drains battery life. Moreover, it hangs too long when switching planets. I suspect, like many areas of technology, performance testing new updates with older devices is not even a consideration. If it runs smooth on the latest and greatest then it is ready to ship.  Like many mobile games this is a casino. It\'s main existence is to make money. I do not have a problem with this so much, but the events give rewards based on leaderboards. Unfortunately, they are pay to win. You are bombarded with options to pay cash. Making the top charts without spending money is not likely to happen.  This game is a time and battery killer, so keep you charger close by.',
       'It\'s okay, but now that I think about it, it really takes up your free time and battery, to me it is eh no use but adddictive! If I had a choice to choose between a milla-seccond or a minute, I would choose a milla-seccond but technichly, you could just go offline while you are waiting. Cool game! 3 stars.',
       'Earth dollar = moon dollar.. the exchange rate is 1:1 when converting to the megabuck not like you grinded to jus redo earth play in the moon or anything. Events are unfairly calculated as well. If you do not pay $$$ you will not tier above 7-8 tiered rewards, if that even.  Youd think in a capitalist game you would be allowed to have choice over portrait lock. But the game overrides system settings I guess.  Game lags hard when it cant figure out portrait or not.',
       'You should be connected to facebook. So when people change from iPhone to android, we can keep our levels. I just had to restart again and I had 6800 lemons and not much longer to complete the game. What an accomplishment I\'m going to try to receive this time' ],

     [ 'This game is essentially a pay-to-play game with one major difference-build times. Part of the reason that I don\'t usually play games like this is because upgrading your HQ to level 10 takes a couple of days. With that aspect, the game is more fun and the developers make less money because purchases dramatically decrease. I find that to be important for them to sacrifice something to make us happy.   Unfortunately, though, my phone overheats when I  play it, so I can\'t binge on it. I would like to, though.',
       'Great action graphics and animation. Love the team aspect. Only negatives for now are several recurring glitches and constant tweaks to the battle aspects of the game due to upgrades and adding additional gameplay features. Takes awhile to get accustomed and tough to get comfortable with constant changes, but still interesting.',
       'This game was very addictive until latest update. Latest update reduce attacking power significantly and making this game is not fun anymore. We can\'t even defeat base with 6 level below ours. Now, this game is suck. Not gonna play again, just let the miners fulfill the storages by their own as attacking just a kind of wasting my time and my resources.',
       'It\'s fun, good time killer. However slow loading, glichtes are becoming too frequent. Biggest issue, almost have to buy packs on a regular basis to level up. You don\'t get enough resources in the game to build, it takes too many resources.',
       'Newest changes not implemented fairly or consistently. They changed how upgrades work dramatically mid game without any prior notice or phase in. The result is any weapon upgrades you didn\'t have the level to use yet have been removed and replaced with new system that requires far more grinding now. Old players now have a much larger advantage over new ones because of this change since they were able to easily upgrade stats while now you are hindered with rare upgrade drops that mean only one thing to play the game...$$$$$ sad.',
       'The game was pretty good before they brought in changes to the maps and units. The game now is mostly for people who want to spend in purchasing units. It\'s no more for people who want to enjoy a good game. Too many changes brought too early. This game will economically drain you.' ],
