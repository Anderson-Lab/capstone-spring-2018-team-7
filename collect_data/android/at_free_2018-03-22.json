        "Wow! Great job on this mobile port. In addition it's also free. Download it! This might be the best mobile game I have ever played, with the best looking graphics. It's absolutely insane that this will run on my phone, but I'm not sure if I can run it on my computer. This is impressive and super fun. The controls are fine, but take some getting used to. If you added Bluetooth controller support, I would buy a controller just to play this. Good job guys  :)",
        "I think this game is really good compared to the Xbox and PC versions of the game. It also adds a few other options for the game that aren't on the PC/Xbox version such as distance from your marker, dotted line to your marker, and it tells you how many poeple are in the plane. The aim assist really helps balance out the phone controls to keep gun fights running smooth and everything works really well. There is the occasional lag spike and stuff but the game works really well for my 2 year old Samsung  tablet.  10 out of 10 would recommend.",
        "Umm i loved this game on my pc but on mobile I belive there are some serious optimisation needed I am using a Samsung j7 prime and it can't run this game on low too. Means are you guys serious? You wrote that it works on Redmi 4a having a much less specs as compered to j7 I know its a samsung phone but we can expect a smooth experience at low setting I will change my rating once I get a smooth experience. Hope you fix it soon",
        "This game is amazing. I've only ever played on mobile since it's hard to find time to play video games. I fell in love within the first game. This mobile version is so good especially being an early release. It only takes up 205mb of storage and runs amazing even on my Honor 7x which is a great phone but is known to be not the best with higher end gaming. I'm very impressed with this game and I'll keep playing it!",
        "Nvrmind I'm starting to understand this game. It's not bad but could be a lot better. Still say u should get to keep wat u find. Unlocking is kool but should be only for better than basic gear. Just my opinion. Guns and melee weapons it's understandable to have to find them over again each game but the clothing I just don't understand y I gotta be naked unless I unlock crates to get clothes. Weird really.",
        "It is a super good game. Probably the best from all other battleground games, even fortnite. You guys should put a game mode where teams of 4 can conqure land on the map. And once a person dies they cant respond. Put checkpoints all across the map to be able to claim a section of the map. The only way to win is by eliminating every enemy or taking all the land. This mode will change the game play of pubg and will be another unique thing compared to fortnite. It is also something new and very interesting. Please take this into consideration."

One of the reasons that I  love word games is because the screen is without animation. It would be great if this was an option that could be turned off in settings.",
        "So good I've finished it! Great game for stimulating the mind. Waiting for new levels but at least I can still do the daily puzzle. Only downside is that some of the words are extremely obsure but the dictionary should help with those. Please hurry and add new levels.... I'm addicted!",
        "Challenging, fun and interactive! Great app for those who likes brain and vocabulary challenges :D Down side is that after the update, the butterflies run out in daily challenge even before i finish the puzzle so I always end up with 2 stars... please fix this bug or error...",
        "Very good but log in or if u change phone u loose ur game & start again! 😂 very frustrating when so far in lol! Also why is lea not a word i thought it was a meadow in the english dictionary? Am i wrong?",
        "Where did the free hints in exchange for ads go?  They had recently moved to their own button, found by hitting \"Shop\" then X-ing out.  Today, they are completely gone.  I'm going to stop playing this game without them.  It's no fun to get stuck.",
        "Ok. This is my THIRD review of this game and I'm getting a little upset. You put the clues back. Thank you very much for listening to us all. Now I have a new issue with the way you have changed this game. Before People Fun came along, when we put a word into the puzzle, sometimes we would see things like, \"Excellent!\" Or, \"Spectacular!\" pop out at us. I noticed this morning that you've taken away that feature. Why? This game was absolutely perfect when you came along. Why are you changing it? Who are you, that you would take a perfect game and then take away the best features? Those words popping out made the game more fun, and they encouraged us to keep going, and yeah, I don't mind saying it. They made us feel good about ourselves. It was a pat on the back. Who gets many of those these days? And you took that away from us. Now this game is dry and boring. Please put the pats on the back, back. Thank you."

        "My first played MOBA. This is excellent game and there's nothing could beat this game. Otherwise, please make improvement like losing stars cause of that AFK player. Deducting credits may not the good way to discipline afk players. Its good if no one's lose or gain star either win or not. Make it the game not counted so players not waist time to pursue the game. I'll give 5 stars if 5 theres improvement. Thanks!",
        "MOBA with analog is really a big joke. The graphics is trashy. Hero and skin are hard to unlock. There's a kind of in game power up that could be bought with real money. The only reason this game has so many player is the game size & device compatibility. If your phone is capable of playing \"the famous 3v3 moba\", you'd better play that game",
        "This game is so cool. Only noob will say it hard to play or hard getting hero/skin. Maintain the gameplay and everything will be alright. Sometimes we win and sometime we won't. Only the graphics need to be improve. Come on! It's 2018 already! Make a tournament cause i wanna join!!. (Give me free skin. I give u  5 stars bitchhhhhhhh)",
        "Why don't you try real super hero characters that we know like from dc anime etc such as. Dragon ball naruto bleach justice league avengers try doing it new heroes are good but if there are some like worldwide famous heroes also then it would sound much more  interesting",
        "I love this game, I've been playing this for over a year and I still play it daily! All the skins and heroes skills are amazing. But please don't  let me team up with low level players it's affecting my game and stats when I'm trying my best to carry they would just afk which can be frustrating. But overall it's a good game",
        "I hv been playing this game for two years alll good perfect game perfect graphics..bt there should be some changes for the afk players... strict steps should be taken towards for these afk players not bye lowering credit score by banning from game for a period of time so that they won't be spoiling game any further"

        "I don't write reviews on games , but this one is impressive. Once I tweaked the settings the graphics became amazing, love that there is NO wait time for upgrades ! You buy it, you own it . Big advantage.. And you dont HAVE to go platinum to enjoy this game, but I am considering it ! GREAT JOB !!",
        "It has a good game play as well as millions of adds which eventually ruines the game. You have to watch an add after every single mission and before starting a new mission to gain energy. So basically the energy bar is just a little trick played on us for watching advertisement. I will not recommend this game only because of the adds, otherwise it's really a good game.",
        "Do not buy Premium. You see all the locked features saying exclusive to Premium. You drop $70 for Premium only to find out the best features are still locked because now there is Premium Plus for ANOTHER $150. You are not told other than here by me that what you get when you buy Premium is a Premium-lite. You hear about Premium Plus for the first time after you have bought Premium (lite)",
        "Nice game. So far I've noticed only critical hits count. Taking out a knee or a shot to the gonads usually fails. Upgrades are like any other game, spend money to get the good stuff. Hopefully it doesn't get to the point I can't unlock the items to keep playing.",
        "Sinse last update when playing when get killed it will show score screen but spawning back to game locks up and won't play just have to watch myself lose or stop and start over losing my life??????? Please fix...... Would like to know when you are going to fix can't win for losing life and diamonds and not even getting to play!!!!!!!!!! Don't know what you have done to the game getting where it is no fun getting killed before you even get respawned",
        "Not only are the graphics realistic, there so persise on everything. They even allow you to purchase different variety of guns. I just wish they let you assemble your own gun, which of course accessories. Best sniper game I've ever played."

If you can please add the feature of talking to enemies when they get near. Or maybe let us chose our squad members (as many of them don't use voice chat)",
        "i was very addictated to this game until the last update. i can't even log in to the game, it said \"network error\", but my network is fine tho. i tried deleting data and reinstalling the game but nothing happened. once i can log in to the game, i can't even play normal matches. and my friendlist is gone wheter it's in game friends or platform friends. hope these problems will be fixed, i really love this game tho, i wanna play it soon :(",
        "This game is just... wow. It has great graphics after the new update, great gameplay and there is a lot to do in this game. It's designed very well, the map is great, everything about it is great. However, i was talking in discord with some people and they said that they couldn't play ranked. I launched the app, and i saw that i could not play it either. I hope this gets fixed soon, good luck! Edit: I can now play ranked mode, 5 stars",

        "Could be better. I dont like the fact that anyone can just waltz up to you and come in your house. There should be a setting that allows you to keep your house and sims private from other people. Also its a bit weird that if you tap on any sim without talking to them, they come into your house and do whatever they like without permission, even if you have a bad relationship with them. And it would also be nice if doors could be locked.",
        "It's fun so far! Can't wait to play more and see what else is in store! P.S. the sims, I wish they would not go off on their own and make doubles. Like if you want to make it a real life interaction type style, you should probably fix it to where the actions are more real and not computerized. I would like the option to do more with my kid sims, like more clothes options.  I also dont like the fact that when your sim retires, yoy no longer have control over them. Yhat jind of sucks. Alot...but Keep up the good work. Thanks!",
        "PLEASE  HELP!!!!! So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning. And didn't really recovered my previous game. Love everything except for this.  P.S. i did the troubleshooting in the forum but nothing really helps.",
        "Edit: I just had my latest infant boy \"evolve\". My question is, why did you all give me a caucasian kid when my family is black? My other 2 kids are black too! I don't mind (since he's here lol) but this is odd.     I love this game! Already have 2 kiddos and a big house!",
        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much",
        "I've always been a fan of The Sims since it first came out on the PC and now this version is WAY BETTER than their other App game! I LOVE IT! It's so much fun and I can't wait to see what more is in store! UPDATE: After playing longer and being able to have a baby with my spouse, I found that our kids are labeled son and daughter under his family tree, but as father and niece under mine. That makes no sense! What's going on?!"

        "This is an extremely fun game. O have a few suggestions on how to fix things on the game. I noticed three things while playing this game. 1. There is not a continue playing option. This can easily be fixed and with all of the great work from Dvloper I think that this is not too far away. 2. I noticed you can uncrouch in the tunnel in the basement even though you are not all the way through. 3. Everything is in a certain place. If one object is in a certain place then if you are familiar with the game enough you will know where the other objects are. To be honest this is not a minor concern but still could be fixed. Other than that I can't stop playing! Thank you so much!!",
        "I love this game, especially when you hide just in time and there's that tense moment wondering if she saw you. I get chills down my spine when I'm hiding and I hear her saying \"I see you\". If I could, I would give this game 100 stars. I would suggest having a mode after you beat Granny to become Granny because I think it would be cool to chase the player around the house. Also, I think the game would benefit from a much bigger house, more drawers and of course, more locks. Love the game, keep up the good work.",
        "It's really really really fun game.  But I think if you guys do some more improvements so it will be much fun.  Here's what I think:  1. I think you should make the house much bigger.  2. You should add more enemies for example:  child o' slenderina,  slenderman and the spiders.  3. You should add an Adventure mode.  Where you need to find some books or something like an emblem like that stuff to make them uncursed like that.  4. Last but not least, you should add more weapons for example:  Pistol,  sword,  injection etc.    If you do that,  it will be super cool and fun.   ThanQ 😃👍",
        "It's definatly one of the better (more fun) horror games on the store, but I feel like there could be some more improvements. Firstly I think that if you've completed hard than there should be an (almost) impossible mode. Also minor details such as different textures and Easter eggs would be good. Last, I think that when you escape there should be an outside section where it's still got puzzles but it's more about the atmosphere. (Maybe that could just be for the \"impossible mode\") but it would make the game a lot more enjoyable. Also maybe a reward for escaping. (For incentive). Thank you and maybe you could take this into consideration :) also new app icon plz",
        "Who doesn't love this game? It's bone chilling and exciting for the whole family (Litterally my whole fam plays this game) it would be cool to have a mode where there was no granny just to explore the house and get a feel for how to escape. Also some weapons to attack granny. Lastly a map of where granny is would be super cool. Good luck!",
        "It's a vary good game so hood i can't believe it's on mobile game! Also the game mechanics are so amazing as well. Then there's series of things you have to do that keeps you in the game for a long time; the theme and music fit the atmosphere, and there's not much of a problem with the game either. \"This game gives me goosebumps!\" (From Dashigames aka Dachi) he loves it as well too. #goodgamemakemore"

        "I. Freaking. LOVE this game! I used to love playing it as a child so when I saw it here I decided to give it a chance, and it's so legit! It's exactly how I remember it being on our old computer, and it is SO ADDICTIVE. The very day I got it I played for like 4 hours straight. Literally. Honestly I love the game. A little unhappy about the ads but honestly you get what you pay for, and this was free, so I can't complain too much.",
        "I have completed 3 rounds in the past on this game and wanted to play again not having to watch a video after every level is too time consuming. Years ago not as bad. after 5 levels deleted. EA took a good game and turned it into a ad seeking game. UGH AND UGH. Do not play unless you love ads. Other games you can watch ads at your leisure for prizes but not mandatory. Good luck but if new to game RUN..Lots to choose from.",
        "It remains a classic, yet some parts are just too screwed up. After paying to remove the ads, the ad hoes with the play button still show up. The vase breaker was my favourite in the past. Now it is broken. 65% of the time ir reads actap like a double tap making it utterly unplayable",
        "Irritating. At first it gives you an option of playing a video to receive additional help. Which works only for the first time. Next time onwards no way to cancel the video in case you don't want to install it. It is so frustrating. Either allows to cancel or tell the users what to do next. Worst way of promoting other apps.",
        "It was good but then this happened. I was playing just like any other day. My phone had died while I was playing, so I charged it and left it untouched for about an hour or two. When I signed in, all off my progress was erased! Please respond and tell me what happened.",
        "The game was great than EA got to it with there sticky fingers and put adds everywhere, it isn't the same game I enjoyed ages ago. It's just another add infested game now, even if you do pay for it l. The charm is gone"

        "Love it. Been playing for over a year. You can earn gems slowly to get premium characters or spend money to get them. However you do not need premium characters to play the game. I think people forget that your \"FREE\" games have to make money some how to pay developers, animators, IT support and more. Either they have dozens of ads everyday (DK has a few but not dozens) or premium paid content.",
        "Most addictive game! Playing it since it 1st started. Love the new mystery event it's so adorable except your missing one vital character!!  I think there's a couple points to improve on... the send home button in the characters actions list I think should be up the top and smaller instead of scrolling down for it cos I use it often. 2nd all of the sounds in my game are very poor, it's nearly always silent and music is always late. Haven't heard the high 5 sound in ages 😔 please fix the sound!",
        "The game is fun and all, but do you think you guys could get this game optimized for the Lenovo tablets? I had to get a new tablet since previous one broke. Now the game keeps closing out on me when I'm trying to do something. Think you guys can fix this somehow?  I'd appreciate it if you do. Thanks in advance.",
        "Fantastic graphics, great controls, overall great game.  Recommended to my friends child.  Some tasks  (i.e., leveling up a character, waiting to clearing a curse, waiting to open a chest...) take too long and their is nothing to do while you wait.  Game has improved tremendously! Love the game, won't stop playing. Thank you Disney!",
        "This game has given me nothing but problems. Every update has to have a glitch. First there was a problem when ever I tried to open a chest. Then an update came and After that update now the consetion stands close out the game anytime I want to view. Now with winnie the poo update the whole dam game is slow. Seriously thinking of quiting. It doesn't matter every update has a glitch. Can't u guys fix it? Or is just me?",
        "This is a fun game. Graphics are so very Disney.  I have a question.. WHAT is the reason for the guests to have a character over their head? That is quite distracting..especially when I don't know what their purpose is.  Also..I wish their leveling up and their quests weren't so long..I only get to play about 5 minutes. But I do love the game"

        "I think this game has very good everything, the only thing about the game play is that they trick you kind of and it is hard to get Easter Eggs and stuff. Or when you jump off a train and there is one of those things you have to roll under but you have no time so the police catches you. Or maybe I am not good with those things. Yeah, probably just I am not good at this game.",
        "Why is it difficult to get daily challenge without using data?  And one can't see other users scores without data. Can't that be possible at least for a week if one on it to her their records it shud be like that for the rest of the week. Most importantly  subway surfers consume too much data. But wen updating every month and for that reason I humbly demand that this game company provide physical cash reward for those who are consistent for us to tell others who are asking us who subway surfers help. If we tell them benefits we derive I bet u more people who are lover of games will wanna be part of subway. Trust  me....  Tnx in anticipation",

I really want the teleporter but I can't get enough coins and I've been playing for AGES! Otherwise, brilliant game always fun. Time consuming.Thank you!"

Anyway the game's good everything is cool but.. if u think u have seen an app with more adds then you know nothing download any voodoo game.. Literally after every single game over u get ads so it doesnt really matter if u tap the revive button (yeah u should u get ads regardless)",
        "Honestly, it's a really good game that mangages to pass as challenging, entertaining, addictive, and time-consuming (in my opintion) all at the same time. But, there are WAY to many ads. The game itself is great but all the ads and interuptions completely takes away from the main purpose of the game; having fun. That's pretty much the only aspect of the game that I highly suggest improving at the moment.",
        "I think the ads are fine. It acts as a breather whenever i lost a run. The gameplay is addictive and all. but.... BUGS! i hate it when i pass through 3 or more layers. And still died by stepping on dangerous tile instead of breaking it. Just had a 11k run today and died because of a stupid bug",
        "Honestly i love this game its a great way to kill time. And there's a lot of reviews on here saying how theres too many ads. Heres the simple solution to that. Don't like ads? Turn off your wifi. Ads can't play without internet.",
        "Reformat your ads. If you're gonna have one play after you lose do it exactly when you lose, not after yu've had a chance to start the next wave. Otherwise watching an ad to revive seems really dumb",
        "It's a good game that is challenging to start,  but adds nothing to keep it challenging. It just changes colors. It would be nice to have a timer,  or a high score, or something to aim to beat. Or maybe even that once you hit a section of a tear it falls away and you have to keep moving (challenge mode). I still play it,  I like it. Just wish there was something to keep it challenging."

Boosters must be given more often.",

One suggestion: make it clear $3 gets you one-time access to your piggy bank only. Thanks😄",

        "What have you done?!! This was a great game with a few annoying adverts, now it's just one long advert interspersed with occasional races. I have no real issue with adverts but when they stick on the screen and hide the X until way after the timer ends that's just offensive. And seriously - £8.99 PER MONTH to clear ads? (Yes I know you get extras) - come on that's taking the ****",
        "Really fun casual game. Adverts are present but not too intrusive. Allowed to watch adverts in exchange for upgrades or items.   My only criticism is that it takes a while to get used to the different menu items as there's no instructions and the \"see as far as you can go\" sections are really expensive to unlock.",

        "Money greedy game. You will end up watching ads every minute. You will be forced to watch half a minute irrelevent ads every minute. It's like these guys built the best game to annoy people with ads. Good luck. Played several levels just to get annoyed and uninstall.",

Similarly maxed th11 players are raiding my base sucking all my loots with all maxed troops , lvl 50 king/queen and lvl 20 warden...This is because i dont invest money in this game.",

Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",

They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",
        "Super game my favourite game really nice guys download it .I have A small request if we have got any bonus in war or Multiple battles it automatically goes in Clan Castle ,and when we want withdraw it give whole treasure comes out. So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.",

Now I am playing this game wonderfully. Thank you super cell and coc. But only the problem is maintainance of server.  It says try again later.  That's why I have rated it 4★. Other wise iwll give 5★. But any way game is wonderful.        PLEASE INSTALL THIS GAME IT'S WONDERFUL GAME"

        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I still love this game! However I have yet to change my mind about the fact that it takes longer to vote just for 3 stars at a time, than to actually design the max of 5 designs per day. Can you not increase stars won per vote? Can you not make designs brief even more compulsory as many designers dont follow the brief and you just end up losing votes because your design is too colourful or eclectic",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget."

The only thing I don't like is that when you shoot sometimes in attacker defender, the other person jumps up and blocks the ball when it's already almost to the net. Please fix this. Overall though, it is a great game.",
        "U guys need to give me like 10 billion dollars. Every time I'm winning in the game it cuts off, it says \"connecting\" like seriously. Iv got the best WiFi in the world and it says connecting. Like really, iv just been loosing due to this. Fix it. Or give me 10 billion dollars in the game. I wont play it anymore if I get cut off 1 more time.",
        "The new update attempts to force you to buy gold bricks I'm order to unlock your gift bags. This may force me to delete the game as it's annoying when your winning multiple games . They could at least adjust the price of the gold bricks. Use to be one of my favorite games and I am not one to play to many games .",
        "Good game. Balanced controls. Thanks to the developers 😀. However the game shows constant network connectivity issues. Even though I use a very high speed wifi and data it still kicks me out for bad connection which leads to losing the game. Pls Fix this guy's. Apart from that an awesome game. Thumps up to the developers",
        "It's great but the new updates suck..Why now you have to wait for the bag you won!!! in a game? You have to wait almost 2 hourse to get one of the bags open? Also you mussout on the other bags you've one because the space is full and you cant het anymore bags until the load or you pay your golds!!! i see that your trying to make money and thats sad because i believe this game is a gold mine with in itself!! but dang the bags!! really? We have to wait for the bags we won!!! to ready itself for openings!! that's stupid!  i think yall should put it back to where the bags just open when you win a game!!and get rewarded a bag. That's really like hey you won a $1000 buck but oh wait you need to pay your taxes first before you can get whats left of it!! Sad!! Put it back to the way it was!!!",
        "I think it's a good game and it had an awesome foundation up until the latest update. I am completely and utterly dissatisfied with the newest update. What happened, Mini Clip =(  Now it just feels like I'm waiting to play instead of playing. I'm alright with change just not coping Clash of Clans terrible waiting system, for prizes I won..."

        "I absolutely love this game. I make it a point to not spend money on mobile games cus they typically turn out to be a cash trap, but this was just like buying a regular video game. No adds, and even before buying the full game it doesn't shove \"buy our product\" notifications down your throat. Nintendo has always had good games and I have no doubts that I will keep playing this every day.",
        "Awesome update! Make the game worth again, when it seems Nintendo had abandoned Super Mario Run, they back and release more content for the half of the price. This is the kind of update I was waiting for, once I didn't paid the game yet, I think this could be a great time to purchase. Probably in the future they will release more content, but the price will back to 9.99, so the best time to purchase is now! Great job Nintendo, I love your games since my childhood.",
        "Was pretty short to begin with but Nintendo has supported this game well, adding additional content, even a new mode. The simplified game mechanics to fit Mario gaming on a phone work great and feel natural. The story with it's additional challenges to open new courses are fun, toad run is addictive, the remix 10 is somewhat redundant content wise but also good. I'd rather pay $10 up front than have in-game purchases, the reception to this game indicates that I'm very much in the minority on that. Great game, very fun for a quick session of Mario.",
        "Awesome and all, but you only get 4 levels for free. To go to world 2, WHY IN THE UNIVERSAL WORLD RIGHT HERE IN A CITY (lol😀) DO YOU HAVE TO BUY WORLD 2, 3, 4, 5, AND 6? TALK ABOUT A RIPOFF! 😞 (Warning to Nintendo: If you dont fix this soon, I'm deleting. Sorry!)",
        "Favorite game. It has a one time cost for full version and not a monthly fee or several different things you have to buy to enjoy it. I like the updates with the remix, and the star courses. I didnt like that there was so little to do before I bought it. I got bored quick. But was surprised by the cost, and love it after buying it. I do wish we could see our friends land and share things we don't need and give rally tickets to others.",
        "This is just proof Nintendo can make amazing games no matter the platform. All the bad reviews are people's mad you gotta pay for the game. Lol wut? It's a great time killer made  by the best gaming company in the world and you're mad it's not free? Funny. There's no IAP.  It's not pay to win. But it is the most fun 5$ will ever buy you."

        "The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn't make it better at controlling. I don't know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌",
        "this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It's so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It's just so addicting and I can't get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the 'play online' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊",
        "This is better than the browser version for multiple reasons. 1) It doesn't lag as much. I played a few rounds a noticed a little bit of lag, but it's better than the browser version.  2) You can play against AI if you don't want to play against people. I like this because I actually had a chance to win and was able to kill some. 3) You can create your own custom skin, which is awesome. All of this is free as well. I love this version of Slither.io.",
        "So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I'll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It's in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I've ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍",
        "Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃",
        "The controlls are pretty bad considering how simple they are.  The lag is unbearable. Fix those and you've got a 5star game all day. Simple fun pick up and put down time killer. In fact the lag is such an issue however, the game is getting uninstalled. You can't play a reaction based game when the lag has you 6 seconds behind whats going on."

        "Its a super fun game and I liked it. But for some reason every 5 seconds an internet browser would pop up saying I had a virus on my phone. Checked my phone but nothing. It never did this with any other app even before downloading this. Only ever happened when playing the game.",
        "I actually like the game, but I got all the guys in 3 days.... Now what? There are no upgrades or any other options to use the money on. Also the same thing is happening as others said, where the browser keeps popping up saying there is a virus. Pretty annoying",
        "Fun game, very entertaining. Ads pop up too often, it opens my browser saying i have a virus. I cant avoid it and it happens very often. Im only keeping the app bc i hope the next update fixes this issue. Other than the stupid pop up its a great game and i enjoy it. Please fix it so i dont have to uninstall.",
        "I wanted to enjoy this game. The advertisements randomly open chrome browser windows with a fake virus scan saying \"your device is infected.\" Its ironic in that the software that you're prompted to download is terrible adware that an actual scanner might flag.  It's quite persistent too, happening only after I installed this. 30 second video ads midgsme and adbars that just so happen to pop up and hover where you have to click in-game.",
        "I love the game as a whole, and I just barely redownloaded it and it saved my progress, but I can't even get through one whole throw without it opening up chrome with a fake survey or whatever. I'm not joking, it's really bad. That's why I can't give this a good rating. I understand the need for ads in a free game, but for whatever reason, mine is nothing but ads.",
        "I did not play this game for a long time. I download it and I only played it for maybe 2 hours. I tried to play, but when I  was in the middle of the game and it froze and sent me back to my home screen. The controls I like. This is not the greatest game I have seen, but It's ok😐😐😞😞"

        "Great game with fun objectives that keep it challenging until level 15.  Only issue with it is that ive recently lost all.my gems due to some sort of bug and now i dont really want to continue playing just to get back to 500 gems to experience something other than sky summit.",
        "I like it and it is a good game, except now I have no sound and the videos do not leave the screen so I can spin the wheel. The sound on the game is on and the last time it worked properly was 3 days ago. I have to shut down the game for me to get the ads gone and still no sound. I have lost many chests and many coins this way. I updated the game and still nothing. Please fix because I have no idea what is going on.",
        "I have enjoyed this game for a couple of years wirh no problems. The only thing I can complain about is earning so many coins and jems and not having anything to buy with them such as new characters and powerups. It's a good hand eye game.",
        "Ok I'm mad I got a new phone. There is no way to save progress. I lost 1,000 gems and 2 million coins. This is BS. They should make it so u can connected thru Facebook like most of the other games. Get it together temple run 2",
        "I abosulutly love this game. It won't get a 5 star though because I have had 4 different coin skins get taken away from me and those were actually my favorites. Idk if it was a glitch or I didn't do something but plz tell me what it is",
        "The blazing sand map is really boring. Only 3 different location there. But looks same all the entire run. Make some free space. It is very boring to run in sand all the time. Make variation like Frozen Shadows atleast. Add some location. Make some variations."

Why cant you put an option to watch 5 ads a day for 10 coins each ad or something? Its annoying being interruoted every ten seconds by something i dont care about. Other than that, the game is pretty good itself and its fun to play.",
        "Cheetah Games, I hope you see this, because I've got a complaint. I've been playing piano tiles 2 for about 2 days and I'm level 11 or 12 I don't remember. However when I was leveling up I noticed that a song I like was missing from Level oh I don't know 5, 6, 7, I don't really know. I was looking for a song called the swan, and I could not find it. Then I went to a different tab in songs and I found it it wasn't in level 5, 6, or 7, but it was in level 65. When I found out about this, my favorite song being in level 65 which I will never get to because I'm not that patient, I nearly broke my phone for I was so enraged because of this change. Please change it back it's my favorite song. I hope you got this  but I know you don't.",
        "Great time killer! On those nights I can't sleep, which is too often, this is the best app to turn my would be long night into an extremely short night. The time literally flies and before I know it morning is here. Couldn't ask for a more fun,challenging and interesting way to pass the time. But be careful, you will become addicted very quickly!",
        "It is amazing no matter what I play this alot and still love it. Has great graphics great gameplay and I will never get bored. If I had to have one game on my phone except YouTube this would be my number one game so keep going but one thing you should make lots of more songs like really new songs",
        "This app is great for passing time, I also love how you can play offline. Its very addicting as well. The only downside is that there are way to many advertisements, I can't even play one song without there being an ad",
        "I mean the game is great! But all of these add-on power up stuff always being added ends up ruining the classic game for me. I love the good original design, no power-ups or anything too extra. I don't use them and find them annoying. It's a great time killer, and a real challenege.  But, as said before, the game is going too extra and I don't really like it.  Playing it is fun, the add-ons are not."

        "One of the best sports games available on the market right now. The graphics are awesome. And the player realism is good. The challenge of acquiring Elite Players keeps you going.    EDIT: This game is a perfect example of how not to screw up a top notch game. Used to love it to death before the update, now every aspect of the game has been worsened; Auctions, Gameplay, Teams. Just name a feature and you can be sure that it's been screwed up. Just hope they resolve this the next year. Will just uninstall till the new yearly reset.",
        "YO IS IT ME OR BEFORE THE UPDATE I HAD CHOICES TO PICK BETWEEN 5 TEAMS I WORK SO HARD TO BUILD? DEFENSIVE LINE UP, SHOOTING LINE UP, AND SO ON. Listen Whoever made the game. I know what type of tricks u tryna do ok. I'm smart enough to know. And I know what y'all doing with that MONEY. So I would appreciate it  if I can use my teams again✌",
        "I can't see myself EVER giving EA mobile games anything but a 1 star rating, the game is geared to cheat unless you're spending actual $ on paccs & players. How many times can an event rob you of stamina to only rob you again by redundantly giving you the same fucc'n collectables over & over & over again!!! By the time you actually complete the set either the seasons over, or there's better players @ the position that you'll probably never end up getting either... Unless you spend some cash. EA succs man, SINCERELY!!!",
        "I think i'm dissatisfied with this game of rule. You should change this rule... when the all people can feel comfortable, and can be feel happy, free and enjoy it. This is so very very bad news with you EA. If you still use this rule, i think... this game can be game over forever. You should back this rule like before. if you can't, everymonts, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, this rating of Nbalivemobile always down, decrease, and fall, hopefully you can understand if you feel this game very important for you! Trust me!. Thank you. Tru",
        "EA, the game is official and is above average as far as graphics, gameplay go etc. etc. but food for thought and I think it'll be a gamechanger really...it'll take the game to new heights on a consumer level. It's the only thing missing aka Commentators/commentary as part of the in-game gameplay and the rest will speak for itself. 🔦"

I also recorded myself playing because I would live to show this game up to the world and give a review. Really enjoy it and think it deserves to be spread out",
        "wow ! why is this game so good!! addicting I got a problem ! to many ads! I under stands u need money but you should put purchases so u get some more money !! and also I want to have new characters and themes that will be cool course I nearly got all but I haven't! also change rating to pegi 3 I know there's the characters can be a vampire but srsly IT'S NOT SCARY what is with wthat!  sorry it's long but thanks for taking time and reading bye!😀😀😀😁😁😁",
        "This adorable & addictive game is very fun to play at any time of the day! It is definitely a close competitor of the infamous\"Candy Crush\" trend. For such a simple concept, it never ceases to amaze me; especially since I can't seem to get a long enough winning streak to increase my stack count. I admit, I suck at this game... Yet I can't stop playing it! 4/5 stars for me. Loses a star for excessive ads and lagging during the game.",
        "I really liked it at first. But now all I get are ads. it's so irritating to be playing and then ad pops up at the bottom. You're clicking on your character to jump & you click on the stupid ad than every time you die you have to watch another ad so annoying. But I could get pass the ad      after you die but not at the bottom of the screen. Makes me not want to play it anymore. And I'm only on day 3. It was a cute to relieve stress and now it just gives me stress.",
        "Very very addictive pass time. Only a lil disappointed with the adds popping out every now and than. I know its a free app and adds are inevitable but try reducing the number of time it should appear not after each and every round.",
        "It's a very good game! I got my boyfriend hooked on it, but my problem with it is, sometimes when I start up the app it sits on the beginning stage of the app?? Like when am I going to be able to play again? Was just updated? So I'm going to have to delete it and start it all over and re gain my high score??"

        "I feel inlove with the game the second I opened it! being a huge naruto fan I had high expectations! and most of them were met.  I have two issues! it's seems the only way to get hero fragments is through the shops which is only 10 at a time. or special attack missions which keep changing! makes it very hard to awaken shinobi.  also why only 8 chapters in story mode! You have a whole two anime to base off and we only get 8 chapters! how disappointing.",
        "I am a little disappointed in the game right now. I saved up for the Jiriya banner which is supposed to have a higher drop rate, got one Jiriya card in a multi 10xs summon. I would like to know why that happened seeing as with every other banner I have ever pulled on had numerous cards for that shinobi, sometimes even the full kit minus an ult. I am not looking for an ultimate every time. But when I pull on a banner I would like the rate to actually be reasonable thank you very much.",
        "Everything was working just fine until not long ago. All of a sudden, everytime I try to play any kind of mission on my android, a message will pop up saying, 'Due to an unknown error the game will return to the title screen'. It's been happening for over a week now, I've tried to reinstall but nothing works. Please fix.",
        "4 days ago i was having a problem of playing missions. I couldnt start it because the screen showed \"due to an unknown error the game is returning to the title screen\". The issue was resolved yesterday and again today the same old stuff. Is this a joke going on with my account?",
        "To BANDAI NAMCO... Just suggesting a few thought about this game. I've taken liken this game more than any other I played so far.  I just thought during the mission about the choosen characters. I think this game will be more stratigical if you can switch characters during the mission. It just doesn't make any sense if the main character you control died right away. Since in a story there's still a chance to turn the table on your side. Just like in Naruto series though their team captain may die the subordinates will carry their will and a chance to win. And in this game,  If the main character died the rest automatically dies though there's still a lot of spare life. Hope you call consider.  Just making suggestion. Your AWESOME making this game BANDAI NAMCO.",
        "I really like this game, the only reason im giving it a 1 star. Is because I've tried to send them a message involving an issue but I cant seem to find the way to do it. In regards to the issue I hope they see this message and fix it, for some reason it wont let me do any missions. I have updated it and deleted the cache but the problem persist."

I can handle the ads and would even pay to remove ads if the game have a point.. a purpose a win/lose sort of deal but it's not I don't think I will be keeping this game .. unless they add a little skill to it",

I buy 3 upgrades and have to watch a full minute ad. It's like an ad simulator.

At least normal clickers have a theme or SOMETHING to pretend you're doing... Anything at all. Here, you don't even have that. No context, no theme, not even a change of shape or whatever  It's sad gaming has gone this low"

        "I was addicted to the game the first time I played it.  Still love it and have put it on every device I've had since I was first introduced to the game.  Pou has been a constant source of entertainment for over three years!  Love love  love it!  Oh and I almost forgot to tell you that I am 56 years old!!  Lol. It is really that fun to play!",
        "I love this game there are so many games to play within.  One thing I would say is that I wanted to buy shoes before I got to the level I had enough coins but when I clicked it it took my money but didn't give me the shoes so now I have to play loads more when I could have got them five minutes ago. Please fix this and I will rate 5 star",
        "After I posted my recent comment, there were some angry comments pointed out at me. I apologise for that. I mean, this game in great! There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars. For someone who says \"too many notifications\", go to the settings and turn off that notifications button. Thank you for those hate critics you guys made. It really teached me a lesson.",
        "Massive Pou fan, but after a short break from playing I find it fails to respond and crashes a lot- anyone any ideas why? I don't want to risk re-installing it in case I lose what I've already got!"

Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I'll be playing this for a long time! I'm working on the living room right now, getting close to level 800! Thank you Playrix!",
        "Its a mind blowing game i cant help but to play this game my day seems not complete if i cant play the game specially when i cant pass the next level and the hardest part is the hard level the time are very fast when i am playing.i really love it and the freebies i can get everyday to boost my game.thank you creators and the makers the graphics and the animation is very realistic.",
        "This is really exciting BUT the levels get way too hard!!! I want a game that you don't have to replay a level more than a couple times! That's when I stop playing. It's a game...it's supposed to be fun not rocket science!! It should relax you but when you're played a level 6 or 7 times and you get down to needing1move to win... yet again... you get stressed!! And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun! I like a challenge but this is ridiculous!!!",
        "Just gave it 2 stars from 3 stars, everytime i use the kite booster it doesn't work and wastes it by flying away. Continued is my previous feedback. Love the game but it is ridiculous how we need stars to start a new day etc. It is difficult to get stars anyway. The lives go out fast because levels are hard. It take 900 coins just for 5 extra turns to finish the level but you get 45 or 50 coins only per level. You need to change this. Make it on the same level, give us atleast 1000 coins per level and let the level have enough stars per task rather than 1 star per level and requirement is 2 stars per task. Something to look into.",
        "Getting green pieces gets extremely redundant. After 30 levels it's still the goal. Levels are near impossible unless you get lucky and things line up perfectly.",
        "I enjoy this game more and more each day.  Is there a possibility to reduce the memory mb? It really takes a lot of storage and slow down my tablet. Thanks"

        "Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don't decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don't mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don't actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.",
        "Great 8 ball pool game. Plays great and looks great. 1 slight issue tho. Im from Ireland but i seem to be playing people from India and surrounding countries.   The Irish and Indian flag are kind of similar so im guessing thats where the issue is coming from.  I cant seem to edit my location either.  Would be great if someone could help but if not, ill be happy to continue playing against random beautiful Indian women 😁",

        "Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "The game is very good. But that spin wheel is not fair at all. I've been playing this game for 6 years now (I know there used to be 1 coin reward there) and I've never got anything more than 2500 coin reward. My point is if you are keeping other rewards on that wheel atleast give equal probabilities for each reward. If not, just remove those big rewards and replace them with small ones but atleast with same probability for each of them. Hope you will do something. (P.S. i know it's a lucrative strategy developers play so that players will stick to the game. But you know just trying.✌️)",
        "First of all It's joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱"

        "I've love playing this game since I began. The main issue I have is that when you buy a new device to play on, none of your progress is saved and you have to starts back at the very beginning. I had more than 80% of the venues open, over 1.2M coins,  and nearly 100 gems. I bought a new phone and nothing was saved. That sucks! Can someone respond, find a way to save your progress so if you switch devices to play on,  you won't lose what you've gained and maybe return my earnings!",
        "The game is awesome, as for the loyal players like myself your game isn't fair with the diamonds on the casino spin 😢 I play everyday at least 8hr or more and only receive 15 gems every two days or so. Please try to rectify the situation I have never received double or triple diamonds on a spin and I've been playing for a year or so. Why?????",
        "UPDATE 4 the NEW BUILDINGS PLSSSsss? TY... Cant Wait. Hope its coming real real soon and REALLY hope theres MORE to come after. U HAVE A WINNER GAME HERE. i bought ALOT of games, & this one is on the top 5 list. Keep up the great work guys/gals. Awaiting the new buildings. lol.    :-)   TY",
        "This game is good and addicting it just sucks with the fact you need to use gems from everything. I wish it was more things to use just money for. I have all this money and run through gems quick and it takes too long to obtain so I end up not playing for a while. A good way of doing this is through earnings that you collect from your restaurant. You can receive 1 gem",
        "Game is very fun and addictive. But you shouldn't have to spend few hundred dollars to play through the game and play all of the restaurants. Yes you can earn gems for free but would take an insane amount of time with each restaurant requiring more and more for each upgrade as you go on.",
        "There's no way to contact customer service for this game. I just bought the new restaurant with the noodles and duck and my sauce cooker doesn't work. I swipe it and swipe it and nothing. I'm doing it the way the tutorial showed but mine doesn't work. I might get lucky and it will come on but I'm losing all of my customers. I think they need to change it so we just have to tap it. I hoping they'll see this so they can work out the glitches for this new restaurant."

Why is that? Now the only way for me to earn more gems os through the free gems  (by watching adds), getting a high enough ranking in battlez, or buying them.",
        "I think the new update is nice battlez is awesome and the good news is that my phone doesnt crashes anymore and when I played Inzanity it did'nt lag great rework but 1 question, WHY DID YOU REMOVE ULTIMATE BATTLE AND DEMONSTRATION MINI GAME THEMES TO EVERY WORLD?? Im sick of every level with just only themes",
        "I think the new update is very cool. It adds some multiplayer into the game. When I heard of this new update I rushed to my phone and started playing. It turned out to be good I was happy and thought it would turn out well. Then after that I remembered pvz one. It's multiplayer mode was much better. One player would be plants and the other zombies. Why could they not have made that. It was such a good idea. I would personally play that mode more than this. But it's just my opinion. Thanks for reading.",
        "Since last update it is very unstable and keeps crashing. Also every time i finish the last inzanity it crashes then once reloaded says expired so ive lost out. In fact im not that interested anymore. Im not a fan of battlez and it all seems geared to that now so had fun while it lasted.",
        "I HATE YOUR UPDATE. Battlez mixed battle between players who bought plants with money with the players who don't is totally unfair. There are many players out there like me who play everyday collecting coins by coins and gems by gems patiently waiting for a good plant offer that we can buy with gems. Buying plants with money is not on the budget. I'm not angry. I'm sad. Because PVZ is always one of my top listed games. Now it's pathetic. Crashed. Unfair. Expensive.",
        "Just like.But EA just want money right? You just wasting money.Money cause something bad.This wirld need to follow the truth path.Not money path.I dont like those plant,pinatas and more that need to buy with money.Useless."

        "So, what makes this one of the best games made?  Let me start by saying the game play is fun.  Try to get the top medal each round. The game on its own is smooth and simple.  Graphic and physics are decent as well. But what makes this the best game?  Ads are not intrusive. You can simply back out of them without the \"wait 30 seconds to continue.\"  I've actually watched ads in this game since they aren't forced. I keep them up because I wanted to.  This does not mean they aren't there or have little countdown timers, but you can simply hit the back button to close it. Next, you don't deal with \"you didn't get a perfect score, want to try again? Buy more lives.\"  Exactly. NO IN APP PURCHASES. None!  Thank you!  Keep playing until your heart is content.

Every developer can learn from them!",
        "Actually it is much easy and had very less features. It is not like a competitive game. In 2hours I have nearly unlocked 31 levels.  Make it a tough one....graphics is good but lots & lots of ads, very annoying ! And add scores there rather than medals",
        "This is a very fun game, even though the screen freezes almost every time I go directly to the next level. I have to close it completely and then reopen it - Please fix this then I will rate it 5 stars.",
        "Fun playing. Passes some idle time. Habit forming. How much more do I need to say before get something free? Lol...",
        "Meh!!! It not what i expected I'd like to do the training but also the 1 on 1 competition. If any1 know of a pool app. Hit me up.",
        "Great game....way too many ads. I would pay for an ad free version since the ads annoy me so much that I'm going to wind up uninstalling it."

        "Overall this game is really fun.. just that I'm from SG and my friend from TH we were planning to play together but we realise it's both different server we can't play together.. Is there anyway for you AOV team to make a server for all SouthEastAsia so many will all be happy... sorry for any inconvenience caused.. appreciate for you team to try your best. Without you guys we work get to experience such good gameplay. Thank you 🤗😘",
        "This game is awesome! And more importantly, it's waaaay better than the cancer graphics of Mobile Legends: Bang Bang. This game needs strategy and teamwork, unlike MLBB, it's a very easy game that doesn't require brains. MLBB has a lot of cancer players, trashtalkers, and stupid players. Although, you can never remove those kind of players but at least they stay in MLBB, and smarter people plays this. This is the best MOBA on smartphones! Kudos!",
        "I seriously love this game and got me hooked to MOBA games. One quirk though, I got the skin for Astrid which looks like Arthuria from Fate Stay Night. One suggestion is to make her sword glow gold instead of red to make it match more to Arthuria (Saber). Thanks! Keep up the good work!",
        "I'm done. At least balance the matchmaking system and determine a players skill level. I was on Gold 3 then back to Silver 1 again? Wow Tencent. Good job making an enjoyable game, but this won't make me say that this MOBA is fine for me. Fix the issues first.",
        "update I wonder why game app like R.O.S and this moba AOV need a huge update. Please make this game using abit amount of size from before & please make game more balance. Player with low connection please dont make them didn't join any rank match or what.. they always make our game really bad",
        "Better than ML. Honestly, I play all sorts of Moba (or any video game), but this one really is different.  This game has issues, no argument with that. But when you compare it to \"Mobile Legends: Bang Bang\", you really see the difference. This one has top-notch graphics that I can probably compare to VG or PC Mobas. This game has awesome gameplay as well. There are almost overpowered heroes, but there are always heroes that counter them. ML looks like sht compared to this game.  The only downside that I can see is that, the controls are kinda off. Probably with an update, they can fix that. Will give five stars once that happens."

This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can't without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.",
        "First up the images used as what the game looks like are fakes. I saw too many polygons.... (Shudder) Secondly there is no start menu. NOPE! Just some fancy loading screen and boom you're in the game without a chance to look at the controls. Plus your first mission is ruined by the tutorial at the worst places on the track.   Bad game knockoff. If you download this just delete it. This game is [EXPLICATIVE]",
        "Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?",
        "The controls is very floaty like your car is late responding when tilted and i really like that this game is very fun and time wasting but it lacks car selection very small but i know it will add soon. And i thought the pic is real but it is not even the same on the game for its originality that all thanks",
        "People have low requirements nowadays. This game doesn't deserve a 4.4 rating. It feels good as long as I stay in the menu (even with the weird japanese mascot) but once the game loads it gets horrible. The camera angles are terrible, the cars feel like toys in the overscaled world, the car's softshadow is terribly aligned and the physics simulation is just mediocre. The whole game is just a mediocre clone of Asphalt 8, I don't understand why people choose an inferior copy instead of the original one...",
        "So many ad's, there back to back ad's. When I am finally able to select a race, guess what...another ad pops up and takes me to the play store to download it. I go back to the game and I gotta start all over again from the first screen. Ad's ad's ad's I was only able to play on the first day I downloaded it, after that..... Ad's ad's ad's                    \"AD'S!!!\".... But i did like the game when I played it"

        "Hasn't even been 10 seconds into the game before it shut down 🤣 - I thought it would be different for me as I have the S8+. Obviously NOT. The game started off very well and easy to navigate. Ease of controls. I will uninstall as there isn't much point keeping this game when it has already failed itself.",
        "Let's be honest here. The concept was very creative and unique, but the game was very poorly designed. The slide is not smooth and   feels very unstable, I wasn't able to enjoy playing the game. The graphics are very low and the game itself is slow. Apart from that the idea was very well thought of but I feel you should have added more time and professionalism into the whole design, the game has potential.",
        "One thing I find annoying is the adds! The game itself is addicting, but every time you die you have to sit through these long adds. I guess you could pay for the game without adds, but if your like me and you don't really like spending money at the app store, patience my friend... the game is worth it...",
        "I really like this app but the the amount of ads are crazy! Wayyy too many. On a good note, the personalisation. I really like the different range of balls and the night time vortex, where everything stands out, and is all black. The trails are really neat too! Although the ball is quite sensitive when dodging around the obstacles. It is still great! I got a score of 104 on my second go! I'd definitely recommend this app! Also i have the samsung galaxy s4 so you can definitely 8nstall this if you have the same phone as me!😊",
        "It is shuting down again and again, in starting that  heppen after 2-3 min then under 1 min and now I open and it shut down in few seconds. For my Moto x play runing 7.1.1  Love concept and game environment.  Control is fine.  Graphic are good.",
        "It's hard to control and there are WAY too many ads. It lags so I'll be doing fine but it'll make me crash because it paused for a brief moment. If all this was improved, I'd love it. I love the concept of the game but everything else sucks."

        "I liked the game so much. No! I love it, but it's just that I'm now on level 65 but I'm stucked since I only have few gems left and I needed to extend the time, and buy some customers which I find amazing just to save your energy and the stage but I also find it hard since I have already completed 3 stars from lower levels and why is it that I can't play the levels I have already completed? I would really suggest that lower levels would still be played just to be able to collect gems. I hope you can fix this issue though. I'm so loving this game and I'm getting addicted to it. I got stucked on level 65 on my two days of playing. Thank you",
        "I love this game! So few games actually suck me in, but this game had me addicted right away. I play on my phone and laptop. Yes I have two different games at different levels lol. I love how upgrades are so easy and it isn't impossible to upgrade or move on. It gets challenging as you go up levels but it's so fun.",
        "Moving on is hard on some levels because they are specifically designed for you to use gems and they are hard to come by. However, If you are patient enough you can eventually earn them. I enjoy that you don't have to drag the items to the customers. It's definitely an enjoyable and challenging game. I'm currently at a \"coming soon\" stage where I can no longer move ahead. I've been waiting a long time and do not want to wait forever. Please do an update soon!!!",
        "Great game but some levels really hard I cant pasd this one level im on for days maybe update make it easier pass level I'm on I just did update...I hope so... love game anyways great game to.. identical cooking joy to map was a great game to but also hard get passed certain levels that game to n I can try play fast with my hands to still cant pass to not playing  cooking joy anymore going stick with this one see if game gets easier to",
        "It's fun till you run out of energy. They get you too rate the game right away while you are having fun with free lives. Give you enough lives to rate it good then the lives end and you have to watch a min advert or 30 mins for one life Regen. OR PAY. They just want your money at that point. So sad.",
        "Brilliant little time waster of a game.. yet.. once you start getting to the higher levels.. the less chance of earning gems and i aint noway paying for them.. last time I stupidly paid for gems on cooking fever..and got my account hacked into! Big lesson learnt! I do still play this alot tho so overall, definitely a good game. 👍"

Not sure why that happen. Also don't like how you have a truck and the grass and or sand will slow you down. Also wish there were more color options for your vehicles. Other than that its a fun and addicting game.",
        "Love the game but cmon guys, how many times are the race ranking going to get messed up. Finish first... But says you were second, second but now I finish third, third but wait... Fourth. Not cool at all. Once or twice is whatever, but its happened at least a dozen times. Please fix this!!  Just dropped my rating again because its getting worse! Idk if its people cheating or what but this is ruining the game! The race rankings are a complete lottery, doesn't matter what place you come in because its gonna change... For the worse. Had it with this.",
        "Well it's ok but you are always underpowered I literally but the next 2!! Cars and I couldn't even get in 2nd place it's ridiculous I mean come on and I wasn't even up against real people it was bots. And the ramps using nitro on them is a deathtrap and the driving is Soo weird.",

        "This is by far the best chess \"trainer\" for me.  It's got a nice flow and the game isn't \"stupid\" like most other chess apps/games I've played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I'm making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.",
        "I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!",
        "I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn't show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.",
        "For the non experts, let me tell you that 5his game cheats. I sat with a real chessboard to analyse why wasn't I  able to crack master level.   And what i observed was it didn't allow you to make actual moves when you show high levels of intell8gence. Sometimes it makes moves which are faulty. I think there is some mistakes in coding, perhaps deliberately made.  So not a fair play but a foul play.",
        "So far it's o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It's not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game",
        "The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw."

        "This game is sufficient. It's just a generic tower defense game. Honestly, it's too easy so couple that without much innovation and yeah, it's okay, but nothing to write home about. I already uninstalled this game because it doesn't stand out from any other tower defense game that I have ever played. Again, it's not a bad game, but it's not great either. Also, with a name like \"game of warriors\" how could this game not be just a bland clone?",
        "Fun, entertaining defense RPG kind of game, with simple mechanics, but loads of fun nonetheless. Easy to play, progress and have fun without having to spend real cash too. That's always a giant plus for me, as many developers these days make their games either pay to win, or pay to progress ie, pay to have or get any sort of fun out of the game. A big thank you to the developers for not doing that with this game!  10/10 -Lots of fun, not pay for fun, lots and lots of hours of enjoyment, and nice graphics and sound design.",
        "My account disappeared after I uninstalled the game because it wasnt letting me in and i now have to start from the beginning... Ive tried loading from the cloud but I receiving a message saying there is no previous save data... Is there a way to get my account back as I spent money on there?",
        "Have just played for a short time and I find this game quite challenging & addictive. Very good gameplay and not $$ greedy. If you dont have $ you're still given the chance to raise coins to upgrade your troop. However, you need to have a lot of patience",
        "The game is fun however the ads are a little too frequent. If the ads were cut back on some I would happily increase my review rating as other than that I'm really enjoying the game. Just keep in mind you will be watching or closing an ad after every wave to every other wave.",
        "Pretty fun game. Good time killer. Not much of a challenge. The only downfall is an ad after almost every wave which can be very annoying. Most of the time you get a reward from watching. Loads of upgrades to choose from also. 4/5 for me 👌"

        "this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It's a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that's it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame",
        "Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn't came in two years it probably isn't. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don't pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges.",
        "Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.",
        "This game is very nicely done. Its a genius concept except the fact that u catch zombies to make it into something is really gross. I would preffer if you could lower the pri e of the drone a bit so that there would be more play time rather than waiting play. Overall this game is superb",
        "I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.",
        "Great game, addictive, in a good way. This is one of the few games that is addictive, but does not take up a large amount of your day, unlike some game (Clash Royale), I feel it's not Pay to Win. Great job guys, thanks for making an entertaining, relaxing, non time consuming, free to play and win game. Graphics can be bested."

Secondly, new maps and modes once in a while would make it perfect and something to look forward to. All other things are great though. Hope you keep these things in mind and improve the game to be perfect.  Player: God Country:Nepal",
        "Worst game. I had log in to this game and my rank was 29 but now 22 I am having players with high ranks and they killed me again and again. You have to fix that problem that a low ranker play with the same rank player otherwise you will loose everything like me. In the beginning it was good game but now it becomes more hard to play with high rankers. Plzz do something otherwise nobody will like it.",

Tip: just remove gas and mine in CTF because many player put this two things on the flag and it become hard to capture the flag. Hope you find my suggestions worth it.",

Please make it easier to rank like give us more exp.  Thanks",

Letting hackers in the game shows that ur security is too weak, u can't stop them. Atleast learn from others games like coc whose security doesn't allow any hackers and if found they r banned asap. And the most important thing hackers r not profiting u. Its stopping the gamers to buy pro pack, coz its better to hack then use pro.",

The ONLY hold backs is the controls, but u really can't do much about that problem unless u actually had physical/analog joysticks built n2 ur phone.?. The basic control problems u have w/ ne downloadable games.",
        "Addictive, played for hours at a friends house until 3 in the morning. Got it for myself. Gems are costly, but save up and you can get the baby on the last shark. Then get hungry shark world.",
        "This game was awesome but sometimes I don't like it when my Shark freezes up and who came up with all these sharks? It is a fun game but why are there pressure limits sometimes I don't like it but this game is it for teens it's for everyone it's really fun and well sometimes I don't like it when it takes me a long time to get money for a shark",
        "It's mindless fun and the soft gore while eating a human is fun. The underwater scenes are visually pleasant. I also like the feature that warps you to the North Pole once a day. The random vortexs that throw you into space are also a really fun feature."

        "Amazing game!! I have purchased 1 or 2 bikes already, I would even pay to get new bikes, but it is very expensive. Please consider lowering to prices or making better bikes more accessible. Ive been stuck on the same level for 5 weeks. I want to continue playing but im loosing intrest not being able to advance. Maybe you could trade your old bikes in to get something in return for a newer bike. Im sure you will never read this, but you do have something special here! Thanks",
        "Very fun BMX pump game. Seen a few reviews say it's gets impossible after level 3 when it becomes pay to win. I don't agree I've just reached level 8 in a few hours. If you ride bikes off road and understand how to pump you'll love it",
        "Its way to hard to win and and the stats do nothing.  You have to be perfect and even then they fly by.  Still LOVE this game.  Just takes away the fun when you get left in the dust and you play the same lvl a million times hoping maybe one time you will be perfect.",
        "I loved this game for 3 days. Then it got to the point where I couldn't beat a level without upgrading my bike, but I couldn't upgrade my bike without spending real money. So disappointing. Don't waste your time if you don't want to spend real money!",
        "The game is fun up until around the third level. After that it becomes near impossible to win any races without spending actual money to upgrade your bike. Had a lot of fun with it up until that point, but it's definitely not worth spending actual money on. Deleted the game after pay to win clearly became a necessity.",
        "It was fun for a while - until it becomes impossible to beat any opponents with your current bike. The difficulty spikes around level 7 and the process of buying a new bike or upgrading your existing one becomes very frustrating, as you can't win any races to earn any money."

        "Easily my favourite android game. Hits all the right spots. While Blitz followed the runner style coins model and see how much you can travel, I am glad that in this game they ditched that over-used android model. I appreciate there vision, it's a complete different game from Blitz. Various fictional cars and characters that seem original inspirations and charming in their own way. The tracks have a theme. Boss races under every championship. There is so much of soul in the game. And you can adjust resolution, add colour correction, adjust many other effects. Words don't do justice here nor does 5/5.",
        "Amazing! I play this game daily and I never got bored. Just one thing: other drivers don't use special abilities which does not makes it challenging. Now since I have completed this game once, I would expect devs to add new levels and characters. I have an idea for a new character. Please contact me if I can help you",
        "The controls take some getting used to. But for a Mario-Kart-like experience for mobile, this game gets my #1 rating. Feels more like Diddy Kong racing to be honest though. Can be played when you only have enough a few minutes, or grinded for awhile until you run out of tickets.",
        "Imagine Mario Kart but on mobile with a few tweaks. That's what this game is and what a great game it is. So much variety and features that makes this game unique. Vector Unit  did an excellent job and this game deserves some credit for how great it is. I'm telling you, if you like Mario Kart, Crash Racing, Sonic All Stars or even Angry Birds Go, you're gonna love this game.",
        "The game just restarted as if I never played it. Just went through the tutorial as a new player. I have been playing for months. Not sure what happened! Can't sync it with google games. I do know I was playing and mid game my phone battery died. I recharged it and went to the game and went default on me.",
        "Second Beach Buggy game, this one you race opponents with some fun, but dirty tricks. A lot of reviews are unfair, just need to figure out strategies. Needs a few new tracks to update it a bit! I cleared it out 4 times & started over, love it! Played everyday for over a year, great fun. Needs a sequel, hope they didn't give up, there is no updates on their site. BBR-2, yea baby!"

FreeFire Battlegrounds is x50 times better and more simply. Go and die in a hole developers.",

For instance i saw a Scar laying down on the gorund in Military base and when i tried to pick it up it said \"item doesn't exist\". Fix this please, otherwise, a decent game.",
        "Everything is well put together tmain thing I love is that each area is different from on another like at the school ive had alot of vertical fire fights or power plant or the supermarket. But one thing I think u guys forgot is that the ump 45 takes .45 acp rounds",
        "Controls are terrible. When aiming directly at a player between the crosshairs. Bullets still miss. Terrible game if you're reading this go download rules of survival. That's  what I did. Also sometimes during the middle of a game a loading icon will appear. You won't be able to move or shoot your weapon. You'll pretty much die. When in the safe zone you will still take damage even tho you are in the white circle. To many hackers.",
        "I love this game free fire and this game are my favorite mobile games so far but there should be some changes like you should be able to aim with an iron sight. And the aiming could be better and what I mean by that is aiming is already hard on mobile so I just think stability should be really good without any attachments or like the aiming system on free fire battleground. The graphics are not the best I've seen really just up the graphics a bit and add the ability to aim with a iron sight. Other than those things I love how exciting the game is as well as how close it is to pubg.",

I understand it will be discontinued in June and I wish it wasn't so.    ...Hey Uno & Friends, could you please not ask me to rate an app I've already rated??? I was asked to read it again and then I came back to find I had made that specific request not to ask me to re-rate something. Your app needs to be reprogrammed so it knows if someone has rated it or not. (sigh)",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",

Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",

These uno players are ready to rock this app! You will never not have people playing. It would be kind of cool if you could create your own avatar though.. & pick outfits and such. Not necessary, but a fun little quirk (:",
        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it."

        "I absolutely love this game. The music is good, the challenges are really fun and... well, challenging. It has taken me several days of being asked by the game if I would like to review it because I was having so much fun and didn't want to stop playing long enough to review. But here you have it. This game is well deserving of a great review. I'm going to go back to the game now so I can keep on rushing.",
        "Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I'm 20 just..😉😉 I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I'm in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️",
        "A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!",
        "Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there's nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.",
        "Minus another star because it's now glitchy and no longer gives daily bonus. I'm on challenge 89 and the point accumulation is taking forever. Minus one star because the ad at the bottom gets in the way while playing. I'll be on a good run and barely graze the ad space and it stops the game and ends the run. Very frustrating.",
        "I'm obsessed with this game. It's not just playing to beat your best score. There are challenges that you can beat as you play and it makes it okay to have a bad run sometimes because you can still beat the challenge lol. Not frustrating, just so much fun. Not sure if my review makes sense, just play this game ok."

        "So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn't find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren't extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don't know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I'm not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.",
        "I loved the original. I've gotta say though, the part with the wizard dying and the endless mode game over scene is kinda sad. Also i found a glitch, if you go to tournament mode and select an icon you haven't unlocked yet and then go to the main menu. You can go back into tournament mode and you'll have the icon even though you didn't unlock it.",
        "Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it's not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I've survived 24 nights but I don't even have the achievements for\"survive 5 nights\". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don't because some of the zombie achievements I'm not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I'm currently at 59. GG!",
        "Addicting game. At start It's easy but It becomes Quick impossible, unless indeed you buy some gems. So It gave me some frustrations but too quickly. Sorry for my notation, Because really It's good work dudes!",
        "Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh",
        "Brilliant game kept me occupied for hours I loved it! I think what seperates this from the test of the stick man games is that you are able to control one of the warriors or miners and you can move them around or fight when them. Absolutely love it! Wish it was longer as I completed canoeing on hard in 67 minutes, please make more and more upgrades and skill points!! Fantastic game!"

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pokémon and I intend to play Pokémon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "Pokemon Go is a pioneer into the world of AR. This game was a hit despite its incomplete composition, and this is why many people left. However, the game now is more complete with features such as raiding with others and dynamic weather. If you are looking for something new on the move, give it a try! Or if you left after launch, give the game another try and see how the game has updated over time. This game is recommended for suburban/urban players, as in-game features such as pokestops are not abundant. This game is still very buggy so patience is required. Thanks for reading!",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "It runs quite smooth and gives me an extra reason to get out and exercise. My only beaf now is that it is impossible to acquire any of the legendaries. If you live in a small rural town you will never have the numbers to take on anything beyond 3 star in raids. Everything else is awesome though."

I decided to purchase the game and get rid of the Ads. Well worth it!! This is the best word game out there!! I love watching the characters go into the store to shop and when they come out they have on different costumes. Some are so funny. I just sit watch them come out sometimes. One about every 15 seconds or so. I crack up, HILARIOUS! Better than plain Scrabble. Love, love, love IT! Please, don't change anything and mess it up.",
        "Great fun, very challenging & a sleek new design.  It's different to Scrabble or WWF in a good way. You can quickly see if you've made a word, plus you get extra points for long words. Lots of players, so you never go short of a game, & now there's a quick play mode too.",
        "I am giving one star because I thought this was a game that went at my own pace. I have a busy life so I thought that was perfect. But today I opened the app and 3 of the current games I was playing and in the lead I might add said I lost and the game just ended for no reason🤷\u200d♀️😠😩 I don't understand why. I am so upset about this I dont even want to play anymore😡 It's going to go on my game record and it isn't fair😒😒",
        "The new update, where you get ads that blare at you for 5 sec before you can close them? Not cool.  Update... they are gone!! Thx!!  I have another request - is it possible to keep track of the number of times someone scores a 7 letter bingo, or a best word?  I would love to see those numbers in my dashboard too! Thx.",
        "The items to accessorize seriously needs to be updated, which would only make me spend more. All of the knightly garb is not that interesting for everyone. The hair choices are clearly geared for white people, and more food  needs to be offered (mexican, asian, african, etc) because  I love to change all of the time. Lastly, we should be able to sort and organize our accessories so they are easier to see and select - like a real closet!",
        "This game is great,  especially if you aren't so good at making words because it helps by highlighting and using the stars. The only thing I would change is to make a version where the boards are random. Scatter the bonus tiles around to make it a little more interesting."

        "I really love this game, i've been playing it for nerely 5 years now and although it can be hard to progress without paying money it is possible. I am free to play which can make it hard but for the people that are not willing to pay money igg is there for you, every week i can earn up to 1500 gems which is probably the reason i have yet to quit. Other than that the leveling and many heros makea the game that much better.",
        "I up my rating to 4. After playing 5 years, this game is really fun to play. I cannot give 5 star as i still having issues with the gem price too crazy expensive. Hope igg can revise gem price back, so many player can support this game, not the rich guy only. I believe you guys has realise many p2p player already quit, so better to revise the germ price again. Overall, i love this game^^",
        "Decided to edit my review to clear things up for people that says this is a money making scheme etc. To the people that say that, do u understand that this game is Free? The devs spend a ton of money making a game enjoyable for people, adding new content such as, new heroes, new events, new upgrading features etc. It's only normal to lock some heroes behind a paid service, and the heroes behind the pay wall isn't even game changing or op. U don't have to spend a cent on this game to make progress. Rolling heroes takes time but it's so rewarding when u get that one hero u were looking for. This is a great game and if u complain about ingame purchases for a game so well maintained then rather go play another free game full of bugs and zero updates.",
        "Holy cow, sitting at 100k might but leveling goes so slow now. Please do something, and new quary is really annoying and sitting in the way.  Edit: everytime I open the game through notification is doesn't load the game.",
        "I hate it. It's always connected to those fake link downloads ugh and if i donwload this game and run it for 30 seconds, the link will open BUT NO it's a lie. This game just wants to be seen as a game with millions of downloads and I HATE IT."

        "Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!",
        "Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm's Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!",
        "Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I'm just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it's going to be good.  We'll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!",
        "This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10",
        "I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.",
        "I've been playing this game since the last lvl was ToE. First time when i was surprised was an update with three or four new maps, also demon levels, but that was actually nothing, i felt at this moment ''Wow, update, ok''. I got more admired by new update with this walking thing, still dunno the name, but things they have added, i still love it. Animated trails, new wallpapers that was awesome. New updates have arrived in mini-games for free, also awesome, but now i guess they have no idea what to add, because what they've done this is the biggest and greatest update. I love this game so much, so i can't just put 4 or less. Gg RobTop, Gg."

        "I've liked this game for years. Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you're still coasting or you're in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You've had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven't fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!",

I hope my tears will help u guys. :)",
        "Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it's just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............",

Not to mention they keep upgrading and making it beter and better, keep it up fellas....i havent experienced any of the problems mentioned withthe updates others have but until then great game",
        "Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!",
        "Its a very good game without any tension of wining any difficult task...I like it very much and its not much addicting I have played many games but its very different. controls are also good but this game needs some practice . I am enjoying this game because the tasks are not very difficult but at the same time not very easy its a perfect game and the main character of the game is very funny he always sleeps in the vehicle.....so finally.... I like this game very much"

Why is it i had completed some of the achievements but it still shows zero progress??i don't know if it is just only me but i really want this to be fix or any solution can the developer suggests. It is a big deal to me since I enjoy playing games with a purpose to achieve something haha btw GREAT GAME!",

        "Great game of my childhood. Unfortunately, had problems with award when you connected Google. It's okay that game didn't count some levels, but I replay all suburbs and didn't receive any medals and there is no progress. It's really sad :(",

        "Nice  game.....too good 👌. ..but only one problem I have noticed is that when you are caught and replay the  game from the checkpoint there's still a penalty  that you are caught. ..really doesn't makes sense....but the rest of the whole game is Awesome 😍. ..i recommed to also play Robbery bob 2"

Is there any way to fix it or to make it work? PS: Its a realy good game, its my style. In MY OPINNION its batter than Shadow fight 3.",

Such a wonderful game it is. Even if the meter hangs to impossible I can beat the competitors. Very nice game used to play it often. At lesiure time I think spending\u200b in it is the best. As you can earn  daimonds  by just watching the ads.",
        "I love this game. I've never been good at fighting games like Tekken or soul Calibur but this game is a very simple take on the genre. I love how very martial arts based this game is and the hit boxes on the characters are quite accurate and simple to understand as well as the moves. Being a martial artsist my self this game has given me an outlet to mentally practice distance management, fake outs and strategy as well as practicing to be like water. The famous Bruce Lee saying. Love this game. Also the rank up system and the grinding isn't too over bearing or tedious and makes it fun through and through.",
        "Great game, my only problem is that it took a long time grinding for the money you need to buy items. It took me about 5 hours of grinding just to upgrade each weapon/armor, 6 hours to buy new ones. Still a great game, loved the way it's in shadows, making it harder to tell who you are.",
        "Game is awesome. But for past 2 days whenever i open the game, it closes after intro showing that unfortunately SF 2 has stopped. Pls do something as i dont want to uninstall it. Also I hv sent feedbacks 2 to 3 times but no reply or fixation. Do something about it.",
        "I have been playing this game for over 3years now and I know how far I have gone with the game... Just lost my phone and I got a new one and... Google Play can't restore Me to my previous level.. Please fix because I can't just start playing the game over from the beginning.. Thanks"

        "Its a really good game but they should make it a bit easier. They should have a thing where they ask your age so that they can determine the hardness of the level. But good game I would try it. One question for RobTop games, though, what is with the \"buy full version\" how is there a full version. Reply to me robtop. I need to know. Not sure about it but worth a try and see if you like it. # Amsam production review.",
        "This game is fun and great but there are too many advertisements and always make me feel annoyed by that. Please fix this and I will rate 4 or if it is better,5.  it was 2015 when i said this. now it is 2018. NO CHANGE. all the ads were still there!!!!! so everytime i want to try again, AN AD WILL POP UP AND BRING ME TO THE PLAY STORE AGAIN.",
        "Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it's fun because it's challenging and there's super fun things in GD except hacking because that's no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I'm super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂",
        "Well, I admit, I'm addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn't be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can't Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍",
        "The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won't annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie",
        "It's a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it's super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star."

        "Great game. Just can't seem to get enough gold and there's too much stuff that has to be paid for and the things that need to be paid for are a little pricey.",
        "It would be better if the the chance to get relic items is higher. I opened 100 legendary keys and not a single relic item. Couldn't even get it on the stage it said it has a chance to drop."

I've reinstalled twice already and I can no longer use the names I wanted. Even if I force close it when it gets stuck. The cam just freezes on black screen when i open it again.",
        "Well this game is good. But it can get pretty old, its still fun to play tho. However its very laggy when there is to many players, and I think it would be cool that the players could be able to chat with each other.",
        "The game is somewhat enjoyable, but it gets a bit repetitive since that death match is the only playable game mode in quick play. It would be nice to add CTF in it or create new ideas for game modes.",
        "Please fix this whenever I go on quick play my phone restarts, it doesn't work on other apps only on this one, I'm really irritated on how this is always disturbing game play",
        "My suggestion is that you add a First person view especially When building, cause it's really hard. 10/10 ❤️",
        "Can u add first person on the build mode cause its  hard to face the thing that you're building for example up to down its really hard pls add and keep the game great!"

Often going back to previous levels needing three stars for best advantage. Only problem I have is with cloud save I can't log in successfully and you must exit game to save data to your phone leave any other way all current data is gone. lOVE the game Good job.",
        "Well executed game.  Items are there only for quick power freaks.  Looking forward to seeing the add one for the game.   PS- The English in the game isn't great and could use improvement.  It doesn't affect gameplay,  just a bit nerve wracking,  😉",
        "Way better than most running shooters I've played but I could do without the 55 action point limit. I just want unlimited play. The action points only allow you about 30 minutes of gaming then you have to wait for it to build up of lengthy amounts of time. Otherwise really fun.",
        "The only way i would give this game 5 stars if there was an option to walk around instead of pressing an arrow to jump from cover to cover that ends up breaking cause your enemy's keep shooting at it. You bring all these amazing features but you take away the most important feature in any shooting game: walking around and taking cover where you like.",
        "You'll know right away if the game is bad just by reading the dialogues. If the English is bad, chances are the game is bad too. I have proven this many times already, and I know many other players have too.",
        "Its not a bad game, its actually just like the rest of the shooters on google play, which is point and shoot type of games like Zombie Frontier. I bet this game would be a lot more fun if you could walk around instead of just sitting In one place which is my only complaint. But otherwise overall this game is rather a bit fun if you are looking for a time killer."

Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.",
        "Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)",
        "I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn't have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it's Definitely Not a game you'd wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!",

        "Time to Uninstall, new server open every week and nothing new about the game. Lag and disconnect every 3-5 min. It's got worst after S17 open.. this game is the same as Loong Craft just different skin. But at least loong craft server is much more sturdy. Please DON'T tell me to check connection or reinstall the game, because I already did it 3 times, connection it's perfectly fine, cuz all my other game I play run just fine.",
        "The game was amazing. Have a good quality in terms of graphics and smooth controls. However, I encountered problem in my account. After I reach LEVEL 35 my character was totally gone and advices me to create a new one. Please help me regarding with my problem. Any reply are very much appreciated. I will change my ratings after I recovered my character. Thank you.",
        "I really love this game. But my only problem here is the  issues of so many servers thats why other players wants to go to other servers to start playing again. Instead of focusing to the last server they had. When saying that the server is FULL it doesnt mean that all character here is active, when the new server is open everyone choose to  go there. What will happen to the other nation on the old server??? Some are ghost nation, coz everybody quits becoz of new server. Please fix this issues. Thank you.  Please bring back my 6000 power loss on my character on s25"

        "I'm not a downloading games on my phone or tablet kind of person but I saw this game and decided to try it out. I loved it and played it all the time but then one day it suddenly stoped working when I was doing so well. I couldn't open the game anymore I tried many things and didn't work. I started a new game all from the beginning I had 55 cash in my town and all randomly it showed I had like 20. This game just wants you to keep making purchases. If you don't it will block you out.",
        "I love this game. I dont play a lot of games. Township just keeps getting better. Some things are a minor downfall to this game, like how you can usually get great items from the store, untill you need a product or item for a task or event item. Then unless you have the township cash to hire the dealer then its hard to get things done in time. Plus in order to complete some tasks, you have to sell everything in your barn to complete the task. You should be able to just harvest than sell without it subtracting it back from your task. But either than that its an awesome game...",
        "Something different and fun. I usually don't play these type games, but I love TOWNSHIP! Still having so much  fun with every level. AMAZING FUN! WOW! The HALLOWEEN decorations were so cute, I can't wait for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Loved the Cranberries. I'm enjoying Township more and more with each level. Year of the Rooster.  Greetings we're all gussied up for the holidays. It's Easter season 2018 still playing.",
        "Loved this game but I can't seem to get on the game now. I wait for a long time for it to start and have to sometimes uninstall and reinstall and wait for it to start again.  If It I do make it on I can't help other players by going to there town. I paid money on this game and play faithfully everyday. I'm feeling some kind of way about this. Please fix this.  Update: The bugs are fixed..Thank you",
        "It is fast pace and complex good for ny age,but it with it ads and constant up daes it is hard on your device. It can be played with out any cost, if one has the time and the patients. Other wise it can be costly.  If it a child playing it I would highly recommend supervision,not because of any other reason other than updates and complex issues.  But it is a thnking ame that is fun.",
        "This is one unique blend of many things made into a game that makes me feel obligated to keep coming back and keeping everything running in the game. It doesn't feel like this when I played HayDay. One highlight I have to mention, game cash (township cash) is generously given away in many form! No more worry of being unable to achieve this and that due to no cash available..."

Until i close the app and restart it Tried making a fresh Charecter and goes straight into other characters but just not my main.. This started happening an hour ago",
        "I can't get certain menus to work. In shop its the purchase for mount gear, all i see is random text and it freezes the game. Some of the event menus do the same. Ive been playing for a little over a year and never had this problem. Please help.  Also the merit shop menu is broken. I can't buy anything and the event ends today. Ill update as I see other menus broken.",
        "This game sucks.. I always get thee same armament with only one star!  and some items are soo expensive that the money you pay is not worthy for the br you get and in return you'll get low br and also low money not worthy.. If they make this game less expensive maybe I'll give it a four stars... But no! not this time",
        "Makes you pay good money to be strong then merges you with much older servers that allows a no pay player to be much stronger ... horrible customer service also! Edit 3\\18 I see Gatorcade replied to this saying contact them for help. I did 8 days ago with no reply... So yeah like I said horrible customer service",
        "I paid money on This game only for it to stop working once I did...plunder doesn't open for me, mounts won't open for me...assassins creed play won't open...if I do open them....game immediately freezes and I have to shut down. Funny how I pay money and now I have Chinese characters all over the damn game...  THIS is absolutely a pay to play game...except when you pay...the game apparently stops working....",
        "Hey guys.. So when I try to level up my mount I click on the icon and when it comes up most of it is blank except a few words in another language. It freezes the screen so I have to close out and sign back in. Also I can't get anything on plunder either. Some help would be greatly appreciated, thank you."

Need manual placement for all kits. I am left handed. This default kits layout is not a joy. Distance between toms, snare and kick need a bit space. Also need space for the hi hat and tambourine. Sound is okay. I used both of these apps.",
        "This application was filled with unecessary and nerve-warcking advertisements. I do not recommend this app to anyone, and if you are interesting in drumming, just buy a real or electric kit rather than playing this garbage.",
        "This app was absolutley perfect before the latest update, it was very responsive and i could drum along to songs on spotify and it would hit 99% of what i tapped. After the update if i play too fast or sometimes just randomly, the sound cuts out on some taps, very annoying when you're trying to keep a beat. What happened!?",
        "I'm never one to comment but this is fantastic!  I needed a few  percussion samples and thought I'd give an app a try..  I wasn't very optimistic on getting something realistic and easy to use. Was I wrong... I'm totally satisfied with this app and then some!",
        "Very good app for great time pass!But some time pass is the way of earning money and fame! There is an YOUTUBER named \"Mobile drummer\" from india,uploads video on youtube with the help of this app and earns a lot ,his some videos are 1 million crossed .",
        "The app is fantastic. But it stops working after a few minutes. It starts to lag and the tracks randomly start and stop. It's fantastic but only when it works."

        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "This game needs balance. Seems like all one does is hide behind shields and gather resources and hope higher might players harvest you for your resources. There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players",

Wasted 3 years of time and data on this worthless app.... recommend not installing or uninstalling it... customer service sucks",
        "Ive played this game a long time. New update and instead of making the game better you screw your customers. I lost all my boosters and you expect me to continue? If nothing else its a matter of principle. You punish me by taking everything ive bought and earned, ill punish you by never giving you another dime and i will let everyone i know who plays or asks about any of your games ro stay away.",
        "Would love to give a better rating, but after the most recent update the game has very bad lag, worse than the usual lag it's always had. Updating this. Was hoping update today would fix the lag. It didn't. Also, adding 2 extra steps in order to replay a stage sucks. You know the old saying; if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
        "In places with bad connection the facebook popup bug is also annoying and causes you to have to restart, losing lives and the streak. And having to click different buttons to confirm to end a game is stupid design.",
        "EDIT: Update on 3/22/18 fixed NOTHING! New levels still locked as well! Worst update in candy crush history. Riddled with bugs. It didn't add new levels like it should have. Unlimited boosters don't appear on level when they should. And boosters are no longer allowed on lower levels. I'm at level 2100 something. I should be able to use boosters when ever I want! And I should be able to have unlimited boosters appear on all levels, not just when they feel like it. Fix and I will give more stars.",
        "So frustrated with all the candy crush games. I periodically get angry enough to quit for awhile,  but end up back. Why am I upset? I was just in the middle of a rare winning streak and had earned a number of special candies to start games with. I was up to 2 hour on the fish, multi color candy, and the juicy jawbreaker, with 3 hours of life. Suddenly,  i still had the life but all other rewards disappeared. This is far from the first time. I am tired of it. I am removing the king games and I am not coming back this time. I get glitches happen but I have never had any  Indication  that anyone gives a damn. No one makes anything right or even says,  sorry. I'm ok with a game having issues but I am not ok with being treated less than."

First i thought playing  this game can be hard because it has so many buttons and how to play it but i did not had any choice and i played ur game. I felt like never deleting  it even i have completed this game . I understood this game by pressing the help button.  I have become  an expert in this without any friends. I have the hulk friend only but i use it rarely.because of playing alone I am stuck in level 19 but i will try. If not possible I wl use hulk. Thank u veryyyyyyyyyyyyyy much!!!!!!☺☺😊😃.i just have a question to you that when can my player become hulk. Only when we buy game money or any other way?????😞😐please tell fast",
        "Its a amazing game but i have one suggestion could u plz in the new anger of stick add cust charesters to be able to to be able to make your own charecter using a custom catolog and for the cuatom items not to cost any coins or jems or anythinf and for it to be free so u can just have all these things to add to your charecter and u can just get them without paying coins jems or real money.",
        "A nice game and I have unlock the last mega weapon it helps so much but weapons are not last long but I have too many so I can change the weapons when 1 ends yo yo a awesome game and J-Park the game server please please please please make anger of stick 7 and 8 I want to see the game and play yo yo a awesome game epic game awesome what should I say now a nice game yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo awesome yo yo",
        "Its good but the cost of reloading ur guns and weapons are way too high.playing in single player  gives you very low amount of money so its pretty hard the cost of stuff should be lowered",
        "Pretty simple and fun and you can play as much as you want, instead of an energy system. I wish there was a multiplayer zombie mode, unless there is and I just can't find it. Great game"

No complaints... No p2w... and the graphics if you set them to full are just phenomenal!!! Keep it up guys!! But fix the loading issue so we can get back to akademia!!",
        "Great game so far. Not sure if there is a community forum or something somewhere which would be nice. I had a character on some other server and it seemed to be erased when the new server opened? Its fine though, previous character did not have too much progression. Music is not the greatest though, would be good if you could include more classic FF music in the game.   Dailys seem a bit overwhelming. There are so many quests to complete each day to get all the chests.   Other than that im quite enjoying it. If you can't load the game after update clear data and dl again",

It has been 5 days since I submitted a support issue with no useful responses made by them. Update: over 48 hours since last response still not any closer to having my issue resolved",
        "I installed the game. I was enjoying it then suddenly it stoped working giving me an error message of \"license stoped working\". I uninstalled it and will try to install it. I hope this time it won't happen again.   What?? Still having the same error! Please do something about it, since the game is really nice.",

And now the game doesn't even start, i love the final fantasy franchise and you have a really great game, and i like that you have to interact with the game to stay alive and it's not just automatic bullcrap, please keep updating the game."

I got 1 dojo and 3 blades from daily challenge after that I played 15 days continueosly but I got only 5000 star fruit but no blades or dojos.

        "Would have given 5 stars but ads are so annoying and far to frequent. I'd accept ads maybe every 5 games but theres an ad after every game and it's a good 30 second ad everytime."

After watching an advertisement between games, a pop up screen of an advertisement will pop up right in the middle of your game and stop you from playing causing you to lose your focus.  Also the control are horrible their is no tapping just dragging.  The dragging is unresponsive sometimes and will cause customers to leave or burgers to burn. Plus side they give a lot of diamonds away.",
        "It's a great game, but the ads are everywhere. It's kind of ridiculous.  Love it to pass the time, though. It's hard to drag the order to each person. And I think it would be helpful if the wait time increased each time you add one of their items on their list.",
        "No reasonable way to upgrade or get good scores without purchasing or watching alot of ads for jewels. After a certain level you need to upgrade equipment and food to get faster but they require alot of jewels, so in essence you'll be only getting 1 maybe 2 stars out of 3 per level if you don't get the uprades. Deceptive, malicious,  uninstalling.",
        "It is  interesting and most of all i like to make the burgers. But the customers are impatient to wait and i hope at least you can update to make them wait a little longer then the game will be much enjoyable.",

        "It was a good game,  but I can't access the other levels.  I've reached out to the developer twice.  I've spent money on purchasing gems,  so I'd really like to find out how to move forward."

        "The stories are really interesting and it is hard to out down the phone once you got into one of the story. 😂😂 Although I really do wish that it is more easier to get the diamond but overall I totally recommend it!!  Keep it up the good work!  😊",

        "Can anyone tell me what SNS is?",
        "Well this is a surprise. It does not have much story yet but a good read if you've every played pixel berry's \"choices\" game. Same concept which means choices are going to need diamonds. Meaning you need to pay to do them. I really find it a nice read but since the books are few i'm on hold on purchasing diamonds. I guess once a series is completed i'm willing to buy diamonds to replay that game. For now i'm just browsing the game and taking notes on how many diamonds are going to cost per book.",
        "This game is amazing! The graphic is pretty great, plus the story is super ADDICTIVE. I can't stop reading this story but because of I have no pass left. However the problem is the pass, the pass is too little and the time is pretty long to wait. I hope this app would give much pass and please make the time shorter. But still this game is awesome, I recommend this game for you. You should download this app and try it."

        "Really enjoy this game but its very hard to do well unless you pay real money to buy extras! There should be more benefits without paying for them and each comoleted challenge should provide more money and diamonds than it currently does! And it should be easier to move up levels- I've played for months now and still only at level 5! People will just get bored of playing",
        "So this game Is fun and addicting BUT it favors those with money to spend. I understand that the creators of the app want money from it but at least make it fair for the players when it comes to voting on outfits and such l. The hair accessories in this game cost $10 which is 1 accessory for 3 -5 hairstyles. That's a rip off.",
        "The app is really good. It's addictive. But, I really feel they should give out cash or diamonds more easily. If we could earn diamonds or cash for watching a video then it would be great. Cause it takes time for the looks to get voted and until then we cannot play and wait for the diamonds. It's kinda sad. Hope they'll look into this.",
        "A very addicting, interesting game. The graphics are very real and there are hundreds of styles and brands to choose from. One problem is, it is very hard to budget your money. You get diamonds and tickets every day, which helps, but it is still hard to keep a good income. Otherwise, Covet Fashion is a great game, and I would definitely recommend it.",
        "So the new GM for Covet has blatantly admitted that they are pandering to LCV/new players now. I have spent THOUSANDS on this game to get myself to hcv in 11mos and now I'm being screwed over for it? What kind of business favors new customers over established ones that spend the most money? These are the same players that have openly admitted to voting against us!",
        "Love this game. Only thing I don't like is that when you buy something it only gives you one item. In the Design game it gives you several when you purchase an item. I find it hard to play this game bc I run out of money and diamonds too quick. If that aspect changed I would give it 5☆"

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. 😁 It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖",
        "This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.",
        "What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I'm in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can't push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something"

        "Great fun game. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because you go through your money pretty quick buying boosts to win levels to then upgrade your garden. I like the game a lot. Also I think that at the end of your board if you have undetonated items they should detonate at the end of that level. I've lost too many levels because of not getting one item that was next to something that was undetonated.",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "Much has improved since my original review (see below). There are special events going on quite often to help with earning coins and powerups, and the levels don't seem to be as tedious. Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

Developers of this game, you must fix the caracteristics of different characters in this game.

For example \"Zero\" character to have +8 bullet pircing and +12 reload, and other characters to have +2, +6, +9, +13, +18... also for weapon is the same thing... make all caracteristics different.

        "This game is actually okay for a mobile app. The downside unfortunately - as with so many - is that there is never quite enough of anything to progress without spending a considerable amount of money. I invested a lot of time on the zombie event only to find that time was running out and I would not be able to complete it without stumping up a relative fortune. I would have bought this game but refuse to pay to play and watch a ton of advertising in the hopes of getting the gold or tickets or cash or whatever. For what you might pay for stuff like this go and buy a console game. Heck you could buy the console as well on what uou could save avoiding this. Deleting it right niw. Adios greedy developers",
        "This game is a lot of fun, really addictive and completely free to play. Of course you can buy stuff if you want, but it's not necessary.   Multiple game modes, a ton of upgrades.   This is a good one."

        "I love this game. It's very dynamic and the gameplay is good too. The only problem I have is every single time I do PvP... It pairs me with an opponent far greater than what I can hope to beat. Sure, that's great for improving, but it disheartens me and makes me feel like a horrible player when I can't even beat ONE PvP opponent, ever, while playing the game. I would suggest to the devs that the matching system be a little more flexible when pairing. Give us a matching system that will actually give us lesser prepared players too so we can have the fun of winning, as well. Also, I am disconnected every single time I do PvP battles and bounties. Quite unstable, unfortunately.",
        "Amazing shooter game, awesome hero collecting game, great multiplayer game. Definitely suggest that you at least try it out. But one thing you should look out for, it's pretty easy to sink between 5 and 20 dollars a week into this. Sometimes even 40 to 60. But, it's pretty free-to-play friendly if you can't afford to buy some gold.",
        "I really like the game. It's fun and has enough activities and quests to keep you occupied for a while. My only complaint is how they match people up for the PVP missions. Sometimes you get matched up with people with far higher power and Team level menu which makes it nearly impossible to win. other than that I really enjoy the game",
        "Super fun game. I haven't got bored of the game because there's always events going on which is good. One of the better if not the best shooting game I've played. I think there is a slight glitch when using Steele. Sometimes after I activate his open fire skill he doesn't shoot when I press the shoot button.",
        "Latest update definitely made the game harder. I used to run 4 gauntlet levels with little issue but now I can't get through 1 without losing people. Resurrected characters are completely unwelcome and unfair in pvp when you tell on kills for money. Probably going to uninstall, you're welcome for the money Hothead",
        "Starts off ok but then the pay walls creep in and you are constantly bombarded with prompts to spend money. The PVP is absolutely pointless, highest power rating wins every time without exception so you know if you've won or lost as soon as it picks an opponent. Needs a lot of work before I'd consider dropping any real money on it."

        "In love with it every second I used it. Have been missing it on my Coolpad Note 3 due to certain glitches with my copy of Warriors Orochi & Orochi 2. The MALI-T720 really sucks. But loving it again on my Lenovo Z2 Plus with Snapdragon 820 and Vulkan. Love the fast forward key, it makes me go LOL sometimes in games. Soon going to buy the Gold Version now as I have a better compatible device. Thank you dev for such a pleasurable claasic experience. Love ya. 😃",
        "After the recent update, the app is crashing quite frequently. Hopefully this will be fixed soon. But Vulcan support is appreciated, it seriously improves frame rate and audio, plus the texture looks nicer too. It's a blessing I can play persona 3 on my phone. Haven't tried many other games though. Will edit and update the score once the game crashes are improved. Lastly, thank you to the developer for this amazing emulator.",
        "This has continued to be an amazing app! The ability to run most PSP games flawlessly on my phone is incredible. My PSP broke a while back and I haven't had the money to buy the system again. I had missed playing my favorite PSP games. Now I still can! I highly recommend this app! I also recommend trying Dead Head Fred on it! Fantastic PSP title!",
        "I use a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 (yes the best-of-the-best). And as soon as I selected Vulkan, instead of OpenGL all my games like Midnight Club 3, Midnight Club LA and even Gran Turismo works SUPER FAST AND ON AMAZING 5x PSP resolution. The only thing disappointing is that the emulator doesn't work full screen. *PLEASE ADD FULL SCREEN SUPPORT FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 8*. BEST PSP EMULATOR.",
        "Awesome app.... loved it... But due to 2 problems I am not able to play the best of the best psp games like G O W and Assassin's Creed, etc. 1. Calibration is not working. The default calibration is only in place even after calibraling it from many different angles. There is no change to the tilt even after calibration. 2. multitap compatibility in OnePlus 3t. I am not able to use the R and X and analog buttons at the same time which is a very needed combination in Assassin's Creed.... Plz.. Fix this issue.... Due to these I am not able to play even God Of War in this app.... plz.. plz.. plz.. plz... fix this......",
        "Its a fantastic emulator and the best .. using it since 3 years..!! Gameplay is Great.. Graphics could be improved.. Sound is Glitchy (metal gear solid - peace walker).. fix it soon...!! ❤️ You PPSSPP..!!  *Cheats- I'm unable to use it.. (Make it happen soon.. probably the next update 😇) Best app on Playstore for me..!!😍😍😍 Make enhancements for HiKirin Socs.. Creators  of  PPSSPP .. please make an emulator for ps2 also (it's my wish)"

However, when I hit him like a combos of headhits, it didnt hurt him at all. It is like he became invincible. Anyway, I love everything of SF3. The storyline, gameplay, graphic and so on, they are all great. And I hope you would fix that one single problem of mine along with others who have the problem of crashing as I had read the comments. That is all for me. Keep up the good work, Nekki.",
        "Good overall, although I have some gripes about the stunlocking when you're ragdolled on the ground and you can't recover. Also, at the fight with Xiang Tzu in the tournament, after I win the game blurs to blue as it is supposed to, but just stay there and doesn't show my rewards. When I restart the app the game then resets me to before I fought Xiang Tzu.",
        "I have been playing this game for past few months and i just love the game. Its so addictive but today when i updated it, it has become a nuisance. Every time i defeat a opponent in a mission the game halts after \"you win\". I tried this with other missions as well but things didn't work. Please fix this bug.",
        "Having same problems as some others after latest update game freezes after wining fight and no rewards show up so have to close the game and do it again. Seem to be stuck in the same cycle so might aswell not play til update fixes problem",
        "The update destroyed everything.. now when I win a match, the game crashes. Can't finish the missions. I tried again and again, but still crashes. It going pretty well before the update. Why was the update anyway.. to make us noobs?",
        "It is impossible to level up with sidemissions which come once in seven hours and the game is tough as hell. My xp bar was three fourth full and suddenly it became one fourth game matching is also insanely inaccurate. Results not loading game is crashing"

        "Hey... I would give this game 5 stars but there is 1 main -VE POINT. FUEL takes TOOOOOOOO LONG TO RECHARGE.  The point of this game is to playyyyyy the game. I don't want to keep waiting. I downloaded your great game TO PLAY it. Please try to solve this issue. I will definitely give you 5 stars if you fix this. Please listen to us and read our comments. Most of us are mentioning this 1 -ve point. Thank you",
        "Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it's only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that's bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it's a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I'll rate 5 star$",
        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn't really feel like you're getting anywhere.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "It shouldn't be easier to level up rather than actually playing game. I wouldn't say that the gameplay is difficult to play, but the purposefully placed trucks that shoot you is a bit ridiculous. Other cars are in the way which ultimately eliminates you before you can attack the shooting trucks. There really is no challenge except trying to beat your previous score. I give this game an eh out eh."

        "Highly addictive. Great fun. Only downside Is, when you get to higher levels, upgrading buildings takes way too long. I'm talking days! Makes you forget about the game sometimes as you can't do anything else untill it's complete. I refuse micro-transactions so this game now only gets visited once every couple of days. It's a shame really as it's great fun to start with.",
        "Provided the developers with evidence of rampant racism, homophobia and misogyny present in the game. They have so far neglected to take any action against the perpetrators. Unacceptable.  Edit: I have already provided screen shots to you via the Help & Support board, you haven't yet taken action. Please do so immediately.",
        "This game is not made for people who do not spend money. The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",

        "Unless you are willing to line their pockets with cash your wasting your time on the game.  You'll never catch up to those who have been playing the game a long time without money.  Parents beware."

        "As expected, it looks and performs amazing. Fighting mechanics and modes are pretty innovative and thrilling. It is quite stupid to compare the console version with mobile one. Each one has its own unique style, so they should NOT look the same, cz' each one provides the fans with a different gaming experience. This surely increases the already huge number of fans of Tekken. 5 🌟 game",
        "WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you",
        "Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It's pretty decent. I'm enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I've raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn't a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)",
        "First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I'll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC's (and MK's) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.",
        "As a long time Tekken fan I am happy that we have a version for mobile. I am also quite impressed with how smooth the gameplay is. The graphics are impressive for mobile. I'm underwhelmed by the controls though.  For me Tekken is all about the controls, and while I didn't expect a full controller interface. I feel like there could have been a better control layout available. Also the interface and game play menus feel quite busy, like there is too much going on. They could take a note from the wb fighters on mobile in this regard.",
        "As a lifelong Tekken fan this game is about as good as you could get for a mobile game. Sure there's microtransactions but they don't feel shoved down your throat and you'll get a decent amount of fun before they feel remotely neccesary. The gameplay is good, simpler but as concise and impactful as it always is. The only thing that I've found off putting so far is some of the writing is a bit... off. Just some out if character stuff but the story dialogue is mostly setup so it's not too bad.  Overall this is definitely worth a try if you want Tekken on the go."

        "I have been playing this game for a while now, and I still love it. Because even though its characters share similarities with characters in other MOBA's, they still have there own original flare that makes playing them much different then other characters from other MOBA's, and the one character that I have absolutely fallen in love with is Olivia. Because not only has she added some relevance to the jungle, she is everything I believe an assassin should be, she has a unique play style, she takes some thought and skill to use correctly, and she dominates late game with her damage output. The only problem I have now is that the older characters like beldora, skarlet, angelyne and car in have fallen far behind as actual characters.",
        "This game is perfect except for two issues. First, when I play ranked match the ping gets so high and it gets lag, but when I play other modes it's working well. Second are the controls. There are instances every game that my joystick randomly makes my hero move without my control. Please fix this and this game will be perfect.",
        "It's a pretty good moba. I don't rly write reviews.  I'm only giving 4 stars, because I just started 15 matches in ranked and i. At 100% win rate..im starting to think were playing with bots..im already ranked gold. Add opath if u wanna team up",
        "i think the game should has more items, items that have evasion, and items that gives both attack or magic and defense and heros should have mana limits. but perks should have less cooldowns with less effects but buffs should last longer this way the game will be more ingaging when there is more bottons to tap. i wrote all these to improve the game. i mean i compare this game to Dota 2. and thank you developers in general and for making  new heros all the time.",
        "1. Still laggy when the scene is crowded 2. Stop matching us with AI/bot in Matched play , Fast Game , Battle Royale , those are supposed to be vs players , that makes me suspicious maybe in ranked there are AI too because some didn't respond team chat .",
        "1- It takes so much time to match up. 2- It lags most of the time when I play ranked or matched play with my friends. Even if I play ranked alone it lags. 3- Sometimes when I try to hit enemy my controls get disabled & it doesn't work for short time then it happens again.  I will give 5 star if you solve these Issues."

        "This is a really good game. I tend to be cynical about mobile games because they're usually pay to win these days but this game seems to have a very fair progression system. It's also refreshing that it's single player. That seems to be getting rare these days. My one suggestion is that there be more levels and things to do. I've only been playing for 4 days and I'm already nearing the end of the campaign. Add more missions or maybe another game mode and this game will easily earn 5 stars from me.",
        "Great time passer! This is one of the better helicopter games I have played. The sound effects are realistic along with graphics and gameplay. No regrets or bad feelings from me. This game is on both phones and my tablet. Love it!",
        "update game and increase more level and There are some Item which we will never  unlock and get up to 2-3 years and signIn problem facing even it is Not completed 30 days i lost my all progress just because of Poor Technology and Software error auto rejected progress i want back my all Progress i was completed 25 days Journey.",
        "Good game, however on my android version I keep blowing up the two transport ships and they sink but an underwater version of them keep going and I can never comple the mission? There is a bug and I'm loosing all my ammo as I keep trying all different ways of blowing the ships up but the ghost ships always make it to the end!!!",

Which I did, even though that's when MORE DATA USAGE. Now it won't even load past a certain percentage, haven't gotten to play yet, even after DIDN'T TONS if files and data worth of the game.........Pls fix so I can actually try the game. I WILL EDIT THE REVIEW IF I GET TO PLAY",
        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "After the latest update the multiplayer rating is bugged and doesn't increase. Also provide some leverage to get the prestige guns because i can hardly afford it. The weapons box also provide useless blueprints of the guns which turns into diamonds and i end up having lots of diamonds and very less credits which doesnt help getting a high end gun.",
        "When im playing online and doing some online events i get credit and xp points after the mach and then when i get kicked out and coming back i have lost everything. This is boring and i want you to fix this problem. I cant play online anymore because there's no one's playing but when my friend is playing on he's phone he always find a mach.

The reason I gave it only 1 star is just to seek your attention because I wanted u all to add an effect of sound of engine as the car speeds up which will make the game really more realistic. I really loved playing this game but if u add that effect, it will make the game more interesting. I hope u add some more realistic effects in the game. Again I say that I gave it just 1 star to seek your attention, otherwise the game really worths a 5 star........Thank you.",

        "Hot garbage. I absolutely love the game but forget playing in the evenings. The game freezes and kicks you saying internet connection lost. The problem is the servers not my ISP. Sometimes you can rejoin and continue where you left off, other times or says the room is full. 5 stars if they get this issue fixed and quit blaming the ISP when it's their equipment.",
        "I really love this game, not sure why. The only problem is that I keep on getting disconnected from servers or I'm not able to load into battle royale or the qualifying games. I get disconnected from the wifi for a few seconds, I thought it was just the phone but when I uninstalled the game it stopped. It happens almost every other game, sometimes a few (5+) games in a row. For most games I would just uninstall after a while and find something else, but I really enjoy playing. Hopefully that gets fixed, I saw a lot of other reviews saying the same thing. ~Lagging",
        "The game is actually really fun, when it works... But it's so temperamental...  Games  disconnect regularly.  My other big issue is that there isn't a global leaderboard, Google play integration, achievements, or an easy way to start a game with friends.  On a side note the English translations are pretty poor, but it doesn't take away from the fub.!",
        "Crashes way too much. Fun, then crashes.  Glitches everywhere.  Multiple functions of game play do not work, like \"Firestorm Arena\". (It spawns me alone, always without opponents.)  Awful app construction, fun concept.  *(This review is not... \"for an older version\". It is for the current glitchy as hell dysfunctional version. It has been dysfunctional for months and will be for months after this post. This is a current review for the current version of the game.)*",
        "The game is really good. I'm really enjoying it but after playing for about 15 to 20 minutes it just quits, like it's crashing. This usually happens when I'm first place and level 17 or so. Really frustrating as it means I've gotta start again. Will happily increase to 5 stars once this has been resolved. Great game other than that!",
        "I personally love this game. The controls are fluent, and it is all around a good game. 😀 But, for some reason, whenever I go into the battle Royal game, it just instantly kills me! Sometimes it works, but most of the time it just kills me straight away. Maybe it's me... Idk other than that, great game!"

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",
        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money.",
        "The game is great but customer service is non- existent. I bought the 30 day gem special that was supposed to come with an egg and fountain. Got the gems (so far)but not the extra items. Tried contacting customer support several times but following their M.O., they never respond."

        "It's a nice game, with a great graphics and such but the auto-update for extra files it's kind of annoying. Is there anyway to turn it off? Because we have to waiting for it to be downloaded before can play again. Can we choose to update whenever we want?  Anyway, this is a really nice game and I've been playing it for a long time. Keep up the good work!",
        "I love the game. There's nothing wrong with it because I feel like it's the old game that I grew up with. But what I hate is that the prices for packs, lp, sp and simoleons went high. The prices before was okay but now I don't think I will spend anymore for packs that give only like 5vip points. Such a fun game but aimes for large microtransactions.",
        "I really enjoy this game, and love developing my Sim's homes and the world. Unfortunately, my game won't open. It hasn't for about a month now, even after this new update. It shows me the loading screen for five minutes, then crashes. It would be wonderful if there could be a fix for this.",
        "Love love love it! This game is actually better than The Sims Mobile... 2 problems,, 1st. The Modern houses with second floor, so expensive😭! 2nd. The time it sometimes takes ages just for one activity!😐 but hey, everything else.. TOTALY AWSOME! 😍 thanks so much for creating this game. Cuz its so hard to download the sims 4 in a Mobile. 💕",
        "This is actually cool and I really love this game. However, the expiration of most of the quest that i'm having are only 2 days to finish. I think it's unfair, and the materials needed are too expensive. Sims are busy on finishing tasks so they won't be able to go to work and earn. So I'm not totally enjoying the game.",
        "When you get an event sometimes it only lasts for like 2 days which really isn't enough because some actions take 1 day. Please extend event times and don't give like 5 events at the same time. Also you should be able to log in other ways apart from Facebook because lots of people don't have Facebook. Please make other ways for us to login  so we can get more neighbours."

Even i haven't sleep for 2 days, felt like an alien or zombie, etc. But this game cheers me up alot. Recommended ? Yes! Good job dev, just download it guys. Lu pasti hepi dah! Keren!",

        "This game keeps crashing to the home screen without warning,same problem with Blossom blast saga.Problem started before few days ago,since I updated both games.This problem keeps happening with android kitkat. Can this problem be solved or should I deinstall all king games I have? I have no problem with games from other developers, so this is on you, not on me.",
        "Have played this game virtually since it first started it's a great game but why do we haveto buy the gold bars we have earned throughout the games I have never spent a cent buying anything! Shouldn't most of the gold bars be awarded to us for being loyal gamers ☺",
        "At level 558 I quit this game like 2=3 years ago... Now I don't even remember how to defeat spiders etc... Thought it would be fun to start over from scratch... But of course in these games not even a chance...  Great fun... NO",
        "I enjoy the game BUT.... I payed £2.99 to open the piggy bank to collect my gold bars and when I tried to collect them again, I have a pop up telling me that I have to pay another £2.99 AGAIN to collect the 50 gold bars I have earned from completing each level! Nothing states that these are one off payments and that you have to pay everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars. I never normally spend money on games and I most certainly will not waste any money on this game again! What an absolute rip off. When a gamer clicks on the piggy bank, I think that the notification should state that you have to pay the ridiculous amount of £2.99 everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars.",
        "Latest update keeps crashing especially when a level has been won and on the bonus. Crashes to hone screen then the level is lost  and had to be done again. Will restore 5 stars when fixed.",
        "Payments for bricks does not respond with google play . Just says error occurred try later or wrong password. Im already logged in google play atc. I did not make any changes in my account."

        "Really great gamplay, graphics, amazing controls which mind you are much more responsive than Sonic Dash or at least I think so, and this is the best concept I've ever seen. It's like Sonic Dash and a racing Sonic game had a baby. Best of all, this game captures the essence of Sonic in a brilliant way. Another thing I'd like to say is it's super balanced(besides Cream shes cheap as hell) but the fact is no character is better than the other cause they all have something unique about themselves.",
        "The game is super choppy! I dont have a bad phone or Wi-Fi so I dont know the problem. If there was a mode like where you can reduce graphics that would be amazing. Besides that the rest is fine. Getting characters is easy, ads plays when after a match and/or if you want to double your rewards, and looks pretty nice.",
        "I like it, really cool game, you never really know what's going to happen in a race. If you guys are making yet another character to race with, Im asking: can it please be Infinite, Big the 🐱, or our own custom character? Also, are you able to make different racing music in the game? I have a feeling that some people will get annoyed if the same \"Lost Valley\" song is being played over and over again.",
        "I was enjoying the game but I started getting put against level 8's and 9's as a level 2.  Losing two races would take away 6 or 7  second place wins in a row, worth of progress.  I would lose 15-20 minutes worth of progress in two races. Wasting my time and effort.  Sometimes I swipe up to jump and my character just spin dashes instead, so my character just slams into an object or spins into a hole. Annoying.  After trying again and losing all gains in two losses, uninstalled.  Waste of time.",
        "This game is really great and well polished. However, something needs to be done about the players with laggy connections. Most of the players with over 2000 points are all so laggy, that you can't tell where they are so you can't attack them. They are abusing the lag and need to be dealt with somehow.",
        "Like the game but the latest update have mess up the gameplay with alot of lag. It keep sticking or kicking me out of the gameplay. Before the uodate. I had no issues and it was great. Please look into this"

I would have been excited about the upcoming birthday event if I could access my game. Fix soon or I will delete this and all other zynga games I funnel my hard working money into",
        "Great game, love achieving all the quests, also love the show animals, I wish I could do more than one with a partner though. I wish that during an update that it wouldn't stop the game for the players, showing grassy area with no coins or keys and level 1, so I could continue to play. But I know I just have to leave it for a while and wait till the update is finished, which is hard because it is so addictive. Some people need to remember though that this is a free game.",
        "Liked this game until now. I recieved some keys from the game. I used them then they said they had had some technical difficulties and some players should not have received them then promptly took my remaining keys off me!  This was they're mistake not mine. I find this churlish and ridiculous. It's put me right off the game!",
        "Since Jan this game has gone to hell in a hand basket. Every update I have to fight to get stuff back they y'all took from my game. This game use to be fun, now I don't care if I play it or not. Y'all only care a out the people who spend money on your game, not the loyal ones that's been playing since it went mobile. I'm very disappointed!!",
        "I just started playing this game and was really liking it. In one day I made it to level 15 and had made a purchase using real money. The app froze and I tried everything is fix it but it erased my whole farm and made me start over. I am soooooo mad!!!! And I'm mad I spent money and lost everything. Really not impressed at all",
        "When I first got it it worked fine. (Yesterday). Now every time I get on it'll load but will freeze and not let me do ANYTHING AT ALL. I've tried everything from closing the app to restarting my phone. Please fix it because I really like the game."

        "Absolutely amazing game!!! I'm a huge petrol head and this ticks all boxes considering it's a phone game. Love the controls. Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress. Literally one downfall... upgrade costs when you get higher spec cars. Apart from that... GOOD JOB!!!",
        "Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.",
        "Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning",
        "The MOST AMAZING racing game in the mobile device. The gameplay, graphics, and the controls were perfect. Also, the tracks in the game were so real like I was racing in real life. I also loves the cars that were added in this game, it looks so amazing. But, what I like the most from this game was online real-time racing. There were no other racing games that has this feature. Just have suggestions, add custom race mode. In this mode, you can chose tracks, daytime, amount of opponents, and also the laps. And also enable to invite friends to custom race mode. Also, probably adding weather system will be better. Last, make the cars could do rev-bombing. So, at the start of the races, you could have some pretty good start. Although, keep it up Electronic Arts & Fire Monkeys. Hopefully, these suggestions could help the game become much better and better.",
        "Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I'm just going to name some things that I'm sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I'm just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!",
        "the graphic, control, and gameplay is good as always, but the problem is, i played this years ago just with a device with 1gb RAM and i have mid-high graphic setting, but now im running with oppo a37f and i think it can run this game with a mid or mid 2 graphic setting... but no, my game always set to the lowest graphic, could you guys fix this problem? i love this game and i'd like to enjoy it in its best performance"

        "I kind of miss the old version because isn't that why they came out with a 2nd game so if we eant more we got it.  Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.",

And about the ads there are a lot of them but if u turn of wifi and data then u won't have a problem with the ads cause they don't show up!              Please pledge to be safe aroun trains",
        "This game is both funny as serious it's a great way to make kids understand the danger of some things around them. Like trains and wires and different things. As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.",
        "I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I'm playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can't complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍",
        "I love the game, it's so addictive! Some of the levels are confusing, but most are super simple and super fun! One thing that is a little bit of a downer is how every time you want to play a new round you have to watch a 30 second add , which gets old when you want to play a lot, but don't want to pay for add free. But I would highly recomend this to anyone",
        "This game is so good but please get rid of some adverts. Whenever I click on somthing it always comes up with a long advert. Also, can you add a toutorial at the start, showing how to do each thing."

        "Great game This is a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing aesthetics and highly addictive. Totally worth the $2 for the premium version. I do have one problem though: even though I am pretty decent at the game, Google Play won't give me any achievements even though I'm sure I have earned some. It won't even let me open achievements or leaderboard pages. Is anybody else having this issue?",
        "I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I've decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I've upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!",
        "There are so many good things to list about this game. First, the graphics are extordinarily beautiful. And how much this game can relax you is AMAZING! When I play this, I swear my stress is gone. This game is never stressful. I find it amazing how satisfying this game is. I also love how realistic this game it is. The veiw and echoing is what really make up this game. Every sound is perfect for the setting. You need to download this NOW!",
        "Really fun and addicting! The first time i saw this app was when my dad told me about this game, he said that it was very good. Literally the first 10 minutes i played this game my mind was blown and i beacame addicted. Around 2 years later(now) i found this game again and instantly installed it. I love this game and I have played it for a long time. The graphics and music are amazing. This a really good game and you should install it! Who could think that glass could be so fun. However I think this game would be better if some of the thing you have to pay for would be for free.",
        "Great game, but premium is almost a requirement. The game itself is great, with an uber-cool, never-seen-before concept of smashing glass with metal balls in mysterious dimensions. The only problem is that getting premium is almost a requirement if you want to do well in the game. You can't continue the level once you die without paying. I would rate this game five stars if it weren't for this.",
        "So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn't save where I'm at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won't be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!"

        "The game is very well written for offline, but not for online games. My phone becomes slow and slow after playing online. During play I experienced slow and my mobile internet speed drops slowly from 55mbps to less than 1 Mbps speed, although I have very good internet speed in my home. After factory reset my phone comes to normal. No problem during offline. I would give rating 5 if it has robust encryption and hack proof.",
        "This game need serious adjusments in controls specialy u cannot aim firmly and direct instead you end hitting the opponents balls instead of yours. Lack of aiming assistance like in 8 ball pool and the power bar should be located in the left side more comfortable to me . How i wished you can configure that by yourself but no option for it available. In the other hand the game is playable not fun at all but playable . Let's see if u update this features soon. I'm delete it until all this bugs are fixed cheers all.",
        "The mechanics and graphics are great. But the AI leaves a bit to be desired. Sometimes the AI will be completely incompetent and miss several shots in a row to the point where you can't shoot because there are too many obstacles. Then all of a sudden it rolls through the table in a single turn.",
        "I am a big fan of ur game.. Can u do me a favour please link this game to email or facebook id because whenever i want to change my cellphone  then the game starts from starting point please do something when anyone cange his cell phone then the game starts at that point or level where i left  please",
        "The aiming is easy due to a system of dotted lines that let you see where your object ball is going to go after you strike it with the cue ball, and it even shows you where the cue ball will go as well. The ball action against the cushions seems very realistic and the roll out after the shot seems real as well. Now if we could get a paid version with straight pool I'd be a happy Tiny Tim. 1/1/2018, still waiting for a paid version.",
        "Due to it's server problems some times it's not responding in online. when our turn comes it gets timed out and opponent get 2 chances at a time eventually we loose the game developers need to check this seriously."

        "Sent email to devs over a week ago asking a question. No reply. Disappointing. Also the fact that there are no videos so unable to use the spinning wheel. Otherwise a mostly good game.",
        "Google keeps crashing. Even if you press stop it still pops ups every 10 seconds and the game takes ages to load and prestidge using an S7. Will increase stars if fixed as a good game otherwise.",

        "I think that this game is amazing and soo fun and adicting but the only problem that I would have rated it 4 stars is that this game only works with internet connection which saddens me because this game is my absolute fav. game I have played and I always want to play it. Keep up the amazing(A+) effort!",

        "Well I think you need better graphics and I don't like how it is slow when you turn. Plus it has TOO MANY ADS! I just started playing this game! The pictures showing the terrains is probably copied off of MCPE's pictures (I am not saying it is! But it might be). I really like this game I really do but there needs to be some changes. People aren't going to like this game if there isn't some changes. I just read a comment saying this game is \"gay\". That was incredibly rude. People shouldn't call it \"dumb\" or \"gay\" just because this game needs better graphics or it has to many ads. Does anyone even know the definition of \"gay\"? There is two meanings for it but they both mean your happy! Stop calling the game names! It is not necessary to!",
        "I love this game, it's sooooo fun but my only problem is the ads. It was fine when I first downloaded it, there were no ads but after I upgrade the game, all of a sudden there's ads every second. If you can get rid of the ads, I would greatly appreciate it",
        "There's so many things wrong with this I don't even know where to start. First off your in a confined space and if you go so far you just hit a blue wall. If in was infinitely generated and you could go farther it might be better. Second its kind of slow when moving. Third since the whole confined space thing you have each different biome all pushed together so when you walk two steps your in a different biome and its small. So you extremely need to make it better.",
        "So, the game itself is incredibly enjoyable and fun. Sometimes the controls get me here and there, but I'm sure, with time, I'd get use to it. The thing is, THERE IS NO TIME. Literally every minute, I get a thirty second ad. I'm just here building my home and making foundation when all of a sudden, an ad pops up. I say, \"oh okay, it's just one, whatevs.\" WRONG. It is now ten, just over the past 5 minutes. This game has serious potential, if only it'd let us play the game and cut out the ads. I'm spending more time watching ads rather than using time to efficiently play the game. It irks me, so I uninstalled the ap. It really is a good game, just lower the ads from 2 per minute, kay?",
        "Just like minecraft !!! This game is amazing I pick this over mine craft for any body who actually reads reviews like me listen ! This game is amazing ! The only thing I want y'all to fix is that easy mode needs night and that hard mode needs to just give you the supplies you need because some things you need you can't scavenge.",
        "\"Oh, it's just like Minecraft.\" Yes. It's exactly like Minecraft. Well no, not quite: this game is awful and that game is great. Overall, terrible game, fake reviews. Outta this house"

For 3 weeks I have tried to reach them and have gotten nothing. So, HELL NO, I would NOT recommend this to anyone.",

WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY A D GAME GLITCHES AND SHUTS OFF TAKING ANY PROGRESS! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!! UPDATE 3/18/18  STILL NO WORD OR REMEDY FROM DEVELOPER!!! SCAM!!!!!"

Why have a cloud save or play the game or spend moo pney when it's erased. I still love the game but now frustrated I will think about uninstalling.",
        "The puzzles are interesting, the animations are generally enjoyable. It quickly becomes a grind, though, where you aren't enjoying the gameplay, you're just trying to get past the timewasters of the daily challenge, or fighting the arbitrary points of the arena. The clan battles and Mighty Eagle challenge are the best parts, but you can't play them all the time. You have to grind away in the Arena.",
        "I just purchased a new phone. And being I'm using the same e-mail address i would have thought it would have started me at the same level I had been on prior to the new phone. Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "GAH! They've over complicated this game with unnecessary graphics and gifts and prizes etc. I couldn't even figure out how to get into the levels for a while haha. I'm sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn't want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn't change it. Uninstalled after 1 day.",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download."

I hate the hiding construction workers. If I don't knock them out at the top of the screen, they get too low down and I miss them. Hate it when I accidentally hit the people when the game throws everything at you. I have a super fast finger, but, sometimes not fast enough. It takes concentration and fast reflexes to advance in this game. I gave it 5 stars.  Might go and read the help section for tips. All I want to say is try it.",

        "The game is good and quite addicting. I already opened the four cafes and was able to finish all of its stages in a short period of time. The problem is that after finishing the four cafes, there are no more cafes to open so I do not know if this game is limitrd to four cafes only.",
        "It was a very good game. I love it,though after playing it for a few days,as i open new cafes and unlock higher levels,it lags and exits itself while i'm playing it. My phone started overheating. It was a likeable game overall.",
        "Love this game to kill time. Only issue is I have 4 cafes open and all maxed out. 120/120 stars and no more chains are available to open so I have nothing else to do on it. There's spaces for new lots but doesn't give me the option. Super confused.",
        "it is a good game! i am enjoying it. so far the only thing that i can see that needs to be fixed is the face of needing gems along with money to buy stuff. that needs to change",

The minus is city is to small for lot of player like that. Very crowd, i cant even see other player appereances. So camera angle maybe you can make lil bit wider or higher so city can looked much bigger",

I only can report the first transaction because the app is not allowed me to report again before the first one is solved. I topped up for event but the event will  end today. If this is solved after goddess kiss event, I just want my money back. I wont delete this until the problem is solved fairly.",

It brought me back to the main menu n tht i hav to log in again BUT i cant log in. I even uninstalled and installed it back a couple of times. It feels like im just taking chances here to be able to play. This all started in the afternoon for me. Not sure bout the rest. But please take some action about this matter and/or respond to us regarding this matter, Thru facebook or here. I really like the game. Soo please. Help. Explain whats happening. Get it fixed quickly.",
        "I love the game its truLy one of the best but after an update I can hardly play 1 minute at most and suddenly its shows unable to connect, I already checked my connection it was good! What happen? The first time I play it was very smooth..please fix this one..please..please...",
        "Awesome It's very addictive! The graphics are nice too but I was disappointed with the heroes - there are only three to choose from. And, you cannot change your avatar for easier recognition. The current thing is okay but sometimes it's difficult to know who is who unless you really pay attention to the name of a player.  Overall, it's awesome and highly recommended :)",
        "Had so much fun and thrill in playing the game. Graphics and overall performance is great!! Though i would just like to be helped with my old account.PLEASE HELP ME RETRIEVE MY OLD ACCOUNT :( I want to continue my old progress but since ive changed phone, Id have to redownload and log in in the game. Tho unfortunately you guys updated it from the last time I played it and now, When i log in using my supposed account it kept me getting right from the start in choosing character. How can i get my old character back? Thats so unfair :( I made all effort :( My username is PetLucifer. Also, does server has to do anything in relation to that? Cause i cant remember which server i used to log in"

They stayed in contact, gave a time that an update should be in place, and even compensated me with a nice sorry for the inconveniences package. Which I wasn't expecting or requesting in anyway. So great game and better customer support than most other mobile developers",

        "Love the concept of the game but the moment you start reaching higher castle lvl  that's when you realize that if you don't pay you will be on a long journey, ie.. PvP are out of the question everyone has minimum of 5 epic items, arena you will have to settle for 5th or less place due to power lvl difference. I am about 141000 fighting 190000 or 90000, which is not fair for those of low power or advantage to those of high.",
        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",
        "I loved this game very much, I had a lot of really nice things and invested nearly $60 dollars into making my guys 5 stars and diamonds and other level up promos... I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine.."

Example: upgrading fridge, adding order to telephone system. The button can easily clicked and cause the time spent to earn cash gone within seconds. Thanks.",
        "I love this game it serves us my boredom reliever. I love the graphics the design and all. My complain is only about the vouchers and the expansion problem Can u please give us lot of expansion voucher bcoz i always use my cash to expand my cafe. U know that it is very hard to earn a cash. And can you lower the prices of avatar like 50 cash only bcoz 100 cash is too much.  Thank you i hope you can consider my request",
        "Amazingly fun and addicting! But really needs a confirmation button for spending cash (\"Are you sure you'd like to spend X cash?\") There are buttons everywhere and I've already wasted so much cash by pure accident. That's my only complaint though :)",
        "Love this game spent some money on it but still very fun.  They do specials on packages pretty cheap that speed things up.  Has a lot to do in it too doesnt get boring.  Good if you have a long time to play or just a couple minutes.",
        "The game is great, reminds me of chefville that truly will be missed forever... I just dont like the fact that you need to spend quite a bit of money to really enjoy it... That is the reason I will probably quit it. :( If you dont start spending money it will be really hard to expand, you wont be able to build machines and that is the reason customers will leave negative comments... And some of the coments you get from customers are really mean and offensive... I wish they were more subtle. The prizes you can win by watching ads and inviting celebrities over are usually not helpful and dont change the situation that much. Like I said, you MUST spend money to enjoy the game. It is a great option for those who have money to throw away on frivoulus things...",
        "Game is fun, but its hard to get all that the game has to offer without spending some real money.  Not sure if I'm going to continue"

And another thing that's a problem is this phone heats your phone up badly in less than a minute and it makes me cautious of my phone.I hope these issues get fixed soon.

        "The game is amazing, addicting and a lot of fun just to collect and level up dragons. The events that are constantly coming on always make you feel like you have something to do. However when of the events are very unbalanced and, if you are against one of these people, not very fun. The heroic races are a great way to compete with other players to add a powerful dragon to your collection but some people take the fun out of it by spending 100's of gems to ensure that they come first. The ability to use gems during these races should be removed as it is highly unbalanced, or at least add another way of collecting the heroic dragons without having to compete with people who pay to win.",
        "I love this game. Its very addicting and fun, but I find that there are barely any female dragons. This upsets me very much and I would like for this to change. The only females I see are the dragons with names like  motherly dragon, belle dragon, viktoria dragons, and sleeping beauty dragons. There are also descriptions like \"add some girly pink to your collections with the gummy dragon\"(which is also coincidently a girl). Then I see cool legendary dragons, but OH plot twist they're all boys. This is a very fun game no doubt on that, but please, stop with the sexism and make cool female dragons. Thank you.",
        "Still Having Lot's of Fun! Cool to mix different dragons just to see what u get!  I just opened my 6th island, When I first started playing this game I think there were only 3 or 4 islands & maybe about 300 to 400 dragons. I'm having trouble keeping them long enough to get the next island!😉😄😁!!",
        "Game would be great except for the fact that you can't do certain things without bugging people on Facebook for help. I just want to play the game. I can't level my dragons past 10 without building a special building which you build without gems or bugging people. No way to get gems other than extremely slowly by completing achievements which take days to complete and give 1-3 gems. Supposedly you can watch videos for gems but there is absolutely no place on the game that allows this. If your friends on Facebook don't play this game they can't help you and you are screwed if you truly want to enjoy the game. You can't win battles with level 10 dragons. You can't breed more than one dragon at a time without gems. You can't expand past 2 islands without gems. If you get the required gems to level your dragons past 10, then there is another super expensive building to level them past 15, and get, guess what, you need gems for that too. Other games allow in game friends which this one doesn't and that is frankly ridiculous as it's a \"social\" game. Other games allow other ways to obtain gems like watching videos or trying other games which this one doesn't. There isn't enough time to complete special events for special limited dragons unless you can get gems. Overall, the game would be fantastic if gems were easier to come by and you could make in game friends instead of having to rely on Facebook friends!",
        "Just a few gripes. 1st of all I LOVE DRAGON CITY. Been playing for years. About your survey, I would never. You ask for too many permissions. Tree of life....when I get a Dragon here comes the same Dragon adding up for hatching. Like why? 815+ dragons are more than enough. Why do u keep adding, adding, adding. We could NEVER get all of them as it is. Why more? Love me some Dragon City like a said in the beginning.",
        "THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! I totally recommend it to EVERYONE who loves addictive games and dragons. I find myself constantly playing this game all the time! I honestly feel like I can't say how much I LOVE this game with words. Again, this is the best game a player can have. Just one thing, I wish there were more ways to get gems instead of just buying 'cause I can't buy anything. So please make gems more easier to get. Also please make the islands worth less gems.😊"

As a mobile game it's nothing much, but throw this on steam and it would rival Binding of Isaac. All in all a great, smooth and challenging game! I definitely recommend it!",
        "Hay soul knight! Good game! The 4 player thing is a good update, but the next update is more of a hard 1 to think of is it? it like its has no more to improve :( But I have a idea! Why not have gun skins! Most gun games have gun skins! But its up to you to do it or not. P.S. I have tested a PS4  controller and it WORKS! Did u add it or is it a gust a random thing? Thx",
        "Five stars! I don't give good reviews  unless I like the game, with Google play that's becoming kind of rare so having a breath of fresh air like this is truly amazing. One thing that this game just different from just about every other game on Google Play is that it doesn't Force ads on you! Instead it will offer you an add for currency or an extra life, purely by choice not by shoving it down your throat! The art style is so old-school and I love it, not to mention that the wepons are insane!!! I honestly don't have anything bad to say about this, keep up the good work ChillyRoom! :D",
        "Great game! Very addicting as well...  But Multiplayer-wise: This game needs to be more optimized for slower devices in order to avoid Server Crashes/Lags, and also needs to improve on the Multiplayer Connection difficulty... Then last but not least, could you make a SEPARATE Save File for Multiplayer Games? Seriously, it bugs me when my friends and I save a game to continue the next day without being able to play at all unless if I want the Save File to be lost.",
        "I saw this game earlier back in 2017, but was reluctant to try it. Though I'm very glad I decided to try it out today, because the first several minutes were pretty awesome. The music on the title especially got me hyped to play. I'll probably be keeping this one for a while.",

        "Ive been playing for a year an some change an my characters the 4 star champions only hav 20 of them an as i progress it gets intense but the game itself cuts back on rewsrds especially the daily grind for 4 star crystal shards. ALSO worth mentioning that a year of playing an i cannot reach max rank on 4 star. Dont mention the 5 star champions. It will take you prob 4 to 5 months of everyday grinding to fully rank a 5 star or even obtain a new one. All the steam aside.  A great game addicting to the  higher levels as you progress",
        "The game is okay, but the drop rates are so suckish. I have opened 10 premium hero crystals  but have not even got a 3 star. My friend, opened his 2nd premium crystal and got a 3 star! Kabam pls like cancel out 2 star heroes in premium hero crystals and like only 3 to 4 or 5 star heroes inside. Oh and u can like gurantee  a 3 star in the 1st premium hero crystal, and also not force people to buy the 2 star hero crystal.",
        "The game is very uncreative. Many of the characters have same moves even when they have different powers... I advice to increase some moves of the players which should be according to their powers otherwise good game.  And also the drop rate is bad, upto this point I have opened about 60 premium crystals and haven't got a single 3 star hero or higher.  .",
        "Pretty repetitive. swipe back, swipe forward, tap tap tap, hold, repeat. controls are rather monotone which I'll slighlty overlook because of the nature of the game but I see a lot of champions have the exact same moveset. also the drop rates are pretty bad. And on arenas, the opponents bcome a lot more powerful than my own. Other than that, good time killer",
        "If you want to invest a ridiculous amount of time to save shards you collect in game to supposedly increase your chances for too quality cards then get yourself either duplicates of what you already have or rubbish class characters in general. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS GAME!",
        "I am addicted to this game. this game is awesome. But the people working in kabam are not good. They have blocked me from sending any messages. First of all I thought it was due to some bugs then I wrote a complaint to kabam. Lately they replied that        I have violated the rules. But I didn't do anything. If I really did anything wrong then they have to send me the proof. with out any proof and information they blocked me. You guys blocked me fine now send me the proof. Prove me that you really know your job. My name in the game is snsnns211187. Send me the proof. With out any proof you should not block me."

        "The ads in this game made it unplayable. I used to love this game and I downloaded it to try playing again and I would get minute and a half ads after every third attempt at a level. It felt like nearly every time I failed a level it would ask me if the level was too hard and I needed a hint. This game is incredibly obnoxious to play with ads on",
        "Well i would give this five stars but you cant watch an add to get a power up! And you should lower the ad mount of adds i cant go in for 10 seconds without an add popping up!! Overall good great game",

        "Look, I understand that you have to make money somehow, and ads are how you make money on a free game. But these ads are way too frequent and obnoxious. I listen to podcasts while playing games and every minute or so my sound cuts out completely to prioritize the ad. Earn the ad by giving me a decent amount of playtime before it and stop overriding my audio.",
        "I like the game itself but when you have 3 adds coming up after one game you hardly can enjoy the game. Super annoying, so if you download it for free be prepared to buy it otherwise it will drive you crazy!"

        "This game has been great to me forever, and I never had a complaint but this recent update has driven me here. The trophy cap is a real kick in the nuts and ruins the game for casual gamers like me. You now HAVE to advance through the games prestige system and keep resetting all your work just to help out a gang. And if you are in a strict gang like I am, they require 100 trophies a day. If I keep advancing, I won't be able to keep up with that. This is all a money grab by zepto now. They want you to have to pay to keep your machines strong so you can compete.",
        "I love this game. I have been playing it for a very long time. I play it every single day. I like the new updates however it seems you are getting away from the original game and focusing more on ultimate machines. Increasing the prestige levels was awesome but you need to also add additional upgrades with them as well. I have over 100 paw upgrades that are completely useless to me at the moment.",
        "Look this was a great game, worthy of it's previous accolades. Sadly since then it's been progressively ruined by an ever more aggressively enforced attempt to move to a pay to win model. Previously you could achieve anything in the game with a bit of hard work, then they tweaked it and you could achieve anything with a bit of hard work and team work. Sadly though what's happened is soft paywalls have been introduced, things you can't outright buy, but will only manage with financial outlay and change after change is being introduced with new soft paywalls and new ways to try and cash grab. The game is on a steady but rapid downward decline and to any new players I would avoid picking it up and investing your time in it now.",
        "Great game, easy to play and a good time waster. One thing I would like to see in a future update  is a scroll bar for the parts in your garage. It would make it a lot easier than swiping through them, especially for those who have a lot of spare parts like myself. Other than that, awesome game.",
        "This game sucks. First it is really hard to get good equipment. Then it is also very laggy. Everytime im playing the game it freezes right when im doing something. (Mainly when im customizing my car). Think about it when you are getting ths game to take up storage. If you'll excuse me now I've got a game to delete.",
        "I had a bad day but this game fixed it,... Well enough. I've bin looking for a good game to play for a couple months now but until, like 2 days ago nothing had shown its self to me or caught my interest! This game is 11/10 to me! For probably about the next two month!"

        "I rarely enjoy a game enough to write a review detailing the game.  I was honestly bored and losing hope when downloading this game.  Once it finished I almost didn't start playing, but I'm absolutely happy I checked it out.  I have just put over 3 hours into a game I figured I would toss, and I see no signs of slowing down.  Excellent gameplay, storyline,  controls, ... everything.  It had be a long time since I've been this impressed.",
        "Well the presentation may be awsome and definitely not what you might expect from a mobile game but in Terms of gameplay the trailer and the description kind of tricked me a bit. So as a reminder: This game focuses on combat and combat only while free movement doesn't seem to be possible. Just focus on a givn enemy and the protagonist will run to him automatically. Imagine the battle sequences of Assasin's Creed without the ability to move around and you have this game - but that's surely not a real RPG",
        "Well, just play today and not bad but nice work. Not sure about bug or something. I just need play more to get more experience about this game. Maybe I will cahange my review if there are something bugging about this game. Nice work btw.. Just keep it up!",
        "Update: FIX THE BLACK SCREEN BUG!!   DROP RATE SUCKS.  1 in 20 drop rate.   no free roam play, No wizard, cleric, only fighter.  An ad every 5 minutes.  Energy fills up way too slow so you have to spend gems to play.  Graphics are nice, auto play is a welcome addition but should be default to on.",
        "Awesome game!! Needs to be a bit easier to gain/find/aquire chest keys and cosumables to evolve. As is now ..the process of evolution of player/weapons/armor gets a bit dragged out and a bit confusing... Either way I love the game concidering Im not into role playing ones... Please ..if you (the developers...a.k.a. Masterminds of this game) are updating/upgrading this game..it works out much better to be more action less RPG. Awesomely beautifull graphics good game play ..which both that and controls are sometimes glitchy.. That aside Excellent game)",
        "I can't handle the bugs anymore. Breaks all the time, gets slow, never saves your game as you play so you will play, get items, use your energy and then it will break. You have to force close the game and open it again. Once in, you find that your items you won are gone, the resources you used to get those items are gone as well.... Please gameloft... Make your save work or make it more verbose... Losing all your items all the time ruins the game."

I just learned to play these games a month ago and trust me you see a pattern of where they go. I haven't played it one night. But then again I have never been jump scared. And parents if your kid is 9 or 10 and they want this game I say go ahead and say yes! One of the best games ever!",
        "It would be better if.... If you would be able to play MORE THAT ONE NIGHT. And when I used the flashlight I had to tap on the area a good few times before it actually worked. And no I don't have a problem with my screen.  I love the PC version of both the games, one of the best horror games in years. I'll definitely buy it IF reaction time on the flashlight would improve. I love the storyline and graphics of the game and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to work on night shift at Freddy Fazbear pizzeria.",
        "AWESOME I am in love with the 2nd game! It's scary and addicting because you want to come back for more! Fnaf is my fav game in the world and I make awesome fan art for it. (Instagram: Laughingsealey) I am saving up for the mobile versions of fnaf even tho I have all the PC versions. I love the graphics and the lore in this game! Actually, this is the only horror game I will play. I spend hours coming up with theory's and watching theorists make more theory's. Amazing game and it's worth the money!",
        "Great! Even though this is only the demo, it is amazing. Just playing the demo made me nervous, but despite that I am purchasing the full game. (Luckily) I was able to complete the demo when I played it, so I am a valid advice giver to anyone who tries the demo. My advice: Get the demo. It is great. Another piece of advice is don't waste your battery. I was able to complete the demo with three bars of my battery left. The last piece of advice I'll give is to keep an eye on Bonnie.",
        "Force Close I LOVE THIS GAME MORE THAN ANY LIVING SOUL!! And then it doesn't work!? It's an awesome game and I would never hate, but is there any way that you can fix this? And I was also wondering if u can make the demo free for the first game out as well. Thanks Scott :)",
        "This game is scary for me because purple man jumpscares me a lot and am 9 years old. Scott thanks for making it but I will gave it 5 stars if you put a warning sign that says that there coming. Also if you could make the flashlight with more power and make it go to other nights and hard. But this game is scary and cool"

        "This game has a short campaign to get in. This game is a remake of the original nova game.   I remember playing the game when it came out, the campaign was long with recording dialogue and fun and multiplayer had more map varities.  I wish this had more reasons to come back to it other than completing daily challenge and stop limiting me on many times I can do the campaign. It kills the fun and gives me more reasons not to come back to it.  I also wish that the multiplayer was more fair. Sometimes I get a match where my opponents has a more upgraded weapons compared to me or my team.",
        "You should let us preview the outfits and weapon designs even if they can't be equipped... trying will also temp us and we can how good it looks. I loved the game too much. This isthe best shooting game I've ever played. It is not that addictive as Clash Royále and CoC are. The controls are great and the graphics are epic...",
        "Graphics are really good and controls feel right. I like how your character fires the weapons automatically when you have the reticle over an enemy. It makes the game a lot easier to play for being on a mobile device. The game also offers loot crates and an upgrade system for your weapons and equipment. All in all I think it's a really fun game and they have done a lot of things right for this platform. Keep it up devs!",
        "You're complaining here even if you know there's no reply that are going to be received here.    Just give up rating this game. And if a developer see this and comment then he/she's likely going to disprove me with evidences that existed before they became popular.",
        "I played this game in my friends mobile and it was great so I downloaded it from play store. But now this game is not even starting . I touch the icon then Gameloft sign appear and then a video start . After that video start the description  of stage and loading appear. When the loading line goes half way the game stops. Please help me I want to play this game. Thank you",
        "Hai guys game is good. But i have 2 problem.

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I've progressed it's just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I'm not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "There is certainly alot to do, but is there really much to DO do? I've just been continually tapping red dots and getting free prizes, which (although nice) doesn't feel like I'm especially earning anything, you know?  Feels like a game that will keep you occupied for maybe months, but a year after you delete it will you really REMEMBER it? Probably not.",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend."

I think it might've been better than Rules Of Survival... this game is worth it..... it also lets you to shoot while your friends is driving a vehicle..well, only for duo or squad mode obviously....but what's more, you can actually pilot a helicopter..... nice...",
        "Great graphics with minimum config,controls are awesome  and it has dive button,can jump thru walls and climb windows,way better than the other survival games on phone,it has bullet physics! the only thing im concerned about is The lagging when shoorting from far distances,and id like to suggest a configuration for the graphics to adjust compatibilty . Thank you for this game 5stars! Your doing just great devs!",
        "I love this game and the devs reply to my requests in their official facebook page, thats awesome. One thing I wanna have here is voice chat. Definitely the best even low end devices can play this lag free. I recommend this. I don't know why they rate this so low but it's probably cuz it's not tha popular yet. Keep it up!",
        "I don't know why it got low ratings ....    I want to tell u thie guys..  ur game was absolutely great.... 125 players that impressive....graphics is good.. some minor buys ... plz reduce the sound of the heli...the most important thing is the render distance is soooooooooooo good.... i don't know how it's achived with in 180 MB .... I'm telling u this I really liked ROS....but not any more.....bc In here their is no such a lag and it can in any device... skill based  .. very good rendering distance.. the bullet drop is so realistic...jumping mechanism sooooo great and all this good things come with in 180 MB .. I love u guys.... GREAT WORK. keep it up....I really look up to the next update.......😘😘😙😙👌👌👌👌👍",
        "there are some bugs, that i knew the player is in the building and in his/her phone, but in my phone the player just float in the air its good for me to kill that player, but its not good if the player was me.  fix the building.  add or fix some features like: 1. the distance of the safezone in the mini map. 2. after automaticaly open the door, please make it close automaticaly too. 3. make the control wheel just by move the camera not by the direction arrow. 4. foot step is just too small. 5. make a gun fire radar. 6. make the animation of the character more realistic.  its ok to me if the update makes the game become 500 mb bigger than previous version.  i love this game. its run nicely in my phone.",
        "Hard to attack, easy to die. I already point the crosshair to the enemy, and when I start shooting, the crosshair miss the enemy and start to move around randomly, looks like I attack the ground, and end up died. Also, hard to find weapon and ammo. Your game is good, but not good enough. You are trying to fully copy PUBG, which is played on PC, while your game is Android-Based, hard to control. Hard to control. Easy to aim, but never hit, because the crosshair like to move around and land the bullet on the ground. Try to play Free Fire Battleground by Garena. Overall, Free Fire much better than yours. Uninstalled!"

        "I like the game its fun and engaging but the premium choices cost a lot of diamonds and you don't get a lot opportunity to earn them. 12- 18 diamonds for more then a couple  choices in a story to make interesting choices that wouldmake the storys better but you only earn 1 diamond a chapter witch you have to wait an hour or more to unlock or buy keys.  So you pretty much have to spend real money for this game to really enjoy it. Ill be deleting this app not worth my time.",
        "While the game is enjoyable and the stories are intriguing, it is way too expensive to make certain choices. There is absolutely no need for choices to cost 20 or 25 diamonds when you only get 1 diamond for each chapter completed.  This game is in no way good enough to warrant spending real money on it, especially considering the ridiculously high prices of making certain choices which would require making a purchase in every single chapter.",
        "The game is great. Great graphics, nice music, perfectly cued entrees  for new characters, amazing story line.... But they don't give you enough keys or diamonds. I mean, y s its understandable that the chapters are long but 2hrs for a recharge on keys? Really? Either make the waiting time shorter, give us more, or both. Now as for the diamonds, they give you 25 of them. But each special choices is always way to much. And you never really know when your going to need them for something serious. With that said either give us more keys, lower the cost of the choice, or give us more diamonds per chapter. Not like 2 but 5 or more.",
        "It's a brilliant app, though sometimes I wish there wasn't as many gem choices. I fully considered buying gems until I realised how quickly they'd be used.   My favourite story was It Lives In The Woods, though most of the choices are gem choices. The story itself is fantastic, and I love the diversity of characters.   I had a problem with a story playing up and after a chat with the team was told to restart it. I didn't mind but I didn't get any keys to compensate what I'd already spent (I don't buy them I just wait for then to recharge, but it did mean I had to respend keys on one story because of a issue out of my control)   Overall its a great app and highly playable without spending.",
        "Diamond choices come up way too often for how much they cost and how little you get. The keys have an unreasonably long cooldown to get them. Options like watching ads to get diamonds would be a great option, especially seeings how you have that option in HSS and HU:RS. All that aside its a good game. Lots of the stories are enjoyable and its visually pleasing.",
        "Great graphics and great stories. Right now they have like 30 \"books\", so there are lots of options. I've been playing since 2016 and the app just keeps getting better. Can get a little pricey for the preminum choices, but otherwise it's a fantastic app; very additive and entertaining"

        "One of the most addictive games i've played. My only issue is the firing rate of the main pistol,it's way too slow to survive 3 or even 2 enemies rushing you. Should make main pistol upgradable to at least increase firing rate to give u a fighting chance especially when u run out of ammo from the mini gun or saw because at that point there are too many bad guys ,and while upgrading the pistol,render a compensator or extended mag,filipinos would love that ish. Bottom line is ur progress after the first boss depends on premium weapons and they dont come fast enough,because the pistol is pretty much useless when there's 2 bad guys on the screen,and absolutely useless when there are 3 or more.",

        "Magdagdag ka naman ng ammunition, magazine or battery for Pistol, Rifle, Laser gun, Etcetera yon nalang pipick-up instead of guns... yong sa mga nabili na baril yon nalang pagpipilian sa umpisa bago sumugod sa raid or tokhang. For example mga 5 - 6 type na mga Baril o armas lang ang dadalhin then yung mga ammunition auto reload it depends kung gaano kadami ammo na napick-up. Salamat sa pagawa ng larong ito nakakalibang kudos to tatay game developers.",

Wish you can rematch if you wanted to though, and can't figure out how to play with your friends from Facebook or Google!! So far those 2 things are my only complaints for this game!!!",

Moreover from the two players challenging eachother, they require to connect to a common third party wifi instead of anyone player's mobile teathering... Please improve it..  Thank you..",

Not the Teamany many things to do and also KILL ZOMBIES. Controls are very easy., and you figure out more things thatr fun. The Music plays in background is a cool little Duddie! If you enjoy a relaxabole Zombie Day of Double Taps!",
        "Game is easy to control and the ability to change the controls to suite user preference is really a plus.  Spanky bars are hard to get and that should be looked into. Weapon upgrades are right in line with where they should be as far as cost and time. New weapons seem to be a little expensive.  Overall . . . Good game and good time playing !",
        "So far one of the best.. and this game is very addictive.. but there's a problem. Im out of gold now and i cannot refill the energy can i know if theres a way i could find gold without doing any payments please? Would appreciate if someone could reply and help out! Thanks",
        "Pretty good zombie action. Going to see how the missions etc unfold and hopefully more events and other actions appear.  I'm playing a few zombie fps games atm and this one's one of the better ones for controlling the sniper movement etc. If there are plenty of other actions and close up fighting happening I may rate it more on game play etc",
        "I played it for 30 minutes and I'm bored already. The zombies aren't fast and not realistic. And why do the shooter needs to shoot from a top of a building? Instead of making the shooter seems like a coward, make it so that he/she is on the road walking and moving.  Uninstalling",
        "Okay... So first of all this can be  really a good game. I have downloaded many zombie shooting games and this one, I personally found it better than the others. But... those time slowing bars should not be costly. You have to buy them.Money can be earned quite quickly in this zombie shooting game as compared to others so it is nice in that area. Graphics are ok, can be made better though. Controls are good too. If you do something about those time bars I'll give you a five star rating."

        "Simply wonderful app!! My daughter's speech is delayed and I introduced this to her at 17months. By 20months, we were hearing her sounding out the letters after it's repeated in the app and she has learnt to choose the correct letter when asked by the app. She couldn't get enough of it! Now we've moved on to shapes and colours that she's working through now at 22months. It's truly amazing. Thank u for no ads. Beautiful graphics. No issues with touch or connecting. Would love British English version tho where 'Z' sounds out as 'Zed.'",
        "I absolutely love this app! My child has learnt so much from this along with all the other apps similar as well. There are no adds which is very much appreciated with a 3 year old that will click on anything. I would recommend to anyone!!",
        "Please check shape matching. My son got little confused between pentagon and hexagon because in app it is telling pentagon shape as hexagon. Might be I am wrong.",
        "Amazing app for toddlers. My 2 girls LOVE it. I like how after they say each letter they sound out the letters. And for the other section where the \"a is for apple\" i think it should be the whole alphabet instead of just a few selection of letters. Because some times the letters repeat.. Like they're learning on just letters j or a.. Etc. Idk if you understand me or not. Oh well just my opinion but THANK YOU Also, for those of you saying it has bugs or its very glitched. CHECK YOUR CONNECTION. most of the time when that happens its because either your phone is sh** or you have bad service. Get on that WI-FI",
        "A great app love the fact that they included games for the parent LOL  I would like a continuous flow though instead of having to press the forward button every time  you're done with one segment",
        "2 year old loves this! She already knew all her letters, I'm so glad that I found this fun way to take her to the next step!!! My only suggestion is that it would be really cool if the praise word for completing a letter started with the same letter. For instance, when they write \"A\" the congratulatory word could be \"Amazing\", \"B\" is \"Bravo\", \"F\" is \"Fantastic\", etc."

But unless you're willing to pay you have to wait for quite a while to get to play again. All of the Criminal Case games are the same way. Never been so blown away by a game insisting on paying money like this before. Very disappointed!",
        "Great gameplay. Colorful and vivid graphics. Smooth gameplay on LG Aristo 2. Been playing this a long time, took a break and came back. Why am I seeing Ads every minute in the game now ?!?!? I've never had that issue before at all. Now its Ads every minute !!",
        "Getting less fun than ever.  Pop up adverts in game very irritating.  Reported glitches in game to get response to follow self help which i already did.  Constantly bombarded by attempts to get you to spend money.     Used to be a great game by now would not recommend.  Will stop when i complete in 6 levels",
        "this game is so addicting. the only thing I hate is that they don't reward energy anymore. No drinks etc. I just wish you didn't have to buy energy to continue . otherwise I love this game. it's a great time consumer when you are borwd",
        "I played this game for a VERY long time. Recently, the creators have made lousy changes, making it difficult to get energy to play and giving us adults some stupid, useless stickers. Most of the regular players feel the changes are to force us to buy energy. Instead, many people are leaving the game, which is very unfortunate. Advertisers take notice! The creators aren't listening to the players and you may want to seriously consider before investing in this game."

You have your own gym what if there is gym fill with other players witch can share skills and practice to keep In shape. This app has great opportunity to be the greatest boxing app. Thanks and good luck",

There's so much potential in this game, but if developer just thinking about money then please, just make this game a PREMIUM one..",

You guys update for the better or wanna shut this game down?  From 4 stars to 1, thinking of uninstalled this game for good.at last I uninstalled for good",

My phone is 3gb ram and the storage is 32gb still lagging even high end graphic game support.  Laggy after update.  Should update and fix the lagging then 5 star will fall down from sky",
        "Too expensive, package delivery is too long, training time is too long, a little bit laggy, the skills and items are expensive, dont waste this good game, make adjustments and consideration. I have been reading some other reviews and it was all negative. Please respond to the reviews. Hope to see some developments",

I have an excellent wifi connection that runs at 22ms at most and I am currently using Oppo F1S Upgrade. I have no problems in my other games except this. I will change my rating if this is resolved.

It would be a massive waste of time  P.s... Please tell me you're working on goku's new angel like ultra instinct form...",
        "Definitely hands down one of the best games to play on the playstore. The only thing I can honestly say that needs improvement is the energy beam blast (secondary energy blast). The beams should at least look a bit more bigger when they are bursted out. Just to really give the dedicated gamers a feel of \"Power Levels\", but other than that 👌👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 Great game/app. Thanks",
        "Slow combat but acceptable, but its pretty slow loading to next screen too. Also after defeating an opponent theres not enough time to pick up the dropped crystals unless you defeat them point blank.",
        "A little rough around the edges and there is no tutorial to tell you how to properly progress but once you figure it out this is a great little game and I can't wait to see where it goes. The ads bother me a little bit but I see what they are doing and it is actually really smart. In order to level up you have to spend ability points on powerups and to get those points you either fight enemies and get them via pickups on the stage or you can watch an ad to get an amount that builds up over time. They key to not going crazy watching ads is to just let it build up and power up in huge chunks.",
        "I will give five star add ultra instinct mastered. I loved this game. But can u make instinct sprite mastered as well. And in training why cant we selecte opponent awaking no.plz give jeran as well and ultra instant more awaking i will give 5 star",
        "I love the graphics and play. I think its really good for those who wants dragon ball feature like game for smartphones...but i think the menu need no be too much of animation maybe perhaps if its kept on color background pics and also the character selection be kept simple but lucrative. I feel the controls needs more refinement. Not jusy the basic ki wave ability but also one, two or more iconic abilities(also like some transformations). And also with more definitive saga like plot line and training session options. Another problem i found is that i can't switch to other characters...for me its still stuck to this Rayon character."

Now it's pay alot for over half of the new content and every new thing costs more and more. Nothing but a money suck and all the fun of Marvel has been sucked out of the game with it. Stay away unless you have $100 s lying around that you don't need. Shame really."

        "I was not happy with the way the game ended. I paid 3.00 for the game because I thought it was interesting in the demo part, but the ending really sucked. I regret spending my money on this. There was no resolution to the ending. Did the Fox die, who was the man in the mask? It just seemed to cut off at the end. There should have been more to have a finality to the story. I want a refund. I pay for a lot of games and this is the first that made me regret it.",

        "Wayyyyy over priced to get 2 short chapters. Not worth the price. Maybe $0.99 would be the logical point for how short and simplistic it was. Had I known it was going to be finished in less than 20 mins of play, I would have skipped it.",
        "great game! puzzles are very difficult, it really made me think.  i just hope all of the chapters are free. such a cliffhanger on the end of chapter 1  but if u have money. go buy all of the chapters, as for me.... uninstall coz i dont have the money 😅",

        "I think that the game is silly yet good!This game does not have another level of playing. I think that the temple ruins and waterfall and the other levels are the same!e but the description given to it is a little too much. The levels do not have anything more than just the same setting. I think that the creator of his game should've made the game in such a way that it has different levels and it helps us to get more bananas or something like that. But overall, the game is pretty good. Good job on the game.😁😁",
        "Towards the end it gets boring. One has to start all over from the first scene, every time one dies. There should be an option to start from other worlds as well. It is really annoying. Also the last levels are at times impossible, for eg. in world 6 almost all the vines are slippery and you never know when you'll loose grip on them, causing you to fall and die.  I like the option of watching a video and getting double bananas or the chance to continue. I also like the sounds although spiky plants can be annoying.",

        "Very fun and addicting game. love it. but the graphics could be better and more interesting. It just seems kind of repetitious. There should be better graphics on all levels. But still in all it's a great game!",
        "My kids enjoy this game however I think there should be an option where you can use your bananas to skip a challenge as some are quite hard to do. This will make the game better as it's pretty pointless without the challenges  Cheers"

        "Game play is to slow. Kudos on all the free rewards but the ads shouldn't pop up when you're trying to ask for rematches. Other than that its a fun challenging game. Also trying to line up shots on the 3D tables is far too slow. If you can fix these things I'll give you 5 stars. Thanks Pool Emporer",
        "Very good game!!!!. but I really don't like the cue stick Controller hard to aim usually time runs out before I can aim it just right , when releasing the cue it move just slightly but just enough to have the aim off.  Other than that I really think you folks definitely have a great game & I will continue to play.  P.S. you should make a Bowling game with your graphics and 2D & 3D (just saying)",
        "Honestly I enjoy and love those game. Closest to being able to play pool for when I can't get to a pool table. As well it's a game my wife and I kind of bind over and play together. However lately it's been glitching badly. To the point on ball break and switching turns the pause messes up the shots. Otherwise I've played this app for years and use to have no issues.",
        "Was fun till I lost everything had alot of money and gold almost had all the pool sticks now have to start from scratch should at least give a good mid level stick to reimburse the loss I understand  not being able to give out the best ones even though I won the Christmas stick and should have never lost everything to begin with",
        "This game took all my money overnight.  I had over 1 million chips yesterday all from hard earned games i won and this morning all i have is  about 100,000 please reimburse my chips because thats really messed that i have start from the bottom again check my ranking im number 9 in venezuela with over 2 million chips my user name is Bell@ please reimburse me for my chips",
        "You should make IT SO IF YOU LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY YOU CAN STILL PLAY!!!!!!!! I lost all my money in it. UN IN STALLED"

        "This game is awesome and I love playing it. Im trying to build a massive farm in the village. Great time killer and addictive.You can build anything. The down side is though, that if youre building an enclosed area, the villagers get in and you have to wait for them to get out so you   can close it.",
        "You shouldn't have a certain amount of blocks. Also you shouldent have to unlock everything except for the basic packs. The way you have to jump I am not a fan of I wish it was on the other side. Lastly is it would be nice to have doors,so the viligers couldn't get into your house. One more thing is I wish you didn't have all of these assignments to do to get money and diamonds.",
        "It's a okay game. Dumb thing though is you cannot craft blocks... you will need 10,000's stone brick and only get 150 every few hours. Developers and support staff are useless. You will have to spend money.",
        "This game is amazing. It wastes your spare time which is great. Just one problem. The blocks go down too quickly can you make it so the blocks dont go down?  Thank you!",
        "I love this game. When my sister downloaded it on her iPad i was sooo addicted to it and now i am downloading it on my own phone!!!! I really recommend to try it at least for once. If you will do so you will not be able to delete it easily beacuse you will be addicted!!!!!",
        "Remove the villagers plz i hate that they keep coming into the house i build and dont leave i have built 10 houses for me and they just keep coming in and its really inoying"

        "Can one also be able yo take turns??  I dont like it straight all the way to nowere. And brake should be fully efective one should STOP anytime he wants and also dont sale cars it should just be affordable by coins  Its really a gr8 game but only a little more work.",
        "The game itself is very fun to play and very entertaining, however, the points system is a bit off. The reason for that is it not about the distant (which I like about) it about how many overtake you can take in a single game. That is what I dislike about this game. Also the cars... Not a lot of cars (need more). Few questions: Will there be such thing as upgrade speed or car customization? Will there be special event like special map that the highest rank get some kind of reward? And lastly will there be a competition of ranking ?  If all the that happening in the future this game definitely deserved 5 stars .",
        "Basic. You have to over take cars... That's it. When they talk about the physics being like simulation they are lieing. Left right go stop. Poor 16bit sound that you will want to turn off. It's like a game from the 80s. Uninstall.",
        "The game is very good but I really wish if the score is for the overtakes as well as the high speed that will be a lot better. Also, I wish if there were more cars. That would be really interesting. Actually it needs a lot of work because it's very boring",

        "The game is Good and a good way to test your skills, Although it contains to many adds. Another good thing is that the game gives you free coins everyday and you can use it to help you out just in case you do not know the answer very well. What I dislike about the game aside from too much adds, It is an expensice price to pay if either you want to Reveal a letter, Tell the 1st and 2nd pic or skip the question. If possible, please make the amount lower😇 THANKS",
        "I really enjoy this game, and unlike similar games, bonus coins are given generously, so it isn't too difficult to move to the next stage. A slight irritation is that many words are specific to the American language, and there are some I've never heard of (and I'm over 60!). For me though, this doesn't spoil the game. The best of its type I've tried.",
        "It's a good game but having an add after every puzzle is a bit much. Yake a bit too much time and easyy to lose interest. Maybe every 5 puzzles wo ups be better I know y'all gotta make your money but the constant ads make me want to uninstall.",
        "Now that I've played it awhile its an alright game. You definitely should give more points for solving since they're pretty good puzzles. Only getting 2 pts for each solve makes you not really wanna play. Not enough reward for the work. Especially when it costs so much for hints.",
        "Since no one reads 5 star reviews I figured I would rate as 1. Great time killer during those boring meetings or occasional bouts of constipation. Want to take a break from your mind numbing job? This is equally mind numbing....but hey, play on your bosses time. When you see a picture you can't figure out, lower your mental ability to where it makes an amoeba seem like Einstein......from there you will get every puzzle. Enjoy",
        "Challenging at times, frustrating to, but not enough for me to uninstall.  I have a galaxy S8 plus, it's a good sized screen, but wish at times I could enlarge the pictures more because my eyesight cannot be corrected any more with glasses.  A lot photos are not common and the word is not known to everyone and my vocabulary is pretty darn good."

        "Initially, there is a lot you need to learn. You need to learn the controls first. I am experienced in playing air combat games, so I got handle on the controls immediately. They are not so hard. After that, the missions and challenges start. All missions from level-1 to level-8 are same, just the color of clouds change, everything else in all missions remain same. No interactive storyline at all in the missions. As the game progresses, you will find it difficult to survive with old and weak aircrafts, hence you will have to upgrade the aircrafts and equip them with superior weapons. This will make it easier to proceed further in the missions. But what after that? I have purchased the latest aircraft, I have equipped it with the best weapons, and I have very easily finished all the missions with 3 stars. What now??!! I think this game needs atleast a local offline multiplayer mode to play with friends. That way, even after the missions are over, it would still be a fun game to keep playing. Apart from this, everything else is good. Especially the Graphics and game controlls are fantastic.",
        "Great game. Addicting. Controls have a slight hesitation, and the graphics lack detail and realness. However, still a great game. Adjust and fix what you can and 10-20 million will come quickly behind. Daily login and daily missions keep repeating failure reports?",
        "This is a very bad game... don't waste ur data👿👿",
        "Needs alot more work guys... so many things can be added in th game but my main problems are  i can't collect ma daily rewards cause it's not allowing me to, And th planes are too hard to get... sure it has to be challenging but nobody is gonna wanna play th game non-stop just to buy a good plane to use... it's gonna get boring after... all fighters should have even a small amount of flares and diamonds and parts should be easier to get. I dnt see th point of putting a timer on th challenge mode cause it's not like we online or anything so take that off an Man me it easier to play challenges without having to wait on it to reset...other than that th game is good but please work on those... great job tho😏😎",
        "The graphics are awesome... It's kinda hard and that makes it more exciting... all-over it awesome.",
        "3 stars with notes! Tested on Smartfren Andromax E2 B16C2H in March 3rd, 2018. Gameplay OK. User interface OK.  Graphic OK (need to add option). FX OK. Tilt Control is useless (need fix/improvement & sensitivity option). On screen joypad is not OK (need fix/improvement & sensitivity option). The game is actually can be played offline, keep it like that. For next update please use approach like Gunship Battle 3D made by Joycity and From The Sea made by Masilgames, as example."

It isn't rigged to fail like so many games today!  UPDATE:  I've just reached level 1,600 and still enjoy the game every much as I did from level 1!  I honestly can't say that about any other game.  This is a great game for just passing the time, or challenge yourself to get 3 stars by studying all possible ways to complete the task.  YOU choose how much effort to put into it.",

I fully upgraded my first starter and reserve and now i have like 50000 in money and can't buy anything since it all requires gold not cash. If it was cash not gold i would give it 5 stars in an instant",
        "I am amending my original 5 star review. I am now giving this game 1 star due to the feature that claims to allow you to earn more gold. I tried a couple of different offers which involved \"a quick survey and email address\". This was complete BS. They were both endless loops of surveys and information mines, and never was given my promised reward after completing the initial survey. This is very dishonest and extremely annoying. So annoying that it prompted me to take the time to change my 5 star review to 1 star.",

There is a bunch of other awesome features that you don't even need to spend money on, so I myself would recommend this game to those who like this sort of thing!   Thanks developers, you're awesome!",
        "Servers seem to be stabilizing so I'm going to change my 1 star review to 3. This game would have been great if they used the same graphics as the story. In this day and age developers have made huge leaps forward in the department and this game doesn't show it. Its jam packed with things to do, customization and other things. If they update the graphics this game would be the masterpiece that it needs to be!",
        "Doesn't seem to work on my mobile data? I don't have high-speed, but other MMORPGs work perfectly fine on average speed. I get the error message \"Server Connection Lost (0)-1\" or something every time I load it, and have yet to get farther than the loading screen (where the current event pop-up comes on, after the download loading screen.) I was really looking forward to playing. If I can get the app to work (going to try online tomorrow!), I'll happily change my review! I'd really like this to work on my data, though; I don't have wifi at home.",
        "Fantastic game it takes some time to get used to the camera angles (It would be even better if you could rotate the camera around your character, it improves the atmosphere). Combat is ... Well it takes time to get used to that too that could use some improvements. Character design is good I like it Story is good also (Still progressing). Overall great game few small updates and changes will make it a even better game.",
        "Great game. It's a good port of the aura kingdom pc. It has nice graphics, options for auto questing and auto path finding for those who needs it, a nice story line, and it's f2p players friendly with the gifts from events and a fair eidolon gacha. Paying is not needed, but can be done if you wanted. Overall a nice game. I'm waiting for the next updates :)",
        "Just as a personal opinion, a 60 fps option would be a good  initial long term patch to be working on. Also you need to realize the fan base your working with, I haven't played the pc version but it looks like some of your fans transitioning from pc top mobile aren't very happy.  Also the mobile rpg type game fans are pretty hard to please initially, we've probably been through tons of other games with the same approach as you. Other than that I would think about how to polish the game up a bit more, maybe look at other games and see what elements make them look polished verses your own game?"

        "It's a good game but I'm still giving it 3 stars for two reasons:  1) Sometimes the shot you take doesn't get synced so even if you hit a 12 it will show a 0.  2) There are a lot of bots in the game. Often you will come across players with incredible records like 95% wins, yet they can't hit more than an 8 even once. If I enter Online Mode I want to play against real players, not AI.",
        "It's not bad, but you will have to play for about 3 years before you can use the female character.  Also, after the first 2 levels your bow will no longer work so you will have to buy a new bow. Problem is you are going to find yourself several thousand dollars short so you will have to keep replaying the same levels or spend actual cash.",
        "Controls are difficult. A small movement makes a big change in aim.  It releases even of you don't. It can get addictive trying to get past those challenges.",
        "It is a nice app I loved it I really loved. And the online game is must say it's very good and who are seeing  this comments please don't see just install . love this app 😘😍 good.enjoyed very much.",

I liked the opportunity of exiting out the app while my Tamagotchi is sleeping so that I don't have to wait awhile for his energy to refill. I've exited out of the app three times after putting him to sleep and three times, I had to return to put him to bed again. PLEASE fix this because I liked it before the new update.",
        "I paid for the starter pack which says it will remove the mandatory ads but guess what, ads are still there. Please do something about it and I will change my ratings.  Edit after reply* wow not even an apology for someone who paid. Kind sir, then please at least let your consumers know that there are actually 2 kind of ads instead of just simply stating 1? No Tom dick or harry will know that unless you state it. Good day.",
        "The only issue i had is the back button when tamagochi sleep. It make auto-wake state when i push the back button. It would be nice if even i push the back button tamagochi still sleeping instead wake up and also option for how long they sleep like 4,6,8 hours. I'll change the rating after the back button issue has fix. Btw the game is good, you should add adventure or something like that.",
        "Good nostalgia, awesome graphics but needs better execution. Allow optional interactivity with friends, for example. The main point of using a smartphone is connectivity. Make earning anything easier, this will increase the replay value. Your game will become popular by word of mouth, I tell you. Don't make it a quick cash grab. Think about how you can keep the game afloat instead of having to scrap it and start anew if it fails.",
        "I did a YouTube video over this app. Overall Tamagotchi Forever is fun. But ads and lack of things to do made this app a miss opportunity for the creators. I do like optional ads. But the ads at the top and in between screens are lame. Also for an app like this cosmetics are the perfect thing to add, but they limit the costumes to about 3 each character. Another nice thing that would've been cool to see would've been decorating your house & visiting friends. These other things would've made the app great.",
        "I can't see ur advise is helping me, none of them. Back button will appear after i press phone's back button. And it makes my pet wakes from his sleep.  And yes, we can collect all of the character but we can't interract with other player, we ONLY can collect and evolve them, not like in tamagotchi v7 if u know what i mean.  Unistalling this game"

But other then that its pretty cool! I've just started so I've notgonna do a whole lot yet. Went to a yellow area once but man so not ready for that.. Also seems like I can't never keep stuff to heal me or even find it? Keep up the good work!!",
        "Solid game, definitely becoming one of my favorites. Only thing I have an issue with, when we die, respawn us back in the zone we died at, for a chance at claiming our body. Also, a friend system outside of a guild would be great. Chat and trade would make encounters with other players more entertaining. Last thing, classes would complete the game. And don't just do three classes if implemented, do 5 or so. But A+ to the devs for a wonderful game!",
        "Great game, restrictive on recipes, needs to improve learning them better. Durability can improve with repair proficiency. Lower proficiency lower durability,  houses could have durability consistent to material. Stronger longer lasting. Anything and everything on enemies gatherable would be awesome, i.e clothes off walkers armor off knights. Environment growth above dungeons could be progressable. Never completed dungeon no growth completed many times a knight.  Fishing would be nice. Hire vendor would be great in player compound. Upgradable structures is cool. Learning them.",
        "I love this game, very addictive and fun. Few things i would like to see change. When you die you can not always find your body to retrieve your things or get to them due to monster. I uninstalled the sister game because if thia as it become impossible to progress when you loose all your best stuff. Also should include the add option to make energy easy to get.",
        "this game is very cool but seriously you really have to spend money to enjoy it fully.The energy system is garbage and walking from place to place is tooo long... seriously 24 MINUTES,also inventory space is insanely limited and it wants you to spend money for more slots. I understand you have to do this in a free game but please don't make the game unplayable becouse of that. I still hope this game will be better in the future becouse i enjoy my time playing it"

        "This game is a lot of fun get to customize some great cars . A lot of my favorites and i was surprised to see some cool muscle cars . Very unique collection of cars. This is actually better than their console games. Well recent carbon and most wanted are amazing. The newest are hot garbage. This one is fun.reallywish there was free roam or a sand box room where you can admire and test drive  what you have grinded out so many hours to get. Only bad thing. Also the boxes are too expensive leaving having to grind way too much just for absolutely anything. By the time you get anything good this game servers will be empty.",
        "Thank you for making this awesome game, I love it! I've not had this much fun playing a Need For Speed game in years.. Update 2.9.1 is fantastic. Although after updating, I'm having trouble connecting to the game servers... :/ Hope it gets sorted soon! nevertheless, I look forward to future updates. ;)",
        "It's a great game, graphics are ok, smooth playing. But. There are some ideeas that may do something different. Think about a chat room, or a place where players can do some trades. Think about adding the possibility for players to get vip points for watching videos, or maybe one day..open world gameplay. And there could be a lot more features. Thumbs up if you agree.",
        "The gameplay/races r so short. It takes less than a minute to finish it. And the police cars than u see in the gameplay don't even do anything they just keep going on on there own, sometimes getting to finish line before u. So basically this would be a perfect game for a three year old but incredibly boring for anyone over the age of 7",
        "I just bought a golden crate for 100 golds, only to get a muscle ECU uncommon part. Disappointing,  no blue prints. Even in a free crate you get blue prints.  Frustrating the reward system is horrible. Am never going to buy any golden crate. Players should be given choices to buy golden crate but you get trusted upon with useless worthless part. Otherwise good game",
        "Great game, accidentally spent 100 gold buying a crate I didn't mean to because they swapped them around in the recent update. Wish they didn't do that, but i guess I should've been paying attention. All in all love this game as far as an arcade racing goes."

        "Ok best game ever. I always dreamed of playing games like pubg or ml something like that but its just not my thing yknow? How its hard to control and super annoying to play. But this god this takes the trophy. Easy control, fun game play, get to live again after dying so no need to be sad so yeah well done gi",
        "Update: Game was fixed very fast and is my favorite game. Everyone should download and play this game. It's simply amazing with great graphics!!! Only thing is why can't we have a woman character? I'm a woman in real life and want to play one online too!!! When are you all going to add women characters???",
        "Graphics are good an Gun play is pretty fair. When battling the game goes on runs where I get matched against teams whos members are way stronger then my team an I. Then it goes back to fair match making.   3 Month UPDATE: The game has turned into a money grab. You have no chance to compete against players that drop a bunch of money an have 4 an 5 star guns. This was the top shooting game in my opinion, but turning it into a pay to compete killed the fun with this game. Havent been match fairly against players in a couple weeks now. I would recommend trying a different p vs p shooting game.",
        "Amazing game, however there is one small problem, but not enough for me to not give it 5 stars. Recently when I've been watching an ad to double the reward at the end of the battle, the video has played until the end and it says the reward has been doubled, but I only receive the regular reward? It has happened 15-20 times and it's getting slightly annoying, as I'm about 4000 gunbucks short of what I should be now. Anyways, thanks for making such an awesome free game with little to no adverts!  UPDATE: video watching for additional rewards does not work with anything. No extra crates or supplies",
        "One of the best fps I've played. Graphics is cartoonish but fun, Remedy is underpowered in the sense that it doesn't generate a decent HP on each hit. On lower levels, it's decent but on higher levels against Porcupine, Ranger, Thunder it doesn't stand a chance that could be balanced out by either increasing the rate of fire or increased health generation on each hit , Lifestealer is pretty darn awesome but could do better with a bit smaller crosshair and little bit more accuracy",
        "Initially the game seems super addictive but once you hit level 16 it gets ridiculous. You have players who have spent money on guns and you're practically no match. Also the teaming of players should be balanced out. Another thing is even if you win a match you win around 30 trophies, if you lose there's a loss of 60 and if by chance you're internet is bad and you automatically get kicked out and cannot reenter you lose a 100 .Eventually you get sick and tired of all this and the game gets boring."

        "I wrote a review already for my game on my laptop,and as I said I love this game but for some addicting reason I now have a new game on my new tablet I just got hehe. I am not here to complain and I'm not saying anyone else is in just wanted to let you know that some of the ads don't show up on the tablets you can hear them play but can't see them and as I said (some). I have managed my way around it through memorizing where the close (x) is just from trying to tap every corner but I would like not to have to do that hehe. But like I said I can manage, it's just that I know someone who would like to play but can't really stand that lol my mom hehe anyway I just thought about it would be nice if she could play too and it might help as well. Thanks for reading and listening and have yourselves  a nice day and night. Plus thanks for this game!",
        "I love this game! So much,very addictive and very unique!  I would rate 100 stars if I could!You can battle, feed dragons, do clans...ECT ! Every update it gets new things!  Best dragon game ever!You would love this game, just get it! And it's free!There are so many islands too! You can connect it on Google play to save the game or Facebook! The dragons are so cute!!! Please get this game! There are so many activities  And tournaments!",
        "I love this game so much but... I used to play this game a year ago then I got tired of it then I returned yesterday  I had a Facebook account that even has a legendary called Ice cream , so I signed in back half of my dragons are gone , my farms , my island everything that's why I rated 1 if I could get my account back I would rate 5 Thanks. Sincerely,  A Google Player ( Facebook too ).",
        "I love this game because is it active! I can play it all day and not get board! Keep up the great work everyone!😛😛 ( there a lot of ads every 5 minutes though. I don't know why. Pls fix that and the game will be even better! Respond to me as soon as you can! Thanks you for your time to listen to my opinion!",
        "There is an unnecessary amount of ads. I understand representing your sponsors, but at what cost to your customers? General game play is also very challenging for new players  as far as leveling up dragons, collecting coins/food, and even breeding times are ridiculous.",
        "Not for those who want a almost free game.  Of course the developers need to make money, but I think this game goes overboard.  In order to advance in the game at a rate that keeps you interested, you must pay.  Not very balanced."

And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.",

Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won't make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least"

        "Please add more cars and make the graphics more realistic, and make the sounds of the cars realistic, unique, and smooth. Make each car have its own sound, the sounds they're supposed to have. Add the car stats and add a nitro feature. Add the brand each car is supposed to have. Make the cars spit fire!. Add weather conditions like rain, thunderstorm, lightning, and windy. Please add cars like: Ferrari F50 GT, W Motors Lykan Hypersport, Ferrari FXX Evoluzione, Hennessey Venom GT, Bugatti Chiron, Ferrari FXX K, McLaren P1, Dodge Challenger SRT, Chevrolet Camaro SS, Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4, Lamborghini Veneno, Chevrolet Corvette Z06 C7r, Ferrari 458 Italia, McLaren F1 GTR, even the Devel Sixteen Prototype. Please add these cars on the next update!. If you can, add them in packs!",
        "I can't say I love it,maybe I can. But any way, this would have to be in one of top hundred games😀. There are a few things I would like added though. Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed this😀😁😀😁😀😁.",
        "I think you guys have messed up your game in the past few updates. Seems like there is some memory leak or something. After a while the steering wheel lags so much. Only the input. Graphics don't lag at all. Please fix. Also would be great if you could add some button to start and stop a timer in free mode so we can set time challenges for ourselves. I like the game but it is unplayable after a few minutes after the recent updates",
        "What you should improve is that YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ADD's I MEAN SERIOUSLY I WATCH MORE ADDS THAN THE GAMEPLAY. I ONLY PLAY FOR A LITTLE THEN MOST OF ADDS SHOW UP. I WQ5CH ADDS THAN PLAY8NG THE GAME FOR CRYING OT LOUD!!",

        "This has to be like, my 5th or 6th reinstallment of this game since there's no ingame reset, but darn well worth the data(little bytes). I usually like more realistic car games, but even the \"extreme\" warp in physics in the gameplay doesn't distract from the fun. These are the cars you'd want if you're trying to beat the traffic, run from the cops, or solve a parking dillemma. Great fun time killer! One thing though, the other reviewers are correct in their complaints about how often and when ads pop up. That shouldn't happen smack dab in the middle of a maneuver."

        "This game is fantastic.Incredible graphics, incredible animation. The story could have been presented better with actual audio, And the fights become quite repetitive after a while. I suggest that on the \"campaign\" the fights wouldn't be as repetitive, to be different, and not so simplistic. The character designs are marvelous there is no doubt on that. The gameplay and controls are ok besides the repetitive fights. The boss battles are incredible at best. If I would rate it from a 1-10, I would give it an 8. So much potential that can be well executed.",

        "Overall, the game is pretty cool. But, I feel much more can be added though. Great game. Just more needs to be added. It's a great app I wish the devs could make like, Sandbox modes where you can build your own... Em... Coasters? I dunno. You had to verify them first. Annnd in order to verify them you had to complete them yourself. Then you could publish them. And maybe a two player mode? Not sure how that's gonna work out. That's all that could be added. Most of all. 3 and a half out of 5 stars.",
        "The only way to play online is Facebook and Google play! First, you can make a 3rd option for an in-game name, like in Clash Of Clans,  and make the Google play account optional if you don't want to download Google play (not meaning that Google play is bad). Many people can not even think of any name that is not already taken in Google play (including me). It still is a good game,just it needs some more work.",
        "Don't get me wrong, it's amazing and seems to be fun, but there's one thing that ruins it all. Whenever I open the game, everything shifts to the right quite a bit, so I can't see about one fifth of the screen, which doesn't allow me to use the button control setup, and some other things. Would love to see this get fixed, as the game has some nice potential.",
        "As much as I want to love this game, its also quite cheap. Every single race, the same \"real\" players are always there regardless of time of day. They follow the same route and incredibly make no mistakes at all! Meanwhile, I'm getting stuck on every edge, my wheel gets stuck in the ground and every single gate smashes only me. Amazing!! Its a super fun game but don't think for a second that it plays fair.",
        "Love this game for the cool clip art graphics with all the chaos. Relly funny when they crash. Lol i just dont like the constant ads gou have to watcg when ever you have to open a prize chest and when you win. I mean you win and then you gotta watch a clip for 30 secs, then it feels like you lose. Lol",
        "Thankyou gor being creative i wish you add more challenge : crash crush. That is like just crush using vlad and rufus (example) and then crush make them crush so who is the winner. Using that game we can know who is the stronger"

        "I really hated this game at first, when i was trying it on a friend's phone. It has really grown on me since then, i love it. I've been playing it for years now and still love it; the graphics are amazing, the game play is smooth, my clan is great, there's always new stuff to do or new bots/weapons to acquire. Yes, there are some people playing that kinda ruin a battle for your team but Hey, it's just a game and you still get points if you lose. Do your best and have fun.",
        "Great start! No glitches. Performs smoothly! One of the best games on Android!! Must download Belive me I have never spent a single penny of \"real\" money and the game has never been unfair to me. Its really very good game. They found a sweet spot to balance both paid and free players. You just need to go on playing. I got the costliest robot of the market for free. Keep playing you'll eventually be strong enough and then you'll never stop to play.",
        "After being so long on the game I can see that the development team behind this game is pretty committed. I can see they really put effort into debugging, improving and renewing some elements of the game, I've decided to increase the star counts for War Robots (This is the original one). It's one heck of a game for mobile device I can tell you that. As for attaining the \"best robots\" or the \"best weapons\" in the game, it's hard but it's not impossible.  Just take part in the festive events... and you don't neccessarily need the \"best bots\" to annihilate your opponents...",
        "Supposed random game is not random. You only win the lowest prices until you start spending gold.  Black market is the same. Also it will take you a decade before you get the best robots unless you shell out your hard earned money. I hope the drop off scheme would earn me points, however it's just for one type of robot.",
        "This game is very much Pay to Win. So expect some people to crush you.  All the \"gambling\" games are fixed to make sure you get the lowest possible reward. Don't waste your gold gambling. All that said this game is worth 5 stars just for the gameplay. The graphics are amazing and the game is fun even when you end up against someone spending hundreds of real dollars on robots and gear. Be patient. You may not always win or do well but in time you can give all but the most hardcore spenders a run for their money (all pun intended)",
        "It will be cool if we can upgrade not  just one robot but all!! And pls double the gold I rlly need it right now for just 1 orkan And also why is it so hard to get a weapons like with puzzle logo on it it's like 10,000 can you imagine that! If I made the game I would do just 6,000 or 5,000! One more make a single player like player vs AI and it will say easy medium hard"

        "Amazing game, great time-killer. I discovered a game breaker: if you go into the settings after you die, the number of coins you got in that level, [the number in the brackets] becomes equal to the total number of coins. Keep going back and forth into the settings, and the game will eventually ask if you want to triple the coins by watching a video. Instead of tripling the number of coins you got in that level, the number of total coins you have gets tripled.  Instantly triple your wallet every run.  I want the devs to see this and see if they can patch it because I really like this game and I want the coins I earn to be legit.  Thanks for your time, Mike C.",
        "It has a progression system, but it's completely worthless. The only reason to try to win belts is to get weapons that serve no purpose. You can win most of them by paying 200 coins and getting a random one, but you can, for some odd reason, get duplicates. Not to mention the fact that coin combos actually do nothing, not even useless cosmetic items, nothing. I think adding function to the weapons (e.g. Making long swords slightly longer range or making small weapons quicker) could add more depth and more of a reason to play the game. Overall: It's a good timekiller.",
        "Great game. Best for killing time. Great concept. Need to add a  counter for counting the number of people killed, otherwise awesome. Also there is not much incentive to play to win belts. Make playing with boss again free. Add new opponents (not bosses but the minions) . Make the game a little less challenging. Also remove the brief stun completely",
        "Really fun game. Nice graphics and simple controls. More depth to combat system would be nice. There is no point in achieving coin combos. It does not affect the amount of coins won. Add a multiplier for coin combos, as well as a score multiplier for chaining combos together without missing enemies or coins. Don't allow duplicate items to be won. Very annoying to grind and grind for coins, only to get a duplicate you can't do anything with. Lastly, an option to pay to disable ads would be nice.",
        "The game gives you an unskippable mission to get kills with a certain type of weapon and then will never give you that weapon. I've opened over 100 chests and never got a two handed sword, so my options are pay real money for the the weapon (what they want) or delete this cancer app. I get you have to make money but there are better ways than stopping all progression and ruining the fun. Overall good game 6.7/10",
        "Fun button slasher. Ultimately stopped playing because I got a weapon mission and three random drops buying weapons with in game currency were taking too long to get a weapon of the right type... They want you to pay for them: lame.  Game is a bit unforgiving, especially when you get to boss fights. Once you fail a boss once it becomes much harder to get back which is a strange and annoying design choice."

I've restarted my phone, uninstalled and installed and nothing. It just sits on the opening screen, sadly I will have to delete. Wish I didn't have to but it's just wasting space on my phone now. Otherwise, I did enjoy it.",
        "Its completely pay to play. You have to use diamonds to expand your land, but you can't earn them. You have to buy them with real money. It would be a problem if you could buy a small amount for like $0.99... But the minimum is $10 Its ridiculous.",
        "I would love the game,if there was really something to do, no interaction,from what I've read this is a useless app.i got on after the update today,and my screen is blank except for my buildings,the scenery is gone,black! I am on a mobile and can't use any of the great functions everyone talks about. I can't even help my team,totally disappointed,that's for sure. And I've spent quite a bit of money. I am so bored.Theres only a couple things to enjoy on it.Come on ,why can't you get this game together for Android users?",
        "Playing on the phone app. I am disappointed that I cannot play the full version. I cannot send messages to my fellowship members, I cannot see their cities, I cannot participate in the events with my teammates. All I am doing all day every day is trying to build up resources for upgrades, and those are high compared with how much you can make. You cannot earm free diamonds, and many of the buildings you cannot get without them. Will rate higher when these things are improved.",
        "The game is beautiful, but its a bit to complicated. And the in app purchases are rediculus. I'd love it if you could actually advance in the games. There are just too many things needed to advance in the slightest. It's too bad cuz the game it has great graphics.",
        "Game is great. Love building games. Only letdown is that is pay-to-win. It would be better if non-paying players would have little more easy time with game, like give more builders at least... 😉"

    "description" : "This is a collection of singleplayer / multiplayer games which can be played by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or even as many as 6 players on the same device (smartphone of tablet). Each of the games has very simple rules and is easy to pick up. You don't need wifi or the internet because this game is for offline, local multiplayer.You can play the games with random people on a dance party, or use them as icebreaker in awkward situations like your first date. The app is also ideal for married couples to play together, for brothers and sisters, kids and parents, and for friends to pass the time. For some reason, these two player games tend to get very competitive and funny.Each of the games is a two player game with extra modes for 3, 4, 5 and 6 players. The more people playing together, the more fun! But if you have no one around to play with, you can also play alone in the 1-player mode to train your skills for your later victories when you play with your friends.We've got mini-games here with unique rules, but also re-makes of famous mobile hits. They are all adapted to the crazy requirement of letting up to 6 players play on the same screen. For example:- multiplayer endless runner- multiplayer birds with flapping wings- platform jumping game- 3-in-a-row with Tic-Tac-Toe like rules- crossing a busy road together- bingo- a strategy game where you send armies to capture castles (has nasty AI in single-player)- football / soccer (close to Pong and hockey)- a multiplayer version of the 1024/2048 puzzle- tapping only your own tiles- balloon poppingWe regularly add new mini-games.

I fully upgraded my first starter and reserve and now i have like 50000 in money and can't buy anything since it all requires gold not cash. If it was cash not gold i would give it 5 stars in an instant",
        "I am amending my original 5 star review. I am now giving this game 1 star due to the feature that claims to allow you to earn more gold. I tried a couple of different offers which involved \"a quick survey and email address\". This was complete BS. They were both endless loops of surveys and information mines, and never was given my promised reward after completing the initial survey. This is very dishonest and extremely annoying. So annoying that it prompted me to take the time to change my 5 star review to 1 star.",

When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..",
        "Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven't gotten very far yet. Thing I DON'T like is you don't get an average..... IF you do, I've yet to find where it is in the game. That's in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯",
        "The Game is good. Some things to improve it:  save your profile using your Google Account. Play with Friends in Tournaments (ie. Teams, Challenges), ability to givie Hearts to friends without using Facebook Also can you PLEASE improve the notification! My friend sends me Requests to Bowl & most of the time I don't get notified. Thank U",
        "Not sure how the currency works or how to upgrade my levels. Played 10 times and still can't upgrade the ball. Do they expect real cash to upgrade 1 ball? Also the controls are touchy, I've inadvertently chucked a few balls into the gutter while trying to align it before my release. Some tutorials would be nice.",
        "I did like this fame but my lane keeps turning pink along with the ball so I can't actually see anything like where the ball is going.... and on quick fire again turns everything pink and don't let me take any shoots what do ever.. think it's a glitch in the game I'm not sure but tried restarting the game and the same thing is happening again and again... on all the different lanes and extra games in bowling king...",
        "Great graphics and realistic feel to the lanes. Controls are a bit wonky, however, and purists won't like being being able to steer the ball after it leaves your \"hand.\" LOTS of attempted upsells, but its free to play features ain't too bad on their own, either. All in all, a decent little bowling game."

        "So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game",
        "A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job 'fun games for free' 👏👌🖒☺",
        "Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you're having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.",
        "I've been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn't force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game's development! :)",
        "Pretty cool app. I'd like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it's pretty cool so far.",
        "This is the most addictive flight simulator I have ever played. The game is fairly easy to progress through without having to spend any money. If I had to find one fault it would be that you can't reverse when on a runway which means some times you have no option but to crash your plane as there is very little room to turn around."

        "The responsiveness of the controls I  this game make it unplayable... it's slightly more responsive than the original sonic dash but it's still no where near good enough for such a fast paced game.  I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it's the same on all of them",
        "Way too many advertisements. I actually downloaded this game because subway surfer makes start over everytime you download it but after my next tech upgrade I'm going back to that, atleast the game not flooded with ads.",
        "I would give it 5 stars, I made an in app purchase to remove ads, but after the game updated non Sega ads started showing again and it asked me to make another purchase in order to remove the non Sega ads AGAIN... love the game, hate the ads...",
        "TOO MANY ADS!! Decent game but ruined by an add every 20s. Sonic forces doesn't have half as many adds as this game but isn't as good so looks like Sega have fallen short trying to add more pounds to their fortunes and made the game unplayable.",
        "Ads are back. I paid for a red ring bundle, which did remove them for a while, but they're back. The only reason I made a real purchase was so that I wouldn't have ads, so can someone please remove the ads from my account. On another note, I really like this, and nice to see Shadow playable again."

        "Ugh look people if u start playing this game oh wait if u had any sense u wouldn't. these adds are outrageous every time I die there an add I'm not even kidding. My dad rates tones of games and I'm the one playing some of them and I told my dad that these adds are so horrible I even had to report it. Now here me out great game but the adds. And in the beginning there is no instructions on how to do the game so like I said in the beginning there is a add at the end of every round so in the beginning there are many adds. Now i think there are more adds then game in this game. I'm not trying to be mean so don't go crying😢 to ur boss.",
        "I think there is to many ads like u have to watch a ad after u die. And then if u wanna continue u have to watch ANOTHER ad. Its just so annoying. But other wise I love this game. It keeps me entertained while I am bored or when I am on the bus on my way to school. But there are way to many ads and I hope u guys please fix that. 💜",
        "tbh it's a really good app! The only problem is that it gets a little boaring after a while (obviously that's my opinion) And I don't know if it's just me but there or tons of over 30 second ads.",
        "I like this game  very much cause you dont know what comes in front of you which makes this game more interesting. But 1 problem is there that the second i crash to any obstacle an add popups",
        "This game is the WORST!!! The controls don't work and there is not even demonstration on how to play. Also every time I retried to do it a stupid add came up. I AM FURIUS!!!! Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don't get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don't mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!",
        "This game is AWFUL!! There is no tutorial and every time I fail an unimportant ad comes up. What is wrong with you making games like this? Close this game down it is terrible. Just learn. Who would want to play a game like this you stupid idiot"

        "I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won't give up.. And I'm not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won't put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I'll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.",
        "Warning careful with this game!  It's ok....hard to win anything. I 've spent quite a bit of money in this game. In the last week ALOT!!!! Both my Husband and I play I explained I could no longer seem to win anything . My Husband played on my device and his own, same room same exact bet. He spent a big sum, my device lost he could not win anything at all but he win 6 billion on his device. We had club members play exact game we was exact same bet, they won big my device won NOTHING AT all. Seems odd. Be Very Careful with this game. I do not believe something is right. After spending a VERY VERY LARGE SUM you would think a person could win a good sized jackpot. NOPE. I will not buy anymore.",
        "This game is very well choreographed. I like the theme music it plays . I like the fact that it give lots of hi winnings. The backgrounds are nicely colored. Very  adictive games. My favorite\"ZEUS SLOTS\". Not fair, I'm not getting some of my winnings. I will take off a star for that. But I still love this game. Although I have been playing this game for a while, and it has improved alot. Now my favorite games are HERCULES, THE MUMMY, and the DIAMONDS SLOTS, and the FRUIT SLOTS. Now I LOVE this game. Some of the game slots needs to up beat the music. Some games are slow, sleepy music. I have always loved this game. Its a lot of fun. It keeps me motivated. My newest favorite game yet is\" WILD STARS\"  . However, \"ZEUS\" I feel that it need to update its amount of pay. And add different characters and music. Love the action😄. This is always an exciting game.😉Ah, always an awesome game.😆This is a wonderful game to play when your on vacation. Just awesome. I love this game, exciting wins. This will always be my favorite game.",
        "Enjoyable game, lots of freebies.  I now need to change up my review.i had made a purchase in the game during a \"Spin and Win\" promotion, that purchase stated that I would receive 10m chips for every 2k league points, at end of promotion, I did not receive any of my chips as promised per promotion advertising. I followed the process of getting in touch with Huuuge Casino and was told once that someone would be in touch with me, as of this listing I still have not heard back from anyone.",
        "So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.",
        "I have always been a loyal player at huuuge casino and can safely conclude I will continue for a long long long time. Why I said this? Simple - huuuge casino has such a wide varieties of games to satify all sorts of players. Huuuge from my experience not only practise fair play policy but also quite generous in giving free chips.  My plea to the great support team - please do the needfull to bring back Merlin Casino, Melbourne Casino and Singapore Casino. Texas hold'em held there were really superb and loved by many players. I don't understand why they vanished after maintenance works were completed.  My many thanks to the support team - you guys are good! Keep up the good work and CHEERS to all of you."

        "I love this game. It's very dynamic and the gameplay is good too. The only problem I have is every single time I do PvP... It pairs me with an opponent far greater than what I can hope to beat. Sure, that's great for improving, but it disheartens me and makes me feel like a horrible player when I can't even beat ONE PvP opponent, ever, while playing the game. I would suggest to the devs that the matching system be a little more flexible when pairing. Give us a matching system that will actually give us lesser prepared players too so we can have the fun of winning, as well. Also, I am disconnected every single time I do PvP battles and bounties. Quite unstable, unfortunately.",
        "Amazing shooter game, awesome hero collecting game, great multiplayer game. Definitely suggest that you at least try it out. But one thing you should look out for, it's pretty easy to sink between 5 and 20 dollars a week into this. Sometimes even 40 to 60. But, it's pretty free-to-play friendly if you can't afford to buy some gold.",
        "I really like the game. It's fun and has enough activities and quests to keep you occupied for a while. My only complaint is how they match people up for the PVP missions. Sometimes you get matched up with people with far higher power and Team level menu which makes it nearly impossible to win. other than that I really enjoy the game",
        "Super fun game. I haven't got bored of the game because there's always events going on which is good. One of the better if not the best shooting game I've played. I think there is a slight glitch when using Steele. Sometimes after I activate his open fire skill he doesn't shoot when I press the shoot button.",
        "Latest update definitely made the game harder. I used to run 4 gauntlet levels with little issue but now I can't get through 1 without losing people. Resurrected characters are completely unwelcome and unfair in pvp when you tell on kills for money. Probably going to uninstall, you're welcome for the money Hothead",
        "Starts off ok but then the pay walls creep in and you are constantly bombarded with prompts to spend money. The PVP is absolutely pointless, highest power rating wins every time without exception so you know if you've won or lost as soon as it picks an opponent. Needs a lot of work before I'd consider dropping any real money on it."

It does not teach your child to become a murderer.",

        "Educational and fun. Some of the gameplay has a bit to be desired. For example, in bonus area flags disappear as soon as they tell you what they are, so you cannot take time to learn them. Graphics are decent but style is a little dated and too ornate. That said, I still like to play it,  I'm learning from it and I appreciate all the effort that went into creating it!  So it gets a 5 from me.",
        "The graphics aren't the best and the set up isn't totally comprehensive. Some maps are so zoomed in that it's hard to recognize the general location unless you're already really familiar with geography. It could be more interesting, but the questions are good and it has helped me learn some.",
        "I'm extremely impressed by your app. It is not only fun, but it is the best educational app that has taught me so much! The border outline is the only thing that needs better graphics...otherwise I couldn't be happier!!! (An offline mode would make this app perfect) . Thank you!🙋💯💡👍❗🌠🏆💝☺",
        "Excellent game. Learnt lots. Ads frustrating but can be paid for. More frustrating is when you get to higher levels and constantly run out of lives. Find myself having to hang on 3-4 days between games waiting to accumulate lives to allow me to proceed further. That's why I have not given it a 5/5",
        "Was a great game, I learned a ton of geography. But now the ads are seriously out of control. Top players are really the ones who watch the most ads. Also, it would be nice if the encyclopedia allowed you to compare countries for a given category instead of only being able to view a single country.",
        "Excellent and really informative game. As someone who loves geography I learned a lot of new things. However I have just one problem to adress. Religion info on Bosnia and Herzegovina is incorrect and not updated, I've sent several reports but it is not fixed yet."

I have a really bad phone and it works great since the animations movements and card designs are all in the app.This means that you can use it for an hour offline and it will only use about 10mb. My only thing would be that it seems to drain battery life but then again so do most apps.",
        "Better than Hearthstone in every way except for the UI and friend system. It's also incredibly easy to amass a collection of cards, because this game shoves free packs and gold at you constantly. I gaurantee you'll be impressed with Cygames' generosity. The game itself is way more balanced than Hearthstone and has leaps and bounds better card effects and synergies. Minimal RNG as well. Give it a try.",
        "While the base game is decent, execution leaves a lot to be desired. Get ready to get matched with people way above your rank when starting out and get absolutely swamped. Get ready to have bad cards compared to everyone else already playing. Get ready to loose 5 games and win one making it impossible to do Ur quests to get more cards so you can win more than 1 in 5. This game intentionally wastes Ur time and makes getting free cards absolutely tedious to make you get frustrated to spend real money to buy better cards.",
        "Recently, after the latest update, the app has stopped working. It'll get stuck on “tap to play”, which really sucks because it refuses to work on my PC as well. I love playing Shadowverse and I hope I can continue to play it. Please resolve!",
        "This is great ccg game the graphics the animation the evolve and many more but this is just a suggestion to the devs. Can you make also 3 evolve for the first turn player since the 2nd turn player can evolve first than the first player and also the set of cards for the first turn player is also not sure if they can play it on the field.",
        "Down side is the online verses mode aginst real people dont get matched up with same lvl u are like beginner, etc..etc so its not really fair to beginner's. Should have a match up system for beginners and so forth."

If you want to play a game where a player repeatedly tells others to kill themselves, douse themselves in gasoline, threatens people, makes sexual assault jokes and literally tells players with cancer he hopes they lose their battle and just harrasses players to make them quit and even says that is what he is doing then this is the game for you.  Edit:The developers reply shows another issue with the game.  If they read the part where I said the developers have not been very responsive they would realize I did contact GM support about this issue.  They just have not done anything.  Nothing has been done even though multiple players have contacted them.  This is why they have 1 star review.",
        "Was really looking forward to playing this game and it does have potential, but it's so frustrating with bugs that makes it so disappointing. Sort the bugs out and you'd have a great game.",
        "It's a good game overall. The in game support is minimal to non existent. Your better off asking players for support. Its a good team building game. Like every other game like this it's pay to win but with strategy and a good team you can still have fun. Again it's a good game. I just hope they sell to a smarter company with better skills in game development and customer service (because without customers, you don't have a game) and then this would be an even better game. Give it a shot just get a good active team and don't expect help from customer service. Be careful buying packs and if you do screenshot EVERYTHING. Hope this helps",
        "If army men strike stuck to there rules, and didn't allow people making death threats, abusive language, to play, it would be better, I would not let anyone under 21 play this game as the explicit content in chat would lead to children learning much foul language and receiving death and rape threats.  Ask anyone in bf 62",
        "So many glitches to what could be a great game....slow on fixes....no lvl buffer so watch out for maxed out players who love hitting low players...be sure not to come to bf74 as it has been held hostage by a single player called Welpia and his corps ROK.....YOU WILL BE MISERABLE.....numerous unanswered complaints to customer support by numerous players....numerous players. May rage quit on this bf....attempts to get cs to act have failed....other wise a great game with great potential so long as you dont get stuck in a bf with one who calls himself Welpia or any corsps. Named ROK or Kor",
        "This should be called Army Men Drama Field... This Game is a Joke along with the consultants you have a better chance of getting struck by lightning than getting a hold of anyone. And it's like being in pre school you can get banned for saying a bad word 🤣 i wouldnt waste my money or time on this game"

        "I DONT LIKE THE UPDATE THAT GIVES YOU MORE TIME AFTER FORCE OF CARDS . IT ALLOWS PEOPLE WAYY!!!!! TO MUCH TIME TO COMPLETE THE BOARD. AND IT WAS MORE COMPETETIVE B4. I DONT WANT MY RANKING TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF LUCK.  +Ima a REAL RISK FAN. I have purchased everymap package available. Its fair priced and affordable.The new maps are too easy in my opinion. MAKE MORE MAPS I'LL PAY idc jus MAKE them MORE Challenging",
        "Time and time again a attacking army with 22 troops defeats a defending army of 22 troops and only losses 4 when the defending army is ment to have the upper hand . Also the game is full of cheaters with two profiles in one game so you cant win. Don't waste your money and time this game is dead there are less and less real players left. They dont care about cheaters just money.",
        "The algorithm used to determine rolls / battles is horrible.  After less than 200 games, I have lost over 20k troops, while destroying only 16k.  That amounts to nothing more than a piss poor design.  Unfortunately I paid for this app, so I am stuck with it.   Game definitely isnt worth the price paid.  Don't make the same mistake I made.",
        "This game is great but it could be so much better.   1. The expert AI is too easy to beat. Risk players normally gang up on an opponent, if they are dominating. There should be a legendary option.  2. It would be nice to have a match summary and timeline at the end of a game.    3. There should be an auto-save game feature when playing against the AI, in case the game drops out.  Edit: They seem to have addressed my third point.",
        "Very unfair, questionable dice rolls against computers, obviously rigged so that on single player you can never win, and then online it pits you against people who are expert when you're a beginner so you can clearly never win. Very rigged, fun when you get the chance to play which is once every 12 hours due to them asking you to buy the premium version. Highly unfair",
        "This is a very frustrating game. Every single time I play my turn (in a multi-player game that is) I get disconnected! .. and I've to replay it again .. only to get disconnected again! and so on and so on till my time runs out. Sometimes in the middle of all this 'replaying' I even lose my troops to other players .. VERY FRUSTRATING! And No .. I've both a very good data and wifi connections."

        "Amazing game! :). Please add Free Ride and Multiplayer modes with custom routes, and some coach buses. Add some NPC buses, street lights in the night mode, and make more passengers get on the bus until they get crowded. After that, will be the best driving simulator in Play Store.",
        "Its a good game and all, but what i think needs changing is the fact it doesn't have a restart button. Like if i wanted to restart i have to go straight back to the menu and go through the whole thing again. So if you dont like having to quit and start again then this game isn't for you.👍",
        "I love the way this game is progressing, but there are still some problems that need to be fixed. For example i saw other vehicles often crashing because they were going way too fast on the ramps, near the bus stops. And that wouldn't be a big problem but when i came across one of those accidents. I had some bad time trying to ho around it especially when other vehicles blocked my way on the other side of the road.   Overall i think that is an amazing app game with a lot of poyential. I hope that it will keep inproving at being as grate as it is now.",
        "This is the best game. Next time you update can you put a map of the world and then you have to choose where to start. Then do cities like canterbury and Dover then set you route and route number. When people want to get on the buses they should get in the front door. Passengers should ring a bell and get off of the back door or doors. And were ever your destination is everyone on the bus should get off. Plus add square speed bumps.",
        "Its OK , The quality is a little bit low but its a fun game and doesn't waste your time like other games. If you don't mind games with a little low quality and LOVES driving then this is the game for you .  Also if the company who made this game has read this comment then can you please improve on the quality ? Thank You",
        "Absolutely amazing. It's the best Bus Simulator for Mobile. Definitely worth making a purchase too to get rid of adds... don't buy the levels or you lose the fun of unlocking them... just buy the busses"

        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I still love this game! However I have yet to change my mind about the fact that it takes longer to vote just for 3 stars at a time, than to actually design the max of 5 designs per day. Can you not increase stars won per vote? Can you not make designs brief even more compulsory as many designers dont follow the brief and you just end up losing votes because your design is too colourful or eclectic",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget."

        "It s a good game , by a good company,many options (that many options that I have not tried each and every one!) But I have rated it 3 stars as:- no 1:- there comes an ad after each and every nail you design , sometimes even after every step you do! Due to that one star Gone and no 2 :-When you are making designs on the nail , you cannot make strips , hearts , umbrellas and stiff you can design with shiny nail polish , I wish we could do that also and now because of these two things , two WHOLE stars gone , only three stars left.",
        "Buyer beware, I purchased the \"unlock all manicures\" option less than a year ago, not only to unlock options but also to remove Ads for my kids. It's less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed.",
        "I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn't get me board everytime i have different desins to do.",
        "A really nice game which also got me hooked up! Nevertheles, it frequently and automatically shuts down, deleting what was there.....this really broke my litlle sister's heart, even mine. For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....",
        "Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!",
        "I  am finally at the final last level! Before I thought it was boring but after I reached some levels farther I thought it was awesome! And it is the best game ever! YEAH!!!!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💙💙💚💚💛💛💜💜💗💗❤❤ AND when I was playing my 1st game all things were opened but when I played in my small sister's tab all, things were closed! I got everything for free!!

They both show completed and say that they've given me the reward.... but they haven't.   I disputed it.   Waiting two weeks on one of them and one week for the other.  This is racketeering.  I've been hoodwinked.. bamboozled!  I'll change my my review after they give me my CASH$$",

        "I'm sorry, but you guys are basically obsessed with money.I know, people need money for their needs, but why make a game free when we can hardly do anything?I miss the Dr. Panda Chinese Resturaunt, the whole game was free!Look, i'm not a cheapskate and the other people who disagree with the prices aren't, but y'know most kids play these games, and their parents aren't wealthy.Just please think about my comment for a while.",

This app has some energy to sense love, friendship or even fun idk and what not? Well, when you get to kiss your girlfriend 4 times in 30 minutes, its seriously no joke. What's the secret behind the energies absorbed by the app? I wonder. Whatever it is, all I wanna say is Thank you 😄",
        "The dares were so unfair. Exampel: my sister would have the easiest dares like, choose someone to give you a foot massage. WHAT! Then(during flue season) they going to tell you to lick the bottom of your shoe! GROSS!  Or do a handstand for 12 seconds. I refuse to do either.",
        "I like this app because it has fun dares and truths. But one thing it disgusting about this app is after every two -three truths or dares the adds come and this is irritating.so if you stop pitting the ads every time then I would date it a 5 star. But all the best for you guys and make more fun app like this😊😊😊",
        "Its ok but I hate the adds however if the adds weren't on this app it would be a 5 but don't let me put you down. Carry on making awesome games like this!",

        "there is some thing you should know.That it need more truthes and more dares .And iam a teengirl so when I get truth they asked me do you love someone? And when I get dare they dare me to smell everyone in the house mouthes and socks and it's so boring it's not funny so don't install this game and its so bad I will never said bye 😬😬😠😠😡😡🙅🙅😝😝"

        "My favorite puzzle/physics app. After I reached my goal of 3 stars on all the levels, I was sad my conquest was over. Then I discovered a whole other area of the app that consists of user created levels to solve. Now I've got new puzzles everyday thanks to the active fans in the brain-it-on community and I submit my own levels on occasion by using the level editor. If you like solving puzzles this is a great way to escape for awhile and exercise your brain at the same time.",
        "I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.",
        "this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates",
        "I'm surprised this game scores so well. It's an exercise in drawing/scribbling, not physics. The puzzles are very one dimensional and most of them are solved by trial and error over thought and skill. It's a novel idea but given what else is available out there I wouldn't pay a penny for this game as it lacks innovation, originality and just feels very dated.",
        "LOVE this game!! Literally, I don't think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it's just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜",
        "A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it's really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it."

        "Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.",
        "There's always a bug when there's about to be substitution of players causing the players in possession of the ball to run like headless chicken. Pls fix that. Add SULLEY MUNTARI of Deportivo La Coruna to the game pls. 'Need FTS18 with embedded dream league soccer ffs! Seems many players who have their current teams in the game are missing. Lawrence Ati of Sochaux in Ligue 1, Joe Dodoo, and many more. A quick update with massive changes will be great 'cause the game currently sucks!!!",
        "Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don't get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a \"Create a Player\" option under 'My Club' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It'd be so nice if you add that.",
        "Look what I experienced. Dls needs development. The commentry needs more reasonableness and intelligence. The behaviour of each player, at least the famous ones should be unique. Controls need more improvement. Add real team logos for the opponent teams. Update players team data according to the recent transfers. And one more issue, while playing local multiplayer we need an extra device to connect two phones. This is a bad experience. If we can connect with each other simply by connecting wifi and hotspot of the two phones respectively, it would be great and simple.",
        "This game is awesome overall. But some changes could be made like adding German league players (especially AUBAMEYANG though he's moved to England) and when you face them leagues top players( in the game) you could add the legends like Pele, Maradona, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and others. Hoping to see these changes in the next update. Thank You!",
        "I will love it if i can send players on loan and be paid some coins instead of directly selling them off. Also switching players for a few or no coins will be great. Since players like pogba likes changing his hairstyles, it will also be great to effect some changes in some players hairstyle. More leagues are needed, if possible, German,  Chinese, Nigerian and south African league. Lastly, commentators find it difficult to call the name of a created player, work on these and this game will be perfect.  Thanks"

        "Edit: Fix the controls! Under the default setting the gas would randomly stop working, and while using auto accelerate the nitro randomly activates even when my thumbs are nowhere near them!  Runs smooth and looks great for a retro style racer.  I wish more devs would release games like this, the free game isn't so much a demo as it is a kind of shareware like they released in the 90s.",
        "Lack of game play is what gets me. Don't get me wrong, it's a smart tactic. Offer a free game with *just* enough content to get you hooked then push a \"pay for\" ad to keep playing the rest of the game. May as well call it a trial or a demo mode, that's all it is. Which it's a shame, I'd rather watch a couple ads here and there vs that tactic.",
        "So I downloaded and wound up buying the full version about 6 months ago. Was awesome. Outrun meets Cruisin USA. Loved it, beat it, 80% through trying to get perfect on every course to unlock a different ending mostly just because I want to keep playing and then it updates. Way after I purchased, a whole brand new set of course tracks. It's the best pocket change you'll ever spend.",
        "It was a good game. Too bad it doesnt open now after the update. It says something below the logo screen and then dissapears too fast you cant read it. And when it goes to the gear connecting thing to try to connect it crashes.",

But one thing that I don't get after I have downloaded it why do I still need to purchase it.... really that's not cool....if people found out about this they may end up uninstalling the app....if only you could give it to me for free."

        "I love it! Out of all the 4 versions my favorite is this one. And it does say 12+ but it really isn't that bad once you get use to it. I just learned to play these games a month ago and trust me you see a pattern of where they go. I haven't played it one night. But then again I have never been jump scared. And parents if your kid is 9 or 10 and they want this game I say go ahead and say yes! One of the best games ever!",
        "It would be better if.... If you would be able to play MORE THAT ONE NIGHT. And when I used the flashlight I had to tap on the area a good few times before it actually worked. And no I don't have a problem with my screen.  I love the PC version of both the games, one of the best horror games in years. I'll definitely buy it IF reaction time on the flashlight would improve. I love the storyline and graphics of the game and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to work on night shift at Freddy Fazbear pizzeria.",
        "AWESOME I am in love with the 2nd game! It's scary and addicting because you want to come back for more! Fnaf is my fav game in the world and I make awesome fan art for it. (Instagram: Laughingsealey) I am saving up for the mobile versions of fnaf even tho I have all the PC versions. I love the graphics and the lore in this game! Actually, this is the only horror game I will play. I spend hours coming up with theory's and watching theorists make more theory's. Amazing game and it's worth the money!",
        "Great! Even though this is only the demo, it is amazing. Just playing the demo made me nervous, but despite that I am purchasing the full game. (Luckily) I was able to complete the demo when I played it, so I am a valid advice giver to anyone who tries the demo. My advice: Get the demo. It is great. Another piece of advice is don't waste your battery. I was able to complete the demo with three bars of my battery left. The last piece of advice I'll give is to keep an eye on Bonnie.",
        "Force Close I LOVE THIS GAME MORE THAN ANY LIVING SOUL!! And then it doesn't work!? It's an awesome game and I would never hate, but is there any way that you can fix this? And I was also wondering if u can make the demo free for the first game out as well. Thanks Scott :)",
        "This game is scary for me because purple man jumpscares me a lot and am 9 years old. Scott thanks for making it but I will gave it 5 stars if you put a warning sign that says that there coming. Also if you could make the flashlight with more power and make it go to other nights and hard. But this game is scary and cool"

The updates are very slow you have to wait for a while if you've gotten to a certain level,  that sucks for a real gamers.. Hopefully they get around to updating new levels faster. until then I guess I'll download something  else like chess.. Hopefully there's no long wait for updates there!",

        "Matt seems like kind of an asshat in Season 2. She should just dump him. Could do way better. Like with Daryl perhaps? He obviously cares for her wayyy more than Matt does. Matt only has eyes for Lana. Like he says he loves our girl? I don't think so. I wish you could choose somebody else to date.",
        "Energy is too short & there isn't anything other than a side game for 100 more points to keep you entertained. The app is basically a story with a couple of nice artistic pictures.  Way over priced. You can buy a book for less at Barnes and Nobles and still get twice the amount in content. The the amount of money they ask for engery in this game is ridiculous. Don't be silly  and spend money that you can do better with. Just play for free or not at all.",
        "I think it's a good game but... Let's be fair you don't get to play for long each day before you run out of energy and have to wait 24 hours and even then it's only a few minutes play.... The lack of play time makes me loose all interest in what I believe might be a decent game",
        "So. This is an addictive store. The main characters are very well thought out. A few Grammer error and hick ups in game play. Although this game can be expensive if you don't make the right choice. I had bought the same secret scene twice and it still asks me to buy it. This is the second time this has happened. All in all great game.",
        "I find it aggravating that your energy goes down so fast. You get a few seconds of free play per day. I've paid to get more. But I can't and won't keep doing that when even paying for extra doesn't last long. 😒"

        "Really enjoying this. Difficult but not annoying. I recommend buying the basic starter pack which gets rid of necessary ads, but you can still watch ads to get more coins etc.. Which is smart I think. Gameplay is pretty fun and responsive. Upgrades don't feel unattainable. Definitely one of the better games on the play store",
        "There is a sudden difficulty spike in this game around level 20. Even if u have the best ship and weapons ur no match for the hordes of enemies. This is not right. Even after spending money the developers dont want you to win in my opinion. Dont know whats the logic.",
        "It's almost nothing without buying coins, u cant even win normal difficulty without ads and purchasing coins, how r we supposed to upgrade our weapons when every map gives u only around 200 and u need 20000 after a while for only one upgrade????!!!!!! Its graphic and gameplay is really good but like I said no progress in winning after a few maps",
        "It's simply too difficult to see when your finger is in the way.   Is there a fix? No.  Fun game. Too hard for my taste.  My $0.02",
        "Stuck on level 32. Theres no way past this level without spending some bucks (crazy prices). Hate the fact that there is no other way, but to  pay for the best upgrades.",
        "Well I can't be mental, I am physically disabled, only this body is disabled, but we can think, ask somebody mental to play pass level 21 plus, we  did pass 21 plus LEVELS.  No disrespect to anybody mental/physically disabled."

You loose the coin doubling upgrade that you pay real money for. Why must I re purchase some I have already bought. Why does resetting my progress reset something I purchased with real money. I feel that is a little unfair and even from a premium purchaser is pretty jading, I really enjoy the game and will change to a 5 star once an answer is provided or it is fixed.",
        "Alright, so the game is pretty good. All I ask for is more tricks, and the ability to upgrade some bonuses (coin magnet, feather hover thing, and the third one that I haven't grabbed yet.) All in all, if you could do that, it'd make the game so much greater. Apart from skipping missions and revives there's no use for coins.",
        "The thing that makes this game great is the visuals and the audio. It is absulutley beautiful and the art style works so well with the type of game. Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I'd very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there's a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style",
        "Echoing what many others are saying, the ads completely break this game. I understand I'm not paying for the game, so I don't mind being shown ads.  However the button to close the apps rarely function properly.  Instead of closing the ad it takes you to the download page of the ad being advertised. Update: I just had to sit through a round of a final fantasy game.  I wish you could rate below the 1 star.",
        "The game itself is fun and minimally challenging.  The graphics are lovely.  I felt compelled to give such a low rating due to the ads not clearing out upon completion.  I had to close the app and restart just to play the game again.  I would have purchased the ad-free version but if it's this buggy prior to purchase, I didn't want to get stuck with a pay version that I'm unable to clear out certain functions.  Maybe next time.",
        "I remember back when this game would cost money on iOS. I would literally try to download every single third party helper app just to look for this game. Now that i actually have a phone, its free. I think this game is great for both relaxing and competitive play. And I am so hyped for the Odyssey. I check often to see if it is there. 10/10 would recommend this game."

        "It's great fun!! My only problem is when I watch first position in events those fast bikes look really fake. I hope it's just how it looks and it's not the actual game physics when I unlock those bikes. My biggest problem is tournaments. They have different categories for entry cost but the high speed players can still enter and win any tier tournament below Thier skill level. They should not be allowed to dominate lower tier players",
        "If there is anything that would make me quit playing this game, it would be ads. I don't mind ads but ads are just way too much and take away the fun of this game.  Apart from that game also freezes sometimes and there are some glitches too.",
        "Great game. Only criticism is, when your racing with other players where there are lifts etc. They can bypass the lift and go over water like it's just not there. And like others have said during tournaments the leader is like 10 seconds faster and supposedly on the same bike. There must be hackers there is no way at all the bikes fly or hover. Come on guys get a grip on this so it's fair for everyone",
        "I liked the older versions of this game, but this one is horrible. There's ads constantly, any time you resume playing from the screen going to sleep, or if you wreck there's one right across the middle of the screen!  Every time it connects to the server, it takes whole minutes to load. Sometimes I set my phone down, the screen goes to sleep and then i have to watch another ad! If I was waiting for it to load an ad in the first place, I have to watch that one first, then a second one as punishment for the screen time out. 😒😒 Not cool Loading times plus ad videos constantly, equates to more than time spent playing. It's miserable. LG V20 on Tmo and 100Mbps wifi",
        "Bit hard to get used to at first. But when the bikes been upgraded and Machu Pichu opened game gets much more enjoyable and less frustrating. Smoth graphics with good gameplay. Any purchase gets rid of ads but at nearly £5 for cheapest purchase it's a bit steep (and you get very little for your £5). But, all in all, a very good game that's worth sticking with.",
        "Cherishable app! I love it, just some minor problems: - Has plenty ads and never skip once when quite competition.  - Its controls should be customizable.  - Partners' profiles should be viewable.      Thank you for your help!"

        "Enjoyable mental break. Wish there were fewer ads or at least more variety of ads.  Response about getting no ads with any purchase. This actually isn't valid as I just looked at each option to buy and none give the option of no ads. Plus I've made purchases and still nothing. I just updated the app and received the option of no ads. I clicked it and paid to no avail. Email has already been sent about it.",
        "Hi there! I love this game! Im on level1839 and my hubby says i have a problem bahaha. The only thing ive noticed is the levels seem to have stopped introducing challenges and are sometimes just not possible to beat without serious coin. But that doesn't mean I plan to stop anytime soon hahaha.",
        "I really love this game. I downloaded it for mindless stress relief in between classes and it has not disappointed. Some of the levels are really tricky, I think in an attempt to get you to buy more balls. But that's not too much of a complaint. I bought the full version and it's worth it to be add free.",
        "It's an ok bubble blaster game, it has a lot of pop up ads. When you beat one level and move to the next there is always a 15 sec video. If your not on WiFi this will drag at your data",
        "This was fun... Until level 100 when they take away the ability to switch colors of the ball you're shooting. It makes it too difficult. I'm missing clearing it by one ball each time so then I'm watching ad after ad to avoid restarting the level. It's really disappointing how much that one thing has made me abandon the game and uninstall.",
        "While its addicting its quite easy. I've gotten 3 stars on every level and I've played over 200 levels already. Ive only had to replay a level that failed 3 or 4 times."

It's pretty simple and easy to learn. Newer and f2p players have a bit of a rough go, but you can easily keep pace in this game for less than $100 a year.",
        "It's a fun game for a while before you will get frustating. Too much depending on luck no matter how good your deck is if you couldnt get the card to do your combo its useless againt an opponant that have better draw than you.  Also if you are free to play you have to be petient to get ass kick for a while till you have luck enough to get some useful legend card.",

You can be in a winning position and still lose because of 1 in a 10000000 chance of the oponent getting lucky. Even when I win I feel bad from winning because I know the oponet was unlucky.... It is very rare I get a game where I think. This game was awesome because we both did our best.",
        "I never even got to play. I have now tried to install 3x. The first two times the app became unresponsive. The third it caused my phone to crash and reboot. I have a pixel which should be perfectly capable of running it. If not then don't offer it for this device. First blizzard product that's ever pissed me off.",
        "Great game! Love all the really cool animations! I do have a problem that since I installed the game, my store has been closed 😐 I am installing it on PC right now to see if I can get to the store there. Game play is awesome though!",
        "Really fun game. 3 stars cause it closes very easily. If I get a phone call even when I dont answer the game closes.even on wifi it closes. Then it takes too long to reload causing me to lose a turn. This is the worst in arena because losing one turn will kill you and it becomes a waste of gold. Please do whatever you can to solve this problem."

        "The game is very good for WWE lovers. But there is some changes if you made in this game then this will be the most amazing game ever you can add this features  like . Buying a single super star with gold or cash we earned 2. Adding various types of championship  s like. Tag team championship or universal championship etc.  3. Divas & legendry super stars are not a available.   And last when I open the lootcases it stops on anathor item but suddenly it's change and give some other item.  Kindly resolve the issues    Thanks Team Reliance Keep It up  .",
        "I am in love with this game ! Can't stop playing !  But I would like to suggest some improvements  1. There should be triple repeat display in slow motion of special & signature moves. 2. Divas are not present 3. Legendary superstars like Rey Mysterio, Hulk Hogan, Rob van dam, Mark Henry etc. are missing 4. Gameplay can be more interesting with ladder, cage, Ironman, tlc types of matches. 5. Most importantly entrances of the superstars is missing. In story mode, only a single player to be selected and his journey should be displayed, improving his stats in between etc.",
        "Game is nice enough, but the  LOOT  is real LOOT . Its  CHEATING  to us. because when we pay 200 or 400 gold for 4 rated super start, why you have included 3 rated super start? Although it is OK with 3 rated start, but 2 rated super star why??? Its real  LOOT  man. ITS NOT FAIR .I am very much disappointed.    Secondly I think in 1 vs 1 match your should gift some reward for every 100 streak.",
        "Lags in between when the game is on. I go for defense but player starts attacking. Fix that issue. Also give update upto 100 mb max. Every month update is almost 360+mb & still the game lags.  Apart from it give an option of Make your own Superstar... Fight , Win & Upgrade... Fight against legends.   Also, once if I got AJ Styles he shouldn't be repeated again & again after opening another suitcase.  Fix it",
        "Love this game but the lootcases are so rigged hey its not even funny! For example i clearly see triple H next to Rick Flair but when u press close to them magically money or an item appears inbetween them. FAKE!! You forcing people to buy 3 or 4 star superstars and I waste my money if its this way!! Atleast its still fun to play",
        "The recent update is horrible. I can not play it like before as it Lage very much.Any attack we made on our opponents only his energy bar got full though my superstar has more rank.please fix this."

        "I m rating it as 3☆ because of the update of 3rd March 2018 . Before this upadte the game was too smooth.  Superb control.  So what if you want to know exactly what is the difference b/w the old and new upadte-   Cons -  1. It's difficult to kill now . Control is not soo smooth . So , if you are playing this game against any plyer who is on old version game he can kill u more times .  2. After entering the game 50% time u will see that less than 30 sec time remains to end the match in team-game .   Pros -  1. Impoved in graphics and sound.   2. You can get silver coins now by playing match and give vote for map selection.   So , I will request the developer that pls fix those lacks which I mentioned in cons . Because if you can fix it the game will be best online multiplyer shooting game on mobile .",
        "@admin, Please put in controls that we can Disable or Enable the autoswitch weapon when picking.. PLEASE. Because its so dissapointment  that whnenever i spraying my gun to enemy and theres a gun or a Bomb that i step in on the floor it autoswitch.. I know what i mean? Just Please put that into the controls.",
        "I JUST WANNA SAY BEST GAME ON GOOGLE PLAY GAME but after the update I am unable to connect with servers PLZZZ HELP ME OUT and the game has become cocktail. ... there is problem with servers..... the new sounds of guns are also bad..",
        "WOW. JUST WOW. I have never seen a mobile FPS as spectacular as this one, and I know it's a CS:GO Clone, but It's pretty gud. Just pls add some more guns and fix the controls. Sometimes they're unresponsive and I die because of that.",
        "Obviously needs a bunch of new skins. 1 skin or so for every gun is way too little. Also the connection lag is a bit too prominent. Otherwise, a great game. Maybe make it so that when you get duplicates from a case, you turn 2 of the same skin in for 1 other one of the same tier."

        "This game is so awesome. Everytime my sister clocks im on my phone she starts screaming then suddenly she stops. Why? Because i just gave her the phone and she's playing this game. Love it so much plz make another game like that ive got another sister whos 1 and is gonna start screaming too soon😁😁",
        "Amazingly Awesome!!! Dear Entertaining One,Your Game is Really Nice.But,if you can,please add more characters in the next update like Mommy Pig,Daddy Pig,Grandma Pig and Grandpa Pig because I want to see what they do,like Peppa and George.Both siblings oink or laugh,and that's why I want to add more characters.Even though I'm 10,this game is awesome! Again,thank for this game and God Bless You All. Love,Daylight Sunshine"

        "so the app works great not one issue, no lost coins no extra targets, however you cant purchase points unless you log all the way in on the console. another issue i opened a ton of packs thru the app and i get the impression that high rated cards will not pop on the app nor will team of the week cards and ones to watch.. if you want all gold mid rated players use the app otherwise dont bother on the packs.",
        "So it's alright for what you need to use it for. Have a weird bug where sometimes the Bio for my players doesn't work. Also the Bio gives the cards overall stats rather than the stats of the player for your club. Also the pack animation could be better. It's pretty lame when you get a walkout/board/IF or just a rare they are all the same animation. It would also be great if you could set up drafts from the app.",
        "A very very important app for its portability especially for market trading and the SBCs. Unfortunately as important as it is, eventhough the app is very useful, convenient and pretty looking, the difficulty for you to login every time alone has killed all the good things that comes with it. I literally have to update the app by uninstalling and reinstalling at times to be able to login again. This is bizarre, this is horrendous.",
        "Downloaded ok, try to open and it says app update must be downloaded, I try to download but update failed to download. Please try again but constantly \"Please try again\" Well guess what, this ain't gonna happen, app going straight in the bin. Waste of my time. Now I have wasted more writing this review. Regards Krankle.",
        "It's clean. It functions. Some controls can move with the keyboard and you might accidentally click a button because of it. Sometimes it tells me I don't have a FUT 18 account which I do. Overall, really nice way to keep up with your team and make changes.",
        "Plain and simple it has no stability, keeps rejecting logins, no trust whatsoever in the bidding process, utterly disgusted and sick and tired of getting emails to confirm codes, and answering to security questions. Not even pay pal bothers me that much. Needless to say my home bank app. Shove this app.. 👆 🍑"

        "I think it is a great idea for a quick game to play when you ate board but  way to many ads. Like every time I missed one of the pink things it would bring me to an ad. If this sounds really formal we are working on constructive feedback in school right now.",
        "Its a really good game. The only thing is, that I wish there was maybe some instructions that appear at the beginning, because I didnt know that you couldnt hit the black lumps etc. Maybe if you add little phrases that say what to do and not to do, then it would be almost perfect.",
        "Great time killer I love everything about it and it is a great game to wake up to. The only down side is that you fall off the ledge and that makes it harder to dodge the black. Everything else is 5 stars so that is what I think about roller coaster.",
        "It a great game but I have a small issue.    Nearly every time I open the app it comes up with this pixilated, almost, screen for about 30s. (I have a screen shot of it) it didn't do this when I first downloaded the game so is this something I've done wrong, my phone or the programmers? Please reply because other than that it a great game.",

The game takes you a thrilling adventure, and although the object stays the same I find myself never growing bored. The way that each new character changes the level is just awesome. Each character is well thought out and designed amazingly. If you're looking for a game to pull out in a waiting room, or while you're bored - then give this game a shot. You definitely won't regret it.",

But play store says that this game supports in app purchases. So I'm very confused! Can someone please help me out here??",

        "This game has so much potential... I started playing and immediately enjoyed it, they've got the game mechanics perfect, everything is easy to get into and the core gameplay is pretty fun. But simple. This usually isn't a problem because game designers usually build complexity ont on top of simple mechanics. Not these guys. The vast majority of jumping platforms, which is all this game is, are incredibly easy to do once you get the hang of it. And that's it. The game doesn't progress at all. It never gets harder. There are some trees and eventually a couple black holes to avoid. Like I mean 3 in the first 100 platforms. Then after platform 100 and something they introduce this drum symbol thing that you can bounce off of. Do they design jumps that implement these bouncy things in a fun and exciting way? Nope. You just go around them. I made it to platform 200 before I finally gave up. This is just lazy game developing.",
        "A great game for relaxing and honing your jetpack skills. It becomes a little boring after a while though, seeing as it's primarily the same activity over and over again. Otherwise perfect =]",
        "Such a great, simple, enjoyable game. I love the visual effects, the art team did a great job. Sound design is great too. I agree that the game is easy once you get a hang of it, but so are games like agario or *cough cough* all of ketchapp *cough cough*  Honestly the devs did excellent, even with ad implementation, all around 10/10 game"

So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I'm pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE 'X'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I'm triggered.  Please fix that.",
        "If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.",
        "It's good at first but you'll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.",
        "Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I'm not spoiling it, but I will tell you it's a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don't know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.",
        "Both my husband and I have this game.  I opted to pay for the no ads though, he did not.  DO NOT do this!  He is able to get \"continues\" for watching adds and can keep climbing up the levels.  I cannot since I purchased no adds.  I get to continue once and that's all since I have stopped ads from allowing me to get the extra chances.  I wish I would have known this beforehand. Otherwise, this game is seriously fun and addicting."

And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.",
        "Good, but has some bugs I'm sorry if I'm being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall",
        "It's good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn't too much skill involved but it's a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I've lost countless games because it doesn't stop or doesn't back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!",
        "Awesome It's a very good game, great graphics even for a bunch of cubes, but I also have an idea. You guys should make a game called smashy water, where we can choose from a wide variety of different boats that run away from boat police. Hopefully I helped you with my idea and I will download if made;-). You can work on the title if needed. Please reply:-)",
        "Excellent could use weapon pickup like smoke machine gun or oil slick.... A health bar which is unique to each vehicle depending on if it is made for speed or for just ramming stuff and an add health pickup... a bouncing red or blue stack of cash equal to a hundred dollars once action picks up and a 1000 dollar pickup after a ten minute counter for those who have gotten very good and lastly an arrest count down when stopped.... Sometimes you get only a breif second to get away other times you get like ten seconds???",
        "Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it's a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can't go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I'm out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!"

        "Awesome game! Only issue is on season 7. Race with save 8 seconds on perfect drift.... it says 3 laps but one lap doesn't count so you have to do 4 laps and you can never save 8 seconds. When crossing finish line game keeps playing and doesn't finish, time runs out and you've lost. Please fix",
        "The car will control itself... If you hold left it will turn left for a period but will start to try and straighten up... To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed",
        "Awesome Game... no need to spend money to get best cards you can easily earn them... Can play offline too... There is a glitch though in season 7 - save 8 second stage... even after finishing it wont give 3 stars and fails me.",
        "Good game, really fun. On season 7 the 6th drift game you cant pass it. When you cross the finish line it says wrong way and doesnt let you finish the gane to get the last star. You end up doing 4 laps, even with 20 secnonds still on the clock. Please fix the issue so I can complete the season",
        "Kinda hate the drift feature, like the car just auto drifts in the direction u turn. This gets annoying too since u can't turn normally when needed and the car just starts drifting, making u hit more obstacles. Graphics are good, my phone can handle the very high settings so I haven't played on the lower settings.",
        "Love the game. However, after finishing the race, an ad pops up and after closing it, the screen is all black and it stays that way. It happened to me a number of times. The stage is complete but I didn't get any of the cash rewards or the cards. Please fix this or at least give me the rewards I didn't get. Will give it a 5 stars then."

        "Not bad. Uses some pretty obscure words and doesn't give you bonus for a lot of what should be bonus words. Hard to earn coins because of this as you earn very few from solving the puzzles. Clues are expensive for the reason. TIP!  TURN OFF YOUR WIFI WHILE PLAYING AND YOU CAN AVOID THE CONSTANT ADS.",

        "Two things which needs to be corrected. If the game is played in silent mode then ads should also be silent. Second, it is not possible to check the meaning of the last word because the level ends as soon as you discover the last word."

        "Brilliant idea. Controls not very good. If you want to swing left it always swings right first. ONLY 6 STAGES. took me about 1 hr to complete. I really do hope the designers read this, Because as already mentioned 1/. More levels please... (lots of). 2/. More accurate controls please. This could be one of the very best  if you take into mind the Constructive Criticsm. I play a lot of these types of games so I know what the players want.",
        "It is a great game altogether, graphics and everything. But often when you hit a pole it goes through the car and you are stuck. If you are on the mission, you can just abandon it, however frustrating and annoying that is, and respawn. But while free driving there is no other way but to quit the game and relaunch it. And after I had to quit 2 times in 10 minutes, I just did not want to open it again.",
        "This could be a really awesome game if it was more realistic. Driving at slow speed over a pavement and the truch flips like it's having a heart attack. The other drivers don't have reverse gears so you have to reset the task. To top it all off, the vehicles get stuck some times due to glitches. Super annoying. Let me know when that has all been fixed and l will download the game again.",
        "After i finished reading all the reviews, all i can say to this app is that this is a very fantastic driving simulator,,i love the graphics the interior of the car and everything! I want to give it a 5 star but some features are missing! Please add some features to your app for the next update,,here are some features that i recommend,,,, Add some signal lights,,people walking around,,third person viewer can move outside the car,,then some building can be visit for shopping and buying different thing like a mall,,,can buy different cars and house,,,add gasoline station and bus station,,,and can use things inside the house,,,add different weather   and night time!!! I hipe you can improve your game through my recommendations,,thank you",
        "This game is good and best for one who is fan of driving diffrent vehicle😎 But i want to advice that some comments are wrong that if we swing right it swing left. Controling are good.It make always perfect turn.",
        "Great game. But one thing is I can't see the instruction on where to go when driving as there is adverts smack bang in the middle of it. Can Chang where you show adverts"

On tablet i am loged in with a google paly account, when i login to same account on my phone it doesnt ask me to download other chapters and i dont have any items or achivements. Is there any way to fix it or to make it work? PS: Its a realy good game, its my style. In MY OPINNION its batter than Shadow fight 3.",
        "Not the master. But I had got with the achievement \"thaught the teacher\". After defeating hermit now I am used to magic. Only in few minutes I can earn money and upgrade\u200b my gear. Such a wonderful game it is. Even if the meter hangs to impossible I can beat the competitors. Very nice game used to play it often. At lesiure time I think spending\u200b in it is the best. As you can earn  daimonds  by just watching the ads.",
        "I love this game. I've never been good at fighting games like Tekken or soul Calibur but this game is a very simple take on the genre. I love how very martial arts based this game is and the hit boxes on the characters are quite accurate and simple to understand as well as the moves. Being a martial artsist my self this game has given me an outlet to mentally practice distance management, fake outs and strategy as well as practicing to be like water. The famous Bruce Lee saying. Love this game. Also the rank up system and the grinding isn't too over bearing or tedious and makes it fun through and through.",
        "Great game, my only problem is that it took a long time grinding for the money you need to buy items. It took me about 5 hours of grinding just to upgrade each weapon/armor, 6 hours to buy new ones. Still a great game, loved the way it's in shadows, making it harder to tell who you are.",
        "Game is awesome. But for past 2 days whenever i open the game, it closes after intro showing that unfortunately SF 2 has stopped. Pls do something as i dont want to uninstall it. Also I hv sent feedbacks 2 to 3 times but no reply or fixation. Do something about it.",
        "I have been playing this game for over 3years now and I know how far I have gone with the game... Just lost my phone and I got a new one and... Google Play can't restore Me to my previous level.. Please fix because I can't just start playing the game over from the beginning.. Thanks"

        "Love it to pieces. The characters are loveable and the stories are fun. I got through three to four in a few days I can't put it down. The only downside is certain decisions cost gems. Major ones are fine and expected but to have to be a jerk to someone because you don't have enough kind of sucks a little. But it's not often and by no means a deal breaker.",
        "Actually, I came here because I'm a fan of Jakayla Toney. I'm a reader from wattpad, and I'm checking out her story here as game. 😂 Anyways, I finished one chapter and I'm enjoying so far. Gotta check out other book after I'm done. Looking forward to this app, though I don't really like the choices costing gems.But its okay, still like it. 😊",
        "Every GOOD choice involved money.  Hard to find one interactive story game that doesn't involve money so much.  I don't mind paying for extra bonus scenes in the end but at least give us some GOOD selection WITHOUT charging!  Then maybe I'll rate it higher",
        "I've really enjoyed reading All the Wrong reasons.  The author is very talented, a true story teller.  As I was reading I felt like part of the story I was so enveloped in the lives of the characters they were alive and real. I was sad when the story ended wanted to keep reading.  I was overjoyed when K. I. S. S.  came out by that very sane author who transported me to a whole new world yet again. I look forward to reading more from this amazingly talented storyteller!!",
        "I'm frustrated by the fact that this is supposed to be a choose your own adventure game, but all the choices that make the most sense to me are stuck behind a paywall, requiring me to purchase those choices with a currency called diamonds. I get the story passes, and I would have been fine if that was the only barrier to read the story, but to require you to pay money for making what you feel are the right choices is just greedy.",
        "The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the chapters update too late that you lose interest and sometimes forget what's happening in the story. If the chapters were to update on a regular basis then readers would feel the need to keep this app and will constantly play instead of playing the waiting game. However the content is good and most storylines get you hooked."

Me and my sister love to play find the phone but I turnt the application off (thinking that it would work in the background and you wouldn't have to keep turning it off) and put down my phone and my sister came in and scared me and I knocked my phone off its stand and lost it (exactly what this application is trying to prevent). I did manage to find it in the end but it took a while. This is an amazing app and would definitely recommend it but it would be ideal If it worked In the back ground and you wouldn't have to keep turning the system on and off but otherwise app great app :)",

Please inspire me more you guys have me crying because I love your game😅😂😭😢😿😹 and you guys did a really good job on this game",
        "This game overall is quite good, however it's graphics are terrible. I try to pick up the paintbrush and it takes me about 5 minutes to do one wipe of paint. Also, it is very glitchy and hardly ever can be played with enjoyably, since there is always a glitch that stops your game from working. I do not recommend this app for people who are not interested in glitches.",

The make up is cute, the outfits and hair are cute.  Its adorable and she can't get enough of this game so I am rating it based on her 6 year old opinion.  If she loves it, its good enough for me.",

        "This game activitly makes me angry. I want to keep playing it but the longer I play the less accurate my ship becomes, eventually missing EVERY SHOT, EVERY TIME. It feels likes the longer you play the game the less effect your ship becomes. It's a fun game but seems like a pretty intense cash grab.",
        "Decent, not good. Enemy flags might as well not exist as they don't fight eachother. You'll end up getting swarmed by every ship that always go faster than you, no matter how much you upgrade speed. They ram You constantly dealing damage but then take no damage from when you ram them. They also aren't affected by friendly fire. You can't actually aim and the constant ads are very annoying.",
        "Easy to play game. Good graphics. Controls can be a bit fiddly, but not that hard to deal with. If playing solidly for a while (30+ minutes), the cannon firing timing stops working properly and all shots miss (except for the enemies!) - restart the game and problem resolves, but a frustrating little bug.",
        "This game is amazing. Hands down one of the best games I've ever played on mobile. Also, you don't need to spend any money! I got to a fully maxed out ships without spending a cent. One thing you guys should add is multiplayer and different style ships, maybe Viking or something. Otherwise great game.",
        "Well I get the concept, but it's just not intriguing enough yes there's fishing, battling, etc. to top it off you get to sail in a really small map & after just 10-15 min I found it quite boring! Nonetheless just create a bigger more diverse map & fix those controls & this game could potentially be a 3 star game."

        "So basically I just sat down to play stick hero. And my goal at the end of the day is to reach at least 100 cherries. Same today. But as I start playing I don't find any cherries on my path. \"That is weird!\" I say to myself. I try to double tap to get cherries it doesn't allow it. So I go to the home page to see how many cherries I have ..... the icon isn't even there???   Despite that concern, love the game its so much fun ! For u people who are looking for a fun catchy game to play here is the perfect game. Please download so much fun and a great game to put on your device!",
        "Awesome but I have some ideas This game is awesome and it never ceases to make me happy. But buying new characters is kind of pointless. Developers you probably won't see this or even care if you do but I think that when you buy new characters the characters should have abilities that you use once a round for free or you can refresh the ability using cherries.",
        "Amazing game...nice timepass.. I love this game.. It is good for kids and I enjoy playing this.. The game doesn't hang and I can't just stop my fingers writing the review.. In the first level o thought it's going to be hard but to my surprise it was easy and smooth... And I loved.. For hours I kept playing it untilthe battery was dead!! The other parts of the game are nice as well especially the voice one!!! Do download😊",
        "False Advertising I mean, in a way. The help example is slower than the actual game. The platform grows faster and the guy runs across instead of the leisurely stroll in the 'tutorial'. Maybe have an option for speed, slower or faster depending on what the player feels like tackling that day. Still a fun game, but come on. We're not all finger-ninjas.",
        "Simply but satisfying It's a very addictive game. I think the little character(s) are adorable. The only complaint I have is when you grab a cherry and then you fall because the stick isn't long enough-in my opinion you should still get the cherry put in your \"bank\". I also like the watermelon level.",
        "An advise read it plz and writ for it if u like! The game is awesome , nyc and funny and chalanging too. but i think it could b more intersesting if we get lifes in it. for example my high score is 22 and i never get on 22 again i remain on 16 or 19 but if i could hav one lyf there i shall surely reached my high score or more...\"thanku\""

Too bad as it as the potential of being a very good. Not designed to let you play for free but wants $$$ to get very far. Uninstalling even tho I really enjoy playing.",

I love! just absolutely love it. The graphics on it are totally amazing to. Great game u have got here. So when r u coming out with more like this.",
        "There seems to be some bugs and balance issues. Example: level 4 you collect yellow things but none were dropping. Also when placing plants on pool the box for the choices disappeared and I had to exit the game and go back in then I could chose my plants. I have to tap the \"do it\" button several times before it registers. All in all though, pretty good game with great graphics. Looking forward to future updates.",
        "Damn, I cant stop playing this game. Its too addictive. You should put a warning sign upfront or at least write on the description. Now I have lost my youth, I demand a time refund!",
        "Oh it's frustrating. ..In 46 lvl when playing, no match 4 times in 1 time, again playing that lvl again no match 3 time oh!!!..seriously😡..sequence just going wrong way ..really disappointed",
        "I decided to download this game based on the user reviews, but there was one thing that players did not mention and it's driving me crazy. English is obviously not the language of these game developers and it shows. It is absolutely abysmal, both in grammar and vocabulary. Some of the statements don't even make any sense and since a storyline is important to me this makes Royal Garden Tales more than annoying. Please have someone edit the language!  The graphics are fine and the music is pleasant and I do like the creation of the little booster characters within gameplay. I don't believe I have ever seen this before and it's very cute. I love any game with a fairy in it, but Lulu is pretty annoying and there is some sort of glitch that causes her to constantly repeat herself. Time will tell, but I suspect this game is going to be uninstalled soon. I don't expect companies to automatically create games for English-speaking players. However, if a game has been created in English it should at least be somewhat accurate. If this was fixed I would be much happier with the game."

This was the case even when I had the game on my Galaxy S7 (it's now on my Galaxy J3 Emerge). Switch to a more conventional d-pad & action button config, already!! Otherwise, the game is pretty sweet!! Looks innocent & simple, but it's actually quite challenging. Better controls would help a lot, though!!",
        "This is a great game! It is very fun! The only two things that I did not like were these, No.1  You can not drive the ghost busters car! No.2 The ghost busters song is not playing well you play the game! Other then that it is a great game! I would defiantly upload this game! It is very fun!!! Ghost buster out 😉💩",
        "You should expand the game by making the existing map bigger, and by adding more maps. Also it would be cool if you added a drop to clear your traps, as there's a drop for everything else. It's a really fun, and addicting game, kind of reminds me of COD Zombies. I think it lacks a little advancement. I hope this game doesn't get lost in the mix like every other game with potential. It gets a little repetitive so by adding some stuff I would give it 5 stars and pay for this game.",
        "This is better for parents who want their kids to experiance the franchise. The game is VERY repetitive. The charicters hold the wand horribly, no origional voice acting or sounds, and below average graphics. Hardcore Ghostbusters fans better pass on this one.",
        "Couldn't even use original voices with audio from the movie? Also bad controls. I usually play mobile games with a bluetooth controller. Make this game better!",
        "Gets old really fast! And you confuse yourself with the controls as game gets faster. Over all it's not a bad game at all! Just needs some additives to the game, and maybe a directional pad and just 1 shoot button"

        "Absolutely sublime! This game is so awesome it's exactly what I want in a dragon game! Although there are microtransactions, you can absolutely play this game without spending a cent to progress! I have never ever payed real money to purchase gold, food and all other resources and I've played this game for almost two years The two tips are a little bit of patience and to keep on breeding. Even if you've already bred a certain pair of dragons, selling unwanted eggs is the best and quickest way to make gold",
        "Once you get to level 100, breeding a dragon is almost impossible to nil. Very frustrating. My roommate and I started this game the same time. I am level 115 and she is on 83. We will breed the same dragons at the same time, she will succeed 85% of the time on the first try, it will take me over 10 times if I even get it, this started after level 100. Good luck long term players.",
        "The events are annoying. I have reached the max on collecting eggs. I just gather then from doing tasks. Does that mean I can't participate anymore and am just stuck. I don't understand. Why would you limit the gathering of items?",
        "Have been playing this game for a couple of years now and I love it! Sometimes it's frustrating - especially when you'd need to buy something to be able to get all the prizes during events - but it just makes it more challenging.  VERY happy with the customer support. I had an issue with a gift not being added to my totals, so I emailed them and they fixed it without issue.",
        "The game is definitely addicting. But when I went into the Egg-straordinary Egg hunt island and tapped on a activty, it said their was a wonky spell and it completely stopped the whole game. I've tried different things different times, and it still won't work. I have played this in the past and the same exact thing happened, but with something different.",
        "This game is AWSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOme. I had 1023 gems saved up and then it glitched and now I only have 34. I love this game so much! Please help me get my 984 gems back! I don't want to rate it lower than 5 stars, but this has happened twice now...😟"

        "Honestly, the game started out being really fun. As players increased their skill level other players (such as myself) who aren't as skilled simply become \"cannon fodder\". My suggestion is have several skill levels available for those of us who are less than skilled. Additionally, have a respawn area where you not killed before even knowing where you're at.",
        "Definitely pay to win, and expect a huge difference at level 30, when you're placed against all the top level 70s... not that it matters a lot, when you can pay to be maxed with armor and weapon at +40 by level 30, and many are. Other than those points it's a darn fine game, and I've enjoyed many many hours on it... Edit: Game over for me. My best weapon got nerfed to the point of unusable, and with the added \"skills\" menu the game got way more pay to win. Uninstalling after years of fun. Way to ruin it.",
        "It is good but still once you are level 30 it is much more harder. The player must play with other players with higher ranks with their weapons maximized. It just frustrates me to be killed by a level 50 player with  Fn2000+35 upgrades running around guns blazing with high level armor. All new level 30 players must stick around sniper mode only. But the game is still good... But a bit less enjoyable.",
        "The great pvp fps just needs little update and make it easier to find people with whom we wanna play. and also plz add some new gears and spectator mode to see...  Overall great experience.... Thanx team and plz bring more things in the game...",
        "Worst game ever. Despite paying to play. It's hands down one of the worst game ever. After level 30 it seems impossible to even play a proper game without being killed after spawning. After progressing to level 30, the opponents are all at least 10 levels up with weapons and armor maxed out. Seems impossible to kill the enemies. Only if the teaming was much more fair it would be much more fun. HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED TO SPEND ANY MONEY ON THE GAME",
        "Graphics are average, gameplay is good until you reach level 28. Then it's a complete pay-to-play game. No matter how good you are, you will be trampled by amateurs who've spent a couple hundred on upgrades, guns, armor, etc.   After level 30, matchmaking will put you in battle with people 20 to 30 levels higher, it's despicable.  You can't last 2 seconds exchanging fire with someone after level 28, you've no chance unless you spend a ton of cash.  Way too many bugs as well, hackers can get in very easily, shoot you through walls miles away, become invincible, etc.   Overall, until you even it out, it's one of the worst games out there. Completely unfair gameplay.  Customer service is the worst in the app store. No feedback whatsoever. Game rarely loads. Will not update."

The competitive mode is also messed up as the opponent gets scores near impossible",

Because of slow loading it will kill your battery life fast as well. Please help to fix the problem and I will re-rate again. Thanks",
        "Even with a perfect LTE speed game struggled with downloading hunts. The game forces you to do certain hunts before you can go back to the ones you like and want to finish. Not too mention every other minute it forces you to watch an ad or tries to get you to buy something from them. I will be deleting this app once i finish posting this comment.",

I have the silver subscription ($1.00/weekly) and im unable to take advantage of the content im paying for  want a refund. The upgrades and new equipment are too expensive, the gear and parts are also too expensive and hard to come by especially for the spearfishing which is the best part of the game.. You certainly can't get very far without spending some real money. You can be killed by animals when the come from behind so you with your limited turning capability you have no chance to defend yourself. A lot of problems.",

I just had this idea for no update that on holidays sometimes the creators could discount how much you need to buy hearts and bannas creators, you dont have to do it. It's just an idea but none the less its a cool game.",

ITS REALLY FRUSTRATING!!! FIX.   IT.    NOW!!!",

The only problem that stops us from giving this game a 5 star rating is a small bug, on the fact that he can't get through to arronville which upsets and annoys him when the game crashes, please fix this problem as it would be a brilliant help to us. Thanks. Btw I would recommend this game , just beware of some small problmes but dont worry as they always update this app to sort these problems out."

You give them what they need and no one fallows up on it. All you get back is the same automated response. Then they remove your ticket. So if you have problems with the game don't bother contacting them it's a waist of your time. THERE'S NO ONE THERE FOR YOU. Can't get my account back. That's all I want. It's simple NO???????",
        "Another month, another violent smash and cash grab. Putting an entire LT behind a character requirement that 99.9% of the player base has next to no chance of getting with obfuscated \"odds\" that require one to spend 1000s of dollars for a \"chance\"(not even guaranteed) to get a character. At this point, I'm only updating the game to keep my reviews more relevant and higher weight.",
        "It's a good game. Awesome graphics, great gameplay,amazing superstar etc. But not good for free player because you don't get good superstar and rate of getting better superstar is very very low. Even some time in 4 pulls. I didn't get any 2 star silver card. Please make rare superstar drop rate more or I can't go any further in this game and make this game more free player friendly.",
        "Basically I have been playing this game over the past year... It is a totally addictive and 100% entertaining game... Only downside which has forced me to stop playing is that I have just acquired a new phone and attempted to load the game with my login details (for both Facebook & Google) but have found that I now have to start from the beginning again... I've now become mildly disappointed unless this can be fixed I don't think I will be playing again as I put too much time into this for me to start from the beginning again!!!",
        "It is my favrt game ever when i play this i stuck with this game I want to say something  now it's giving  too many ads and a problem  when I log out it says only one thing again and again that this account using on another device  but it's not real and what I do I am help less and I can't get new powerful superstars 😭😭😭😭😭when I open with cash he always give me duplicates.. Give some new cool events like wrestlemaina T-shirts..",
        "Love playing this game until google services crashed my phone and when I came back on to the game after having to reset everything, I lost access to my account. I have contacted customer services and all they do is send a pregenerated message that answers and resolves nothing!!  5 days and still receiving the same message back.. Even my faction leader has provided information to determine that my account is indeed my account and that I am active in his faction. But still SCOPELY send the same annoying generated message. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICES EVER!!!"
