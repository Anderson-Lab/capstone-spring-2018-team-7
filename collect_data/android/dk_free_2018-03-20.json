        "Wow! Great job on this mobile port. In addition it's also free. Download it! This might be the best mobile game I have ever played, with the best looking graphics. It's absolutely insane that this will run on my phone, but I'm not sure if I can run it on my computer. This is impressive and super fun. The controls are fine, but take some getting used to. If you added Bluetooth controller support, I would buy a controller just to play this. Good job guys  :)",
        "The gameplay is so great so far! There are stil a lot of bugs though, like mic doesn't work sometimes, aim and reloaded ui is gone, and I don't know if it's my phone but when I use 8x scope, the frame rate drops; like a lot. Hopefully the game will get fixed, and get optimized for low spec phones on a further update, oh and also a suggestion make the hud mini map a little bit big and also make the map itself hd. Anyway you guys still did a great job and thank you for this! :)",
        "I think this game is really good compared to the Xbox and PC versions of the game. It also adds a few other options for the game that aren't on the PC/Xbox version such as distance from your marker, dotted line to your marker, and it tells you how many poeple are in the plane. The aim assist really helps balance out the phone controls to keep gun fights running smooth and everything works really well. There is the occasional lag spike and stuff but the game works really well for my 2 year old Samsung  tablet.  10 out of 10 would recommend.",
        "Umm i loved this game on my pc but on mobile I belive there are some serious optimisation needed I am using a Samsung j7 prime and it can't run this game on low too. Means are you guys serious? You wrote that it works on Redmi 4a having a much less specs as compered to j7 I know its a samsung phone but we can expect a smooth experience at low setting I will change my rating once I get a smooth experience. Hope you fix it soon",
        "Nvrmind I'm starting to understand this game. It's not bad but could be a lot better. Still say u should get to keep wat u find. Unlocking is kool but should be only for better than basic gear. Just my opinion. Guns and melee weapons it's understandable to have to find them over again each game but the clothing I just don't understand y I gotta be naked unless I unlock crates to get clothes. Weird really.",
        "It is a super good game. Probably the best from all other battleground games, even fortnite. You guys should put a game mode where teams of 4 can conqure land on the map. And once a person dies they cant respond. Put checkpoints all across the map to be able to claim a section of the map. The only way to win is by eliminating every enemy or taking all the land. This mode will change the game play of pubg and will be another unique thing compared to fortnite. It is also something new and very interesting. Please take this into consideration."

        "Could be better. I dont like the fact that anyone can just waltz up to you and come in your house. There should be a setting that allows you to keep your house and sims private from other people. Also its a bit weird that if you tap on any sim without talking to them, they come into your house and do whatever they like without permission, even if you have a bad relationship with them. And it would also be nice if doors could be locked.",
        "It's fun so far! Can't wait to play more and see what else is in store! P.S. the sims, I wish they would not go off on their own and make doubles. Like if you want to make it a real life interaction type style, you should probably fix it to where the actions are more real and not computerized. I would like the option to do more with my kid sims, like more clothes options.  I also dont like the fact that when your sim retires, yoy no longer have control over them. Yhat jind of sucks. Alot...but Keep up the good work. Thanks!",
        "After playing for three days, this doesn't feel like a Sims game, some actions and interactions with objects are meanless, why do I need to use the toilet? One of the key factors of the Sims is to fill their needs, what are the needs of these Sims? It doesn't care at all if I decide to not pursuing one of the stories with friends, hobbies or career. And where are their feelings? Their aspirations? If I follow two romantic stories,  those Sims don't seem to be jealous even if I'm dating them in the same room! This is a game for the money,  not to play a simulation.",
        "PLEASE  HELP!!!!! So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning. And didn't really recovered my previous game. Love everything except for this.  P.S. i did the troubleshooting in the forum but nothing really helps.",
        "Edit: I just had my latest infant boy \"evolve\". My question is, why did you all give me a caucasian kid when my family is black? My other 2 kids are black too! I don't mind (since he's here lol) but this is odd.     I love this game! Already have 2 kiddos and a big house!",
        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much"

        "I think that this game is amazing and soo fun and adicting but the only problem that I would have rated it 4 stars is that this game only works with internet connection which saddens me because this game is my absolute fav. game I have played and I always want to play it. Keep up the amazing(A+) effort!",
        "The game is really addictive and fun. One of the best idles i've played. Good graphics and simple to play. The only problem is the poor performance. I don't know if the problem is my cellphone, but i think the game could use a little bit of an optimization.",
        "Sent email to devs over a week ago asking a question. No reply. Disappointing. Also the fact that there are no videos so unable to use the spinning wheel. Otherwise a mostly good game.",
        "Google keeps crashing. Even if you press stop it still pops ups every 10 seconds and the game takes ages to load and prestidge using an S7. Will increase stars if fixed as a good game otherwise.",
        "Lo      What the hell are you doing today and then I have to play a lot to do with the son I will call u in the garage for parkour now I'm a little Italy for you and I will call u after shcool you have a good night sleep oh I thought it would be fun with the kids and I will end you will be able to get a email from the other day but I didn't know if it would help me to get",
        "Fun game can you make things less expencive though i know it is ment to cost allot but it takes a while to get money i love the graphics and the controles my rating is a big fat five well done and keep updating us on new things!#LOVEGAME"

Not sure why that happen. Also don't like how you have a truck and the grass and or sand will slow you down. Also wish there were more color options for your vehicles. Other than that its a fun and addicting game.",

Not cool at all. Once or twice is whatever, but its happened at least a dozen times. Please fix this!!  Just dropped my rating again because its getting worse! Idk if its people cheating or what but this is ruining the game! The race rankings are a complete lottery, doesn't matter what place you come in because its gonna change... For the worse. Had it with this.",
        "Well it's ok but you are always underpowered I literally but the next 2!! Cars and I couldn't even get in 2nd place it's ridiculous I mean come on and I wasn't even up against real people it was bots. And the ramps using nitro on them is a deathtrap and the driving is Soo weird.",

        "What have you done?!! This was a great game with a few annoying adverts, now it's just one long advert interspersed with occasional races. I have no real issue with adverts but when they stick on the screen and hide the X until way after the timer ends that's just offensive. And seriously - £8.99 PER MONTH to clear ads? (Yes I know you get extras) - come on that's taking the ****",
        "Really fun casual game. Adverts are present but not too intrusive. Allowed to watch adverts in exchange for upgrades or items.   My only criticism is that it takes a while to get used to the different menu items as there's no instructions and the \"see as far as you can go\" sections are really expensive to unlock.",
        "Fix the damn gas pedal. The reason why I lose half my races cause the gas pedal just magical doesn't want to read my finger but the brake sure does work just fine. Keep shoving ads down my throat and it'll be all 1 star.",
        "Money greedy game. You will end up watching ads every minute. You will be forced to watch half a minute irrelevent ads every minute. It's like these guys built the best game to annoy people with ads. Good luck. Played several levels just to get annoyed and uninstall.",
        "I've been playing this game for a long time and love it. The only annoying Thing is that in some challenges. Even if I come first or second. It deduct point and I didn't even loose. Which is starting to become very annoying"

        "I absolutely love this game. I make it a point to not spend money on mobile games cus they typically turn out to be a cash trap, but this was just like buying a regular video game. No adds, and even before buying the full game it doesn't shove \"buy our product\" notifications down your throat. Nintendo has always had good games and I have no doubts that I will keep playing this every day.",
        "Awesome update! Make the game worth again, when it seems Nintendo had abandoned Super Mario Run, they back and release more content for the half of the price. This is the kind of update I was waiting for, once I didn't paid the game yet, I think this could be a great time to purchase. Probably in the future they will release more content, but the price will back to 9.99, so the best time to purchase is now! Great job Nintendo, I love your games since my childhood.",
        "Was pretty short to begin with but Nintendo has supported this game well, adding additional content, even a new mode. The simplified game mechanics to fit Mario gaming on a phone work great and feel natural. The story with it's additional challenges to open new courses are fun, toad run is addictive, the remix 10 is somewhat redundant content wise but also good. I'd rather pay $10 up front than have in-game purchases, the reception to this game indicates that I'm very much in the minority on that. Great game, very fun for a quick session of Mario.",
        "Awesome and all, but you only get 4 levels for free. To go to world 2, WHY IN THE UNIVERSAL WORLD RIGHT HERE IN A CITY (lol😀) DO YOU HAVE TO BUY WORLD 2, 3, 4, 5, AND 6? TALK ABOUT A RIPOFF! 😞 (Warning to Nintendo: If you dont fix this soon, I'm deleting. Sorry!)",
        "Favorite game. It has a one time cost for full version and not a monthly fee or several different things you have to buy to enjoy it. I like the updates with the remix, and the star courses. I didnt like that there was so little to do before I bought it. I got bored quick. But was surprised by the cost, and love it after buying it. I do wish we could see our friends land and share things we don't need and give rally tickets to others.",
        "This is just proof Nintendo can make amazing games no matter the platform. All the bad reviews are people's mad you gotta pay for the game. Lol wut? It's a great time killer made  by the best gaming company in the world and you're mad it's not free? Funny. There's no IAP.  It's not pay to win. But it is the most fun 5$ will ever buy you."

        "Fun game. I would like to see an update that includes sounds effects, music etc. I would also like to see different characters to choose from and/or customization of the character(s). Overall, good job.(Edit**) Great job on the addition of new content with the last update, however with this latest update the game will glitch. The glitch makes the ball not land and resets the game to the pitching of the ball.",
        "I liked the game before. I did pay to remove ads. The game was simple and fun. However the current update has the game broken. The ability to get new characters is a nice addition but the game at higher levels is unplayable. The game keeps resetting because the ball is hit so hard and high it goes out of the playable area even if you hit it \"perfect\" once this issue is fixed I will adjust my review",
        "Fun off the bat... But then it slows down to a brutal snails pace. It's a great concept, it just needs a lot more updates!  *Slow claps* great work on the \"updates\". I shouldn't have updates in parenthesis.. The characters are cool, leveling is also a cool touch, and a whopping 7 new bats? Killing it!..? But come on, way to go extreme overboard on the speed! All the other bad reviews cover it better. I just wanted to also sarcastically congratulate your update.",
        "pretty good game, glad they're updating it and adding in more bats. I play it when I'm waiting at the airport. the new update sped things up, made it really buggy. resets your hits at 44000 M and isn't really playable at this point, hopefully it's fixed soon",
        "Latest update totally destroyed the game. Even using the basic bat hitting it perfectly straight it takes the ball 2 seconds to fly 100,000 meters and then the game resets back to swing again. Without even getting to actually make any currency for upgrades",
        "UPDATE: Every time I hit, the game resets it's self. I hit the ball the meters get up above 80k and then the screen goes black and then I'm back at the plate.   Any upgrades coming soon? I have all the bats and am over 30,000 meters. Need some more upgrades."

Because when I click the restart button then click the screen I would always end up behind the starting point even though I didn't move yet I die immediately why is that? pls fix it, everyone who played this game of yours would appreciate that.☺️😉 (btw I kept on dying on the first part of the game because of that so....I deleted the game!😀).",
        "Just extremely broken, can't even play the game without the ball not touching the first platform and falling off the map or the game's score just going up while nothing is happening. The game is too hectic and the gravity is too much compared to the last update. It's a really good idea but I hope this isn't just a quick grab for cash.",
        "Having to restart the app every time you want to play instead of being able to hit RESTART sucks.  The app won't let you restart a game without a glitched ball each time.  Also, the speed of the ball is ridiculously inconsistent.  Sometimes you get games that are at a reasonable speed and other times it seems like the ball speed has increased an unreasonable amount to play.  Why even bother trying to load the game each time anymore?",
        "The game is extremely broken. I can't start a game without falling off the map, and there are times when I don't even play it's a blank screen and my points meter goes up. It's a very broken game I'm thoroughly disappointed.",
        "it is extremely broken. after the first death, it starts you out right in front of the start platform and you cant play it again unless you completely close the app. its a shame that they dont even test the game before they launch it and that google play cant prevent it from launching in the first place. great game, but extremely broken.",
        "Poor quality game that wasn't tested before release! After your first death you can't land on the platform upon restarting and immediately die, the only way to have another go is to completely close the app first."

If the removal of the blocks topples the tower  or the hexagon gains momentum and rolls off the screen, then it&#x2019;s game over and you have to start all over again. <br> <br>Challenging, emotive and blissfully simple to play. Six! will have you hooked on getting as far down the tower as possible. In keeping with Gram Games&#x2019; hits, playing this game is simple and fun, but claiming a spot on the leaderboard and bettering your friends is challenging and rewarding.<br><br>Key Features<br>&#x25CF;    Easy to learn and fun to master gameplay<br>&#x25CF;    Challenge your friend&#x2019;s high scores, challenge the world.<br>&#x25CF;    Fun and engaging graphics.<br>&#x25CF;    Engaging and addictive.<br>&#x25CF;    Play for a few minutes or hours at a time.",

I hope you make the main menu button apear immediately or allow you to click your back button to go to the menu of the game but other than that AMAZING game!",

Game play is fun, there aren't ads every 30 seconds, the app runs smooth, and the artistry that went into designing this game and the characters in it is absolutely flawless. Can't complain at all. Great game, I do recommend to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games.  10/10!",
        "Awesome game. Sadly motivated by profit grabbing providers. The cost to buy extra lives is astronomical. The only way to buy on a more viable basis was via the piggybank and guess what. They removed it. When I questioned this I got standard fob off bull. I questioned that and guess what no reply. A shame, it is a great addictive game. Just don't get tempted to get you wallet out..........",
        "Zainy!  I can understand the addictivity of it, however, just as I was getting into each level, surprise!, is was completed! This spoilt a bit of the fun for me.  The catchy music, oddly I never got tired of hearing... Great game!!!  This review is after my first experience of the game which I played upto level 20 before stopping.",
        "Sounds boring but I'm loving it! Sucks you right in. Starting to get a little complex (actually using some real brain power) but still very much doable and no charges as of yet and I'm up to level 10 atm. I am no gamer by any means but I'm really enjoying this.",

I therefore uninstall, only to find myself in no time at all missing the game...the challenge & reinstalling the app.  👍👍👍  Good job to the developers.",
        "Great game. Would have given it 5 stars but a recent update has made the commercials play at max volume. I play the game in silent mode, in bed, while wife is asleep. Sudden barrage of loud commercials has ruined the experience. It has actually resulted in me playing less and therefore has had me watch less commercials. Go figure.",
        "I don't like that strong competitive advantages are behind pay walls. These advantages make PVP almost unplayable because of how unfair it is for those who haven't paid real world money for them. Also, one of my fully upgraded non-starter ships was completely reset.",
        "For some reason all the videos have stopped working. The double coins video, the video for another life and the video to allow an extra spin of the wheel, please fix and I will 100% change my rating",
        "Hard to win PvP when you can't get any power ups. Need to make it more fair. I have no trouble losing a game but when you make it to level 4 and only got 1 power up. Almost impossible to have a chance",
        "Tried multiple times for them to give me my purchase, I have shown them the evidence and they agree I don't have my in game purchase and have been trying to fix it for ten days and won't issue a refund. Horrible customer service"

It's a game...it's supposed to be fun not rocket science!! It should relax you but when you're played a level 6 or 7 times and you get down to needing1move to win... yet again... you get stressed!! And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun! I like a challenge but this is ridiculous!!!",
        "I enjoy this game more and more each day.  Is there a possibility to reduce the memory mb? It really takes a lot of storage and slow down my tablet. Thanks",
        "Getting green pieces gets extremely redundant. After 30 levels it's still the goal. Levels are near impossible unless you get lucky and things line up perfectly.",
        "Its a mind blowing game i cant help but to play this game my day seems not complete if i cant play the game specially when i cant pass the next level and the hardest part is the hard level the time are very fast when i am playing.i really love it and the freebies i can get everyday to boost my game.thank you creators and the makers the graphics and the animation is very realistic.",
        "I like this game but would like to be able to acquire more stars per level.",
        "This is a great game except the play money you get in the game is not enough.  You spend 900 if you close to winning and you want to extend your moves.  When you win you get anywhere from 50 to 100 play money.  So you have to spend your real money to get your play money.  If you have money to spend then enjoy the game."

        "I love the game and then when i saw that there was 3D projects i was so excited but they did not meet my expectations the controls were a little hard and the graphics were a little shady. Also there is a lot of adds i don't mind some adds but there's just so much so it would be nice if you cut down on the adds. Over all i really like the game i love that i don't need Wi-Fi to play this.",

        "Simply love it, if i may make a suggestion... how about providing an option to hide the finished works from the first tab? That way one would not have a lot of scrolling to do find a new piece to start. :) keep up the good work! 👍",
        "This game is AWESOME!!! and Everytime the game updates their app it adds more exciting options to playing the game such as creating your own pictures from your picture gallery folders or other of your downloaded photos from your picture galleries or saved photos. It's so much fun. I also find it to be a Great stress reliever for me. ThaNkS, pixel art app. I love this game, I find time each day to play... Very Relaxing 🤗🤗😀😀😉😉.",
        "Absolutely love this. The only issue I have is when I am working on a puzzle on my galaxy tab A 10.1 it blinks off if it's tilted a little the wrong way. It especially doesn't like it when it's laid down on a flat surface. I love that it's mostly free for Android users and the 3D puzzles are fun too.",
        "Great way to relax or calm down. Lots of choices without having to earn game coin to buy more that only disappoint. Mix of both easy and challenging. One thing would improve over all play and that would be an easy way to locate any missed cells at the end of a puzzle. Having to scroll through some of those detailed ones to find one or two blanks can be a real headache! Other than than i think this is the best color game I have tried! Keep up the great work!!"

Can't that be possible at least for a week if one on it to her their records it shud be like that for the rest of the week. Most importantly  subway surfers consume too much data. But wen updating every month and for that reason I humbly demand that this game company provide physical cash reward for those who are consistent for us to tell others who are asking us who subway surfers help. If we tell them benefits we derive I bet u more people who are lover of games will wanna be part of subway. Trust  me....  Tnx in anticipation",

Get this fixed please.  EDIT: contacted the devs and they were great. Fixed my problem and I still managed to play a bit on the event. If anybody else has this problem, please contact the dev team they will gladly help you. Happy mining. Cheers"

I wish therr was a way to go back and do the tutorial again and I accidently pressed during the first one and missed how to land. Lots of trial and error on that one. Also would be nice to know how the scoring exactly works.",
        "It's getting frustrating.. I'm into level 14, have up graded skills and equipment but yet still can't manage to get a bronz let alone a silver or gold in the very first jump in the game. Along with finishing a constant 16th about 95% of the time make me think it's rigged. What's up with that??",
        "Fantastic concept and artwork and potentially amazing game ruined by a half arsed tutorial and lack of information, pure laziness.  The fun of the game turns to frustration as you get good distance and terrible scores, but why? You assume landings but the game gives you no information on correct technique. Also same for takeoff and mid air lift.   Come on devs its lazy and ruining a game with huge potential. Uninstalled...",
        "By level 4 no matter what score i get the bots always get about 15 higher. 1 game i would get 130 and the bots would get 145. Then when i get 160 they still get 175 showing this is rigged. That makes it so annoying with a lack of help from the developers make it annoying otherwise would b 5 stars if these issues were fixed",
        "The game has a great Idea to it, but it really needs so tweaking in the physics deparment of the game, on certain Stages I go further with a Bad Jump then a Excellent one, and the wind doesnt really play that much of an effect in the game. But overall great and fun game, amd very addictive.",
        "This game is actually very good, I play a lot of mobile games as its normally all I have time for and this is challenging and fun, the career mode is good and also like the upgrades..  I will definitely be keeping this one on my phone for a while because it is a really cool game. If you don't like ads then click you back button to get rid of it from time wasting or spend the buck to lose them forever.. Well done on a cool game, make some more like it!!"

        "Awesome Game!! Really I like this game. I dont even have words to describe it. Totally Fantastic... Whatever you say, this is totally cool. But I have a request...please add a column of legendary bikes. Like there is Common, Rares, Epics, and Specials , there should be a column of legendary. Waiting eagerly for the next update. Thanks a lot of making this fabulous game. And I would also like to appreciate the colours and graphics of this game. Thanks to the team for making this game. I advice this game to those who are looking for cool new games. Please install it and have FUN!!!! Dont just look at the pics, install and you'll be amazed.",
        "Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death",
        "Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won't register your flips. These aren't huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.",
        "Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I'll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.",
        "Way much room to improve                                 So first you could get more bikes in there and add more levels and make the resolution better like 1080 or something add more achievements and more of those levels that you get when you are just playing that game outside of the levels. But other wise great stuff great stuff keep it up. Also some missions are impossible, unless as someone else's comment said you play 16 hours a day",
        "This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can't seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn't be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it's not something you have to add, it's just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven't seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it's an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘"

They offer 2 packs for 5 and 20 then except for rare sales which offer 49 and 79 dollar packs everything is 100 dollars google should step in and pull this game off the google play market for a square enix licensed product they have enough backing to have actual microtransactions not be a game exclusive to rich people who use 100 dollar bills as toilet paper...",
        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15",
        "I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my \"family\"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we're like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I'm from Michigan,we're both married ,but there's nothing I wouldn't do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!!

        "Just downloaded this app.  So far a very well executed app with excellent layout and controls/easy and fluid to use.  Much better than other Sodoku b/c no ads during actual game play!  The only \"con\" is that I cant put graphics behind gameboard. Only suggestion: Would like to see options for backgrounds like in Solitaire. This would truely make it a 5 star game!   Ps. I was not paid/reimbursed or otherwise incentivised for this review in any way.",
        "I'm addicted to this game especially the daily challenge boards. Pros: pencil feature, all instances of the number Are highlighted when you fill in a cell. Con: the timer starts when board opens, would like it to start after filling in 1st cell. As others have said the ads are right below the numbers, too easy to tap when your on a roll.",
        "I like this app, but it feels like it could be more educational. I get stuck on the expert puzzles and often have to use the hints, the way the hints just tell you the number in a selected square doesn't help me work out what I'm missing. If the hint could show me how I could reveal another number would be more helpful to me. Otherwise top notch app",
        "It's a pretty decent sudoku implementation, far better than a lot of the other ones out there I should say. The only issues I have are firstly I do find the \"penciled\" numbers to be a little on the small side (on a 5.5\" screen). I'd also say that for those of us that don't find the \"expert\" setting particularly difficult (without meaning to sound arrogant), it would be good to have a step above that. And finally a Google Play leaderboard would be a nice addition. None of these are massive problems, it's a good app as I said.",
        "Great app. I can do Sudoku on the app with the 'write' facility for numerical notes and I like how it removes them automatically as you fill in other areas. But I still find it very difficult to do paper Sudokus because I can't fill in the right answers without loads of workings out on the more challenging puzzles. The app makes this aspect easy.",
        "I would greatly prefer to start by touching a number rather than touching a cell.  I have to hunt for a cell with the number I am working with, touch that to show where all instances of that number are, then touch each cell and the number to place either the number or a note that this might be the number.  If I could select the number first, I would only have to touch each cell to place that number, then turn on \"note mode\" and touch each cell for a note.  Only half the taps per game, saving both time and the muscles in my arthritic hands!"

        "The game is simply awesome in a word. The mesmerizing music combined with excellent commentary makes me nostalgic to the time when FT first released Score World Goals. Playing the game is a very smooth experience, in addition to the pleasure from the quality of the graphics. There are some minor problems in gameplay, but these don't matter that much as the game excels with the idea, execution and result. And of course, it is a game where losing creates no frustration. Thanks to FT for providing us this masterpiece.",
        "Love the reduced tackling. It feels more like a high pressing Premier league match now and actually gives you a chance to stop the better teams. With the slower tackling, one missed time tackle deep in your opponents half can result in  them getting the ball all the way to your penalty box and scoring. All the while your players just hover around doing nothing. Keep the reduced tackle time!",
        "I do not like the new update where tackling recharge has been reduced. I think what it was on before was a lot better and made the game a lot more strategic as you had to time your tackles perfectly. I think reduced recharge should be something you can win in the boxes or buy with the money or gems. Another good idea could be to give the team that's just scored 20 seconds of quicker tackling on the back of the goal they have just scored. Please put it back to the normal tackling rate! I am addicted 😂😁",
        "Honestly so angry, you go on a small losing streak and end up not being able to play a game due to not having enough nomey, so I spend £10 of in app purchases thinking it will sort me out, lose once and again I can't afford to play. Don't download money snatching pile of tosh",
        "Pathetic gameplay, it has so many issues that haven't been solved with the updates. First the game lags so much, then you cant even string 2 passes together when the opponent team tackles you off the ball. Ths happens in all difficulties. Can't attack, can't defend. Player updates cost too much. Fix all of this in the next update.",
        "The fast rechargeable tackles should be removed.  The game is no fun now. Earlier I had to time my tackle perfectly so that I don't give away second balls. And same with the attack. I tried to get tackled in an area where I can win second ball. But now this fast tackle recharge has just ruined the game."

        "Hello NetEase, thank you for this wonderful game. I have been playing RoS for a few months now. Lovely game but after the last update, my game freezes at the server screen. After several attempts if at all the server menu loads, the game kicks me out when I try to login my account. I tried repairing the game many times, reinstalled it too many times, but the same problem persists. Hope your team will look into the matter soon. Thank you!",
        "I love the Game. Great Gameplay and Controls.. but maybe the Worst in technical issues. Reinstalled dozen times and Repaired using there repair icon on start menu (because of always server busy). Game always updates especially on patches .. Spent more time on fixing the game to make it work than playing it. And ..l.. for your latest update. Btw. My phone is s8+. And got decent internet connection.",

        "The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn't make it better at controlling. I don't know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌",
        "this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It's so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It's just so addicting and I can't get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the 'play online' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊",
        "This is better than the browser version for multiple reasons. 1) It doesn't lag as much. I played a few rounds a noticed a little bit of lag, but it's better than the browser version.  2) You can play against AI if you don't want to play against people. I like this because I actually had a chance to win and was able to kill some. 3) You can create your own custom skin, which is awesome. All of this is free as well. I love this version of Slither.io.",
        "So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I'll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It's in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I've ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍",
        "Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃",
        "The controlls are pretty bad considering how simple they are.  The lag is unbearable. Fix those and you've got a 5star game all day. Simple fun pick up and put down time killer. In fact the lag is such an issue however, the game is getting uninstalled. You can't play a reaction based game when the lag has you 6 seconds behind whats going on."

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",
        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money.",
        "The game is great but customer service is non- existent. I bought the 30 day gem special that was supposed to come with an egg and fountain. Got the gems (so far)but not the extra items. Tried contacting customer support several times but following their M.O., they never respond."

        "I just completed all 3185 rounds... took nearly 2 years to do so. A couple of suggestions...  1. Some big reward must be given to the one who completes all the rounds... an uphill task. 2. All these years I played the spin wheel every day ... but not even once the jackpot was opened... it simply shows the malintentions of the programmers who programmed it as such. 3. Boosters must be given more often.",

One suggestion: make it clear $3 gets you one-time access to your piggy bank only. Thanks😄",

        "I like it.   The fish are friendly and encouraging.  I use the game to help me keep calm and relax.  Please consider allowing us to select another of one of the earlier aquariums when we get to the point where we are waiting for new aquariums to be developed and have finished everything.  I'd like a place to put new fish and decorations, but none of the old fish want to be sold.  They are still my favorite friends.  The game uses a lot of memory, and I had to uninstall it from my tablet because it kept making it crash.  Works on my phone, but it's still a lot of memory.",
        "Love this game!! I love the challenge with completing levels. There's days I can't get enough of this game. I play every day. I love decorating my tanks. I love when I get infinite time, but It would be nice if we had control over when to use it or the time would stop and be saved for when we return. Sometimes 6 hours is impossible to sit there and just play. One thing that would be nice is if we didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life to renew and could have more friends to  receive more lives and got to use the diamonds we earned amd not be stored in a bank to buy. Other than that I cant complain😉 best game out there and I highly recommend it to all ages.",
        "It's a great game. I play it with my daughter on our freetime it's quite addictive. Its great that you get rewards if you have to watch the movies. The only thing i would change is the reloding of the lives. Half an hour for one life is too long. Every so often you get a few free hours, but you need to have free time to play.I love the fact that we can play using my phone sideways (landscape ) as I have a problem with my wrist. I highly recommend it!",
        "Fishdom is a fun game.  The puzzles are challenging. I would love to see a change to the gifts we can give our neighbors . Such as, the lightening, or fireworks, or an ornament for their aquarium. I would also like to see the diamonds we earn to be available, not stuck in a bank, to be paid for.  Limits could be put on it, of course, but the free one here and there only help once in any puzzle sequence.   Overall, though, its a nice game.",
        "I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one's tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don't earn anything for more decorations and it doesn't get dirty and the fish don't get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.",
        "Got a new tablet for Xmas.   Had game on sd card. Wouldn't transfer to new tablet.  Was on level 105.  Have to start all over again! TORTURE lol. Other games I would just stop but not this one.  I love It!  EDIT...STILL LOVE THIS GAME.  Highly reccommend it!  Some levels are SO difficult but still loving this game Oct 9/17.  DEC 2017.  Still adore this game.  Now my husband plays too.  Best game EVER!"

Anyway the game's good everything is cool but.. if u think u have seen an app with more adds then you know nothing download any voodoo game.. Literally after every single game over u get ads so it doesnt really matter if u tap the revive button (yeah u should u get ads regardless)",
        "Honestly, it's a really good game that mangages to pass as challenging, entertaining, addictive, and time-consuming (in my opintion) all at the same time. But, there are WAY to many ads. The game itself is great but all the ads and interuptions completely takes away from the main purpose of the game; having fun. That's pretty much the only aspect of the game that I highly suggest improving at the moment.",
        "I think the ads are fine. It acts as a breather whenever i lost a run. The gameplay is addictive and all. but.... BUGS! i hate it when i pass through 3 or more layers. And still died by stepping on dangerous tile instead of breaking it. Just had a 11k run today and died because of a stupid bug",
        "Honestly i love this game its a great way to kill time. And there's a lot of reviews on here saying how theres too many ads. Heres the simple solution to that. Don't like ads? Turn off your wifi. Ads can't play without internet.",
        "Reformat your ads. If you're gonna have one play after you lose do it exactly when you lose, not after yu've had a chance to start the next wave. Otherwise watching an ad to revive seems really dumb",
        "It's a good game that is challenging to start,  but adds nothing to keep it challenging. It just changes colors. It would be nice to have a timer,  or a high score, or something to aim to beat. Or maybe even that once you hit a section of a tear it falls away and you have to keep moving (challenge mode). I still play it,  I like it. Just wish there was something to keep it challenging."

        "I actually like the game, but I got all the guys in 3 days.... Now what? There are no upgrades or any other options to use the money on. Also the same thing is happening as others said, where the browser keeps popping up saying there is a virus. Pretty annoying",

Im only keeping the app bc i hope the next update fixes this issue. Other than the stupid pop up its a great game and i enjoy it. Please fix it so i dont have to uninstall.",
        "I wanted to enjoy this game. The advertisements randomly open chrome browser windows with a fake virus scan saying \"your device is infected.\" Its ironic in that the software that you're prompted to download is terrible adware that an actual scanner might flag.  It's quite persistent too, happening only after I installed this. 30 second video ads midgsme and adbars that just so happen to pop up and hover where you have to click in-game.",
        "I love the game as a whole, and I just barely redownloaded it and it saved my progress, but I can't even get through one whole throw without it opening up chrome with a fake survey or whatever. I'm not joking, it's really bad. That's why I can't give this a good rating. I understand the need for ads in a free game, but for whatever reason, mine is nothing but ads.",

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Love this game. My mom and I play it 24/7. It's addicting. Annnd it's a great time killer. Just like everyone else there are things that I would suggest to improve the game. Like for example the time frame for waiting on items. Crazyyyy long. Like the fish nets are like 14hrs! Could drop all the high times to half. That would be cool. But of course if you guys did that then it would be super easy to level up. And you guys would loose out on money cause there are some impatience people out there that just go ahead and buy diamonds and such. Anywho. Love the game. Please consider some of these people's suggestions. Thank you. #HayDayFan",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "Good game. I initially wrote a one star review because this game was very dependant on microtransactions but it's actually pretty fun if you have the patience. Right off the bat you have to wait upwards to 30 minutes or an hour for basic production and warming but as you grow your farm it gets easier to deal with. This definitely isn't a game you can play for, like, an hour, consecutively, which kinda sucks but it's great for the 10-20 minites you pop in now and then."

        "Its a really good game but they should make it a bit easier. They should have a thing where they ask your age so that they can determine the hardness of the level. But good game I would try it. One question for RobTop games, though, what is with the \"buy full version\" how is there a full version. Reply to me robtop. I need to know. Not sure about it but worth a try and see if you like it. # Amsam production review.",
        "This game is fun and great but there are too many advertisements and always make me feel annoyed by that. Please fix this and I will rate 4 or if it is better,5.  it was 2015 when i said this. now it is 2018. NO CHANGE. all the ads were still there!!!!! so everytime i want to try again, AN AD WILL POP UP AND BRING ME TO THE PLAY STORE AGAIN.",
        "Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it's fun because it's challenging and there's super fun things in GD except hacking because that's no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I'm super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂",
        "Well, I admit, I'm addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn't be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can't Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍",
        "The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won't annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie",
        "It's a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it's super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star."

        "Great fun game. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because you go through your money pretty quick buying boosts to win levels to then upgrade your garden. I like the game a lot. Also I think that at the end of your board if you have undetonated items they should detonate at the end of that level. I've lost too many levels because of not getting one item that was next to something that was undetonated.",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "Much has improved since my original review (see below). There are special events going on quite often to help with earning coins and powerups, and the levels don't seem to be as tedious. Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

You can go to diffrent places to get outfit,makeup and hair done. They actually give you a report card with all your classsess and grade. You can peform in front of an audience and you can battle people at the battle arena. Finally my favorite part of this game BOY DRAMA AND GIRL DRAMA it's amazing. DOWNLOAD THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!",

For example If your swiching btwn classess its hard to complety take off i.e jacket, tights or pants from previous classes. If u pick certain outfits there stuck on you. Please fix. Other then that good game.",
        "I'm not much of a dance gamer but I love simulation games. This one in particular is very innovative with their design and gameplay. I was skeptical of how I was going to like it at first but it proved me wrong and I immediately took to it. The controls are easy to learn and I don't even mind all of the ads. Honestly, a really great game.",
        "I love this game! It is really fun and if you like dancing then this is the one for you! Personally I like gymnastics more but that's because I've come a long way in it. The only thing that you could change is the amount of ads are! There are so many of them! But over all this game is great! 😉😉",
        "Honestly, one of the best games that I ever played. Dont care much for the ads. Just turn off your data and none of the ads will come out😉 But just like what the other reviewers are saying, the option to choose and take off certain clothes are limited. But other than that, great game.",
        "This game is actually good. The biggest downside is that there's A LOT OF ADVERTISEMENT to watch during playing. I know this is a free game, but c'mon! Waiting and watching minutes of the advertisement is longer than playing the game itself. Not to mention the conversation between characters in the game also took too long to wait and there's some things need to use real money before it can be explored.  This kind of game supposed to be fun and gives the cha cha feeling, but instead I get frustrated of waiting for the advertisement to finish before I can continue playing.  Out of all that, this game is great."

They give daily prizesand makes thou wsnt to come back. It can be frustratingly challenging and that is a hood thing.. thank you creators.",
        "Ok new review, I've passed all 1740 levels would have given 5 stars but the upper levels can only be passed when you hit the right program! Play same level 20-30+ times then suddenly pass with 10-15 moves left!!! Not fun anymore!!! Uninstalled",
        "This game was my favorite, however the lack of being able to reset the game is truly sad 😢 and takes away from my joy of the game! Please give the option for us to reset our play easily, please 💕",
        "Can you sponsor a video for me? I've introduced this game to several people and I have yet to hear it be exposed on youtube. As a creator I can give the game the exposure it deserves.",
        "The recent changes to the game bother me, you can no longer see how many points you get as you go or when you fail. Now it seems that they limit the amount of points you can get at the end for the moves you have left. The only time you see points is the total at the very end. Seems like they're screwing the people who want to get 3 stars on the levels...",
        "I enjoyed playing this game but I was to reset game to beginning.Tried clearing data and cache but didn't work.E-mailed developers to ask them and they e-mailed back saying they would but only once which I am still waiting for them to do.What is the big deal about wanting to start over the game again?Better that than once getting to levels you can't do to not play game again surely!!!!"

Big advantage.. And you dont HAVE to go platinum to enjoy this game, but I am considering it ! GREAT JOB !!",
        "It has a good game play as well as millions of adds which eventually ruines the game. You have to watch an add after every single mission and before starting a new mission to gain energy. So basically the energy bar is just a little trick played on us for watching advertisement. I will not recommend this game only because of the adds, otherwise it's really a good game.",
        "Do not buy Premium. You see all the locked features saying exclusive to Premium. You drop $70 for Premium only to find out the best features are still locked because now there is Premium Plus for ANOTHER $150. You are not told other than here by me that what you get when you buy Premium is a Premium-lite. You hear about Premium Plus for the first time after you have bought Premium (lite)",
        "I do liken the game. Here are my pros and cons. Great graphics, wide variety of levels, and ease of controls.  Weapons are too expensive, the game stays one step ahead of you as far as when it offers you deals on weapons. You will either not have the points or coins to purchase and then when you do it offers one level too high at your point in the game to purchase.",
        "Nice game. So far I've noticed only critical hits count. Taking out a knee or a shot to the gonads usually fails. Upgrades are like any other game, spend money to get the good stuff. Hopefully it doesn't get to the point I can't unlock the items to keep playing.",
        "Sinse last update when playing when get killed it will show score screen but spawning back to game locks up and won't play just have to watch myself lose or stop and start over losing my life??????? Please fix...... Would like to know when you are going to fix can't win for losing life and diamonds and not even getting to play!!!!!!!!!! Don't know what you have done to the game getting where it is no fun getting killed before you even get respawned"

If you're trying to complete a challenge, every couple tries it will reset to free play mode and you have to go intentionally kill yourself which sometimes takes way too long. Then if you don't tap the challenge button exactly right, you have to free play again. Then every time you get back into the challenge screen, you have to scroll all the way through every one you've completed. The game would be fun if it wasn't so infuriating.",
        "I paid the 2 odd dollars to remove the ads since i really enjoyed the game. If you are thinking about doing the same DON'T. Paying the money removes ZERO ads. It simply allows you to skip most of them after 5 to 10 seconds rather than watching the whole 20 to 30 second ad. They still pop up just as often and are just as annoying. Personally I would wait for another developer to make a good clone of the game, shouldn't take long it's a simple engine.",
        "What I couldn't even get taken to dinner before being forcibly bent over with ads? I mean with in 45 seconds; I downloaded, opened, played 2 games, and BAM! There it is. What, you couldn't even butter a brotha up? Hell I'd even been fine being lathered up with 10 minutes. Soo ok, I bite, i watch the ad. Attempt number 3 is going well l, bam I die. Tap to continue, well there's a 5 second cool down for revive I didn't notice at first. So I think to myself \"well that's probably what I watched the ad for.\" Wait the cool down, tap to continue. So I tapped, and BAM! ANOTHER AD. Hmm welp you wanted a rating and here it is. Give me about 5 minutes of gameplay before two back to back ads and I might consider having the game installed longer.",
        "DO NOT PAY TO GET RID OF ADS!! IT'S A SCAM...IVE PAID AND IT DID NOT WORK. EMAILED THEM TWICE NOW OVER A MONTH. NO RESPONSE AFTER THOSE ATTEMPTS. Great game but deliver to customers when they give you money VOODOO. And a simple email would be nice jeez",
        "If you're a sucker like me then you paid the $2 something to remove the ads. Doesn't work, obviously a scam. Helpful Hint: If you play with data and Wi-Fi off the ads actually disappear regardless of whether you paid to have them gone or not. Although this shouldn't have to be necessary it's the only way you're gonna enjoy this game as there is and ad Every. Single. Time. You. Die.",
        "Paid to have add removed, no add were removed! Reading though the comments it's seems like I'm not the only one who feels this way. Bit of a shame as I wanted to like this game but it makes it impossible to tolerate for more than a couple of goes as the add pop up every time still!!"

        "The game itself is really fun, but it's horribly unoptimized and crashes frequently. 90% of the time when playing I would hit frequent lag spikes that makes the game practically impossible to play. Whenever I try to watch an ad, the game crashes and the random pop up ads have like a 20% chance to crash the game.",
        "The game overall is awesome, though there are some things that need some work.   To give an example I personally find it very annoying when the screen zooms in when you get a combo. Like it is now it's very hard to manouvre around incoming cops as you only have a split second to react. Maybe something like a copcar indicator would be in place as well.  For the rest I find the game great and super fun to play, although I'd hope to see newer, cooler and more expensive cars. The ones that are available right now are quite easy to get and don't need much grinding at all.  All with all it's a great game and I love playing it. Keep on the good work folks!",
        "I would give it more stars, but it glitches a lot.  My car jumps to random places on the screen. If you fix I will give it 5 stars.",
        "I really like the game, but since its single player, for 400 coins (that's what I call the in game currency)could we have a mode where you can create your own vehicle and vehicle stats , (health, speed, etc.) Pls. then I will give a five star rating, keep up the great work.",
        "Game is really fun but crashes all the time. Downloaded after watching a friend who plays on iOS - where it never crashes. This version crashes when you start ads and sometimes just randomly.",
        "Damn cop cars coming out of f, nowhere. Can it give us a warning of where they coming?"

Make an option to use those gems for shots instead of real cash would be nice but still earned 5 stars. Samsung galaxy note 8",

I can't leave message with development so this is the best I can do about that. But I love the game and this wouldn't change my activity amount at all. Keep up the great work development and look forward to new games in the future.",
        "Best game i played ever. But new update have some bugs like if we going to play with friends it take too much time for loading nd mostly notification pop up that there is an error your coins refunded in your account. Kindly resolve this issue. Except this best game 👍",
        "So I have no idea why I am always at a club disadvantage. My driver is level 5 and always vs a person with level 7 or 8. Why do I never go against level 3 drivers. Always vs higher clubs! ALL THE TIME! you might as well give them the win. Losing me as a customer because there is something very lopsided.",
        "Game sucks donkey *****. You play maybe 10 beginner holes and get chests that open in 12 seconds. THEN you play a normal hole and get a chest that doesn't open for 4hrs. You only get four chest slots so that means you can only win four holes then you have to wait 4hrs (or 8 or 12hrs depending on the chest you choose to open) before you can get anything for winning a hole. In two days, I haven't even played 18 holes. Guess you gotta have money if you wanna play. Thought I trusted the \"Editors Choice\" games, guess not.",
        "Love the game, but its not perfect. You could make the textures better and add more detail in each level bc right now they look empty. Also matchmaking is garbadge, and I get matched against people with much higher trophy counts and far better clubs... Fix this bs please."

This is a problem that really needs to be addressed. I read the reviews before downloading, so I know it's a consistent problem.

PvP are out of the question everyone has minimum of 5 epic items, arena you will have to settle for 5th or less place due to power lvl difference. I am about 141000 fighting 190000 or 90000, which is not fair for those of low power or advantage to those of high.",
        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",

        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine.."

        "I've liked this game for years. Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you're still coasting or you're in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You've had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven't fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!",
        "The best racing game ever, I've played this game along time ago. the first version it has 4/5 cars it was so fuuun.That was 5 years ago now I want to play it again.I feel the nostalgia ooohh the good old days.Now I'm going to install the game.U guys change my life Thank u guys soo much guys. I hope my tears will help u guys. :)",
        "Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it's just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............",
        "For this game to be so simple compared to todays games and grafics, I love it. I spend hours sometimes playing this.  Not to mention they keep upgrading and making it beter and better, keep it up fellas....i havent experienced any of the problems mentioned withthe updates others have but until then great game",
        "Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!",
        "Its a very good game without any tension of wining any difficult task...I like it very much and its not much addicting I have played many games but its very different. controls are also good but this game needs some practice . I am enjoying this game because the tasks are not very difficult but at the same time not very easy its a perfect game and the main character of the game is very funny he always sleeps in the vehicle.....so finally.... I like this game very much"

It quickly becomes a grind, though, where you aren't enjoying the gameplay, you're just trying to get past the timewasters of the daily challenge, or fighting the arbitrary points of the arena. The clan battles and Mighty Eagle challenge are the best parts, but you can't play them all the time. You have to grind away in the Arena.",

Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",

I'm sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn't want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn't change it. Uninstalled after 1 day.",

New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download."

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. 😁 It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖",
        "This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.",
        "What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I'm in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can't push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something"

        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I still love this game! However I have yet to change my mind about the fact that it takes longer to vote just for 3 stars at a time, than to actually design the max of 5 designs per day. Can you not increase stars won per vote? Can you not make designs brief even more compulsory as many designers dont follow the brief and you just end up losing votes because your design is too colourful or eclectic",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget."

This game is awesome and all about tactics, and I love it. This game deserves a five star!🖒",

What matters is that there's a constant redirect ever 30 seconds! It sends you to a website and it's often and very stupid... And if a redirect isn't bad enough it no joke happens to me in the middle of game play. You can be playing and all the sudden here comes a redirect... !",

I wish you'd left in the settings so if we wanted the moving graphics we could have them. And, if not, the they'd be totally still and not distracting.  Make everyone happy that way. :,( Will be uninstalling this now.",

After players matching ,game is hacked/stopped by several times.Only way to win that kind of match,any of one player has to quit or network issues.Its waste of time,also harm for devices (battery drainage,high heating). So,admin plz look after these prob.Why it's hanging or hacking.",
        "As football based game it is superb, in terms of gameplay, graphics etc. But the biggest idiotic part of this game is that if freezes like magic. The whole game main screen becomes unresponsive and stays like that no matters the game is restarted or the damn phone is. Get this thing sorted out Miniclip. You have a reputation to maintain or not?",
        "Could you please enable the user to save his progress in a Gmail account??  So that, when you lost or change your phone, you can recover the level and progress you had before instead of restarting from the beginning!!!!!!!!!!!!   If you could allow more media for sharing the game, it would be better, Facebook is not the only social media!!   And sometimes, it bugs!! Sometimes, the game is very slow and causes you to lose. Indeed, you shoot but the ball goes after many seconds even though the connexion is good!! Consequently you loose against a weak player, And this makes very angry!!!   Should those problems fixed, I will rate 5 stars.",
        "I think this game is a really fun addicting game. The main reason why I got it was because of 8 ball pool. That game is also very fun. The only thing I don't like about football strike is that when I get on sometimes it won't let me click the spinner. So it's like my phone froze. But my phone didn't freeze. It's just the app. So can you guys please fix this.",
        "At first I was skeptical about this game. I had downloaded it and went without playing for a couple of weeks. Then,one day I just happen to open the app and play. Best move I ever made for an app! This game is just flat out addicting, fun and challenging.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much fun it is and that there is, most of the time, something new.  Chalkenign friends and new people always makes for a challenging and fun time waster. Even if I don't have the time to play, I still make time!! Haha",
        "There is a bug in your game I went first of my league, supposingly I am entitled to 350 cash, but it wasn't there.  How could you make it so unfair for someone. Why bother having a prizes if not given to the right person."

        "This game has been great to me forever, and I never had a complaint but this recent update has driven me here. The trophy cap is a real kick in the nuts and ruins the game for casual gamers like me. You now HAVE to advance through the games prestige system and keep resetting all your work just to help out a gang. And if you are in a strict gang like I am, they require 100 trophies a day. If I keep advancing, I won't be able to keep up with that. This is all a money grab by zepto now. They want you to have to pay to keep your machines strong so you can compete.",
        "I love this game. I have been playing it for a very long time. I play it every single day. I like the new updates however it seems you are getting away from the original game and focusing more on ultimate machines. Increasing the prestige levels was awesome but you need to also add additional upgrades with them as well. I have over 100 paw upgrades that are completely useless to me at the moment.",
        "Look this was a great game, worthy of it's previous accolades. Sadly since then it's been progressively ruined by an ever more aggressively enforced attempt to move to a pay to win model. Previously you could achieve anything in the game with a bit of hard work, then they tweaked it and you could achieve anything with a bit of hard work and team work. Sadly though what's happened is soft paywalls have been introduced, things you can't outright buy, but will only manage with financial outlay and change after change is being introduced with new soft paywalls and new ways to try and cash grab. The game is on a steady but rapid downward decline and to any new players I would avoid picking it up and investing your time in it now.",
        "Great game, easy to play and a good time waster. One thing I would like to see in a future update  is a scroll bar for the parts in your garage. It would make it a lot easier than swiping through them, especially for those who have a lot of spare parts like myself. Other than that, awesome game.",
        "This game sucks. First it is really hard to get good equipment. Then it is also very laggy. Everytime im playing the game it freezes right when im doing something. (Mainly when im customizing my car). Think about it when you are getting ths game to take up storage. If you'll excuse me now I've got a game to delete.",
        "I had a bad day but this game fixed it,... Well enough. I've bin looking for a good game to play for a couple months now but until, like 2 days ago nothing had shown its self to me or caught my interest! This game is 11/10 to me! For probably about the next two month!"

I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I'm making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.",
        "I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!",
        "I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn't show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.",
        "For the non experts, let me tell you that 5his game cheats. I sat with a real chessboard to analyse why wasn't I  able to crack master level.   And what i observed was it didn't allow you to make actual moves when you show high levels of intell8gence. Sometimes it makes moves which are faulty. I think there is some mistakes in coding, perhaps deliberately made.  So not a fair play but a foul play.",
        "So far it's o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It's not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game",
        "The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw."

        "I've love playing this game since I began. The main issue I have is that when you buy a new device to play on, none of your progress is saved and you have to starts back at the very beginning. I had more than 80% of the venues open, over 1.2M coins,  and nearly 100 gems. I bought a new phone and nothing was saved. That sucks! Can someone respond, find a way to save your progress so if you switch devices to play on,  you won't lose what you've gained and maybe return my earnings!",
        "The game is awesome, as for the loyal players like myself your game isn't fair with the diamonds on the casino spin 😢 I play everyday at least 8hr or more and only receive 15 gems every two days or so. Please try to rectify the situation I have never received double or triple diamonds on a spin and I've been playing for a year or so. Why?????",
        "UPDATE 4 the NEW BUILDINGS PLSSSsss? TY... Cant Wait. Hope its coming real real soon and REALLY hope theres MORE to come after. U HAVE A WINNER GAME HERE. i bought ALOT of games, & this one is on the top 5 list. Keep up the great work guys/gals. Awaiting the new buildings. lol.    :-)   TY",
        "This game is good and addicting it just sucks with the fact you need to use gems from everything. I wish it was more things to use just money for. I have all this money and run through gems quick and it takes too long to obtain so I end up not playing for a while. A good way of doing this is through earnings that you collect from your restaurant. You can receive 1 gem",
        "Game is very fun and addictive. But you shouldn't have to spend few hundred dollars to play through the game and play all of the restaurants. Yes you can earn gems for free but would take an insane amount of time with each restaurant requiring more and more for each upgrade as you go on.",
        "There's no way to contact customer service for this game. I just bought the new restaurant with the noodles and duck and my sauce cooker doesn't work. I swipe it and swipe it and nothing. I'm doing it the way the tutorial showed but mine doesn't work. I might get lucky and it will come on but I'm losing all of my customers. I think they need to change it so we just have to tap it. I hoping they'll see this so they can work out the glitches for this new restaurant."

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pokémon and I intend to play Pokémon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "Pokemon Go is a pioneer into the world of AR. This game was a hit despite its incomplete composition, and this is why many people left. However, the game now is more complete with features such as raiding with others and dynamic weather. If you are looking for something new on the move, give it a try! Or if you left after launch, give the game another try and see how the game has updated over time. This game is recommended for suburban/urban players, as in-game features such as pokestops are not abundant. This game is still very buggy so patience is required. Thanks for reading!",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "It runs quite smooth and gives me an extra reason to get out and exercise. My only beaf now is that it is impossible to acquire any of the legendaries. If you live in a small rural town you will never have the numbers to take on anything beyond 3 star in raids. Everything else is awesome though."

And another thing that's a problem is this phone heats your phone up badly in less than a minute and it makes me cautious of my phone.I hope these issues get fixed soon.

Idk but hepatic feed back would help so much. Ad these thing's and I'll rate 5 stars and fully purchase the game.also multiplayer with like 3 to 5 other people just messing around  would be awesome. Keep supporting this game and has a lot of potential unlike other mobile games that are very linear and closed off. This feels like a console quality game please keep it that way.   PLEASE ADD HEPATIC FEEDBACK SUPPORT",
        "This is legit the best car simulator type I had ever played. It can easily succeed Extreme Car Racing 3D, which was one of the original simulators back in 2014. Smooth gameplay and realistic sounds. I would suggest to add the 350z, RX7 FD and a touge map for late night uphill driving, that would be insane",
        "This game could be even better if you could: - Add the settings to the menu to control the music and SFX volumes.  - Add a map.  - Add a cockpit mode!  - Add an online or multiplayer mode!  - Add weather conditions like rain and snow.  - Add the brands to the cars!!!!.  Fix the speed of the cars and add the actual speed of each car. For example, the speed of the Lamborghini Aventador is supposed to be at 217 mph and it's supposed to have 7 gears but it's only using 5. Please fix that. - Make the city as BIG as you can please!!!!.   - Please add more shadow effects!!!. - ADD UPGRADES PLEASE!!!. - Add car stats. - Add more cars like:   • Chevrolet Corvette Z06  • Chevrolet Camaro SS  • Mosler Land Shark • SRT Viper GTS • Mosler Super GT  • Marussia B2  • McLaren P1 GTR  • Pagani Huayra  • Pagani Zonda R  • McLaren F1 GTR  • Ford GT  • 2017 Ford GT  • W Motors Lykan Hypersport  • W Motors Fenyr Supersport  • Lamborghini Huracan  • Lamborghini Veneno  • Lamborghini Reventon • Lamborghini Centenario  • Trion Nemesis RR  • Ferrari F50 GT  • Ferrari LaFerrari  • Ferrari FXX-K  • Ferrari FXX Evoluzione  • Ferrari F80  • Hennessey Venom GT  • Henessey Venom F5, and the   • Devel Sixteen. Please!!!!!. It is totally fine if you can't add any of this, but it would be better if you could do so!. This could be an official car driving simulator game. WHO WANTS MORE CARS!!!???!?!?!.",
        "Hang it up yet info it yet info username and yet I've used back but isn't it is it is to see the in person but I don't have a Instagram account and follow me on Instagram account and I have a lot going I look forward to hearing back from you close by and I will be there for you close the door and it going to be thankful I look forward to seeing the new Star is it possible that I look cute and he is it is to be done by the time I look forward to seeing the new one and I can you know what time you are available",

        "Simple, Nice and Addictive. Almost perfect! But the game build lags from when the log records too many life events, which could be solve with a clean log record button. Another Thing is the name your child gets when your child is born in korea but you are from another country, the kid gets your name instead of your surname as his/her surname",
        "I love it! The only thing I would say is to let is have the option to transition without being diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Or at least give us an option on the action board(with the profile of our person) with the option to identify as a transgender at schooling age of 6 or 5. Also, can we have the option to go to early schooling from 2 years? Some people do this. I love this game! It's very interesting and fun.",
        "After so long Google will actually let me review this now! I absolutely guarantee you will have fun with this game. There's so many choices that affect your life, you can be so many different things, and no life is like the other. If you're looking for a quick life simulator game to pass the time, or just play any time at all, this is the game for you.(P.S if you want to transition, you need to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Very rare.)",
        "Overall Its time killing for me, and, just some advice, we should have a Save state, because im kinda upset like.. i have played these game for 3 hour to age of 60 and retire and having a 7/8 mansion bedroom but i accidentally clicked back and then its started over again.. I wanted to see ma kids grow lol, but then i clicked it :(",
        "I love this game and it leaves a lot to your imagination. I do have a few things I would really love to see in this game. I would love for there to be 5 bedroom houses. 4 bedroom houses just aren't big enough sometimes and mansions cost WAY to much even if you're making over 100k a year. Also if you can control your children as well as make suggestions to your spouse to get a job, work out, ect. Would be amazing.  I would love to be able to have little grand babies on the game as well as step children. Even though this last one is a small request I would love to have my children in order by age if I adopt an older child then the children I already have without them being at the bottom of the list. It already states that they are adopted in their details tab so they shouldn't have to be at the bottom.",
        "Great fun little life simulation with a lot of potential. Their need to be more career paths other than work, painting, music or ceo. I want to be an athlete, a career criminal, drug runner, politician etc. And the UI needs to be cleaned up. There's no reason why clubbing and holidays shouldn't be under leisure."

        "This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!",
        "Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don't like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option",
        "Great game, I totally love it. I don't mind the ad but I get annoyed of too many questions of Selena Gomez/Taylor Swift/Beyonce/Ariana Grande etc top hits. How about the legends..like David Bowie, Prince, Foo fighters, Guns n roses, Smashing pumpkins.. other than that, u all admins really rock!!

I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can't take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren't recognised either. I'd enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.",

And now the game randomly quits, and erases any games I've started when I exit from the game for any period of time. Was find until I removed the ads.

The only thing I don't like is that when you shoot sometimes in attacker defender, the other person jumps up and blocks the ball when it's already almost to the net. Please fix this. Overall though, it is a great game.",
        "U guys need to give me like 10 billion dollars. Every time I'm winning in the game it cuts off, it says \"connecting\" like seriously. Iv got the best WiFi in the world and it says connecting. Like really, iv just been loosing due to this. Fix it. Or give me 10 billion dollars in the game. I wont play it anymore if I get cut off 1 more time.",
        "The new update attempts to force you to buy gold bricks I'm order to unlock your gift bags. This may force me to delete the game as it's annoying when your winning multiple games . They could at least adjust the price of the gold bricks. Use to be one of my favorite games and I am not one to play to many games .",
        "Good game. Balanced controls. Thanks to the developers 😀. However the game shows constant network connectivity issues. Even though I use a very high speed wifi and data it still kicks me out for bad connection which leads to losing the game. Pls Fix this guy's. Apart from that an awesome game. Thumps up to the developers",
        "It's great but the new updates suck..Why now you have to wait for the bag you won!!! in a game? You have to wait almost 2 hourse to get one of the bags open? Also you mussout on the other bags you've one because the space is full and you cant het anymore bags until the load or you pay your golds!!! i see that your trying to make money and thats sad because i believe this game is a gold mine with in itself!! but dang the bags!! really? We have to wait for the bags we won!!! to ready itself for openings!! that's stupid!  i think yall should put it back to where the bags just open when you win a game!!and get rewarded a bag. That's really like hey you won a $1000 buck but oh wait you need to pay your taxes first before you can get whats left of it!! Sad!! Put it back to the way it was!!!",
        "I think it's a good game and it had an awesome foundation up until the latest update. I am completely and utterly dissatisfied with the newest update. What happened, Mini Clip =(  Now it just feels like I'm waiting to play instead of playing. I'm alright with change just not coping Clash of Clans terrible waiting system, for prizes I won..."

Also have the app freeze just after I enter games and lose all the starfruit/gold apples it cost to play, but never even got to open that game. Super pissed and dissapointed.",

I got 1 dojo and 3 blades from daily challenge after that I played 15 days continueosly but I got only 5000 star fruit but no blades or dojos. Please solve this problem I really want to give 5 stars for this awesome game. 😞😞😢😢😩😩",

        "Would have given 5 stars but ads are so annoying and far to frequent. I'd accept ads maybe every 5 games but theres an ad after every game and it's a good 30 second ad everytime."

        "Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don't decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don't mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don't actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.",
        "Great 8 ball pool game. Plays great and looks great. 1 slight issue tho. Im from Ireland but i seem to be playing people from India and surrounding countries.   The Irish and Indian flag are kind of similar so im guessing thats where the issue is coming from.  I cant seem to edit my location either.  Would be great if someone could help but if not, ill be happy to continue playing against random beautiful Indian women 😁",

        "Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "The game is very good. But that spin wheel is not fair at all. I've been playing this game for 6 years now (I know there used to be 1 coin reward there) and I've never got anything more than 2500 coin reward. My point is if you are keeping other rewards on that wheel atleast give equal probabilities for each reward. If not, just remove those big rewards and replace them with small ones but atleast with same probability for each of them. Hope you will do something. (P.S. i know it's a lucrative strategy developers play so that players will stick to the game. But you know just trying.✌️)",
        "First of all It's joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱"

Like the free ride option allot Barry minor glitches to sort out but other than than that keep it up excellent game well done. But please sort out little problems. Thanks.",

One more thing is in real life i know i should put on a blinker when changing lanes but i cant tell if your game does that or not sorry for tge long review i hope it helps tho",
        "It has very good graphics, controls, and it's a very addicting game. On of the best driving games I have played. But there is a problem with the Canada map. Cuz I see cars go straight through red lights and when I turn it says that I didn't use the correct blinker when I know I did. But other than that I think it's a great game. I hope they can fix the Canada map for me.",
        "I like the game but when you are driving in the slopes/hills it's really hard to turn and then you have too watch a ad to undo it.At Every time you turn on the hill you go on the other side and get points taken off you for crossing the line so could you improve the game by NOT taking points off when you turn on a hill and can it PLEASE not be constanly raining because you the driver in the game have too keep on turning the wipers on and off. (Also sorry for long review and i wasn't shouting just making the point clearer)",

        "The game would get a much higher rating if it didnt penalize after each stoplight. It wants you to turn your blinker on at each light regardless if you switch lanes."

        "Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!",
        "Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm's Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!",
        "Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I'm just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it's going to be good.  We'll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!",
        "This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10",
        "I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.",
        "I've been playing this game since the last lvl was ToE. First time when i was surprised was an update with three or four new maps, also demon levels, but that was actually nothing, i felt at this moment ''Wow, update, ok''. I got more admired by new update with this walking thing, still dunno the name, but things they have added, i still love it. Animated trails, new wallpapers that was awesome. New updates have arrived in mini-games for free, also awesome, but now i guess they have no idea what to add, because what they've done this is the biggest and greatest update. I love this game so much, so i can't just put 4 or less. Gg RobTop, Gg."

It has taken me several days of being asked by the game if I would like to review it because I was having so much fun and didn't want to stop playing long enough to review. But here you have it. This game is well deserving of a great review. I'm going to go back to the game now so I can keep on rushing.",
        "Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I'm 20 just..😉😉 I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I'm in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️",
        "A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!",
        "Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there's nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.",
        "Minus another star because it's now glitchy and no longer gives daily bonus. I'm on challenge 89 and the point accumulation is taking forever. Minus one star because the ad at the bottom gets in the way while playing. I'll be on a good run and barely graze the ad space and it stops the game and ends the run. Very frustrating.",
        "I'm obsessed with this game. It's not just playing to beat your best score. There are challenges that you can beat as you play and it makes it okay to have a bad run sometimes because you can still beat the challenge lol. Not frustrating, just so much fun. Not sure if my review makes sense, just play this game ok."

        "I like playing it, its a good time killer but why are there so many ads?! I cant play one song without an ad to advertise some other game! Why cant you put an option to watch 5 ads a day for 10 coins each ad or something? Its annoying being interruoted every ten seconds by something i dont care about. Other than that, the game is pretty good itself and its fun to play.",
        "Cheetah Games, I hope you see this, because I've got a complaint. I've been playing piano tiles 2 for about 2 days and I'm level 11 or 12 I don't remember. However when I was leveling up I noticed that a song I like was missing from Level oh I don't know 5, 6, 7, I don't really know. I was looking for a song called the swan, and I could not find it. Then I went to a different tab in songs and I found it it wasn't in level 5, 6, or 7, but it was in level 65. When I found out about this, my favorite song being in level 65 which I will never get to because I'm not that patient, I nearly broke my phone for I was so enraged because of this change. Please change it back it's my favorite song. I hope you got this  but I know you don't.",
        "Great time killer! On those nights I can't sleep, which is too often, this is the best app to turn my would be long night into an extremely short night. The time literally flies and before I know it morning is here. Couldn't ask for a more fun,challenging and interesting way to pass the time. But be careful, you will become addicted very quickly!",
        "It is amazing no matter what I play this alot and still love it. Has great graphics great gameplay and I will never get bored. If I had to have one game on my phone except YouTube this would be my number one game so keep going but one thing you should make lots of more songs like really new songs",
        "This app is great for passing time, I also love how you can play offline. Its very addicting as well. The only downside is that there are way to many advertisements, I can't even play one song without there being an ad",
        "I mean the game is great! But all of these add-on power up stuff always being added ends up ruining the classic game for me. I love the good original design, no power-ups or anything too extra. I don't use them and find them annoying. It's a great time killer, and a real challenege.  But, as said before, the game is going too extra and I don't really like it.  Playing it is fun, the add-ons are not."

It felt like nearly every time I failed a level it would ask me if the level was too hard and I needed a hint. This game is incredibly obnoxious to play with ads on",

I listen to podcasts while playing games and every minute or so my sound cuts out completely to prioritize the ad. Earn the ad by giving me a decent amount of playtime before it and stop overriding my audio.",

I think people forget that your \"FREE\" games have to make money some how to pay developers, animators, IT support and more. Either they have dozens of ads everyday (DK has a few but not dozens) or premium paid content.",
        "Most addictive game! Playing it since it 1st started. Love the new mystery event it's so adorable except your missing one vital character!!  I think there's a couple points to improve on... the send home button in the characters actions list I think should be up the top and smaller instead of scrolling down for it cos I use it often. 2nd all of the sounds in my game are very poor, it's nearly always silent and music is always late. Haven't heard the high 5 sound in ages 😔 please fix the sound!",

I have only 1 problem with this game, it does not count time when you go out of the game or close your phone. It might just be me, but if it wasn't for the bad saving, I would have given this game 5 stars, since it deserves it, or even more.",

Love the game, won't stop playing. Thank you Disney!",

    "description" : "Ever wanted to be Mayor? Ever wanted to run a town, develop the land, and see a metropolis grow? Well, look no further than Merge Town!, the newest title from Gram Games. The concept of the game is simple - you have a plot of land, and it’s your job to turn it into a town. Every so often, you’ll be gifted with a house. Each house can be merged with other houses of the same variety to form a bigger home. Every house built on the land will earn you money - the bigger the home, the more you will earn.

        "Oh wow.. You have got to be kidding me..play limits and an energy system? On the small amount of free content available?? On a chess exercise game with a recurring subscription fee to fully unlock?? Every single thing about this game is designed to be such a ridiculous money grab I actually laughed. It does have a very nice interface but there are a lot of completely free or one time purchase alternatives that are every bit as good.. Definitely don't waste your time and money on this..",
        "OK guys as far as the overall experience with the app was good I could use it all the time to progress my skill at playing chess just like anybody i.e.  any practice  1 possible flaw or idea that I've found which may shift Play Magnus app's popularity is to make a free version of the Magnus Trainer app with only the free content intending this app to be a demo and add more daily activities and challenges to keep them on your app longer  which of course will always end prompting the user to download Premium Magnus which requires an initial $5.00  purchase to begin downloading Magnus Trainer Premium enabling user full access to all the content app offers them. Followed by subscription payments made monthly at the set price of $5.   Might be dumb idea but food for thought I know Runescape had their free server separated from Members only servers also at $5 / mo.  People may  be able  to understand more clearly that if they want the full  app to get way better skills on the board if they want lessons of this caliber then it requires subscriptions to support your hard working team.   The haters will always hate... Keep it up good app",
        "Best forever😍😍 Arabic language please",
        "A truly awesome app for anyone who wants to learn the foundations of chess and enough information to become a really good player. love the idea of the repertory mini games to drum the patterns into your head",
        "This is an amazing app but why do you have to pay for the exclusive lessons. Those are literally the main ones to look at and study. Yeah okay the free ones are good too but I mean I really wanna get awesome at chess. There should be like a 1 month free trail for the exclusive content without having to pay.",
        "It's awesome !! My chess has improved tons !! It's perfect! Yeah, it hurts I have to pay for full but even the free content is humongous and great. Keep up the good work."

Its a bit hard to naviagte back and forth. It can be easy to make a turn you didnt really want to do but harder to correct it cause it does not stop until it is too late or very far down the path. It would be great if you were able to stop mid run. But other than that I enjoyed playing this game.",
        "If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It's by far the best maze game app I've come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I've tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It's the only maze puzzle app I've found worth playing! 😀💜",
        "Sublime controls, varying but very original and fun game modes, and an online leaderboard for the ones interested..!  I'd easily rate this 5 stars if the white-on-grey theme didn't give me a headache! For the love of whatever God is out there, at least give the choice between a light and dark theme, PLEASE?!",
        "I'm not far into it, but it's fun so far. My eyesight could be why it's not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It's still a very good game though.",
        "I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven't played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I'll have to download a separate kid version for her.",
        "5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes"

        "Wow! Just WOW! I had been very skeptical about downloading this huge gigabyte and pay-to-win game, BUT after finally \"trying it out to see\" I am now hooked and now a believer of all of the hype! I have gotten pretty far so far and have a pretty decent crew and I have not had to pay a red cent at all. The grinding in this game is actually fun and I do not mind watching an ad or two for fuel. Simple concept, EXCELLENT execution!",
        "Wow, I'm extremely impressed. The gameplay is very fluid (as it runs on a 60fps on my s9+) lagging and unrealism is unheard of. Also, the soundtrack throughout the games retains just as much excitement as you'll feel beginning the game, viewing car selecting and racing. A must have game for car/racing/gaming enthusiast's. Very additcting.",
        "Ok, my game is back but I'm missing a lamborghini 700-4 that was decked out completely with fusion parts maxed out and stage 6 nitrous and tires. So, you owe me a what, 4 start or 5 star car decked as my car was you took from me. I bought crates with money real money for that car. So I want the closest thing to my car the same as it was. Thank u",
        "I used to love this game. But now all it has become is an ATM for the developer. Every good car in the game must be bought. Winning special events costs money. In game rewards have become useless. There are plenty of other racing games out there that won't require you to refinance your house to play. If I could give it zero stars I would.",
        "Sound could use tweaking, I've driven some of the t1 and t2 cars and they do not sound like that. The grind is real in this game but the developer adds events on a frequent basis to over shadow this. Which would be great if the events didn't expect you to either have the devils luck with silver key crates or a never ending supply of cash.   Over all, great game. I still enjoy playing it even when I hit a \"pay wall\" and that says something about the game. I've only put $5 into this game (bought a $4.99 special pack) and I've still made it pretty far.",
        "This is by far the greatest racing game I've played on a mobile device! The graphics are amazing, the controls are solid, and it keeps me coming back for more. The only issue I've found with it so far is the live races. Its sometimes hard to find a race and the races themselves seem unfair at times. Other than that, its a great game! Highly recommended!"

Because we have to waiting for it to be downloaded before can play again. Can we choose to update whenever we want?  Anyway, this is a really nice game and I've been playing it for a long time. Keep up the good work!",
        "I love the game. There's nothing wrong with it because I feel like it's the old game that I grew up with. But what I hate is that the prices for packs, lp, sp and simoleons went high. The prices before was okay but now I don't think I will spend anymore for packs that give only like 5vip points. Such a fun game but aimes for large microtransactions.",
        "I really enjoy this game, and love developing my Sim's homes and the world. Unfortunately, my game won't open. It hasn't for about a month now, even after this new update. It shows me the loading screen for five minutes, then crashes. It would be wonderful if there could be a fix for this.",
        "Love love love it! This game is actually better than The Sims Mobile... 2 problems,, 1st. The Modern houses with second floor, so expensive😭! 2nd. The time it sometimes takes ages just for one activity!😐 but hey, everything else.. TOTALY AWSOME! 😍 thanks so much for creating this game. Cuz its so hard to download the sims 4 in a Mobile. 💕",
        "This is actually cool and I really love this game. However, the expiration of most of the quest that i'm having are only 2 days to finish. I think it's unfair, and the materials needed are too expensive. Sims are busy on finishing tasks so they won't be able to go to work and earn. So I'm not totally enjoying the game.",
        "When you get an event sometimes it only lasts for like 2 days which really isn't enough because some actions take 1 day. Please extend event times and don't give like 5 events at the same time. Also you should be able to log in other ways apart from Facebook because lots of people don't have Facebook. Please make other ways for us to login  so we can get more neighbours."

        "I enjoy this lifetime favorite with people worldwide, and Uno Dare is my most favorite mode. I understand it will be discontinued in June and I wish it wasn't so.    ...Hey Uno & Friends, could you please not ask me to rate an app I've already rated??? I was asked to read it again and then I came back to find I had made that specific request not to ask me to re-rate something. Your app needs to be reprogrammed so it knows if someone has rated it or not. (sigh)",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",
        "Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "LOVE! Please DO NOT end the game! This app is perfect all the way around. Best card game app ever. SOOO many people are gonna be upset if you take it down, so leave it up! These uno players are ready to rock this app! You will never not have people playing. It would be kind of cool if you could create your own avatar though.. & pick outfits and such. Not necessary, but a fun little quirk (:",
        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it."

The down side is though, that if youre building an enclosed area, the villagers get in and you have to wait for them to get out so you   can close it.",
        "You shouldn't have a certain amount of blocks. Also you shouldent have to unlock everything except for the basic packs. The way you have to jump I am not a fan of I wish it was on the other side. Lastly is it would be nice to have doors,so the viligers couldn't get into your house. One more thing is I wish you didn't have all of these assignments to do to get money and diamonds.",
        "It's a okay game. Dumb thing though is you cannot craft blocks... you will need 10,000's stone brick and only get 150 every few hours. Developers and support staff are useless. You will have to spend money.",
        "This game is amazing. It wastes your spare time which is great. Just one problem. The blocks go down too quickly can you make it so the blocks dont go down?  Thank you!",

        "Hey... I would give this game 5 stars but there is 1 main -VE POINT. FUEL takes TOOOOOOOO LONG TO RECHARGE.  The point of this game is to playyyyyy the game. I don't want to keep waiting. I downloaded your great game TO PLAY it. Please try to solve this issue. I will definitely give you 5 stars if you fix this. Please listen to us and read our comments. Most of us are mentioning this 1 -ve point. Thank you",
        "Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it's only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that's bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it's a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I'll rate 5 star$",
        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn't really feel like you're getting anywhere.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "It shouldn't be easier to level up rather than actually playing game. I wouldn't say that the gameplay is difficult to play, but the purposefully placed trucks that shoot you is a bit ridiculous. Other cars are in the way which ultimately eliminates you before you can attack the shooting trucks. There really is no challenge except trying to beat your previous score. I give this game an eh out eh."

        "I d give it 10/10 if there way a search button to look for mayors, more communication options (private/public) messaging to facilitate talking in the game etc..and concerning the gameplay, it would better if devs reduce the production time of items. It takes way longer and as players we dont have all day to play even if we used boosters and in game cash !",
        "Wonderful game indeed. The only thing is missing is the financing part. Would be really nice to have a banking inductor a stock market where you could trade financial products like other cities bonds or debt. Financing during the game can be a big problem so having a financial hub from where you could trade and borrow would be really useful. Thank you for developing this amazing game.",
        "This game is crazy and awesome at the same time. My population has been awesome. Just 2 months and it was from 0 - 92 000+! The crazy part is when I see a blue hospital sign, the people dont even tell good reasons. ALL THEY DO IS SAY, Sometimes I go to the clinic just to read MAGAZINES! My citizens are so crazy JUST BEACAUSE IN ONE HECTARE, I AM A GOOD MAYOR!",
        "Too much waiting for things to get made and produced. The storage and items for upgrades FAR too difficult to get. 42 items to raise storage by 5 items. And it can take weeks to find all the items. When you go to global storage and find an item that you really need, by the time that you get there, it's already sold! 😠 Also, it takes 3 different items, and you have 3 of one item and 24 of another. Really? Also, it should be that you get needed items more often, randomly rather than at specific times. Other than that, a good game.",
        "Like the competition challenges it holds your attention. the time frames of production are a little long however the markets move products fast. I also like the club wars and the mayors challenges. My dislike is there are not enough thought bubbles in the fact that you only get two the rewards should be more frequently.",
        "The new arenas for war are terrible... There is a massive lag time... I can't even get to the war after rebuilding until the game thinks for approximately 45 seconds... By the time I actually get one shot off it's a minute and a half... Then I'm almost dead and you come back with I'm sorry we're experiencing connectivity issues get it fixed please!"

But since my tv can't download apps so I opened d website on d browser on d tv but the room no or the QR code doesn't appear no matter how long I wait. I don't know what d problem is please tell me a solution",
        "It would be a really good game if it stops letting me use my coins then when I'm in the game for not even 5 seconds. It would shut down on me and when I login back in my coins are gone. I will like you to fix that",
        "Yeah. This game it is very cool and all but, there's this really messed up update and I kinda... Hate it. I only have 200 coins daily, thus it isn't for buying songs, it's for just playing them. This update is a money-baiter. I got to say, this game really took a lot of work to Ubisoft and who am I to critize it. But I think that they should let us buy the songs. This game is really cool btw",
        "Its good but the update mess me up because i have so many song that ived by but now i dont have any of it and there s a limit by purchasing a song 2 songs per day? And what happen to the connecting with fb? What the heck",
        "The new update STILL didn't fix the coin limit. And when I tried to buy something with my coins that I didn't have enough coin for it. I lost all my money and it told me I didn't have enough money to buy it! But it's still a good game. Also please put love ward in the game thanks",

        "Really great gamplay, graphics, amazing controls which mind you are much more responsive than Sonic Dash or at least I think so, and this is the best concept I've ever seen. It's like Sonic Dash and a racing Sonic game had a baby. Best of all, this game captures the essence of Sonic in a brilliant way. Another thing I'd like to say is it's super balanced(besides Cream shes cheap as hell) but the fact is no character is better than the other cause they all have something unique about themselves.",
        "The game is super choppy! I dont have a bad phone or Wi-Fi so I dont know the problem. If there was a mode like where you can reduce graphics that would be amazing. Besides that the rest is fine. Getting characters is easy, ads plays when after a match and/or if you want to double your rewards, and looks pretty nice.",
        "I like it, really cool game, you never really know what's going to happen in a race. If you guys are making yet another character to race with, Im asking: can it please be Infinite, Big the 🐱, or our own custom character? Also, are you able to make different racing music in the game? I have a feeling that some people will get annoyed if the same \"Lost Valley\" song is being played over and over again.",
        "I was enjoying the game but I started getting put against level 8's and 9's as a level 2.  Losing two races would take away 6 or 7  second place wins in a row, worth of progress.  I would lose 15-20 minutes worth of progress in two races. Wasting my time and effort.  Sometimes I swipe up to jump and my character just spin dashes instead, so my character just slams into an object or spins into a hole. Annoying.  After trying again and losing all gains in two losses, uninstalled.  Waste of time.",
        "This game is really great and well polished. However, something needs to be done about the players with laggy connections. Most of the players with over 2000 points are all so laggy, that you can't tell where they are so you can't attack them. They are abusing the lag and need to be dealt with somehow.",
        "Like the game but the latest update have mess up the gameplay with alot of lag. It keep sticking or kicking me out of the gameplay. Before the uodate. I had no issues and it was great. Please look into this"

It's so awesome and I absolutely love how everything is pixelated and that makes it more charming. Not to mention that the music is fantastic as well and I never get tired of listening to it!",
        "Love this game because you don't have to spend real money, just tap the screen to get coins and also diamonds then upgrade the guns, rinse and repeat but it never gets boring. Only trouble I've had is a sore tapping finger. LOL",
        "This would be a fine time-waster if they reign in the ads, until that happens, about like the plague.  They started out as a means to (optional) easy buffs. Fine, annoying, but not that bad. Suddenly, random ads are popping up in the middle of the game and you get nothing out of it. Totally unacceptable way to run a game. Don't bother, there are thousands of other time wasting idle/incremental games that show an ounce of respect for their customers. These guys simply don't.",
        "this game is basically an app for watching ads. you are forced to watch ads in order to progress. on the top of that, when you upgrade your stuff, the game randomly starts an ad. to have double money, you have to watch an ad. to collect diamonds.. guess what, watch an ad. to start idle mode? yes, watch an ad. utterly disgusting, terrible design.",

        "Whenever you die in the game you start completely over again. And after each game an advertisement plays. Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It's a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It's very competitive!!! I swear my husband can't beat my score no one has lol",
        "It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone's or tablets I find it hard to control I don't know if anyone else thinks so but that's my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company",
        "It's good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it's my opinion so don't get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don't have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn't play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀",
        "Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface",
        "A very addictive game that's great fun! The only problem is with the controls. It seems to go too fast without even hitting the speed button (if you have played it you will know what I mean). IMO the speed function is uneccesary, take it out of the game and it's 5 stars all the way!",
        "Great game however I wish there was a way to avoid the button that makes you speed up suddenly.  This us partially because you use your fingers to maneuver it and your fingers can get in the way of your view of the screen. It could cause you to kind if lose control of your worm."

I loved it and played it all the time but then one day it suddenly stoped working when I was doing so well. I couldn't open the game anymore I tried many things and didn't work. I started a new game all from the beginning I had 55 cash in my town and all randomly it showed I had like 20. This game just wants you to keep making purchases. If you don't it will block you out.",
        "I love this game. I dont play a lot of games. Township just keeps getting better. Some things are a minor downfall to this game, like how you can usually get great items from the store, untill you need a product or item for a task or event item. Then unless you have the township cash to hire the dealer then its hard to get things done in time. Plus in order to complete some tasks, you have to sell everything in your barn to complete the task. You should be able to just harvest than sell without it subtracting it back from your task. But either than that its an awesome game...",
        "Something different and fun. I usually don't play these type games, but I love TOWNSHIP! Still having so much  fun with every level. AMAZING FUN! WOW! The HALLOWEEN decorations were so cute, I can't wait for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Loved the Cranberries. I'm enjoying Township more and more with each level. Year of the Rooster.  Greetings we're all gussied up for the holidays. It's Easter season 2018 still playing.",
        "Loved this game but I can't seem to get on the game now. I wait for a long time for it to start and have to sometimes uninstall and reinstall and wait for it to start again.  If It I do make it on I can't help other players by going to there town. I paid money on this game and play faithfully everyday. I'm feeling some kind of way about this. Please fix this.  Update: The bugs are fixed..Thank you",
        "It is fast pace and complex good for ny age,but it with it ads and constant up daes it is hard on your device. It can be played with out any cost, if one has the time and the patients. Other wise it can be costly.  If it a child playing it I would highly recommend supervision,not because of any other reason other than updates and complex issues.  But it is a thnking ame that is fun.",
        "This is one unique blend of many things made into a game that makes me feel obligated to keep coming back and keeping everything running in the game. It doesn't feel like this when I played HayDay. One highlight I have to mention, game cash (township cash) is generously given away in many form! No more worry of being unable to achieve this and that due to no cash available..."

Sometimes on many occasions, the level starts with the time passed like 1-3 minutes. Say I want to get 3 stars in a level by finishing it under 2 minutes and 30 seconds. When I start it, immediately one minute and a half are past without me doing anything and I have to restart the level to get it to zero. Sometimes I forget and end up finishing the level with 2 stars because of that bug and having to restart the level once again. I appreciate your support and offering the game for free but don't forget to get a fix for this bug, please. Thanks 🌹",

        "Well its really fun and the graphics are really good in my opinion. The controls are super easy and super fun. Like its really easy to shift from one side of the screen to the other without taking your finger off your device other games like that don't do that. There are lots of obstacles my one problem is that you can only jump on the small buses like what about the big ones that's a problem that sucks but overall get this game. When you look at the pictures that is exactly what it is its super fun!😁",
        "I like the game but, the think is you can get any lives and sometimes when I swipe the game won't move my character and when you have to get some of your missions and you have to get them in total I hate cause it's very hard and some of the goals are to but, other than that I LOVE the app",
        "I love this game it is so entertaining and you can play it anywhere because you don't have to play with internet. this game can allow you to mix and match the  characters with the cars and even allows you to play different games with dragons dinisours. I love this game!💖💖💖💖💖",
        "I used to like this, but since the update with Lego elves, the gameplay become worst, it's not smooth, I even cannot jump over the bus properly. I use Xiaomi MI5s with Snapdragon 821 and 3Gb RAM, and the graphics and gameplay is still lag",
        "J thought it was gonna br boring bit instead it was really run and I'm a fan of lego",
        "This game is awesome and once u play it u just want to beat ur high score. But the characters look nothing like the actual lego friends🍑"

It runs well and is fun, so I would highly suggest getting it.   Edit: I see lots of people talking about boring gameplay, and I think they just haven't had a good game. After over 50 games and plenty of wins, this game is always fun to drop in to",

        "So, what makes this one of the best games made?  Let me start by saying the game play is fun.  Try to get the top medal each round. The game on its own is smooth and simple.  Graphic and physics are decent as well. But what makes this the best game?  Ads are not intrusive. You can simply back out of them without the \"wait 30 seconds to continue.\"  I've actually watched ads in this game since they aren't forced. I keep them up because I wanted to.  This does not mean they aren't there or have little countdown timers, but you can simply hit the back button to close it. Next, you don't deal with \"you didn't get a perfect score, want to try again? Buy more lives.\"  Exactly. NO IN APP PURCHASES. None!  Thank you!  Keep playing until your heart is content. Lose all you want and retry. They aren't looking for your money. Trust me, try it and you'll see. You also may find yourself more interested in the ads. I know it surprised me that I was. Every developer can learn from them!",
        "Actually it is much easy and had very less features. It is not like a competitive game. In 2hours I have nearly unlocked 31 levels.  Make it a tough one....graphics is good but lots & lots of ads, very annoying ! And add scores there rather than medals",
        "This is a very fun game, even though the screen freezes almost every time I go directly to the next level. I have to close it completely and then reopen it - Please fix this then I will rate it 5 stars.",

        "Well I think you need better graphics and I don't like how it is slow when you turn. Plus it has TOO MANY ADS! I just started playing this game! The pictures showing the terrains is probably copied off of MCPE's pictures (I am not saying it is! But it might be). I really like this game I really do but there needs to be some changes. People aren't going to like this game if there isn't some changes. I just read a comment saying this game is \"gay\". That was incredibly rude. People shouldn't call it \"dumb\" or \"gay\" just because this game needs better graphics or it has to many ads. Does anyone even know the definition of \"gay\"? There is two meanings for it but they both mean your happy! Stop calling the game names! It is not necessary to!",
        "I love this game, it's sooooo fun but my only problem is the ads. It was fine when I first downloaded it, there were no ads but after I upgrade the game, all of a sudden there's ads every second. If you can get rid of the ads, I would greatly appreciate it",
        "There's so many things wrong with this I don't even know where to start. First off your in a confined space and if you go so far you just hit a blue wall. If in was infinitely generated and you could go farther it might be better. Second its kind of slow when moving. Third since the whole confined space thing you have each different biome all pushed together so when you walk two steps your in a different biome and its small. So you extremely need to make it better.",
        "So, the game itself is incredibly enjoyable and fun. Sometimes the controls get me here and there, but I'm sure, with time, I'd get use to it. The thing is, THERE IS NO TIME. Literally every minute, I get a thirty second ad. I'm just here building my home and making foundation when all of a sudden, an ad pops up. I say, \"oh okay, it's just one, whatevs.\" WRONG. It is now ten, just over the past 5 minutes. This game has serious potential, if only it'd let us play the game and cut out the ads. I'm spending more time watching ads rather than using time to efficiently play the game. It irks me, so I uninstalled the ap. It really is a good game, just lower the ads from 2 per minute, kay?",

        "Great game with fun objectives that keep it challenging until level 15.  Only issue with it is that ive recently lost all.my gems due to some sort of bug and now i dont really want to continue playing just to get back to 500 gems to experience something other than sky summit.",
        "I like it and it is a good game, except now I have no sound and the videos do not leave the screen so I can spin the wheel. The sound on the game is on and the last time it worked properly was 3 days ago. I have to shut down the game for me to get the ads gone and still no sound. I have lost many chests and many coins this way. I updated the game and still nothing. Please fix because I have no idea what is going on.",
        "I have enjoyed this game for a couple of years wirh no problems. The only thing I can complain about is earning so many coins and jems and not having anything to buy with them such as new characters and powerups. It's a good hand eye game.",
        "Ok I'm mad I got a new phone. There is no way to save progress. I lost 1,000 gems and 2 million coins. This is BS. They should make it so u can connected thru Facebook like most of the other games. Get it together temple run 2",
        "I abosulutly love this game. It won't get a 5 star though because I have had 4 different coin skins get taken away from me and those were actually my favorites. Idk if it was a glitch or I didn't do something but plz tell me what it is",
        "The blazing sand map is really boring. Only 3 different location there. But looks same all the entire run. Make some free space. It is very boring to run in sand all the time. Make variation like Frozen Shadows atleast. Add some location. Make some variations."

It's exactly how I remember it being on our old computer, and it is SO ADDICTIVE. The very day I got it I played for like 4 hours straight. Literally. Honestly I love the game. A little unhappy about the ads but honestly you get what you pay for, and this was free, so I can't complain too much.",
        "I have completed 3 rounds in the past on this game and wanted to play again not having to watch a video after every level is too time consuming. Years ago not as bad. after 5 levels deleted. EA took a good game and turned it into a ad seeking game. UGH AND UGH. Do not play unless you love ads. Other games you can watch ads at your leisure for prizes but not mandatory. Good luck but if new to game RUN..Lots to choose from.",
        "It remains a classic, yet some parts are just too screwed up. After paying to remove the ads, the ad hoes with the play button still show up. The vase breaker was my favourite in the past. Now it is broken. 65% of the time ir reads actap like a double tap making it utterly unplayable",
        "Irritating. At first it gives you an option of playing a video to receive additional help. Which works only for the first time. Next time onwards no way to cancel the video in case you don't want to install it. It is so frustrating. Either allows to cancel or tell the users what to do next. Worst way of promoting other apps.",
        "It was good but then this happened. I was playing just like any other day. My phone had died while I was playing, so I charged it and left it untouched for about an hour or two. When I signed in, all off my progress was erased! Please respond and tell me what happened.",
        "The game was great than EA got to it with there sticky fingers and put adds everywhere, it isn't the same game I enjoyed ages ago. It's just another add infested game now, even if you do pay for it l. The charm is gone"

So tired of this app closing... Will increase stars once bug fixed. Friends are quitting due to this plus all the items costing RC... Game seems to care more about those who can pay to play... Sad...",
        "What did you guys do! I opened the game and was told to update so I did. When I opened the game it took me all the way back to the beginning. I lost everything.all the coins, all the work I did on the islands. Don't know wat your programmer's did. But it pissed me off. I will not start over.i enjoyed the game played it for years. 700+ days played without interruption.",
        "Very addictive! Some of the missions are impossible to finish without using your real money. Would recommend but with a warning: don't get your hopes up! Takes a very very vey vey long time to make progress if you don't use real money...",
        "I can't believe you wouldn't offer an update to access this app? We the collective have spent hundred of dollars over the course of time. Your suggestion to contact fun plus?? We've been told that Android does not have an update available? Neither can I access the game on my fire. I've spent money throughout 115 levels. I'm sick to my stomach.",

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I've progressed it's just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I'm not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "There is certainly alot to do, but is there really much to DO do? I've just been continually tapping red dots and getting free prizes, which (although nice) doesn't feel like I'm especially earning anything, you know?  Feels like a game that will keep you occupied for maybe months, but a year after you delete it will you really REMEMBER it? Probably not.",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend."

All other puzzle improve your skills but this isn't since you have no time to caulate the expression it's more a test of memory then calculation because you can only 3 star it if you know the expression by heart if you try workout you answer right but run out of time. You should make is so each correct answer adds time so you can accurately l improve. Also most games are broken with not enough time to do the given task and workout same as previous has no buttons so you can't play it.",

Star ratings give the game good replay value, and the workout mode is a nice addition for something short and sweet. Ads can get a bit annoying, but there's not too many and the pro version isn't that expensive anyway. As for the skill-building element, I can definitely see a difference in my attention and reflexes since playing. Overall, I would definitely recommend this game.",

VEARN App is Iegit one which allows earning points just by doing simple tasks like watch advertises,videos and so on. Then you can exchange your points for PYAPAL/PATYM/Gift Cards and there're various options to choose from. Also \"VADZ\" App is perfect for anyone in anywhere who has free time and doesn't wana waste it, you can use it while working,travelling.. simply earning by watching advertisements,videos..",

        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "This game needs balance. Seems like all one does is hide behind shields and gather resources and hope higher might players harvest you for your resources. There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players",
        "Pretty good. 4 stars because I never liked the time it takes to do stuff. I know it is profit making, but I gave 4 stars because it is manageable and they do have lots of free instant completes. This is waaaaaaaaaaay better than clash of clans... JS.",
        "1 l. no more free heroes added,always add paid heroes. 2. no more free castle skin,need topup to upgrade castle skin 3. all latest event just for them who buy something in the shop , no free spin like 1 years ago"

        "I Absoulutely love the update! Each design is so unique! I was wondering, will there be mythical animals as legendarys or, as rare. For example The Aura Wolf, an elemental wolf with feathered wings. If you think my idea is silly, I understand! Also, this game is so smooth and fun! It's a must play! I play it everytime I am stressed or need some fun. Anyway I hope you like my idea, if not it's tottal fine! Keep up on the good work and awesome games! Best of Luck for the future!",
        "Its a pretty good game, the animals look nice, but you should definitely add more if them, like tigers, lions and bears (see what i did there?) And add their appropriate habitats. Another thing i saw was all the juveniles are called cubs. This, i think, should be changed. Wolves have pups, foxes have kits, and lynxes have cubs. There should also ve more diversity and variety in the prey department. Such as bison or elk. Over all i really like the game.",
        "I love it all the other animal games were never as good as this one I love how we can have more than two cubs and we can switch between animals. So I rate it 5 stars 😸 love the game and I would recommend it. But the one problem is that it is so hard to get acorns can you make another way to get acorns . Oh and can you add more animals like tiger🐅.",
        "This is one of the best animal rpg games I've ever played. The only thing I'm confused about is how to get a pup. Both of my wolves are above level 10. The female is level 12 and the male is level 11. I made them fall asleep in the den, but I'm not getting a pup. Could you explain this to me? I'll enjoy the game a lot more if you do.",
        "This is the best game I have ever played and ever will play. I recommend it to everyone. Even if it doesn't look good to you get it its awsome. I think or know you will like it. Also it's so cute and the graphics are awsome. Also everything is priced so well. I love how you add new stuff often. Also you can level up fast, and let go of your purse into a new family. BEST GAME EVER!!!!!,",
        "OMG THE NEW UPDATE IS AWESOME ITS LIKE THEY SAW MY OLD REVIEW AND DID ALMOST EVERYRHING I ASKED THEM TO DO OMG LOL XD GREAT GAME!!! 😁😁😁😁😁😁 COULD NOT B HAPPIER ABOUT THE NEW UPDATE! 😝 Edit: ANOTHER AWSOME UPDATE!!!

        "I really enjoy this game has been the only game that has kept my attention for more than a week. Working on week 3 now, most of the game is free but if you want to grow your port quickly than you will need to play into the game. The game really starts to slow down after level 50, I'm up in the high 60 levels now. I do really enjoy all the quests and they do add bonus quests from time to time to help build up your port.",
        "A fun, easy-going game. No crazy-pace required and easy to advance.  The amount of unique ships is crazy, I think only fan of nautical history would really enjoy this aspect. The list of active ships should be available from your town, instead of only from map view. Other than that, it's quite enj9yable and not a complete time-sucker like many 9ther games. Well done.",
        "I just started the game a couple of days ago, but I'm already hooked.  Like most games, you kind of learn as you move along, but a little more guiding would be very helpful. Thanks for making a fun game! I am having a problem getting past the loading screen though. I tried clearing cache, forced stop, delete files, even uninstalling and reinstalling again.",
        "Easy to learn with loads of variables to keep it interesting. Graphics are stellar. As with most 'free' games, there are lots of incentives for you to get out your wallet; if you're as unwilling to do so as I am, you'll have to be patient. Can't fault the developers. Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat.",
        "If you want a game you can tap on a few things then come back a few hours later, this is it. Not any real goals though so after a while you do feel what's the point but the graphics are good and the events are good too but it needs better goals to help you achieve something. I just do what I want for now. Still play it though",
        "I don't mind spending money on micro transactions if I like the game, and I do like this game.  But the jems in this game are outrageous, if you wanted to buy jems to buy one ship it would cost you $10-$20, depending on the ship.  Because of this, this developer won't be getting any more than the $4 I've spent on it unless they lower their prices."

        "Please add more cars and make the graphics more realistic, and make the sounds of the cars realistic, unique, and smooth. Make each car have its own sound, the sounds they're supposed to have. Add the car stats and add a nitro feature. Add the brand each car is supposed to have. Make the cars spit fire!. Add weather conditions like rain, thunderstorm, lightning, and windy. Please add cars like: Ferrari F50 GT, W Motors Lykan Hypersport, Ferrari FXX Evoluzione, Hennessey Venom GT, Bugatti Chiron, Ferrari FXX K, McLaren P1, Dodge Challenger SRT, Chevrolet Camaro SS, Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4, Lamborghini Veneno, Chevrolet Corvette Z06 C7r, Ferrari 458 Italia, McLaren F1 GTR, even the Devel Sixteen Prototype. Please add these cars on the next update!. If you can, add them in packs!",
        "I can't say I love it,maybe I can. But any way, this would have to be in one of top hundred games😀. There are a few things I would like added though. Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed this😀😁😀😁😀😁.",
        "I think you guys have messed up your game in the past few updates. Seems like there is some memory leak or something. After a while the steering wheel lags so much. Only the input. Graphics don't lag at all. Please fix. Also would be great if you could add some button to start and stop a timer in free mode so we can set time challenges for ourselves. I like the game but it is unplayable after a few minutes after the recent updates",
        "What you should improve is that YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ADD's I MEAN SERIOUSLY I WATCH MORE ADDS THAN THE GAMEPLAY. I ONLY PLAY FOR A LITTLE THEN MOST OF ADDS SHOW UP. I WQ5CH ADDS THAN PLAY8NG THE GAME FOR CRYING OT LOUD!!",

        "This has to be like, my 5th or 6th reinstallment of this game since there's no ingame reset, but darn well worth the data(little bytes). I usually like more realistic car games, but even the \"extreme\" warp in physics in the gameplay doesn't distract from the fun. These are the cars you'd want if you're trying to beat the traffic, run from the cops, or solve a parking dillemma. Great fun time killer! One thing though, the other reviewers are correct in their complaints about how often and when ads pop up. That shouldn't happen smack dab in the middle of a maneuver."

        "I like the game its fun and engaging but the premium choices cost a lot of diamonds and you don't get a lot opportunity to earn them. 12- 18 diamonds for more then a couple  choices in a story to make interesting choices that wouldmake the storys better but you only earn 1 diamond a chapter witch you have to wait an hour or more to unlock or buy keys.  So you pretty much have to spend real money for this game to really enjoy it. Ill be deleting this app not worth my time.",
        "While the game is enjoyable and the stories are intriguing, it is way too expensive to make certain choices. There is absolutely no need for choices to cost 20 or 25 diamonds when you only get 1 diamond for each chapter completed.  This game is in no way good enough to warrant spending real money on it, especially considering the ridiculously high prices of making certain choices which would require making a purchase in every single chapter.",
        "The game is great. Great graphics, nice music, perfectly cued entrees  for new characters, amazing story line.... But they don't give you enough keys or diamonds. I mean, y s its understandable that the chapters are long but 2hrs for a recharge on keys? Really? Either make the waiting time shorter, give us more, or both. Now as for the diamonds, they give you 25 of them. But each special choices is always way to much. And you never really know when your going to need them for something serious. With that said either give us more keys, lower the cost of the choice, or give us more diamonds per chapter. Not like 2 but 5 or more.",
        "It's a brilliant app, though sometimes I wish there wasn't as many gem choices. I fully considered buying gems until I realised how quickly they'd be used.   My favourite story was It Lives In The Woods, though most of the choices are gem choices. The story itself is fantastic, and I love the diversity of characters.   I had a problem with a story playing up and after a chat with the team was told to restart it. I didn't mind but I didn't get any keys to compensate what I'd already spent (I don't buy them I just wait for then to recharge, but it did mean I had to respend keys on one story because of a issue out of my control)   Overall its a great app and highly playable without spending.",
        "Diamond choices come up way too often for how much they cost and how little you get. The keys have an unreasonably long cooldown to get them. Options like watching ads to get diamonds would be a great option, especially seeings how you have that option in HSS and HU:RS. All that aside its a good game. Lots of the stories are enjoyable and its visually pleasing.",
        "Great graphics and great stories. Right now they have like 30 \"books\", so there are lots of options. I've been playing since 2016 and the app just keeps getting better. Can get a little pricey for the preminum choices, but otherwise it's a fantastic app; very additive and entertaining"

A 30 second ad after a run that ended in just a couple seconds? Multiple times in a row? I understand ads needs to be there, but I'd like to have more play time than ad time.",
        "The game itself is pretty fun. I think I'd like it. But the ads are far, far too intrusive. Not only are there too many. But, many of them have timers. Some are 30 seconds, and you can't break out. Too annoying. I have no interest I sitting and waiting for ads to finish",
        "Very enjoyable game, quite addictive and jumping back into a new game is quick. Couple of gripes, there seems to be some slow down or framrate dipping after an ad has shown and the option to remove ads isn't working. Sort this out and it will get another 2 stars",
        "Wow!!!! I've never been more annoyed with an app in my life!!! I would play this game all day long but the amount of ads are literally driving me insane! Two runs and another 15 second ad comes up. No thanks",
        "Ads pop up during gameplay where your fingers contact so it stops game play ... other than that it's good but I've had enough. Fk you chilly:-p uninstalling",
        "This game was my favorite of any maybe ever. I played all the time, then there was an update and I had to uninstall. It made the app close constantly (even when it wasn't even open and I was in other apps), there's way too many ads that make me want to vomit, and it stats to lag now when it never did before. Someone at corporate ruined this game. Smh."

The AI got worse at the same time, so it's not really harder... just more random.  I now find that this game stresses me out instead of helping me relax, so I have to give it up.",

Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!",
        "The game is very fun and progression is steady as you get better, on the downside once you get through your first play through with the app and come back later there are 30 second adds that pop up after every other round or so. A little disappointing but no biggie the game is really quite fun.",
        "I feel like I would really like this game but it is not working on the Android phone. So I have never actually played the game but I have tried to open it up like 50 times.  Every time I tried to open it, it would just lag out right when it was going to show me the home screen.  If this gets fixed then I will play this game and most likely enjoy the game but for now it is awful.",
        "In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it's newer it's boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star",
        "Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can't just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can't advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it's basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.",
        "This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said \"add break\". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them."

        "This game was absolutely perfect and was very much enjoyable, but now to unlock the full experience you have to pay. One of the reasons I enjoy this game and recommended it to my friends is because it is one of the only games that isn't locked behind a paywall. Overall, I have had countless hours playing this game, and trying to land on everything and return successfully. Instead of the microtransaction, why not institute a merit-based system for unlocking parts?",
        "Very great!  Here are a few suggestion from me to make your game more enjoyable :)  1. Can you please make the earth scale correctly because its diameter is around 12.000 km and moon orbit is around 380.000 km  2. Please make a smaller powerful engine like the 9 engines of the falcon 9  3. Please make a button that is simple to cycle from another rocket to another one to ease the attempt of landing a booster  4. Please add an ocean on the earth for some splashdown  5. The last one. Im a free 2 play player and i cant enjoy a majority of the new update :*(",
        "This game is awsome. Loads of fun. Told my friends about it. Could you add a free sandbox mode and more free parts. Thanks. Keep up the good work. Shouldn't have added micro transactions. It just ruined the game for me. Had to take it from a 5 star to a 3 star. Please bear this comment in mind for future updates. This game was 100% free when i downloaded it in december last year. Since then, you added a new build system, free parts which make the game absolutely amazing, and then you add pay for parts. Thats just buzzkill.",
        "Very fast and simple rocket building and great graphics. I wish there was a sandbox mode with infinite fuel. Also there is no indication for loading screens when you hit the launch button. Somethimes you think you tapped the button and end up sitting there for a minute or two wasting time.  Edit So glad they made a small payment option. Well worth the money and glad to support",
        "Great!  Only thing I miss is the ability to rendezvous and dock with another object.  In a moon landing, you could leave a stage in lunar orbit and pick it up for the outbound burn.  Also, karman line should be 100 km??  Edit:. Great updates.  I have no idea how to use docking to reattach parts that have been undocked though.",
        "Can you please add option to center the map on the rocket/vehicle when being in the map mode? It is difficult to switch between near objects in the current version, since I assume the map is stationary relative to the body in which influence sphere we're in at that moment. Also, a \"docking guide\" would be cool in some future update"

        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info.",
        "The game is a lot of fun if you are willing to put A LOT of time into grinding things out. They have made huge changes for just quality of life things, but they have kept the core game the same. Grind, grind, grind, grind, and grind some more. You can get everything in the game just by playing it. No need to pay anything. However it would be a lot easier if you could spend 1000$ on the game every couple weeks lol."

FreeFire Battlegrounds is x50 times better and more simply. Go and die in a hole developers.",
        "It has a lot of bugs, but it's a fun game. It has a lot of potential, if you decide to keep on working on it. One major bug that i've noticed is ITEM DOESN'T EXIST. For instance i saw a Scar laying down on the gorund in Military base and when i tried to pick it up it said \"item doesn't exist\". Fix this please, otherwise, a decent game.",
        "Everything is well put together tmain thing I love is that each area is different from on another like at the school ive had alot of vertical fire fights or power plant or the supermarket. But one thing I think u guys forgot is that the ump 45 takes .45 acp rounds",
        "Controls are terrible. When aiming directly at a player between the crosshairs. Bullets still miss. Terrible game if you're reading this go download rules of survival. That's  what I did. Also sometimes during the middle of a game a loading icon will appear. You won't be able to move or shoot your weapon. You'll pretty much die. When in the safe zone you will still take damage even tho you are in the white circle. To many hackers.",
        "I love this game free fire and this game are my favorite mobile games so far but there should be some changes like you should be able to aim with an iron sight. And the aiming could be better and what I mean by that is aiming is already hard on mobile so I just think stability should be really good without any attachments or like the aiming system on free fire battleground. The graphics are not the best I've seen really just up the graphics a bit and add the ability to aim with a iron sight. Other than those things I love how exciting the game is as well as how close it is to pubg.",
        "Mind Blowing Game..But Could You Guys Please Include \"Voice Chat\" It will Make the game more Awesome.. Its so tough To Contact With Team Mates. In chat box By typing..Please..see in thus matter.. #Devlorpes"

BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it's not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It's just not fair.",
        "A lot of Numberlink programs have \"fake\" puzzles - they have multiple solutions unless additional non-standard \"rules\" are followed... which are NEVER fun. This app doesn't do that. These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.",

I've played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I've tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs",
        "Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.",

The original starts to get boring after awhile, but with all the different variations they come out with, it never gets old. A very fresh experience with one of the recent updates, feels much more refined when compared to the one I used to play.",
        "Simple yet clever, Free Flow is about connecting brightly colored dots together without crossing the lines. With an abundance of board shape, size, variety, and difficulty, there's something in free play to challenge nearly everybody. Those who find even the largest puzzles too easy may alternatively challenge themselves in time trials to finish the boards as quickly as possible."

I thought that the different colours gave you the ability to collect more balls so not really sure what the point of the game is... no way to won or lose ... just click ... I like things with skill... I can handle the ads and would even pay to remove ads if the game have a point.. a purpose a win/lose sort of deal but it's not I don't think I will be keeping this game .. unless they add a little skill to it",
        "This isn't a game. You just hold a button until it disappears and then hold another button... Really. And then there is an option to just have the buttons automatically hold themselves. Then the next level happens and there are new colors, but nothing else is different. Maybe good to keep your baby busy but I wouldn't condone that sort of thing",
        "It's decent. I like the sounds it makes, and the colours look nice too. The forced ads I can't skip after 5 seconds is the annoying part. I get that you need ads, but come on man. I buy 3 upgrades and have to watch a full minute ad. It's like an ad simulator. Honestly if I wanted to play with balls, and watch ads I'd play with my own balls, and throw some ads on YouTube(this part is mostly for humour). Just so you know I'm not salty, annoyed yes, but not salty.",
        "I like the game as it's one when you don't want to think but want to do something. It's very easy. However you watch more ads than you do play the game. So annoying I had to sit through a 1 minute cat chat advert without being able to skip it. Then a 10 second level then another 50 second unskipable ad so annoying",
        "Ads are non skipable which is awful. Skippable ads are ones that pop up that you don't want usually. The full ads like on this game are only usually shown when you are getting a upgrade to a boost or something free etc. Terrible design as you can't win either",
        "I love a stupid game, I really do, not everything has to be top tier strategy or reflex based or whatever  However this is the most boring clicker game ever. At least normal clickers have a theme or SOMETHING to pretend you're doing... Anything at all. Here, you don't even have that. No context, no theme, not even a change of shape or whatever  It's sad gaming has gone this low"

        "Ok so ive been olaying this game for a long time now, but I had to delete the game for storage purposes. Once I game back I logged in with my facebook account and all that but nothing loads. Which is fine I just have to wait. But now my issue is that the actual levels for the wedding event, and the normal quest, it kicks me out of the app and it does thatt every time. Please fix this issue. Maybe then Ill give it five stars.",
        "Great addictive game! Starts out cute and innocent. Recently found out through a spoiler thread that it does take a darker turn in Ch 15. The U.S. servers are currently only on Ch 12. Still a great addicting game that many players start out thinking \"Awesome! A great game that I don't I can have the option to play for free!\" Soon they cave when that ONE outfit comes along that they HAVE TO HAVE lol.",
        "I love this game! It's really good for creative people who like to design their own outfits. I just downloaded on my new phone and started over (I don't have Facebook to link my progress with). Please make it available to link with Google play so I don't always lose progress!   Also, since downloading again, I found that some of the names are different... I was very confused, since the voice over still says the old names. I like Yoko way better than Bobo!!",
        "I loved this game, and am V8. So its not like I am against paying. I am against the ranking event especially since you devs LIED TO YOUR PLAYERS and said we wont be getting one again. We will not pay 100s for a non guarenteed reward. It would be more HONEST, if you set up the suits as 300 USD each recharge.  If you are smart at all, devs you should understand that business ethics is just as important as profit and will benefit everyone in the long run.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events."

        "! GOOD !, Arcade style eat'em up game. Feels ALOT like \"Echo The Dolphin\". Except ur a badass shark! The ONLY hold backs is the controls, but u really can't do much about that problem unless u actually had physical/analog joysticks built n2 ur phone.?. The basic control problems u have w/ ne downloadable games.",
        "Addictive, played for hours at a friends house until 3 in the morning. Got it for myself. Gems are costly, but save up and you can get the baby on the last shark. Then get hungry shark world.",
        "This game was awesome but sometimes I don't like it when my Shark freezes up and who came up with all these sharks? It is a fun game but why are there pressure limits sometimes I don't like it but this game is it for teens it's for everyone it's really fun and well sometimes I don't like it when it takes me a long time to get money for a shark",
        "Love the game but in the last couple days, I'll get into a warp and it'll freeze completely on me. And It truly disappoints me because I could've had so many coins by now. I cannot play the game at all with it not freezing and making me start over.. I don't know if it's a virus or what but I wish it would get fixed."

        "I love the game but three times now it has not given me my diploma for jobs I passed in Hawaii with is keeping me from moving on to the next level.  It's very frustrating.",
        "Nice idea but crashes too often. I like the way you can travel to different countries and learn about different places. Unfortunately it crashes too often",
        "I spent a good amount of time today trying to figure out why I was not getting job diplomas. I pass the quizzes with enough points but it doesn't give me the diploma. I even updated the game just in case. Advice?",
        "Super fun game, play as much as you like, don't have to spend money, travel around the world and learn about different cultures. Usually only very minor loading issues but probably because of my own connection. Add more diplomas!",
        "How do I use vip travel card? It was said that it cover all the trips, but when I want to travel, I have to buy a ticket. I dont understand the purpose of tbe card."

        "I will consider rating the game five stars if you can add new levels and lines, but the \"hearts\" feature forces me to watch ads, even though I paid to remove ads. I will give the game five stars if you gracefully remove the \"hearts\" feature. I'm asking CM a question: \"Will you please change the game back to the original way we played it? And add new levels? 'The Easter' would be creative, and the diamonds can be eggs. How about an Easter Bunny line? I like all the new levels, and the new lines we can unlock. Can you add more remixes to the levels? There are only 3 existing remixes, if CM had forgotten.\"",
        "I originally had it as 5 stars, but I noticed the longer that I've had the game, the more bugs I'm starting to see. Sometimes the music won't line up with the levels, which is the point of the game, and other times the game won't register my touch and will screw up my progress. If this gets fixed that would be great, and I'd move the rating back to 5 stars!",
        "I really wish you guys didn't update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can't listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!",
        "Amazing game... Loved it...😍 The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it'll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it's okay 😊",
        "The game starts off really strongly and the concept is unique and the music is fabulous.. but later on things get so progressively difficult it makes flappy bird look like a piece of cake... And in the later on levels there's not much sync between the music and the cube it's really hard to play... I enjoyed it initially but now I'm just going to uninstall it...",
        "This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn't as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn't there but now it's forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads."

        "On level 2185, had over 800 different boosters and suddenly all of them are gone, serious glitch in game... emailed their tech center for over 1 week now and only get a automated response and nothing from a real person. Wasted 3 years of time and data on this worthless app.... recommend not installing or uninstalling it... customer service sucks",
        "Ive played this game a long time. New update and instead of making the game better you screw your customers. I lost all my boosters and you expect me to continue? If nothing else its a matter of principle. You punish me by taking everything ive bought and earned, ill punish you by never giving you another dime and i will let everyone i know who plays or asks about any of your games ro stay away.",
        "Would love to give a better rating, but after the most recent update the game has very bad lag, worse than the usual lag it's always had. Updating this. Was hoping update today would fix the lag. It didn't. Also, adding 2 extra steps in order to replay a stage sucks. You know the old saying; if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
        "In places with bad connection the facebook popup bug is also annoying and causes you to have to restart, losing lives and the streak. And having to click different buttons to confirm to end a game is stupid design.",
        "EDIT: Update on 3/22/18 fixed NOTHING! New levels still locked as well! Worst update in candy crush history. Riddled with bugs. It didn't add new levels like it should have. Unlimited boosters don't appear on level when they should. And boosters are no longer allowed on lower levels. I'm at level 2100 something. I should be able to use boosters when ever I want! And I should be able to have unlimited boosters appear on all levels, not just when they feel like it. Fix and I will give more stars.",
        "So frustrated with all the candy crush games. I periodically get angry enough to quit for awhile,  but end up back. Why am I upset? I was just in the middle of a rare winning streak and had earned a number of special candies to start games with. I was up to 2 hour on the fish, multi color candy, and the juicy jawbreaker, with 3 hours of life. Suddenly,  i still had the life but all other rewards disappeared. This is far from the first time. I am tired of it. I am removing the king games and I am not coming back this time. I get glitches happen but I have never had any  Indication  that anyone gives a damn. No one makes anything right or even says,  sorry. I'm ok with a game having issues but I am not ok with being treated less than."

Then I noticed that they changed the looks and now it looks horrible and stupid I was disappointed by this plus to many damn ads! PS unupdate the app the older version was better the new one sucks!!",

I might get another game similar to this one but i will have to erase this one. Also, it only gives you a little bit of time.",
        "The game itself is pretty good. But the thing is, there is a point to where it is to much ads. I bet that u make money every time some1 sees an ad on in your game, but u won't make any money if that person stops playing the game because of how much ads. I have been playing this game for 10 minutes and already come across around 100 ads. I might take away some of that cash income because the amount of ads Is insane. Would u rather make No Money, or A decent bit of money?",
        "The game could be better if you tone down the ads a bit more... Maybe 10 games one ad? Or maybe more? Its really annoying when you get ads every end of the round."

        "To anyone saying the magnometer should be free; no, it shouldn't.  You guys are requesting it be free because it is in demand, which is exactly why it is for sale.  Parents don't let you buy things on the app?  Good. The magnometer is something EXTRA that is absolutely not necessary for the app to function.  Sure, it can help make the right move; that's why you have to pay for it... Without the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app.  With the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app and paying for it to help analyze your moves.  You are not entitled to a free move analyzer to help guide you simply because you want it to be free.  That's not how economics works, hate to break it to you.  There are many, many ways to analyze moves, positions, and get better at chess; the Magnometer is not and will never be the best way to do so. It is simply an added convenience that you can choose to pay for to help you find or analyze a move/position.",
        "Feels great to have a simulated match with a Magnus-like computer AI opponent. Will definitely destroy you even at the lower age levels. The only thing I don't like in the app is the gray color graphics of the board and the chess pieces. The upside about this is you can surely change that setting if you got the appropriate in-game currency to purchase a different color scheme, with some playthroughs that are needed first to be able to get them.",
        "You know this is the best chess app. The magnus tuned engines works great. You actually improve with each passing day. Few points too. I would have given it 100 stars if possible if the graphic would have been better. The graphic you know, like black and white makes a very depressing combination. Also an option for online game with others would make it a perfect app.",
        "Sound effects and graphics are distractingly poor. Missing basic features like turn confirmation. You can see a video on YouTube of Magnus himself making a mistake in placing a piece using this app.",
        "This chess game is very good, I would give it five stars except for an internal error that will not post my record of wins, losses and ties against Magnus. Maybe I fried the memory with all my losses...😁",
        "the engine is actually good, I gave that 1 star for that, yet the interfaces are sluggish, very clunky, slow, and you can't even change the default board colors without playing a lot of this, with ridiculous brainpower credits.  it's slows down my new smartphone too much when another chess apps are practically lightweight. and without good sides such as analysis or online multiplayer matches."

        "It's good. A decent game that forces you to grind and wait, OR you could spend money to buy gold to open more chests. I would have given it 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that to watch ads to get rewards, I have to give it my LOCATION, ALLOW IT TO MANAGE MY CALLS, and access to my media. Why do you even need my location and phone number to watch an ad for rewards?",
        "Love this time killer. Its a simple game, simple concept. Easy to learn the controls by yourself, and unlock stuff. Simplistic graphics, and will most likely run smooth in any device. Now, the only issue here is, that unlocking a chest is a tad bit too expensive, and gaining coins and stars are a bit hard. Tho, i havent unlocked quests yet, so i dont know. Either way, Awesome game, cant wait for future updates, and i really hope the devs will add new worlds, characters, weapons and customisations maybe?",
        "I love this game in every way. It's a great time killer and it's fun to collect the helmets. The chests don't wait too long to open and the challenges keep you from just messing around. My only complaint is the lack of creativity in the weapons. If I work hard enough to get a new helmet I would like to see at least one unique weapon per helmet. Instead it is a different combination of the regular weapons.",
        "As a 3D MMORPG dev it is hard to find something that is enjoyable on this damned store. However your combination of simplicity mixed with a variety of prefabs and abilitys alongside particles and everything else make this an excellent game. You dont spam ads, you don't make it incredibly difficult and you don't make it pay to win.  A tip of my hat to you guys. I would give this 5 stars if I didn't have a buck fifty skins in my face all the time....",
        "Great game......the only problem in this game is that the lack of information about a weapons..... i wish their are something like a short tutorial about the types of weapons or a short video on what happen if the weapon equiped..... since the game is just currently launch... its normal that it has minor bugs.... but please fix it as soon as the updates come....for a summary: A reallly great game and entertaining",
        "I enjoy the gameplay and various unlock/progression mechanics, but the game is extremely laggy. It may be my device, however. Also, some hitboxes seem to be mercilessly accurate and it can be very frustrating. That may not be something to change, but definitely something to note."

        "Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I'll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx",
        "I couldn't get enough patients, I couldn't get enough cash, and my staff energy seemed to drain way too fast. I love the surgery games but you maybe get one of those a day. I ended up uninstalling when room upgrades said they would take 12 hours. Too much waiting, not enough action. I liked the story so far too. Maybe I'll reinstall in the future if the times go down.",
        "It's a great game at first, but it takes so long to upgrade or save money or anything that you end up spending a lot of your real life money. Plus the surgeries all start to be the exact same, and the glitches... oh, the glitches. Zapped $200,000 out of my bank, and that bloody epinephrine shot is impossible to get without striking out. Oh, and $120,000 for research that will only make you $4,000? Why is everything so time and resource consuming???",
        "Controls don't work properly during surgery! There is lot of lag while performing an action while the timer works properly. Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "Love the overall feel of this, though some things need tweeking. For example, I only have half of the staff available and am now getting far too many duplicate cards concidering how many I have left to get. Makes it feel all too much like it's pushing people to spend real money, something that always ends with me deleting the game and moving on. Hope this doesn't happen in this case, but I'm not holding my breath...",
        "It's a nice game, I like the concept, you get to operate on patients and manage a hospital. Problem with the recruitment part, it was always giving me surgeons and wasted 200 hearts on the same person. There should be an option if you want to fire someone or replace with another staff. The biggest issue is with their connectivity, internet connection is very stable works with all apps except for this one, no idea why. Fix it please I would hate to delete this game. Thanks."

        "Its perfectly awsomely COOL Im already level 27 and i have all of the ninjas but can u please add more space for the other ninjas? That cant get in even we need them somtimes we play it and we need a ninja and its not in the box to pick a ninja you will jut restart the game. Anyways but i still love it Ninjago is my  favorite have you guys watch the ninjago movie even there episodes. Thank you for creating this game.👍👍👍👍👍👍",
        "I'm a big fan of lego ninjago♥. Its just hands of time I fight serpentine and when master Wu spoke I saw a timeblade. When I was chilling looking at my mission's then Lloyd hacked into Zane's computer he said something I just have a bad memory.",
        "I think if you could add a few extra spaces for more ninja then everybody would be happy .the reason I'm giving this app a 4 star rating is because you can only have up to five ninja on a mission including your own .if anybody would like that to happen then give this review a thumbs up.",
        "I love the game it's fantastic but one thing can you please have the feature to ride the vehicles or make your own customer vehicle and could you please add where the ninjas are actually following your character",
        "I think the controls are horrible because I Am left handed and you've got to use your right hand to go forward and there is not much of fighting or ningargo feeling",
        "No controller support on Android TV. Very buggy playing on a tablet. Character gets stuck behind/in objects and you have to kill the game..."

        "Why I liked it? Because it's a simple game that doesn't make you addicted to phone but rather enjoy going forward focusing your attention entirely on your finger. What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven't listened to this game's. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I'm entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.",
        "I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it's meant to be \"skillfull\" but thats harder than skillfull, you can't even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don't care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.",

What is a difference if I buy better worker or he evolve? Maybe to include waiting for raw material after order? Include different sizes of workshops? I have some other ideas as well",
        "This game is really well done. The tutorial teaches you everything you need to know. Its an amazing game and its very fun for killing time. As a machinist my self I like the aspects it puts into play. So good job to the developers its a great game.",
        "What you see is it. Very simple game. Very simple practice. Just s classic build up your base, buy more expensive stuff to make you more money. I don't recommend to download it because of gameplay but because of it's amazing sound track. I LOVE LOVE the techno one that has a very short guitar rift in there. It's music is probably the best for a mobile game and definitely worthy of being a big mainstream soundtrack.  I read some of the reviews. A lot of these people probably aren't smart enough to pour piss out of a boot let alone operate their phone. There is a simple tutorial and even then it's easy to operate. It's not hard to make money like some people it is. Don't spend all your money at once, dumbass.",
        "Irony, factory efficiency game with no automation, zero, none. If you want automation pay $$$. If you want more in game coins pay $$$ so if you cant afford automation and you cant afford currency games done for you. Cant make your own premium currency without paying either. Just a free demo app at this point.",
        "I like the game just wish it was not over priced  There is a machine that will cost me 4000 gold and if i was to buy it cost me 80 bucks real cash to get it with only 1000 left over thats crazy high it be nice to have flash sales that would make more money for the game but also would be nice to have a cash or gold option when buying  The new machines and it be nice if some  Machines you buy will produce gold without spending cash  On the machines that will. lowering the price would be a big plus and a lot more people would be willing to buy cuz my saying is a fast dime is better then a slow Dollar so if they was to lower price they would make a lot more money faster just my opinion and it would be cool if you could do customization to work uniform and do a little bit of customization in the game just my thought on it",

        "Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it's just my phone. Also I'm not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)",
        "I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the \"mine\" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it's nicely done!",
        "I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.",
        "Overall the app is really great. It's the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you're not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.",
        "Input delays keep getting me killed. Instead of marking a bomb my input sets it off. I'd prefer two different inputs for marking or removing tiles.  I'm using a stylus too so I know it's not an issue of accidentally hitting the wrong tile.",
        "Great game. Love it! Sometimes the flag wouldn't place when you pressed a square, and once it selected a square instead of placing a flag, but I still really liked it. Wish there was a zoom because the mini square field is a ton of fun, but a bit small for my fingers. I still love the game though!"

        "I don't mind ads, but one after every round is excessive, especially when you can't skip them. Perhaps consider only ads you can't skip when requested, like for bonuses and prizes. I've quickly come to love this game, but I also love plenty of games who get by on much less frequent and interfering advertising. . You're generic response doesn't address anything I said except the target word \"ads.\" I'm talking about ads you can't skip after many levels.  Save the unskippable ads for when we choose to watch them.",

        "One of the best bubble/ball shooter games. And yes very addictive.  Only 2 negatives... bubble at the bottom unable to move to the left or right as in another favorite game. Secondly there is a creepy ad or something dark that pops up periodically between games.",
        "Between every level guess what? Ads, ads and more adds . I hate it! I understand that ads will help you as developer somewhat but how it will help you if we , users going to instantly uninstall your app and rate it low? Maybe it is time for a different aproach since it is abosolutely anoying that level of ads?",

First adds would take forever to play then they wouldn't play at all and it would freeze up till you closed it out then my whole phone froze up has NEVER happend before. I UNINSTALLED this game and my phone is back to normal. Not worth screwing up your phone. It's a bit fun but there are other games out there.",

Now had to start again (which is not such a big problem), but then the game glitches and I don't get anything for leveling. Meaning I can't get past car level 4 anymore, because there are simply not enough parking spaces. Will give 5 stars if this gets fixed.",

And now it's take me to spam pop ups. Ugh. Gave it  another try anf This one still has potential...but for now it's getting deleted again.",

        "This game is so awesome. Everytime my sister clocks im on my phone she starts screaming then suddenly she stops. Why? Because i just gave her the phone and she's playing this game. Love it so much plz make another game like that ive got another sister whos 1 and is gonna start screaming too soon😁😁",
        "Amazingly Awesome!!! Dear Entertaining One,Your Game is Really Nice.But,if you can,please add more characters in the next update like Mommy Pig,Daddy Pig,Grandma Pig and Grandpa Pig because I want to see what they do,like Peppa and George.Both siblings oink or laugh,and that's why I want to add more characters.Even though I'm 10,this game is awesome!

After this last update I lost slot. It started off awesome but once I started investing money in the game it's like it just took my money by taking the gifts and coins.  Such a waste of time and money when no corrections are made.  Trying to give the developer a chance to redeem themselves from this error.",
        "I like the idea of changing prices and finding new recipes. I want the barista to automatically start the machines if there isn't one already there. i want to be able to hire another barista. I want to put my menu on the other wall. I want smaller windows. There's basically a lot of things i feel limited on and i still haven't figured out if i can change the color on wallpaper or not.",
        "I watched the 4 adverts and got a no diamonds for the doing so. I also watched the the add to pick a bonus prize, never got a that either. I used to play this game a lot and I've noticed the prices of everything have went up and including the spices. You no longer have the option to buy the cheaper furniture forcing you to spend more so customers come in to the Cafe. Very greedy and game makers. Sort these issues and give me the diamonds I'm owed or take away the ads.",
        "I'm used to like this game very much, addicting and lovely although it is so p2w. After certain update my game will start to reverse progress itself when one message pop out and state \"profile change, please restart\". Recently this problem occur very frequent and its so unbearable and irritating when what u done it just become undone, ALWAYS.  Im so fed up with this and quit for few days, wish developer can fix or lessen this issues or i will just uninstall it one day, thanks for reading.",

        "Lost all of my bikes when I re-download the app. It shows the 500+ wins I have, but I don't even see a way to get the basic ones unlocked again without paying for their stupid VIP package. It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven't bothered to update this in years.",
        "This game is AMAZING. YOU DEFINITELY need it. There is only 1 thing that I hope this game will have, I really want them to have CPU's on multi-player and on tournaments and duels because it says check your internet connection when I try to play them. But still this game is the best. So if you're searching for a game just get BIKE race and you probably won't need any other game.",
        "Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can't stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn't happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can't buy any of the bikes.",
        "It's a fun little game at first, but has many, many flaws. You have to link it to your Facebook account if you wanna play all maps. There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can't play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That's just ridiculous. Not to mention it's very buggy. Sometimes you're racing someone who's in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it's just stupid.",
        "Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you're racing friends.",
        "Fun game but its lame the only bikes that have boosted stats are super expensive. And it's really dumb that the stats don't scale up with the cost of the bike. They have a range of 100 to 350 with the ultra bike and 300 for the super bike, that leaves plenty of room for various speed levels. The helmet and trick type perks are cool but not enough of an incentive. Need more to play, pay, or fight for."

        "Amazing game!! I have purchased 1 or 2 bikes already, I would even pay to get new bikes, but it is very expensive. Please consider lowering to prices or making better bikes more accessible. Ive been stuck on the same level for 5 weeks. I want to continue playing but im loosing intrest not being able to advance. Maybe you could trade your old bikes in to get something in return for a newer bike. Im sure you will never read this, but you do have something special here! Thanks",
        "Very fun BMX pump game. Seen a few reviews say it's gets impossible after level 3 when it becomes pay to win. I don't agree I've just reached level 8 in a few hours. If you ride bikes off road and understand how to pump you'll love it",
        "Its way to hard to win and and the stats do nothing.  You have to be perfect and even then they fly by.  Still LOVE this game.  Just takes away the fun when you get left in the dust and you play the same lvl a million times hoping maybe one time you will be perfect.",
        "I loved this game for 3 days. Then it got to the point where I couldn't beat a level without upgrading my bike, but I couldn't upgrade my bike without spending real money. So disappointing. Don't waste your time if you don't want to spend real money!",
        "The game is fun up until around the third level. After that it becomes near impossible to win any races without spending actual money to upgrade your bike. Had a lot of fun with it up until that point, but it's definitely not worth spending actual money on. Deleted the game after pay to win clearly became a necessity.",
        "It was fun for a while - until it becomes impossible to beat any opponents with your current bike. The difficulty spikes around level 7 and the process of buying a new bike or upgrading your existing one becomes very frustrating, as you can't win any races to earn any money."

        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",

        "Would be nice if there was a redo button for the last move. I'm very quick when playing and I often misplace a block. Also, why does the Apple version have stars and the android version doesn't? I was trying so hard to earn enough stars to buy the colour packs on my iPod, and I got quite disappointed that I can't do that on android. I guess I'll just delete the game off android since there's really no goal to the game now.",
        "Very fun and addicting but nice calm relaxing game. Ads only happen after each round and not a big deal. If you want to keep playing this game FREE then add up with the package. Quiet whinning about ads. Someonbe has to pay the creators for this game including the upkeep and updates. How else will the creator make his money? 2 choices, either gets ads or charge to download. So I can deal with the ads. It's a FREE APP.",
        "Way too many ads. I just need something for my fingers to do while listening to podcasts but this constantly interrupts my listening pretty much after every round. I really liked the game but I have had it with thw ads and am uninstalling. It's just not worth it.",
        "I really like the game but as many others have said their are too many ads. Ads after every round and sometimes in the middle of the round which makes you start over and that gets annoying. Too many of thr same ads. I also agree their needs to be a redo button. It does get a bit pintle after you hit the goal but still fun.",
        "Too many adds, and it makes me restart every time an add plays, I've only had this app for 1 min, and have already played 50 rounds... Not. Cool. I would be okay with the adds if I could at least pick up on where I last left off.",
        "I'm not quite sure what's happened to this game. It's very straightforward and strangely addictive. However, just today after Android's OS update, it performs much worse. Where before when you pick up a block, it is elevated slightly above your finger so you can see where it's going, now it's just under your finger, making this game frustratingly impossible. If this is due to an interaction with the OS update, then 1010 is due for it's own update."

        "This game is my 5 yr olds favorite thing to do during trips. She loves the music and animation, and the gameplay is entertaining enough to keep her engaged. It's definitely worth the few bucks to get the add free version.",
        "Pay to play mechanic. Seems rather predatory for a game targeted for younger CHILDREN. Not to mention the constant barrage of ads that can only be removed by paying for ponies which shouldn't be EA'd. Outside of that the game is enjoyable but the paywall issue is a problem. Devs... you should feel bad about yourself.",
        "Remove the paywall and just charge for the game, it's worth it and people will buy it. But the way you can't unlock ponies without paying is insulting. Such a shame... I'll be sure to avoid any games you make in the future. And, yes, that's a bit harsh. But if we all don't stop letting devs get away with this kind of thing every company will turn into EA and will ruin the fun of gaming.",
        "Installed it, launched it, after the bungie screen was presented by a full screen ad for some game involving a woman + handcuffs + panties. Not a good look for a game aimed at children, my 6 year old was standing behind me.",
        "Why advertise the game as \"free\" when it really isn't?  You can only get so far with the \"free ponies\" before you hit a pay wall that requires parents to purchase additional ponies to finish the quest.  The reason I say \"free ponies\" is that your child is subjected to a ridiculous amount of ads in order to play. The only way to get rid of the ads is to buy the ponies.  Even though my daughter loves the game and it's easy for a 5 year old to play, I had to uninstall it due to the ad content.  You really should be more careful who you solicit ads from for content designed for children under 8."

        "Great game, me and the family enjoy it immensely and we have all made our contribution, thank you. The controls in card battles on the phone are too fiddly, considering there is a lot of unused space on the screen: this would have been developed differently if it wasn't attempting to mimic the desktop version. Lazy! Is the \".. playing over WiFi...\" warning still relevant? Unlimited mobile data and 4g means many of us have as good a connection as fixed line. Love the game, thank you.",
        "This is an awesome game I play it be very day and I had two games I would always play now I don't even play them at all because this game is so awesome and I kinda play it to much.  But I did get my last account deleted for some reason I was mad and couldn't get it back so I had to create a new one",
        "Everytime I play a club arena game (free every 24hours) it will keep telling me i disconnected from the game while my Internet connection is fine. But when I play other normal arena games, it turns out fine. I find it very annoying because i have to wait 24 hours to play my favourite club games and it always disconnects, and it makes me mad. I hope you notice this comment and leave a reply... Please fix this... Thanks :(  Edit: It works fine now, thank you! :)",
        "Very fun game, my most played game by far but the major issue in this game is hackers. You get good and start to play the end gamers and realize 90% of them are bots with millions of coins and as soon as the game starts you are sent balloons to your side that cannot be activated until round 15+! It's frustrating to earn my coins legit just to have them taken by all the hackers and bots. Ruins the game when makers aren't doing anything about it.",

Got 3 stars got 3 stars but when I went to go to the next level it show only 2.   Levels 8 thru 12 I won first time. Level 13 I lost and the same thing happened as level 7.  Other than that I really like the game.  Very cute graphics.",
        "I get to No. 1400 and it stalled. I've tried everything and it says I failed. It states I have so many balls, but when I shoot 5 or 6, I am out, and then it says I failed. I would loved to go further, but will Uninstall until it is fixed. I really wanted to see just how far I could go.",

        "I love to play hold em, but it's just to hard to round up the posse for poker night due to simply getting older. Life takes everyone n different directions. Not too mention, having kids and getting married, doing the family thing. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love living the family life with my wife and kids but I will always miss poker night with the fellas. Now that I have stumbled upon WSOP I have been able to invite all of the fellas to join and we can all play together still once again. THANK U!!!!",
        "Seen to many players leave because of this. Players with over a billion in chips. Goes to a small table with players having 30k or 40k. Goes all in every hand and kills the table. Players ask him why he does it and not play bigger tables. His answer because game allows me to and I can knock out player after player. Regulate players if they have X amount of chips play on bigger tables. Let the smaller players gain chips and enjoy the game.",
        "It appears that I have reached a certain point where my free play is being met with bot resistance. I've gained over ten million in one day and lost it all and more in suck outs. This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you'd have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun",
        "Win a bit and loose everything in a few hands...  Once you win a good hand, leave the table.  Dealer will not give a a chance.  After this review, I received an e-mail from the designer assuring me, that game is fair.  I have been losing several hands with pocket KK, QQ, JJ, and so for.  So I stand with my original review.   Win on a good hand and leave game.  Or else you will lose it ALL!",
        "This is a good game , only prob I have is there seems to some hackers/botting which makes it a little hard to play. Now as far as some people's comments even if the  people with a billion chips come to smaller tables , if you all knew how to play you wouldn't have to worry about them taking your chips. Trust me the majority of them started out at low tables also having to have to fight the ones with more money. I have been playing this game for a few years and love it.  Like I said only problem I have is to many bots/hackers.",
        "I really enjoy this game .At first I just added it for one of the games on app like to gain points for gift cards.And of course to learn how to play poker. Now if their no points given for this game I would still play it. I totally enjoy this game , and the people that play it. Its truly an enjoyable game. This game is a keeper know matter what.tthe only thing I wish is that their was more coins given ."

The only down side is that the spins cost alot of coins and those coins can be hard to earn. So 4.5 stars i would rate it is that was a option but its not so i rate it a a big fat 5",
        "this game is the bomb. it is stupid that they asked you is this game beautiful, of course not, people die, and crack their necks, backs, and shoulder blades. This game all in all soooooooo fun and you should totally get it. just say no if you want to write a reaport on this game because it will ask you is this game is beautiful which it is not. GOOD LUCK, good  night, new york city. at late night talk show with stephen colebert......jk",
        "Would rate give starts, but the amount of ads is absolutely ridiculous. I'm actually thinking about uninstalling please fix that. I know you want players to pay but in all actuality, it's quite stupid. Anyway, I do believe the game is quite fun",
        "Whatever they did last update broke the game for me, this is why I never buy anything in these games. No way to contact anyone to resolve any problems.  Game gets boring anyway",
        "I love this game a lot. The only problem is that when you do the Dailey spin, you only get like coins. And then with the coins you can buy another spin which is what I do. And I get even more coins. It's really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and",
        "It's a really good game and works really well. The only thing I don't like is how the cost of the daily spin goes up every time. It is quite annoying. Other than that I really enjoy playing this game. Great job guys😀"

But when I'm connected to Wi-Fi there's too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you'll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I'm playing the game??!! It's too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.",
        "Well before I say my review, I would like to clear out a few of the negative reviews. There are not very many ads at all, in fact I barely ever even get any. Second, the controls don't suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.",
        "I don't know why the controls have a 3.7 rating, they're actually pretty good. The gameplay's decent and the graphics are too. Btw I get over 600 score everytime just to let you know because the controls quote on quote \"barely move the car\"",
        "I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don't you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?",
        "THIS GAME IS THE WORST!!! Save yourself some time and DON'T install this thing I can barely move the car so please make easier to control. I know your trying but I,m sorry I,m uninstalling this game.",
        "It's stupid. It's really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn't turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked."

        "I have loved Hot Wheels for years and this is a good game. Fun and challenging. However I have been a bit frustrated because sometimes I just explode for touching a wall like on level 6. Awesome😒 Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don't reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie's handling. You killed it, literally. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.",
        "The game is good. There are problems though. D-muscle is absolutely useless. It's the worst car in the muscle set and has no business being the fourth car in that set. The final upgrades for the fourth car on all sets are far too expensive. It requires an insane amount of grinding to unlock the last cars. The prices of supercharged upgrades are all over the place. Why do all of Haulinator's cost 100 coins while Dune It Up's cost 1000-2000?",
        "Good graphics. If you fail and do exact same again you may pass level if you level up car, you end up failing sooner and have to slow down but after trying 7 r 8 times gets annoying and the level up car is worse than your basic car. Too frustrating so deleting",
        "Game would be good if the dev's took time to work out the huge amount of bugs. Everytime I run this, I get 3 races deep then everything stops responding. Running it on Samsung Galaxy S9+ with perfect cell service. All the buttons click but do nothing. Uninstalled.",
        "Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I've never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.",
        "My 2 almost 3 year old and I really like this game. It's pretty fun BUT it seems to freeze up after a few races and I have to shut the game off and restart it to play more. This obviously frustrates little man and I'm sure I'm not the only one this has happened to. Other than that, we think it's a great game."

Awesome. :P Net connectivity is as good that when other apps show good connection under high speed wifi, ot shows no connectivity. Lol",
        "Freakking great. Best chess app EVER!!!!. I have the free one and it can teach you tactics, help you in situations and if you dont want that no need to do it. You can even costumize your wallpaper or theme. Skill ratings 100-2600 playing real people. Or you can play a computer, 400-1200 or 1400 i think. Great app, get it you wont regret it.",
        "I think this app is horrible simply.. I'm a diamond member, but I don't think i will be for much longer. There's other chess sites that don't disconnect and lag so much. Main dislikes is the constant disconnection, no order at all in the videos section. Tactics, lessons and drills bugs and crashes when turning the mobile or screen goes off. Specially drills bugs and just repeats the same one over and over when you finished instead of going to the next one. Also, app was unhappy I was logged in on my turned off computer.. come on..",
        "I cannot respond to chats. The support team promises they will fix the issue, but it's only lies so that I can give the app a decent rating. Now my custom board, pieces, and background settings get reset every 2 days. Frustrating app.",
        "The last update sucks! Premove is not at all intuitive. It now just shows the block which we want to move the pawn and doesn't move the pawn itself like before. The toast message that showed 'challenge rejected' was better than the current one. Dislike it!!",
        "I have no connection issues but some times game discontinues with showing no n/w.pls solve otherwise good game Finally uninstalled... Worst team."

        "Awsome game. Completed all levels without any hack jzt waited  for hope   ( the lives ) evrbdy shld try this. Sry i gonna uninstall this app only bcoz i finished all levels. Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.",
        "The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don't get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new \"enemies\". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you've lost some lives. But that's not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.",
        "I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It's more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.",
        "Remember the old days when platformers taught you through trial and error how to interact with new game mechanics? If you don't like that, you'll hate this game. So much fun, so creative, and once you start to get down one of the new features, it ramps it up and keeps you learning creatively how to beat the level. I love this game, it's a fantastic platformer that will challenge you to learn as you go instead of giving you a tutorial every time something new comes up.",
        "Completed all but just couldn't get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I've ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.",
        "I love this game 😍😍 it is my favourite but.... I don't like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it's a great idea😋😋 btw i loved it 😍😍😍 ill give it 5 stars then😊😊"

Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don't register as pineapple hits for the counters. There's a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it",
        "Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.",
        "Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.",
        "Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.",
        "BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn't have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What's bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I'm not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game.",
        "How can I say this? I can not stop playing this!! Everytime I set a new and higher record I want to achieve and I only stop until I get there xD atm with 6400 coins and everything unlocked 😁😁 please release new content for months and months!! It will make me so happy! Thank you for this game."

Im sick of every level with just only themes",

It turned out to be good I was happy and thought it would turn out well. Then after that I remembered pvz one. It's multiplayer mode was much better. One player would be plants and the other zombies. Why could they not have made that. It was such a good idea. I would personally play that mode more than this. But it's just my opinion. Thanks for reading.",
        "Since last update it is very unstable and keeps crashing. Also every time i finish the last inzanity it crashes then once reloaded says expired so ive lost out. In fact im not that interested anymore. Im not a fan of battlez and it all seems geared to that now so had fun while it lasted.",
        "I HATE YOUR UPDATE. Battlez mixed battle between players who bought plants with money with the players who don't is totally unfair. There are many players out there like me who play everyday collecting coins by coins and gems by gems patiently waiting for a good plant offer that we can buy with gems. Buying plants with money is not on the budget. I'm not angry. I'm sad. Because PVZ is always one of my top listed games. Now it's pathetic. Crashed. Unfair. Expensive.",
        "Just like.But EA just want money right? You just wasting money.Money cause something bad.This wirld need to follow the truth path.Not money path.I dont like those plant,pinatas and more that need to buy with money.Useless."

        "This is an extremely fun game. O have a few suggestions on how to fix things on the game. I noticed three things while playing this game. 1. There is not a continue playing option. This can easily be fixed and with all of the great work from Dvloper I think that this is not too far away. 2. I noticed you can uncrouch in the tunnel in the basement even though you are not all the way through. 3. Everything is in a certain place. If one object is in a certain place then if you are familiar with the game enough you will know where the other objects are. To be honest this is not a minor concern but still could be fixed. Other than that I can't stop playing! Thank you so much!!",
        "I love this game, especially when you hide just in time and there's that tense moment wondering if she saw you. I get chills down my spine when I'm hiding and I hear her saying \"I see you\". If I could, I would give this game 100 stars. I would suggest having a mode after you beat Granny to become Granny because I think it would be cool to chase the player around the house. Also, I think the game would benefit from a much bigger house, more drawers and of course, more locks. Love the game, keep up the good work.",
        "It's really really really fun game.  But I think if you guys do some more improvements so it will be much fun.  Here's what I think:  1. I think you should make the house much bigger.  2. You should add more enemies for example:  child o' slenderina,  slenderman and the spiders.  3. You should add an Adventure mode.  Where you need to find some books or something like an emblem like that stuff to make them uncursed like that.  4. Last but not least, you should add more weapons for example:  Pistol,  sword,  injection etc.    If you do that,  it will be super cool and fun.   ThanQ 😃👍",
        "It's definatly one of the better (more fun) horror games on the store, but I feel like there could be some more improvements. Firstly I think that if you've completed hard than there should be an (almost) impossible mode. Also minor details such as different textures and Easter eggs would be good. Last, I think that when you escape there should be an outside section where it's still got puzzles but it's more about the atmosphere. (Maybe that could just be for the \"impossible mode\") but it would make the game a lot more enjoyable. Also maybe a reward for escaping. (For incentive). Thank you and maybe you could take this into consideration :) also new app icon plz",
        "Who doesn't love this game? It's bone chilling and exciting for the whole family (Litterally my whole fam plays this game) it would be cool to have a mode where there was no granny just to explore the house and get a feel for how to escape. Also some weapons to attack granny. Lastly a map of where granny is would be super cool. Good luck!",
        "It's a vary good game so hood i can't believe it's on mobile game! Also the game mechanics are so amazing as well. Then there's series of things you have to do that keeps you in the game for a long time; the theme and music fit the atmosphere, and there's not much of a problem with the game either. \"This game gives me goosebumps!\" (From Dashigames aka Dachi) he loves it as well too. #goodgamemakemore"

        "Love it to pieces. The characters are loveable and the stories are fun. I got through three to four in a few days I can't put it down. The only downside is certain decisions cost gems. Major ones are fine and expected but to have to be a jerk to someone because you don't have enough kind of sucks a little. But it's not often and by no means a deal breaker.",
        "Actually, I came here because I'm a fan of Jakayla Toney. I'm a reader from wattpad, and I'm checking out her story here as game. 😂 Anyways, I finished one chapter and I'm enjoying so far. Gotta check out other book after I'm done. Looking forward to this app, though I don't really like the choices costing gems.But its okay, still like it. 😊",
        "Every GOOD choice involved money.  Hard to find one interactive story game that doesn't involve money so much.  I don't mind paying for extra bonus scenes in the end but at least give us some GOOD selection WITHOUT charging!  Then maybe I'll rate it higher",
        "I'm frustrated by the fact that this is supposed to be a choose your own adventure game, but all the choices that make the most sense to me are stuck behind a paywall, requiring me to purchase those choices with a currency called diamonds. I get the story passes, and I would have been fine if that was the only barrier to read the story, but to require you to pay money for making what you feel are the right choices is just greedy.",
        "The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the chapters update too late that you lose interest and sometimes forget what's happening in the story. If the chapters were to update on a regular basis then readers would feel the need to keep this app and will constantly play instead of playing the waiting game. However the content is good and most storylines get you hooked.",
        "I literally have nothing bad to say about this game. It's one of the best story/choices/chapter games out, in my opinion. I'm ready for sequels and the remaining chapters of Bad Boy Blues. Other than that, keep up the good work."

        "Great game This is a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing aesthetics and highly addictive. Totally worth the $2 for the premium version. I do have one problem though: even though I am pretty decent at the game, Google Play won't give me any achievements even though I'm sure I have earned some. It won't even let me open achievements or leaderboard pages. Is anybody else having this issue?",
        "I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I've decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I've upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!",
        "There are so many good things to list about this game. First, the graphics are extordinarily beautiful. And how much this game can relax you is AMAZING! When I play this, I swear my stress is gone. This game is never stressful. I find it amazing how satisfying this game is. I also love how realistic this game it is. The veiw and echoing is what really make up this game. Every sound is perfect for the setting. You need to download this NOW!",
        "Really fun and addicting! The first time i saw this app was when my dad told me about this game, he said that it was very good. Literally the first 10 minutes i played this game my mind was blown and i beacame addicted. Around 2 years later(now) i found this game again and instantly installed it. I love this game and I have played it for a long time. The graphics and music are amazing. This a really good game and you should install it! Who could think that glass could be so fun. However I think this game would be better if some of the thing you have to pay for would be for free.",
        "Great game, but premium is almost a requirement. The game itself is great, with an uber-cool, never-seen-before concept of smashing glass with metal balls in mysterious dimensions. The only problem is that getting premium is almost a requirement if you want to do well in the game. You can't continue the level once you die without paying. I would rate this game five stars if it weren't for this.",
        "So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn't save where I'm at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won't be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!"

Really developer?, ya cant wait a tad longer to stop the game and make us stare at a cat puzzle? The worst. I didnt even play it long enough to appteciate the poor controlls. Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.",
        "Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)",
        "I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn't have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it's Definitely Not a game you'd wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!",
        "Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout",
        "Great game.... but difficult for controle on himeself during shooting  you can get killed during shooting by enemies if you will not move to and fro...",
        "It would be great if the control's could be moved. The I keep hitting the fire button when I'm not making to. A couple of glitches but otherwise a cool way to kill time. The developer is on the right track."

        "Been playing since goblins vs gnomes (2014) and still play today. Not a diehard player, but as my buddy put it, \"hearthstone is the best toilet game ever\". It's pretty simple and easy to learn. Newer and f2p players have a bit of a rough go, but you can easily keep pace in this game for less than $100 a year.",
        "It's a fun game for a while before you will get frustating. Too much depending on luck no matter how good your deck is if you couldnt get the card to do your combo its useless againt an opponant that have better draw than you.  Also if you are free to play you have to be petient to get ass kick for a while till you have luck enough to get some useful legend card.",
        "I love card games and this got some awesome elements. However... The randomness and luck in this game is pure bs. You can be in a winning position and still lose because of 1 in a 10000000 chance of the oponent getting lucky. Even when I win I feel bad from winning because I know the oponet was unlucky.... It is very rare I get a game where I think. This game was awesome because we both did our best.",
        "I never even got to play. I have now tried to install 3x. The first two times the app became unresponsive. The third it caused my phone to crash and reboot. I have a pixel which should be perfectly capable of running it. If not then don't offer it for this device. First blizzard product that's ever pissed me off.",
        "Great game! Love all the really cool animations! I do have a problem that since I installed the game, my store has been closed 😐 I am installing it on PC right now to see if I can get to the store there. Game play is awesome though!",
        "Really fun game. 3 stars cause it closes very easily. If I get a phone call even when I dont answer the game closes.even on wifi it closes. Then it takes too long to reload causing me to lose a turn. This is the worst in arena because losing one turn will kill you and it becomes a waste of gold. Please do whatever you can to solve this problem."

        "I like this new update. Hanks now have His own happy meter like Tom and Angela. Nice. Also this is just my suggestion. Can you guys also make My Talking Ben and My Talking Ginger. Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that's it. You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It's not fair. Lastly good job guys.",
        "Great game, probably best talking animal game out for adults n kids... but sometimes u watch a video so u can spin the wheel n win gems or coins but the wheel not always comes up... ive had approx. 20x it has not happened in last 4 hrs... would like it redeemed n fixed plz...",
        "I like my talking tom and I download this one thinking that it will have some fun stuff like play mini games I know this one have a picture feature but man only eat, pet, sleep , and pics? Sorry I am re-downloading my talking Tom and start from scratch that only take pics feed and sleep on this game",
        "My three year old grand daughter got around my password and charged $40 of in app purchases and did a monthly subscription, too. I have gone through everything to try to remedy this, with no help from the customer service from the this apps developer.",
        "I'm only on level 1 wrong so correct me if im wrong but I thought the game was a bit boring at first and the game doesn't seem to give you much choice andyou have to folow what it says but if you enjoy the game thats great! I also did like that u got stickers for taking pics. I did end up having to uninstall the game as it took up to much storage space D: Overall I did really enjoy the game yay =D"

But the rest of the things r fun. The best thing is..... This game DOES NOT have any adds AT ALL. I would waste my time, or do whatever i can, just for this game to be funner.

        "The responsiveness of the controls I  this game make it unplayable... it's slightly more responsive than the original sonic dash but it's still no where near good enough for such a fast paced game.  I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it's the same on all of them",

        "I would give it 5 stars, I made an in app purchase to remove ads, but after the game updated non Sega ads started showing again and it asked me to make another purchase in order to remove the non Sega ads AGAIN... love the game, hate the ads...",
        "TOO MANY ADS!! Decent game but ruined by an add every 20s. Sonic forces doesn't have half as many adds as this game but isn't as good so looks like Sega have fallen short trying to add more pounds to their fortunes and made the game unplayable.",
        "Ads are back. I paid for a red ring bundle, which did remove them for a while, but they're back. The only reason I made a real purchase was so that I wouldn't have ads, so can someone please remove the ads from my account. On another note, I really like this, and nice to see Shadow playable again."

Why change something that wasn't broken!! 😡  UPDATE...since the second update the game is back and I LOVE it. Thank you so much for sorting it out. I genuinely love this game!!",
        "So frustrating to play since the update. Game constantly crashes, cannot play for longer than a few minutes before it crashes, can't go into any other hospitals because it crashes, can't watch videos because it crashes.....*STILL crashing, even after new update. I'm now getting a message on update screen 'this app may not be optimised for your device' - this app worked perfectly fine before update, why now is the app not optimised??",
        "This is A cute game to play doctor and all.  I just wish earning coins did not take so long, because to add on a clinic or expansion, it takes up all your money.  Also to purchase item for the hospital, the cost of each item goes up after you purchase one item. Like the waiting room chairs starts at 40 coins after a few chairs it is now at 70 coins per chair. Like how unfair is that?  Like is their a limit to how high each item gets?",
        "The problem is the friends system requires you connect via Facebook. For people that don't want to, or don't have Facebook, you're screwed. Please implement a way to add friends inside the game rather than through Facebook harassment.",
        "The game has the potential to be very entertaining however the constant crashes and app failure is very disheartening. Definite work needed to improve these issues, now its saying the app may not be optimized for the device. Why wouldn't it say that before downloading? Try again!",
        "Very laggy, took up alot of space on my phone. Wouldn't let me drag anything from one place to another. Very annoying. Don't reccomend"

If you can't restore your progress and continue playing without restoring, then all your progress is lost!",

Who the hell cares about a dog when you can't even keep a jacket for more than a trip to a location... Update has lost my account again and do you know... I think that I have had enough. I'll come back if you do ever finally release it which I don't think you will until you stop wasting time on pointless additions and concentrate on the core gameplay.sort yourselves out, I am going to find another game.",

Also, if to be compared to your other games, this game is the best and has the greatest potential. You must give more attention on developing this game. ps- the new update is still not fixing the connect button issue.",
        "for anybody just starting out don't bother to download and play this game. I've been playing pretty much from the first version and have yet to find a fuel tank for my motorcycle. the developers either just don't listen to the people playing the game and address the problems people have with the game or don't care. with every update it's becoming more and more obvious they're more concerned with how to get more money out of players that are willing to spend it.",
        "Dog update just lost all my data including motorcycle, nearly finished acid bath, and atv, cement base with maxed out trunks, loads of stuff. Played every day for months to have it all wiped away in 1 update. They have done this repeatedly to others and yes it was connected to playstore. I have restored it before.

        "Most puzzles are self explanatory. The odd few appeared to be impossible without some instruction. Few levels I had to skip probably around 7 levels. Couple due to pieces not moving or stuck. Very happy to be able to skip levels.  Would have been great to have a certain bank of hints for some of the  difficult ones. I found the later levels easier than the ones around 100. Max levels 120. Great fun!",
        "Not responsive to most touches. I finally got a cheat only to realize it was the game.  Ads were not frequent but had a strobe light going off (health issues) and would not turn off. Had to close out of the game every time so I just quit playing. Typo many similar more challenging games out there to try and work with this one.",
        "Some things are hidden in such a place makes it hard on note 8 due to curved screen. Level 89 doesn't work, as well as other levels where touching the same place over and over and over might get something to work.  Most puzzles are extremely easy,  it's just a matter of the game not working.",
        "I like the concept of the game in and of itself however the controls leave a bit to be desired. I will tap on an area a few times trying to locate an item to no avail then get frustrated, tap again and whatever object will move and item revealed. This gets old very quickly please fix it.",
        "Maybe it's just my phone, Galaxy S7, but even when i knew what to do i had to tap over and over again to get a response. Seriously, tap the object 10 times and nothing happens then tap it an eleventh time and it reacts. Very frustrating. Spent most of my time just repeatedly tapping the object. Game is a good concept, but really bad controls.",
        "I'm stuck! I must be around level#50 to 70 and the loading process is froze up.  Can't even get to the main menu, two days now. I've liked Challenge 1&2, but, HELP!"

The bonuses come very frequently and add an appeal to the game I haven't found with others. This is day one though so keep that in mind. Good rates from me though on first play",

Me and my sister love to play find the phone but I turnt the application off (thinking that it would work in the background and you wouldn't have to keep turning it off) and put down my phone and my sister came in and scared me and I knocked my phone off its stand and lost it (exactly what this application is trying to prevent). I did manage to find it in the end but it took a while. This is an amazing app and would definitely recommend it but it would be ideal If it worked In the back ground and you wouldn't have to keep turning the system on and off but otherwise app great app :)",

        "Overall, the game is pretty cool. But, I feel much more can be added though. Great game. Just more needs to be added. It's a great app I wish the devs could make like, Sandbox modes where you can build your own... Em... Coasters? I dunno. You had to verify them first. Annnd in order to verify them you had to complete them yourself. Then you could publish them. And maybe a two player mode? Not sure how that's gonna work out. That's all that could be added. Most of all. 3 and a half out of 5 stars.",
        "The only way to play online is Facebook and Google play! First, you can make a 3rd option for an in-game name, like in Clash Of Clans,  and make the Google play account optional if you don't want to download Google play (not meaning that Google play is bad). Many people can not even think of any name that is not already taken in Google play (including me). It still is a good game,just it needs some more work.",
        "Don't get me wrong, it's amazing and seems to be fun, but there's one thing that ruins it all. Whenever I open the game, everything shifts to the right quite a bit, so I can't see about one fifth of the screen, which doesn't allow me to use the button control setup, and some other things. Would love to see this get fixed, as the game has some nice potential.",
        "As much as I want to love this game, its also quite cheap. Every single race, the same \"real\" players are always there regardless of time of day. They follow the same route and incredibly make no mistakes at all! Meanwhile, I'm getting stuck on every edge, my wheel gets stuck in the ground and every single gate smashes only me. Amazing!! Its a super fun game but don't think for a second that it plays fair.",
        "Love this game for the cool clip art graphics with all the chaos. Relly funny when they crash. Lol i just dont like the constant ads gou have to watcg when ever you have to open a prize chest and when you win. I mean you win and then you gotta watch a clip for 30 secs, then it feels like you lose. Lol",
        "Thankyou gor being creative i wish you add more challenge : crash crush. That is like just crush using vlad and rufus (example) and then crush make them crush so who is the winner. Using that game we can know who is the stronger"

        "I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance",
        "I LOVE THIS GAME This is good game design. It rewards you no matter how high you go with a beautiful little tower. The colors are really satisfying. It keeps me engaged since you can \"regrow\" your blocks. That creates tension too--something to strive for. It's so simple but soothing and really addictive!!",
        "A Great Game For When You're Dumpin'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I'm in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren't too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I'm happy to say that. I don't like to stay too long. Great game!",
        "So,  basically it's a pretty fun app to play when you're bored. It's a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It's a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don't really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!",
        "Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn't have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic.",
        "Good, with a major flaw I've ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I'll tap, and the game won't register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I'm on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I've closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It's an issue I'd like to see fixed."

        "Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!",
        "Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I've basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I've got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.",
        "A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it's a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you've done them and reached level 10 on both, there's really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.",
        "Be cool if there is boosts. Example if you get 3 perfect you get a free auto perfect boost or something. Also plz add a line of code to stop people from the date/time bug abuse - save current time to file. Player won't get money till that last input time has passed.  Also be cool to spend the coins on boosts",
        "Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot's more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn't bother me that much. 5 stars for the team",
        "It's a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the 'colony' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you"

Aa well as all the glitches that you have to put up with... I try to do research and the times counts down but it wont show as completed although it takes your rss away which is why i bought so many packs i wasted that money just last week!!! Haven't even had time to use the things i bought and now its all gone!!!! I loved the game but i will not continue to play or spend a dime on it until this issue is resolved if i get my money back i will think about not sueing them and play the game again which i dont mind spending money on because it is fun just needs improvement and Google play needs way better customer service!!!!"

        "As expected, it looks and performs amazing. Fighting mechanics and modes are pretty innovative and thrilling. It is quite stupid to compare the console version with mobile one. Each one has its own unique style, so they should NOT look the same, cz' each one provides the fans with a different gaming experience. This surely increases the already huge number of fans of Tekken. 5 🌟 game",
        "WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you",
        "Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It's pretty decent. I'm enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I've raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn't a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)",
        "First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I'll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC's (and MK's) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.",
        "As a long time Tekken fan I am happy that we have a version for mobile. I am also quite impressed with how smooth the gameplay is. The graphics are impressive for mobile. I'm underwhelmed by the controls though.  For me Tekken is all about the controls, and while I didn't expect a full controller interface. I feel like there could have been a better control layout available. Also the interface and game play menus feel quite busy, like there is too much going on. They could take a note from the wb fighters on mobile in this regard.",
        "As a lifelong Tekken fan this game is about as good as you could get for a mobile game. Sure there's microtransactions but they don't feel shoved down your throat and you'll get a decent amount of fun before they feel remotely neccesary. The gameplay is good, simpler but as concise and impactful as it always is. The only thing that I've found off putting so far is some of the writing is a bit... off. Just some out if character stuff but the story dialogue is mostly setup so it's not too bad.  Overall this is definitely worth a try if you want Tekken on the go."

        "I really enjoy playing this game. It helps me to relax while I am watching TV, or even using in split mode while watching a video or something. It's a bit different then the way I originally used to play Klondike, but still a great game and easy to get used to quickly! I don't mind the 5 second or so ads between games. It's the price you pay to get a good, free game. It's not like they play constantly and during a game there is usually an ad on the bottom screen but it will quickly move if you go to start a new game or need to access the other options.",
        "It's a fun relaxing game. Its so addictive that every device I have, must have this game. I have it on my phone, ipad and tablet. Except my laptop cuz then I would get no work done. About the ads, one pops out each time you finish a game, so I'm not to bothered by it. Also, theres no videos too watch in order to earn coins or diamonds because none are needed. I just love it. Its stress free.",
        "I would have scored higher except there is suddenly super annoying music being played that there is no option to turn off. The ads also now autoplay loud music. I agree with another poster who said it starting to seem like you lose more so you see more ads. I liked this because it was good for a quick game while getting ready to sleep. The music ruins this. I'm going to try another app now.",
        "I love the game solitaire played it on many different computers over the years. Downloaded three other version on my phone. All of which I deleted almost straight away because they were finicky and I didn't like the format. This one is easy to use and no glitches. So far so good.",
        "Addicting to play. The amount of ads is annoying and gets in the way of some of the controls sometimes, but otherwise it's a nice little game! I also like that it keeps track of stats and that you can deal just one card or 3 cards at a time!",
        "Terrible ads. So bad they hid the menu bar behind an ad banner so you click the ads just to access settings. Pretty sure they recently increased losing deal rate to make more ad videos play. So many other solitaire aps available so skip this one."

They both show completed and say that they've given me the reward.... but they haven't.   I disputed it.   Waiting two weeks on one of them and one week for the other.  This is racketeering.  I've been hoodwinked.. bamboozled!  I'll change my my review after they give me my CASH$$",

        "Ok game, but bingo mode is a huge pain.  My shots filled out the opponent's card better than mine.  Stupid way to lose a lot of progress/coins."

        "I really like the concept of the game I fun to play. But what I really find droubling its a pay to win type of game. Sure you get daily rewards and everything, but that still doesn't compare to the lack of coins you get. For example I recently reached lvl 11, and when I go into lobbies with people with high tier amor and weapons. I find It hard to get kills now. I really hope you guys can fix this in the further future",
        "I think it's OK, I mean like, its just a copy of pixel gun 3D but there's more action in pixel gun. And could you make the fire button a little bigger because whenever I try to fire I always miss the trigger and then get killed😬 but I still like pixel gun better (sorry alot) but I think the game needs more improvement that's why I gave it a 3 star",
        "I hate this You need to get report or find a mod. see in the chat a player keep calling me gay for 17 day I will 5 star it if you can do it",
        "I will u 5* if u increase the amount of coins every match and reduce price of weapons & armours. Amount of coins every match is so little that I can't buy a good weapon and also armor repair and also granede buying system is so pathetic.",
        "Its awesome, but the armor repair... really why? People are going to start hating that. Which happened to me and some others. Also add a friends list. Keep it up",

        "So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game",
        "A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job 'fun games for free' 👏👌🖒☺",
        "Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you're having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.",
        "I've been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn't force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game's development! :)",
        "Pretty cool app. I'd like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it's pretty cool so far.",
        "This is the most addictive flight simulator I have ever played. The game is fairly easy to progress through without having to spend any money. If I had to find one fault it would be that you can't reverse when on a runway which means some times you have no option but to crash your plane as there is very little room to turn around."

Only thing that frustrates me is the fact that you can only achieve a new high score if you play from the current level you are on and upwards.

Though, when I'm playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can't complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that game👍",
        "I love the game, it's so addictive! Some of the levels are confusing, but most are super simple and super fun! One thing that is a little bit of a downer is how every time you want to play a new round you have to watch a 30 second add , which gets old when you want to play a lot, but don't want to pay for add free. But I would highly recomend this to anyone",

        "I really enjoy this game, but I have found a flaw in the design. The game speeds up as you go and after a point it doesn't go faster, but after around 10,000 you notice the ball start to move forward on the screen and after about 20,000 you don't even have to move the ball to not die. It just misses the spikes. I know you might be thinking Its not on the leaderboards, but that's my next complaint. Im currently 6 on the leaderboards, but I've gotten a better score and it won't update. I quite frankly destroyed that score and it doesn't show up. Thank you for your time and I hope this helped",
        "Game is great, far too many ads, after each level AND major issues with the videos giving rewards. I watched 4 and only received 1 reward which makes the game unfair and not worth playing.",
        "I HATE the vibration when u die I almost uninstalled the app bcuz of that. I also have a problem with pop up ads. I really like the game though",
        "Fun game, but occasionally an ad will pop up while I'm playing, causing me to mess up and die. I was having a really great run when an ad popped up. Not cool.",
        "Theres random ads in the middle of playing and you cant move for like 1 sec and you die to a spike.",
        "I think this game is very addictive. To all the people that say u have to many adds well i dont i can actually play the game without getting interrupted"

This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.",
        "Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you're given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.",
        "Must be the shortest time I have had a game installed. Pace of gameplay is SLOW and I hate the voice of the game. So annoying! If I could skip the animation before and after a level it would be much better.",
        "Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.",
        "Liked it but sometimes it just wouldn't give me the right bubbles to win at the end when I absolutely could've. If there's 4 bubbles left and none of them are yellow why do you give me a yellow one? I felt cheated",
        "The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item."

The graphics and UI are nice and stylish, the controls are great, the gameplay is solid and it's generally just very fun to play. However, the game has some optimization issues. When you minimize it, it disconnects, and if you wait long enough it shuts down the entire game. I get that it was made like this to reduce background data, but come on, not everybody stays in the game all the time. It also takes longer than most games to connect. These are minor issues, but it would be great to see them fixed.",
        "This game works good but the reason I gave it 2 stars is whenever I click on ranked games it shows leaver penalty and the time to wait is shown 00:00:00:00. After waiting for so many days,it is always showing like this and not allowing me to play ranked games.Hope you would look into this.",
        "developer, i used to keep on playing cuz its very very fun but idk why recently when i click on connect via google play it shows connecting after that nth changes. i DONT want the ops acc i WANT my usual account back. the name of my usual account is   -FiReRY-  and the clan name is DeNY. pls pls pls pls pls help me get that account of mine back. i worked v hard for it n i have almost all the skins n i seriously like all of them v much. Many thanks.",
        "This is the best First Person Shooter available on Android. The only game that's not pay-to-win. Ok I give you that this game is great, but damned login issues are the reason for 3 stars. I just can't LOGIN with google play. It's like the game decides when I can login and play coz sometimes I am able to login. REST OF THE TIME IT SAYS PLAYING AS GUEST. FU!CKING FIX THIS LOGIN ISSUE!!!!",
        "Well they still have to grow but I think it's op. As I play a lot of CS:Go (not sponsoring)  then I thought this could help me because my PC stopped working.. Anyways graphics aren't great but good.. They aren't clean. Oh and last before I end this comment- when you complete offer for credits it doesn't give you the credits.. That's sad..  So yeah.. Just keep it up!! 👍👍"

        "Do not spend any money on this game. This used to be one of the best slot games until the developers got greedy. Payouts are small and events are nearly impossible. They try to make it all sound good but it's not. They also changed the customer service on here where it's hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!",
        "What the hell kind of question is that?  \"Is it beautiful\".... meaning the game! HOW NOT PERTAINING TO ANY GAMES!  Anyway,  this game is hands down the best Slot game EVER!  Have played slots in and out of casino's for over 20 years and this is the one to play! A huge variety of Casino games,  easy to maneuver and a lot of really nice people.",
        "I used to love this game but something they did changed it. Winning is nearly impossible even if you are a paying customer. I know it is a game of luck but when you purchase 85 silver tickets you should be able to complete puzzles when you only need 1 piece for each of them. Make winning a little easier and people will be happy to spend money.  I think the game is broken. I was just playing in a room on Billionaire with a person who was playing on Huge Casino. I know it's the same developer but I don't think that is supposed to happen. I know the person was playing Huge Casino because it was my husband playing it. May want to look into it.",
        "Customer relations are horrible even non existent. If you spend money you will lose far more than you win, in their eyes you will spend even more. If you send a message they will hide behind a canned \"industry standard\" response. This is not a free standing casino there are no freebies and you can't collect any winnings. Yet they have their games dialed in so you lose in hopes you will spend money. Horrible company.",
        "I just started this account in hopes of recovering my lost one. If it goes smoothly, I am happy with the app to date. The slots don't pay as much as they used to, a little tite , otherwise a fun app. The events they choose for you to play, daily, do steal a lot of chips. If u want to remain in a successful club, you must do them, is the main downfall. I would recommend it to my friends.",
        "This is an interesting game. After I played it for awhile it became very boring. Haven't gotten a big or any good win for the past 70 million. I guess if you buy chips you might win more often. It doesn't give you all the bonuses, and it takes gifts and doesn't give them to the gamers you gave it to. So all in all it's just okay. I've never been able to get anywhere with their support team as they added to my reply. I'd give it a one star but if you buy chips it might be better."

The latest video advert lasted inbetween games lasted 8 mins....ridiculous!!!. I understand the need for adverts, but if you can't play the game, the adverts are pointless, espeacially if it makes players quit.",

No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It's TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred",
        "Great game, but there's an annoying window that pops up everytime I try and start a new marathon. The window is pretty much useless and wastes my time. Would give this 5 stars if it gets patched",
        "Great game and builds on. The original. The only thing stopping it getting the 5* rating is that the ads on it are sometimes several minutes long and at times when they have finished you can't return to the game. I don't mind watching them as I know that's what funds it, but they are putting me off playing now.",

        "this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It's a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that's it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame",
        "Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn't came in two years it probably isn't. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don't pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges.",
        "Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.",
        "This game is very nicely done. Its a genius concept except the fact that u catch zombies to make it into something is really gross. I would preffer if you could lower the pri e of the drone a bit so that there would be more play time rather than waiting play. Overall this game is superb",
        "I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.",
        "Great game, addictive, in a good way. This is one of the few games that is addictive, but does not take up a large amount of your day, unlike some game (Clash Royale), I feel it's not Pay to Win. Great job guys, thanks for making an entertaining, relaxing, non time consuming, free to play and win game. Graphics can be bested."

If someone could fix this for me or refund me that would be great. I just got 6 new babies and she can't use any of them which is ashame cause she loves this game.",
        "Bought all the babies when I first downloaded the app. Everything was working great. So when the most recent (3) babies were available for purchase I bought them, but now those babies don't work!.... I'll give five stars when you get them to work. In the meantime, I think I should get a refund on my money.",
        "I'm very unhappy!! Since the update my daughter can no longer play with the babies I bought, only the free ones. She is constantly bugging me to buy them again, but since I have already purchased them I do not think I should have to. Please may I have a full refund so I can purchase again or better yet fix the problem, then I can give 5*",
        "Bought the game early on, then after an update with new babies they mixed the new babies in.  So you are left with a child constantly wanting the new babies.  A horrible money grab.  Otherwise a fun game.  Shoyld not show the locked babies mixed in with purchased ones.",
        "Dang, I wish the purchases I made on 6 more babies for my daughter would just work! She loves the app, but gets frustrated that the whole app freezes when she clicks to play one of the other babies. Wouldn't recommend this app because of that... it's just stealing my money..",
        "Downloaded this game for my daughter and we never got to play because the game will not load. It gets stuck on the bottle screen and then has a black screen after that. She has Nabi tablet, so I will keep the app for now and just disable it. Please fix soon!!!"

        "Definitely enjoyed the game. The only issues I found with it is the amount of time it takes to upgrade a new weapon slot. The Success and Failure prompts in general linger on the screen for so long you're forced to tap the upgrade button hundreds of times before your new weapon slot is caught up to your current weapon. The area to tap in the field to is a bit unclear as well.",
        "Ok graphics for an idle game imo. Not super responsive to touch on my Note 8, sometimes have to double or triple tap or try to scroll twice to get it to move. Wish there was more reason to mine, but the combat is pretty fun. Satisfying sound effects in combat.",
        "I really like the game. It's lots of fun when I need to pass the time. I do wish that you could pause things when you get stuff in the store and you want to use it but maybe you want to stop the auto button at some point and have more control of the weapons. It would be nice if you could disable the auto button. I prefer having more control of the weapons unless I'm away from my phone but I haven't seen a way to pause it. Thank you very much! I love the game and will definitely keep playing.",
        "I THOUGHT this was an idle game. But no, you ACTUALLY have to actively be playing the game to make any progress. It really is a novelty idea if it was an idle game. Like keeps making money while you're away. Again you actually have to be active to sit through very, VERY long battles to make money. Make this an idle game and it would be more worth it. Until then, I for one am uninstalling.",

        "The game is amazing, addicting and a lot of fun just to collect and level up dragons. The events that are constantly coming on always make you feel like you have something to do. However when of the events are very unbalanced and, if you are against one of these people, not very fun. The heroic races are a great way to compete with other players to add a powerful dragon to your collection but some people take the fun out of it by spending 100's of gems to ensure that they come first. The ability to use gems during these races should be removed as it is highly unbalanced, or at least add another way of collecting the heroic dragons without having to compete with people who pay to win.",
        "I love this game. Its very addicting and fun, but I find that there are barely any female dragons. This upsets me very much and I would like for this to change. The only females I see are the dragons with names like  motherly dragon, belle dragon, viktoria dragons, and sleeping beauty dragons. There are also descriptions like \"add some girly pink to your collections with the gummy dragon\"(which is also coincidently a girl). Then I see cool legendary dragons, but OH plot twist they're all boys. This is a very fun game no doubt on that, but please, stop with the sexism and make cool female dragons. Thank you.",
        "Still Having Lot's of Fun! Cool to mix different dragons just to see what u get!  I just opened my 6th island, When I first started playing this game I think there were only 3 or 4 islands & maybe about 300 to 400 dragons. I'm having trouble keeping them long enough to get the next island!😉😄😁!!",
        "Game would be great except for the fact that you can't do certain things without bugging people on Facebook for help. I just want to play the game. I can't level my dragons past 10 without building a special building which you build without gems or bugging people. No way to get gems other than extremely slowly by completing achievements which take days to complete and give 1-3 gems. Supposedly you can watch videos for gems but there is absolutely no place on the game that allows this. If your friends on Facebook don't play this game they can't help you and you are screwed if you truly want to enjoy the game. You can't win battles with level 10 dragons. You can't breed more than one dragon at a time without gems. You can't expand past 2 islands without gems. If you get the required gems to level your dragons past 10, then there is another super expensive building to level them past 15, and get, guess what, you need gems for that too. Other games allow in game friends which this one doesn't and that is frankly ridiculous as it's a \"social\" game. Other games allow other ways to obtain gems like watching videos or trying other games which this one doesn't. There isn't enough time to complete special events for special limited dragons unless you can get gems. Overall, the game would be fantastic if gems were easier to come by and you could make in game friends instead of having to rely on Facebook friends!",
        "Just a few gripes. 1st of all I LOVE DRAGON CITY. Been playing for years. About your survey, I would never. You ask for too many permissions. Tree of life....when I get a Dragon here comes the same Dragon adding up for hatching. Like why? 815+ dragons are more than enough. Why do u keep adding, adding, adding. We could NEVER get all of them as it is. Why more? Love me some Dragon City like a said in the beginning.",
        "THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! I totally recommend it to EVERYONE who loves addictive games and dragons. I find myself constantly playing this game all the time! I honestly feel like I can't say how much I LOVE this game with words. Again, this is the best game a player can have. Just one thing, I wish there were more ways to get gems instead of just buying 'cause I can't buy anything. So please make gems more easier to get. Also please make the islands worth less gems.😊"

I've purchased all unlocks and until now extras, even enjoy the pc version but now even after I've handed out funds they want more money to enjoy features. When I purchased unlocks and extras the last thing I wanna hear is we've added more unlocks for more money, even though you already paid for unlocks.",
        "1.) You used to be able to fast forward game for free... That now has to be upgraded  2.) Everything costs money!!! In order to progress in the game you basically need to purchase the full version 3.) The fungus level is definitely the hardest to get past, played at least 10+ times and still have not won that level because it doesn't give you enough DNA to upgrade. 4.) Game is overall, Ok.  5.) I like the new levels! Like the vampire and ape one. It's pretty cool."

        "Can't seem to open the game... It hangs at the loading screen with \"downloading please wait\" the downloading lettering blinks and the game never opens... Previous version was fine with my device.. Plz fix soon... Otherwise i love this game",
        "Not gonna lie love this game and I'm rating it 5 stars but the game would be way better if you could somehow jump. Its still rate 5 stars. I recommended at least trying the game out.",
        "Its nice but theres one problem for me.When i logout and login again the game loading glitches and it wont let me play.Pls cix this glitch but anyway thankyou and its still really fun to play",
        "This game is for people who love to be stuck in time, since this game came out there hasn't been any proper updates except from adding new unnecessary stuffs to the game so kids can waste their money on, the time limit in the game is 4mins for either team battle or free for all; this has been the way thia game has been for years since i started play the game anything new in the game is all about spending more money, what tyoe of developers are you guys? Do you even play the game? It gets more boring every second, the are no proper changes no organization of your weapon and other stuffs in the game... It takes like 2+ minutes to change to another outfit because the list is too long, YOU DEVELOPERS NEED TO FOCUS ON THE GAMEPLAY AND NOT NEW ITEMS... Add in squad battles so it can be more competitive and allow people to be able to see their stats and then players will care more just look at what other games are doing in 2018 and don't get stuck in time...GOODLUCK"

        "Very addictive. I'm a big fan of both your games &lt;3! Awesome graphics, awesome set up, everything g is awesome! I can say some resources are hard to get tho esp a well. But other then that its pretty cool! I've just started so I've notgonna do a whole lot yet. Went to a yellow area once but man so not ready for that.. Also seems like I can't never keep stuff to heal me or even find it? Keep up the good work!!",
        "Solid game, definitely becoming one of my favorites. Only thing I have an issue with, when we die, respawn us back in the zone we died at, for a chance at claiming our body. Also, a friend system outside of a guild would be great. Chat and trade would make encounters with other players more entertaining. Last thing, classes would complete the game. And don't just do three classes if implemented, do 5 or so. But A+ to the devs for a wonderful game!",
        "Great game, restrictive on recipes, needs to improve learning them better. Durability can improve with repair proficiency. Lower proficiency lower durability,  houses could have durability consistent to material. Stronger longer lasting. Anything and everything on enemies gatherable would be awesome, i.e clothes off walkers armor off knights. Environment growth above dungeons could be progressable. Never completed dungeon no growth completed many times a knight.  Fishing would be nice. Hire vendor would be great in player compound. Upgradable structures is cool. Learning them.",
        "I love this game, very addictive and fun. Few things i would like to see change. When you die you can not always find your body to retrieve your things or get to them due to monster. I uninstalled the sister game because if thia as it become impossible to progress when you loose all your best stuff. Also should include the add option to make energy easy to get.",
        "this game is very cool but seriously you really have to spend money to enjoy it fully.The energy system is garbage and walking from place to place is tooo long... seriously 24 MINUTES,also inventory space is insanely limited and it wants you to spend money for more slots. I understand you have to do this in a free game but please don't make the game unplayable becouse of that. I still hope this game will be better in the future becouse i enjoy my time playing it",
        "I am picky. This game grabbed me and hasn't let go! I willingly bought in-app on day three, and I LOATHE micro transactions with the white hot intensity of a thousand suns.  The ethos of the game is perfect, dark, eery, and forboading.   Love the crafting and foraging. Love the RISK inherent in death. Eau to play, hard to master. Perfect.  The only improvement I can see is to have the world be larger, the storyline more full, and add character modification. In effect, just make more of what is already amazing."

It gets stuck like for a very long time, I need to exit and open the game again and my progress of winning the fight is lost. So I play again and win again but same thing happens the game crashes.

When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. 👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..",
        "Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven't gotten very far yet. Thing I DON'T like is you don't get an average..... IF you do, I've yet to find where it is in the game. That's in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! 😉💯",
        "The Game is good. Some things to improve it:  save your profile using your Google Account. Play with Friends in Tournaments (ie. Teams, Challenges), ability to givie Hearts to friends without using Facebook Also can you PLEASE improve the notification! My friend sends me Requests to Bowl & most of the time I don't get notified. Thank U",
        "Not sure how the currency works or how to upgrade my levels. Played 10 times and still can't upgrade the ball. Do they expect real cash to upgrade 1 ball? Also the controls are touchy, I've inadvertently chucked a few balls into the gutter while trying to align it before my release. Some tutorials would be nice.",
        "I did like this fame but my lane keeps turning pink along with the ball so I can't actually see anything like where the ball is going.... and on quick fire again turns everything pink and don't let me take any shoots what do ever.. think it's a glitch in the game I'm not sure but tried restarting the game and the same thing is happening again and again... on all the different lanes and extra games in bowling king...",
        "Great graphics and realistic feel to the lanes. Controls are a bit wonky, however, and purists won't like being being able to steer the ball after it leaves your \"hand.\" LOTS of attempted upsells, but its free to play features ain't too bad on their own, either. All in all, a decent little bowling game."

For under $2 my daughter has memory games, puzzles, fingerprinting, math, music, matching,  and the list goes on.  I spend at least $10 on a toy and for $2 it teaches and helps on long car rides and planes rides.  It's a great educational app and not a \"game\".

        "This is an extremely fun game. O have a few suggestions on how to fix things on the game. I noticed three things while playing this game. 1. There is not a continue playing option. This can easily be fixed and with all of the great work from Dvloper I think that this is not too far away. 2. I noticed you can uncrouch in the tunnel in the basement even though you are not all the way through. 3. Everything is in a certain place. If one object is in a certain place then if you are familiar with the game enough you will know where the other objects are. To be honest this is not a minor concern but still could be fixed. Other than that I can't stop playing! Thank you so much!!",
        "I love this game, especially when you hide just in time and there's that tense moment wondering if she saw you. I get chills down my spine when I'm hiding and I hear her saying \"I see you\". If I could, I would give this game 100 stars. I would suggest having a mode after you beat Granny to become Granny because I think it would be cool to chase the player around the house. Also, I think the game would benefit from a much bigger house, more drawers and of course, more locks. Love the game, keep up the good work.",
        "It's really really really fun game.  But I think if you guys do some more improvements so it will be much fun.  Here's what I think:  1. I think you should make the house much bigger.  2. You should add more enemies for example:  child o' slenderina,  slenderman and the spiders.  3. You should add an Adventure mode.  Where you need to find some books or something like an emblem like that stuff to make them uncursed like that.  4. Last but not least, you should add more weapons for example:  Pistol,  sword,  injection etc.    If you do that,  it will be super cool and fun.   ThanQ 😃👍",
        "It's definatly one of the better (more fun) horror games on the store, but I feel like there could be some more improvements. Firstly I think that if you've completed hard than there should be an (almost) impossible mode. Also minor details such as different textures and Easter eggs would be good. Last, I think that when you escape there should be an outside section where it's still got puzzles but it's more about the atmosphere. (Maybe that could just be for the \"impossible mode\") but it would make the game a lot more enjoyable. Also maybe a reward for escaping. (For incentive). Thank you and maybe you could take this into consideration :) also new app icon plz",
        "Who doesn't love this game? It's bone chilling and exciting for the whole family (Litterally my whole fam plays this game) it would be cool to have a mode where there was no granny just to explore the house and get a feel for how to escape. Also some weapons to attack granny. Lastly a map of where granny is would be super cool. Good luck!",
        "It's a vary good game so hood i can't believe it's on mobile game! Also the game mechanics are so amazing as well. Then there's series of things you have to do that keeps you in the game for a long time; the theme and music fit the atmosphere, and there's not much of a problem with the game either. \"This game gives me goosebumps!\" (From Dashigames aka Dachi) he loves it as well too. #goodgamemakemore"

I have the silver subscription ($1.00/weekly) and im unable to take advantage of the content im paying for  want a refund.

You certainly can't get very far without spending some real money. You can be killed by animals when the come from behind so you with your limited turning capability you have no chance to defend yourself. A lot of problems.",

The reason for that is it not about the distant (which I like about) it about how many overtake you can take in a single game. That is what I dislike about this game. Also the cars... Not a lot of cars (need more). Few questions: Will there be such thing as upgrade speed or car customization? Will there be special event like special map that the highest rank get some kind of reward? And lastly will there be a competition of ranking ?  If all the that happening in the future this game definitely deserved 5 stars .",
        "Basic. You have to over take cars... That's it. When they talk about the physics being like simulation they are lieing. Left right go stop. Poor 16bit sound that you will want to turn off. It's like a game from the 80s. Uninstall.",
        "The game is very good but I really wish if the score is for the overtakes as well as the high speed that will be a lot better. Also, I wish if there were more cars. That would be really interesting. Actually it needs a lot of work because it's very boring",
        "Hey, this game is just so good, just make few improvements like, try to create bends in your highway and add more cars, a little road features like tunnels, two way traffic feature. This way you will have killed me. gameplay is so nice anyway."

        "The game is amazing, addicting and a lot of fun just to collect and level up dragons. The events that are constantly coming on always make you feel like you have something to do. However when of the events are very unbalanced and, if you are against one of these people, not very fun. The heroic races are a great way to compete with other players to add a powerful dragon to your collection but some people take the fun out of it by spending 100's of gems to ensure that they come first. The ability to use gems during these races should be removed as it is highly unbalanced, or at least add another way of collecting the heroic dragons without having to compete with people who pay to win.",
        "I love this game. Its very addicting and fun, but I find that there are barely any female dragons. This upsets me very much and I would like for this to change. The only females I see are the dragons with names like  motherly dragon, belle dragon, viktoria dragons, and sleeping beauty dragons. There are also descriptions like \"add some girly pink to your collections with the gummy dragon\"(which is also coincidently a girl). Then I see cool legendary dragons, but OH plot twist they're all boys. This is a very fun game no doubt on that, but please, stop with the sexism and make cool female dragons. Thank you.",
        "Still Having Lot's of Fun! Cool to mix different dragons just to see what u get!  I just opened my 6th island, When I first started playing this game I think there were only 3 or 4 islands & maybe about 300 to 400 dragons. I'm having trouble keeping them long enough to get the next island!😉😄😁!!",
        "Game would be great except for the fact that you can't do certain things without bugging people on Facebook for help. I just want to play the game. I can't level my dragons past 10 without building a special building which you build without gems or bugging people. No way to get gems other than extremely slowly by completing achievements which take days to complete and give 1-3 gems. Supposedly you can watch videos for gems but there is absolutely no place on the game that allows this. If your friends on Facebook don't play this game they can't help you and you are screwed if you truly want to enjoy the game. You can't win battles with level 10 dragons. You can't breed more than one dragon at a time without gems. You can't expand past 2 islands without gems. If you get the required gems to level your dragons past 10, then there is another super expensive building to level them past 15, and get, guess what, you need gems for that too. Other games allow in game friends which this one doesn't and that is frankly ridiculous as it's a \"social\" game. Other games allow other ways to obtain gems like watching videos or trying other games which this one doesn't. There isn't enough time to complete special events for special limited dragons unless you can get gems. Overall, the game would be fantastic if gems were easier to come by and you could make in game friends instead of having to rely on Facebook friends!",
        "Just a few gripes. 1st of all I LOVE DRAGON CITY. Been playing for years. About your survey, I would never. You ask for too many permissions. Tree of life....when I get a Dragon here comes the same Dragon adding up for hatching. Like why? 815+ dragons are more than enough. Why do u keep adding, adding, adding. We could NEVER get all of them as it is. Why more? Love me some Dragon City like a said in the beginning.",
        "THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! I totally recommend it to EVERYONE who loves addictive games and dragons. I find myself constantly playing this game all the time! I honestly feel like I can't say how much I LOVE this game with words. Again, this is the best game a player can have. Just one thing, I wish there were more ways to get gems instead of just buying 'cause I can't buy anything. So please make gems more easier to get. Also please make the islands worth less gems.😊"

Under the default setting the gas would randomly stop working, and while using auto accelerate the nitro randomly activates even when my thumbs are nowhere near them!  Runs smooth and looks great for a retro style racer.  I wish more devs would release games like this, the free game isn't so much a demo as it is a kind of shareware like they released in the 90s.",

Offer a free game with *just* enough content to get you hooked then push a \"pay for\" ad to keep playing the rest of the game. May as well call it a trial or a demo mode, that's all it is. Which it's a shame, I'd rather watch a couple ads here and there vs that tactic.",
        "So I downloaded and wound up buying the full version about 6 months ago. Was awesome. Outrun meets Cruisin USA. Loved it, beat it, 80% through trying to get perfect on every course to unlock a different ending mostly just because I want to keep playing and then it updates. Way after I purchased, a whole brand new set of course tracks. It's the best pocket change you'll ever spend.",

        "Overall, the game is pretty cool. But, I feel much more can be added though. Great game. Just more needs to be added. It's a great app I wish the devs could make like, Sandbox modes where you can build your own... Em... Coasters? I dunno. You had to verify them first. Annnd in order to verify them you had to complete them yourself. Then you could publish them. And maybe a two player mode? Not sure how that's gonna work out. That's all that could be added. Most of all. 3 and a half out of 5 stars.",
        "The only way to play online is Facebook and Google play! First, you can make a 3rd option for an in-game name, like in Clash Of Clans,  and make the Google play account optional if you don't want to download Google play (not meaning that Google play is bad). Many people can not even think of any name that is not already taken in Google play (including me). It still is a good game,just it needs some more work.",
        "Don't get me wrong, it's amazing and seems to be fun, but there's one thing that ruins it all. Whenever I open the game, everything shifts to the right quite a bit, so I can't see about one fifth of the screen, which doesn't allow me to use the button control setup, and some other things. Would love to see this get fixed, as the game has some nice potential.",
        "As much as I want to love this game, its also quite cheap. Every single race, the same \"real\" players are always there regardless of time of day. They follow the same route and incredibly make no mistakes at all! Meanwhile, I'm getting stuck on every edge, my wheel gets stuck in the ground and every single gate smashes only me. Amazing!! Its a super fun game but don't think for a second that it plays fair.",
        "Love this game for the cool clip art graphics with all the chaos. Relly funny when they crash. Lol i just dont like the constant ads gou have to watcg when ever you have to open a prize chest and when you win. I mean you win and then you gotta watch a clip for 30 secs, then it feels like you lose. Lol",
        "Thankyou gor being creative i wish you add more challenge : crash crush. That is like just crush using vlad and rufus (example) and then crush make them crush so who is the winner. Using that game we can know who is the stronger"

Top it off with some multiplayer of some kind and this would be my no1 game, I don't even mind that it takes a while to earn money.",
        "Very good and interesting game. I love to play with it but I can't understand that: I paid once from my table for \"double scoring\" but it's not appeared to my smartphone even  using the same Google play account. Unacceptable...",
        "If you wanna waste your time it's probably the best game, I mean great graphics, lots of cars with their upgrades & smooth game contorol are good; but when I find that it encourage me to drive faster and more likely to a drunk person! And for that it give me bonus , I actually     delete it. Many people loves fast driving but this game motivate you drive fast & crazily like you don't care to have an accident with a truck in opposite side!",
        "I love this game, I loved it before, I love it now and I'll love it for ever. It helped me through some horrifying times in the first few years of my multiple sclerosis as it continues to do so. Thanks people.",

        "I hate everything about this game cause everything about the bonuses is all lies. I liked all your pages for the bonuses and nothing was give to me. WHY ? Why you playing us? WHY???"

I fully upgraded my first starter and reserve and now i have like 50000 in money and can't buy anything since it all requires gold not cash. If it was cash not gold i would give it 5 stars in an instant",
        "I am amending my original 5 star review. I am now giving this game 1 star due to the feature that claims to allow you to earn more gold. I tried a couple of different offers which involved \"a quick survey and email address\". This was complete BS. They were both endless loops of surveys and information mines, and never was given my promised reward after completing the initial survey. This is very dishonest and extremely annoying. So annoying that it prompted me to take the time to change my 5 star review to 1 star.",

        "I love this game, it's simple and sweet. However, there was a middle row in the item-picking menu in which I had invested many coins into to help me level up faster. Today, when I logged in, the row simply disappeared without a trace. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the backgrounding of my app, but nothing seemed to fix it. Now I only have the Training row and the Fun stuff row. It took me quite a while to get those coins and I'd really appreciate it if you brought the row back or gave me a solution to get it back. If it helps, you should also know that the 'I' on every icon which used to let you see how an item was used has also vanished. Please fix this, thank you.",
        "I wish I could give this game 10 stars. It's amazing all around.  It's adorable and fun. The graphics are amazing too without any glitches so far. Haven't noticed any bugs either. The developer's done amazing. It does get repetitive after a while but so far by the time it happens something new unlocks so it's still fun. Can't wait to see what else you guys do to improve the game play since everything else has been flawless so far. Great job, keep up the great work!",
        "This game is super cute! I love my lil ninja friend! Lol. Nice story, and plenty to do to keep you busy. Will def take time to master, but it def has the potential to keep you interested in playing. Even got my wife playing it, and she usually only keeps games for a day or 2, cuz she gets bored with them. I think she'll play this one a little longer than most of the other games she's tried. I'm really happy i found this game!!",
        "This one is probably my favourite, with minecraft and clash of clans. If you don't have this Virtual Friend game, then it is you who is missing out. Install and enjoy. There's nothing bad about this game, and if Naturalmotion do want me to suggest an add-on, then maybe enable me to link the game with a new device. I was LVL 52 once but I lost it. Now I'm level 17. Hope you liked the suggestion. :)",
        "I really love this game, but if you don't put an update on Clumsy Ninja I'm going to uninstall this awesome game. In the next update will you please fix the part when you touch the story book then it tells you the pictures are still locked? If you put this in the new update anytime, I will start to love this game like I did before. One more thing.... If this helps.... I really really really love this app!!!",

It just sounds like a good idea  the dog should be a husky or a smaller dog like a beagle so it is small like the other animals and it can sleep with the ninja the cat can just be a cat please look into this *^* looking forward to this"

        "Amazing game, great time-killer. I discovered a game breaker: if you go into the settings after you die, the number of coins you got in that level, [the number in the brackets] becomes equal to the total number of coins. Keep going back and forth into the settings, and the game will eventually ask if you want to triple the coins by watching a video. Instead of tripling the number of coins you got in that level, the number of total coins you have gets tripled.  Instantly triple your wallet every run.  I want the devs to see this and see if they can patch it because I really like this game and I want the coins I earn to be legit.  Thanks for your time, Mike C.",
        "It has a progression system, but it's completely worthless. The only reason to try to win belts is to get weapons that serve no purpose. You can win most of them by paying 200 coins and getting a random one, but you can, for some odd reason, get duplicates. Not to mention the fact that coin combos actually do nothing, not even useless cosmetic items, nothing. I think adding function to the weapons (e.g. Making long swords slightly longer range or making small weapons quicker) could add more depth and more of a reason to play the game. Overall: It's a good timekiller.",
        "Great game. Best for killing time. Great concept. Need to add a  counter for counting the number of people killed, otherwise awesome. Also there is not much incentive to play to win belts. Make playing with boss again free. Add new opponents (not bosses but the minions) . Make the game a little less challenging. Also remove the brief stun completely",
        "Really fun game. Nice graphics and simple controls. More depth to combat system would be nice. There is no point in achieving coin combos. It does not affect the amount of coins won. Add a multiplier for coin combos, as well as a score multiplier for chaining combos together without missing enemies or coins. Don't allow duplicate items to be won. Very annoying to grind and grind for coins, only to get a duplicate you can't do anything with. Lastly, an option to pay to disable ads would be nice.",
        "The game gives you an unskippable mission to get kills with a certain type of weapon and then will never give you that weapon. I've opened over 100 chests and never got a two handed sword, so my options are pay real money for the the weapon (what they want) or delete this cancer app. I get you have to make money but there are better ways than stopping all progression and ruining the fun. Overall good game 6.7/10",
        "Fun button slasher. Ultimately stopped playing because I got a weapon mission and three random drops buying weapons with in game currency were taking too long to get a weapon of the right type... They want you to pay for them: lame.  Game is a bit unforgiving, especially when you get to boss fights. Once you fail a boss once it becomes much harder to get back which is a strange and annoying design choice."

Its very difficult to be very good without spending real cash but it's possible. You can watch adverts for coins, so be patient and play. The more you play the more you get. You don't need top characters to have great team - you can create great team with average characters if you focus on weapons. Get yourself into a good team, hit faction's minimums and you'll become great.",
        "There are good and bad aspects of this game, but the pros out weigh the cons. You can absolutely level up incredibly high without spending a single penny on this game. You just need patience. One of the funniest aspects of this game is its long term playability. There is always something to do every day and in the long run it all adds up to your benefit.  My only complaint is the pop up windows when you first get on. They show you you've been raided...then you have the notification that you have to check that gives you the same info. If the pop up already gives me the info, why do I still have notifications?",
        "Rubbish repetitive game. After spending ten's of thousands pointlessly I can tell you honestly... don't waste your time or money. It's a very addictive cash cow and just a very smart way to take your money and keep you hooked. Scopely has repeatedly lied and will continue to do so. You have been warned",

Even some p2w toons were able to be accessed later on in some events. With 6 stars, this really isn't the case. This has also caused the Road to Survival community to become more toxic and started making the game unfair/not fun for other players.",

However, the game is not balanced for casual players and the development put a huge emphasis on pay to play.

        "Cool game and really realistic. I give it a good rating. But can you plz update game sothat more players can join 1 room and plz plz plz plz add more possibility's like feeding cows can give more cows and then you can sell some of your cows and buy new ones. Or you can build a pig stall and buy/sell pigs and upgrade a farm house or build a horse place. Or paint some buildings. I would spread the game to all my friends and people i know if you add some of those things. Plz add some of them cause I really like the game alot.",
        "Good games. Fun.. Need more equipments for farm like oldest planters to newest planter balers drill seeds ects. Need john deere too. Need rid of slurry thing not need it. All need is manure and spreader or just hual manure to make mulchs for fields to cover up dirts and need oldest tractors to newest tractos also",
        "Purchased a bunch of tractors and unlocks and had my account charged only to find the game to block me from using my purchases. This game is a money scam. Do not be tricked into making in app purchases. I even tried contacting giants software to give them a chance to correct but to no surprise i did not recive a response to my email, they got my money why would they care now. Save yourself from being taken by this company!!!!",
        "I have absolutely no qualms about giving 5 stars. It's a nice game. I  hope their updates will give an alternative way to the tilt control of vehicles. It's tiring. Can you also consider faster response to queries to your customer care Department?",
        "This is the best game ever I saw for farming. It haves the controls amd graphics. But still theres problem that whenever I purchase any tractor and sell it after I want another tractor then I cant purchase it. The option of purchasing becomes blur. So please make it better. If I will not see any improvement than I will less the stars rated. Regards Jagdish Gadhvi",
        "WHERE are half of my purchases??!!?? I know for sure I bought the big red harvester and the bigger mower, tredder, and wind rower yesterday. My first save has them but today its saying their all locked and I have to purchase again... and yesterday I'm pretty sure I got charged for 250k coin package twice and only received coins for 1 purchase. Can you please fix this or I will be forced to contact Google billing to solve this. FYI I have tried the restore button but that doesn't work as well. I gave you guys several days to respond and nothing. So I'm going to have to cancel those charges"

Deducting credits may not the good way to discipline afk players. Its good if no one's lose or gain star either win or not. Make it the game not counted so players not waist time to pursue the game. I'll give 5 stars if 5 theres improvement. Thanks!",

The only reason this game has so many player is the game size & device compatibility. If your phone is capable of playing \"the famous 3v3 moba\", you'd better play that game",
        "This game is so cool. Only noob will say it hard to play or hard getting hero/skin. Maintain the gameplay and everything will be alright. Sometimes we win and sometime we won't. Only the graphics need to be improve. Come on! It's 2018 already! Make a tournament cause i wanna join!!. (Give me free skin. I give u  5 stars bitchhhhhhhh)",

        "I love this game, I've been playing this for over a year and I still play it daily! All the skins and heroes skills are amazing. But please don't  let me team up with low level players it's affecting my game and stats when I'm trying my best to carry they would just afk which can be frustrating. But overall it's a good game",
        "I hv been playing this game for two years alll good perfect game perfect graphics..bt there should be some changes for the afk players... strict steps should be taken towards for these afk players not bye lowering credit score by banning from game for a period of time so that they won't be spoiling game any further"

        "I love this game. It's very dynamic and the gameplay is good too. The only problem I have is every single time I do PvP... It pairs me with an opponent far greater than what I can hope to beat. Sure, that's great for improving, but it disheartens me and makes me feel like a horrible player when I can't even beat ONE PvP opponent, ever, while playing the game. I would suggest to the devs that the matching system be a little more flexible when pairing. Give us a matching system that will actually give us lesser prepared players too so we can have the fun of winning, as well. Also, I am disconnected every single time I do PvP battles and bounties. Quite unstable, unfortunately.",
        "Amazing shooter game, awesome hero collecting game, great multiplayer game. Definitely suggest that you at least try it out. But one thing you should look out for, it's pretty easy to sink between 5 and 20 dollars a week into this. Sometimes even 40 to 60. But, it's pretty free-to-play friendly if you can't afford to buy some gold.",
        "I really like the game. It's fun and has enough activities and quests to keep you occupied for a while. My only complaint is how they match people up for the PVP missions. Sometimes you get matched up with people with far higher power and Team level menu which makes it nearly impossible to win. other than that I really enjoy the game",
        "Super fun game. I haven't got bored of the game because there's always events going on which is good. One of the better if not the best shooting game I've played. I think there is a slight glitch when using Steele. Sometimes after I activate his open fire skill he doesn't shoot when I press the shoot button.",
        "Latest update definitely made the game harder. I used to run 4 gauntlet levels with little issue but now I can't get through 1 without losing people. Resurrected characters are completely unwelcome and unfair in pvp when you tell on kills for money. Probably going to uninstall, you're welcome for the money Hothead",
        "Starts off ok but then the pay walls creep in and you are constantly bombarded with prompts to spend money. The PVP is absolutely pointless, highest power rating wins every time without exception so you know if you've won or lost as soon as it picks an opponent. Needs a lot of work before I'd consider dropping any real money on it."

        "So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game",
        "A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job 'fun games for free' 👏👌🖒☺",
        "Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you're having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.",
        "I've been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn't force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game's development! :)",
        "Pretty cool app. I'd like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it's pretty cool so far.",
        "This is the most addictive flight simulator I have ever played. The game is fairly easy to progress through without having to spend any money. If I had to find one fault it would be that you can't reverse when on a runway which means some times you have no option but to crash your plane as there is very little room to turn around."

Developers of this game, you must fix the caracteristics of different characters in this game. Literaly all have similar characteristic +1 and +5 etc. And what is the point to collect other characters? For example \"Zero\" character to have +8 bullet pircing and +12 reload, and other characters to have +2, +6, +9, +13, +18... also for weapon is the same thing... make all caracteristics different. You can reword weapon for rank, rank 5 win something, rank 10, 15, 20...",

        "This game is actually okay for a mobile app. The downside unfortunately - as with so many - is that there is never quite enough of anything to progress without spending a considerable amount of money. I invested a lot of time on the zombie event only to find that time was running out and I would not be able to complete it without stumping up a relative fortune. I would have bought this game but refuse to pay to play and watch a ton of advertising in the hopes of getting the gold or tickets or cash or whatever. For what you might pay for stuff like this go and buy a console game. Heck you could buy the console as well on what uou could save avoiding this. Deleting it right niw. Adios greedy developers",
        "This game is a lot of fun, really addictive and completely free to play. Of course you can buy stuff if you want, but it's not necessary.   Multiple game modes, a ton of upgrades.   This is a good one."

        "Awesome game. just a few comments. you guys should have the stuff that's automatically generated (mining for example) running in the background even while the app is closed because otherwise you're just getting maybe 100 every now and then and you feel like you're getting nothing. would be nice for the money that comes every minute to also still run even while the app is off",
        "Great idle game that you can play as much or as little as you want, even if you only have a few minutes. My only gripe is all the inactive guilds. Finding a guild with an active guild master is virtually impossible, and when the gm quits all guild upgrading is over. It's also frustrating that all the upgrades you earn for a guild stay with the guild so if your guild master comes back after 6 months and kicks you, you get to start from scratch with no bonuses.",
        "This game is actually really good. Not as confusing as the picture shows. Lots to explore.   The only thing I would change for a 5 star it to not stop us from battling after 1 hour of playing.  Hypecrafter NX youtuber Sighing out.",
        "I am not able to access the members list after the upgrade, please fix this problem. I have too many inactive players I have to kick out. Kindly fix this asap",
        "great game, but one of the advertisements with a game in it caused my game to crash, and now i get nothing from watching the advertisements, I'd suppose because its still waiting for a reply from the advert. it was a casino advertisement with 3 buttons, and it led me to the top one. other than that, the app is good. definitely didn't expect an attack from the tribe of stretchy nipples.",

If you can fix this i would gladly appreciate",

The shop is sucks. Too much chines character. I dont know my goal at all. Etc.. So many issue for this game needs lot's of improvement.",

Not the first time I have ran into this problem.  Please help me fix this.  I have cleared the game data uninstalled and all that nonsense.",

        "So basically I just sat down to play stick hero. And my goal at the end of the day is to reach at least 100 cherries. Same today. But as I start playing I don't find any cherries on my path. \"That is weird!\" I say to myself. I try to double tap to get cherries it doesn't allow it. So I go to the home page to see how many cherries I have ..... the icon isn't even there???   Despite that concern, love the game its so much fun ! For u people who are looking for a fun catchy game to play here is the perfect game. Please download so much fun and a great game to put on your device!",
        "Awesome but I have some ideas This game is awesome and it never ceases to make me happy. But buying new characters is kind of pointless. Developers you probably won't see this or even care if you do but I think that when you buy new characters the characters should have abilities that you use once a round for free or you can refresh the ability using cherries.",
        "Amazing game...nice timepass.. I love this game.. It is good for kids and I enjoy playing this.. The game doesn't hang and I can't just stop my fingers writing the review.. In the first level o thought it's going to be hard but to my surprise it was easy and smooth... And I loved.. For hours I kept playing it untilthe battery was dead!! The other parts of the game are nice as well especially the voice one!!! Do download😊",
        "False Advertising I mean, in a way. The help example is slower than the actual game. The platform grows faster and the guy runs across instead of the leisurely stroll in the 'tutorial'. Maybe have an option for speed, slower or faster depending on what the player feels like tackling that day. Still a fun game, but come on. We're not all finger-ninjas.",
        "Simply but satisfying It's a very addictive game. I think the little character(s) are adorable. The only complaint I have is when you grab a cherry and then you fall because the stick isn't long enough-in my opinion you should still get the cherry put in your \"bank\". I also like the watermelon level.",
        "An advise read it plz and writ for it if u like! The game is awesome , nyc and funny and chalanging too. but i think it could b more intersesting if we get lifes in it. for example my high score is 22 and i never get on 22 again i remain on 16 or 19 but if i could hav one lyf there i shall surely reached my high score or more...\"thanku\""

        "Seems like a good game. Has gotten allot of good reviews also. Is ashame I can't play it though. I downloaded it, and when I start it tells me I must download the update files. Which I did, even though that's when MORE DATA USAGE. Now it won't even load past a certain percentage, haven't gotten to play yet, even after DIDN'T TONS if files and data worth of the game.........Pls fix so I can actually try the game. I WILL EDIT THE REVIEW IF I GET TO PLAY",
        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "After the latest update the multiplayer rating is bugged and doesn't increase. Also provide some leverage to get the prestige guns because i can hardly afford it. The weapons box also provide useless blueprints of the guns which turns into diamonds and i end up having lots of diamonds and very less credits which doesnt help getting a high end gun.",
        "When im playing online and doing some online events i get credit and xp points after the mach and then when i get kicked out and coming back i have lost everything. This is boring and i want you to fix this problem. I cant play online anymore because there's no one's playing but when my friend is playing on he's phone he always find a mach. Please fix those problems",
        "I like the game but only when i actually works!! It doesn't let me change the graphics settings and it's crashing constantly after each game i play. That's frustrating for such a huge title I'm running android 7.0 on a redmi note 4",
        "It's a game where people will get addicted to it after playing it once.. But every time when we are installing app we have to play the untill 1st check point.. Better developers fix this. So after immediately after installing user must go to his account and sync game data.."

        "Great Sudoku app with clean design and animations.  I like how it gets rid of your notes automatically when you can no longer use one of those numbers in that box.  Also like that when you click on one number it highlights every same number on the page.  Maybe you can make the color of numbers the user inputted to be slightly different than the numbers that they started off with.  Other than that I love the app.",
        "(To the developers: Please add a more difficult level. The Expert level is too easy most of the time) Pretty and efficient. This app is what every Sudoku app should feel like. I am in love with how easy it is to make pencil marks or put in answers. Instead of having to press a cell and input a number each time I want to mark something, I can pick a number use it to paint multiple cells. I also love how it doesn't immediately tell you you made a mistake and lets you figure it out. The different themes are great, especially since I play at night and the darker ones are soft on the eyes.",
        "Default settings display a circle behind 'locked' cells, and no circle behind cells you place. This difference means you cant tell at a glance where The numbers are. You can change settings \"dont distinguish locked cells\" which removes the circles. This helps see all placed numbers, but the circles were distinguishing 'notes' from placed cells, everything mono. 'Dont distinquish' should ADD circles to my cells, not remove from locked.  Other than that, controls are very intuitive, looks and feels good.",
        "A superb implementation of sudoku, with an intuitive and helpful interface. It would be nice to allow us to input our own sudoku, but other than that, this game is complete. A big minus is that the adverts come with sound; this is disruptive and entirely unnecessary.",
        "I'm so grateful to have run into this app. I used to be on iOS, and there was a Sudoku app that performed very well. When I switched to Android, it seemed that every Sudoku game o found was too complicated, too unresponsive, or just too ugly.   Then I ran into this in one of the suggested apps boxes, and man have my Sudoku playing tendencies been saved.   It's minimal, so nothing is confusing or cluttered. It's efficient, so you never waste time trying to maneuver the controls. It's aesthetically pleasing; the whole setup just looks beautiful.   Absolutely worth the 5 stars.",
        "Now that it is possible to pay to remove ads it's a 5. Minor issues: the note highlight should be a dimmer colour than placed numbers, it should not be possible to put a note over a placed number, or at least this behaviour should be a selectable option. If these 3 things are sorted out it will be a five star from me."

The AI will always take advantage of beating you with moves that will take what you need 98% of the time. Moves that no one can see but magically the AI knows what to choose to beat you. I love strategy games, but cheating is not a fun for anyone. The AI compition is not a compition. It's a slaghter waste of time until you get lucky or they give it too you. No strategy there. Just piss you off cheating AI. Being the top of Candy Crush and Candy crush soda. And yes also Jelly. It is ridiculous sometimes to waste my time with this one. If the AI opponents played at the highest level of what to use, then I wouldn't mind getting beaten. But when you watch the AI make the dumbest move to get what it needed, tells you that the AI sees the whole board. Even what is hidden. Give up or beat yourself up on this one. I seem to love the Gluten of punishment, lol.",

Watch the number counter not the monklings going under the rope & u will see the counter not go pass a certain number! THE SAME NUMBER continues like 6 will stay 6 4x's! That way u don't beat the level & u have to buy a booster, KING Co are CHEATS!",

It would help us be less grindy. It would help with collection and able to get legendary easier plus monthly revenue. I would love that. Compare to MFF which is a lot more hectic, you guys a bit more generous. Just please don't put any paywall characters. Hated that.",

We now earn less points because it's impossible to beat higher rated teams and still have full team remaining which means less points and why is every one of my battles only 3-6 points? This clearly isn't the same as others given their points haul. Fix the stuff that doesn't work and leave the stuff that does!",
