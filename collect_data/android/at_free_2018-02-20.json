      'Good but £4 is a lot to not quite remove all the add. Some pictures are still locked behind and walls. Easy enough to unlock but for the price id expected all add to be removed. Also really would like the pictures to be sortable by category with more fantasy and space stuff in the complex pictures. Also there appears to be no way to sync pictures across devices. If I\'ve paid £4 I should be able to switch between the phone and tablet at will. Both are android.',
       'In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it\'s just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.',
       'I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It\'s kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.☺',
       'Awesome app, its oddly satisfying and can either be really challenging ir really easy. Its constantly update with new pictures to do, and already contains probably hundreds lol, if dont 75+ and in saving the really detailed ones for last. If there even is such a thing. But, i think a counter for how many blocks of each color are left would be a really awesome alteration. There are many strategies to use when you do a color by number. So a counter for how many blocks of the selected number are left, it would be such a life save.this game has taken enough of my life already as is lmao',
       'Way to many ads, was hard to enjoy. Would have been more bearable If the ads weren\'t 30 seconds each, and played everytime I open/close a drawing. And, to prevent any ads you have to pay. I just want an easy, accessible, relaxing game. And by either making one pay, or making them suffer is not really my idea of "Relaxing". Thank you for your consideration.',
       'This game is really fun and when u play it u won\'t even know how fast the time has gone by. This game has some really challenging photos to colour which I am still working on. The thing that is not really good about this game is that there are lots of adds that pop up every time. Please improve that. Other than that this game is fantastic and I also really love all of the images we need to colour and how there are different modes u can change image after u have completely coloured it. I would definitely recommend this app.' ,

      'I hope you take the time to read.   This game is amazing, and it just keeps getting better. I do wish you would change the video knives to apples or video. Now I have nothing to spend apples on.  But here is what i really wanted to say i really like this company and the games you put out to your users. I\'m newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me. I own alot of your games and have spent alot trying to help. I wish I had more to unlock things in time. But Thank you very much.',
       'Deleted all my data with no reason. Had a bunch of Legendaries and Rares that have now been deleted. I put a lot of time into this game, and even bought the ad-free package. If you don\'t want a load of wasted time, don\'t download this app.  Edit- Updated the app and levelled up a bit. The game crashes every time I get a free revive. Still a massive waste of time.',
       'I really do like the game. There are two things that get to me however. Knives should all have individual names other than the boss ones. There are also alot of ads, I do understand they need to make 💰. Otherwise the game is great.',
       'I bought the remove ads purchase and it screwed me. I still get adds and i still have to watch videos to remain in the same level. I want my money back since the game is the same. DONT BUY THE REMOVE ADS PURCHASE.',
       'Love the game its addicting and a great way to kill time i remember there were similar games a few years ago i think called aaa but this one is just way better with the graphics and apples and knife unlocking and also the bosses and power ups its fun to play love the idea that it will increase the chance of a power up after i unlock all of them cant wait for the challenges bought the ad remover and continue to support you guys',
       'It\'s one of my favorite games on the play store but since the last update the game keeps lagging and there is a bug where I throw knives and the don\'t land on the logs nor can I hit anything so I just don\'t lose nut because of the lagging happening at the same time it is just unplayable' ,

      'I do enjoy this game but certain levels don\'t give you enough moves to complete the level. The ones you have to match the cubes with the colors makes it impossible to pass when the game doesn\'t give you moves to do so. You waste your moves on areas that doesn\'t give you the opportunity to pass the level and then you don\'t have any moves left before it does give you the moves you need it does get frustrating you get stuck on that level and can\'t pass it. Which will just make you want to unistall the game cause you will never leave that level.',
       'Support don\'t want to help when you have an issue. Once they reply you don\'t have an option to reply to them, you have to start all over again and it\'s the same reply about back up to Facebook etc, which I did.... level 170 and I had to start again, don\'t ask for help, they don\'t care!!! Better of with candy crush or another competitor game',
       'So far so good.  I\'m only on level 12 right now and this fantastic. Kids will feel good about themselves. I\'m hoping that it stays simple for a while longer. Kids tend to have shorter attention spans than adults and get frustrated easier. All in all a great game thus far. Thanks',
       'I absolutely love this game. The graphics are spectacular. The characters well they\'re not characters their cartoons they\'re amazing. And the game is fun. My only complaint is that every level is a struggle to get through and it would be nice if occasionally they would make a few of them easier.',
       'You will not believe what I am about you tell you but this game picks and chooses who to charge for rewards. I have screenshots of my partner\'s game, not having to pay for his rewards and I look at my game, getting charged $2.99 everytime I want my rewards. Its messed up and I have deleted the game.',
       'My grandma has this game and she said, Braelyn go to your app store and get this game called toon blast. I said ok when it finished downloading, I started to play it and i loved it!! Whoever created this game good job!! I cant believe my GRANDMA has the game!! Btw i really love this game. Keep up the good work' ,

      'Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death',
       'Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won\'t register your flips. These aren\'t huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.',
       'Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I\'ll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.',
       'This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can\'t seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn\'t be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it\'s not something you have to add, it\'s just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven\'t seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it\'s an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘',
       'This game would be great if it wasn\'t so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn\'t slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.',
       'Love it. Only thing is there is a glitch when you watch an ad for 200 thingy things you get a menu that lets you get 200 more. Than again, than again. Its better on our side than yours but it would be a good fox so you have to earn them! I love all your games, wish I had all of them but I have limited storage!' ,

      'This is actually a really good game. And while I would refer a flat fee to buy it without ads even the ads aren\'t that bad. Yes there are ads but the game is free and even the "microtransactions" are so minor and the currency so easily obtained in game I can easily overlook the ads. Some have called it a Mario clone but in a way aren\'t most platformers but unlike so many of them this is actually very creative and well done. Excellent job!!',
       'A great Mario Clone.... Very close gameplay to the original. I love playing the game and have got very far through the levels but even tho I was signed in with Google account I lost my game progress after having to reset my phone. Am I missing something? Is there a way to get my progress back?',
       'Really good game only reason I gave it 4* is because when the the toads or snails are close... they seem to be 1 - 2 steps away and you still either die or shrink into small Mario... other than that little glitch it seems really good.',
       'Great game, my children 7 & 4 love playing it.... when they get a chance haha😁 One thing I have noticed is you need to fix up the 111st to 111th after defeating the Boss! There is no st in 111',
       'I love the game but it  kind of have a lot of glinches on level 50 every time I jump off the wheel thing i die me and my neice got the same game she say it has glinches when u step on the mushrooms u die i saw it if u fix most of those glinches it would have only 5 star ratings',
       'I finished all 140 parts, the more higher the more challenging. It always made me curious about this. Wait for d next part 2,3,etc from SWorld Boy Adventures. Just need fixed for controls the pictures doesn\'t​ moved while we repeat at the same level that We failed. Overall for me it\'s good game\'s.' ,

      'Gave 2 stars more than last time...  Now i have all the mines but i think that i will delete this game..... Too much frustrating because of the instability of the game.... The game always shut down either i\'m watching an ad or just upgrading my miners.... When it happens on an ad it\'s thw worst!!!! sometimesi have to redo the same boosting to 3-4 times until it works once... So instead of losing 30-45 sec of my life for a game a lose 3 minutes in all!!!!',
       'The in app purchases are a little overboard. I normally wouldn\'t pay for stuff in an app but for this game I would definitely not even consider it. Nothing should cost more than $50, but there are packages in this app costing $100... that\'s way too much and I really don\'t like it. The only thing I want to see in the game is the ability to upgrade things with a percent amount of money. (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and obviously max which already exists)',
       'This Is A Good Game But Lots Of Glitches Such As You Dont Like The Facebook Or Instagram You Go Back Boom? I Love This Game But It Needs Some Fixes So 4 Stars For Now.',
       'I saw my older son playing his game. Remind me of the old miner game I used to play. On my phone so I gave it a try I loved it. I just sit home and watch TV and play the game. So I could challenge my friends you better catch me',
       'It was a fun time waster while it lasted. I had the game for about 3 days and it just wouldn\'t load anymore. I tried uninstalling and re-instlling but the load screen gets stuck in the same spot. I\'ve uninstalled the app but again, fun while it lasted.',
       'Good game, nice time waster. Got the latest update and now the game will not load past 42%. I missed put on the last day of a special event due to this issue.' ,

      'So I played it on my iPhone e and loved it. Recently o got a new phone and it\'s am android. I connected to my Nintendo account and loaded it up. My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I\'m not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr',
       'I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',
       'Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I\'m paying £9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn\'t make it worth the price being asked.',
       'Super Mario run is a great smartphone game it has the very addicting toad rally and remix ten and the simple, but very rewarding controls. The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars',
       'I could only rate this 1 star as the app does not open, it gives a message saying Unfortunately Super Mario Run has stopped working. Disappointed as I was hoping to get My Nintendo points.  Installed on both my tablet and my phone, neither installation works.  Very disappointing.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game WAY........Before 5/22/17 as my last review states in my prior comment!!.  I paid $9.99 to obtain full access to all worlds! And I\'ve emailed you all with this information,  I\'ve sent proof of purchase!! And all other things required to confirm my statements! But I continue to go ignored as if I never mentioned an issue!.. For some strange & frustrating reason I\'m unable to regain access to the entire tour which I completed not long after I paid the cover fee of $9.99 to do so!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And I\'m NOT wiling to pay for that again!!that\'s certainly an option I\'m NOT willing to apply.  Please repair this ongoing issue.. It will be appreciated beyond words' ,

      'So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I\'ll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It\'s in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I\'ve ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍',
       'this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It\'s so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It\'s just so addicting and I can\'t get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the \'play online\' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊',
       'I\'ve recently upgraded from cubot to galaxy s7 and unfortunately the game is not working properly like it did on the old cubot phone. The screen gets stopping and it\'s impossible to play. I\'ve tried uninstalling and changing Wi-Fi settings but nothing worked. Other than that the game is sick! Love it,my kids love it and it\'s fun to play.',
       'Should allow us to be able to control the speed with a bar level instead of the button. Should make online controllers like offlines. Faster and more sensitive to move. And add a special rare star that floats around the screen rarely that doubles your size by eating it. No matter how big you are. That would be interesting.',
       'Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃',
       'I\'m highly addicted to this game. It\'s a thousand times better then agar.io in my opinion and it\'s really cool that you get to create your own skin. The only downer is that I just wish there was some music because you start to get a bit bored after a while.This game is NOT a waste of time, and everyone needs to download it to experience the awesomeness!' ,

      'Love it! I play it all the time! You can play online or offline - online gives you a chance to revive. Has course like game play or continuous. No pause which is understandable but kinda sucks. Once you get the hang of the controls it becomes  addicting. Would like to see more land and background options... maybe on the next update??',
       'I gannruntee this won\'t make it on the review list but oh well. I just uninstalled this game because I paid the $2.49 for no ads and it doesn\'t work. Don\'t waste your time or money. I really like the game bit there are way TOO MANY ads and when you try to hit home to bypass the ads the game freezes up. So until they fix the problem I WILL NOT download this game. I\'ll find another one similar.',
       'A good concept, I love the gameplay and have a highscore of 589. But the ads are way too common, it\'s always a 30 second or 15 second ad after every death; It\'s like our motivation to keep the ball going is just so we don\'t have to watch an ad. Plus, sound would be good to add for Dune.',
       'I really like the game actually but I paid to get rid of the dumb ads and yet everyother frickin game more ads. If you pay to get rid of the ads the shouldn\'t be any. NONE So they took my money and gave me nothing for it so to me they kinda stole my money. To me thats not right. How many people are they takimg money from without fulfilling their end.',
       'I wish i could rate 0 stars, when thus game first came out i played it but got bored pretty soon. Alot of people are playing it at my school now so i decided to try it again, well what do you know the game isnt even starting up now. It goes to the voodoo screen and exits out the app. I already tried downloading it some times and from different sources. Not good...',
       'Cool game but the ads are irritating. I paid for the ad free but I\'m still getting ads. Contacting the developer and will request refund if they don\'t do anything.  Update: Has become so glitchy that I can\'t even play very well anymore. Still have ads and haven\'t received a refund.' ,

      'I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It\'s pricey but we\'ll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn\'t need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get',
       'Omg I have just realised that it was 1 year ago since I wrote that! So I\'m going to write a new one!. I love this game so much it has such good graphics and I recommend this game for any age I am addicted to this game and I think that you should definitely get it. It is a great game and I love it! So what are you waiting for go ahead and download it right now!',
       'Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn\'t need to have the internet on. Don\'t know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.',
       'this is a very well made game with excellent graphics and challenging play. It is however very money focused. The beginning levels are structured to encourage upgrades which at first are reasonable. Each later stage requires more diamonds to complete. The so called \'challenges\' are Impossible to complete without upgrading every implement so are essentially impossible for free play. Players beware!',
       'I love the way this game plays, and it plays like a dream. The grafics are wonderful, but there is just one flaw. The diamonds. You have to either play for a long time to earn more diamonds, and you can, or buy them with real money. And the game causes you to spend more diamonds than you can earn. From the atmosphere itself, to the food, and the appliances. Unless you have a lot of time and patience, or have the money to buy diamonds, this game might grind your nerves.',
       'Very nice graphics and addictive. The best thing is that it does not force you to pay for better progress. Ads are not noticeable. It provides a very comfortable playing environment.  It could be even better if the food can be more sensitive to touch. I always fail to grab those cooking food causing them to be burnt. Nice game overall though.' ,

      'This is an awesome game that gives you daily and weekly quest\'s and offers treasure chests. Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven\'t tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.',
       'Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a "slide," I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don\'t compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.',
       'I love all the graphics it\'s a bit like the        piano tiles it test\'s your fast skills but except it is temple run 2 love it. Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.',
       'I love this game, very addicting. And I love that it has the daily, weekly and global challenges. As well as objectives and the daily chest challenges. Lots of things to work for and win. Makes the game more fun. Plus, so far, I haven\'t come across anything that I\'ve had to spend money on in order to advance in the game',
       'All I want Imangi is a reset button,  the ability to start from scratch... Your original allows me to do this when I uninstall and reinstall. Been there,  done that,  would like to do so again but all my collected junk follows me',
       'I have been.playing this game and won valentine and Chinese new year run but main problem is same glitches as in old temple run the score 24,000 suddenly becomes 4000 and then to open new map destinations you need 500 diamonds so it\'s quite glitchy and unrealistic' ,

      'UNINSTALED   Need alot of gold (money to get it) to finish special even its true...!!! you can\'t finished that even if don\'t have it. yes it\'s a MONEY MAKING GAME..!!! actually, it\'s pretty good game but you need to improve your server, it\'s fu**ng so long... need 5 minutes to enter the game. please even if  I got a good internet, still to long long time to enter the game. please​ fix it up.',
       'Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won\'t reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.',
       'The game starts off good in the first couple levels. But once you start getting to the faster cars, it becomes way harder to keep up with the cars PR points, to get to better races. Unless you spend real money to get the parts. One question I do have. Is about the blackridge rivals. Why put some one with a car at a way higher level against a person who\'s car isn\'t even close to the car at a high level, and one more thing... make the races longer. 20 seconds a race isn\'t fun at all. Thinking with the name "Need For Speed". You guys would of done a lot better. The only thing that I seem to like are the  graphics... But that\'s about it...',
       'Goog game, adddictive infact. But I don\'t understand the concept of PATANJALI adds. Whenever i choose to see adds to reduce the waiting time, you comeup with Patanjali adds of 10 and 20 seconds and the irritating part is the time doesn\'t gets reduced even after watching the whole add. Please fix this. When you say reduce wait time by watching add, you need to actually reduce the waiting time after the add instead of insisting to watch the add again and again.',
       'When I started playing this game I really enjoyed it. But now I realise that in order to progress, you MUST spend REAL money. I am a family man, with a wife and 6 children, I just wanted a game that I could play when kids are in bed and wife is in bath, I don\'t have cash to spend on games, the worst thing is the 7 Day events, you cannot beat them without spending money. Very disappointed. Good game but don\'t expect to progress very far if you don\'t want to spend money.',
       'The game is undoubtedly based on a pay-to-play foundation. Car Series is virtually impossible without spending money. Even with pulling all nighters, spending over 1000 gold, and not wasting a single ticket, I couldn\'t make the PR requirement for the final race of blackridge rumble. 7 days of suffering to get 40 blueprints.' ,

      'I played Game of War for appx 3 years.  The game started out great, everyone was on a somewhat even playing field. The game advanced to quick and left thousands of players behind. Other Players and I felt we could never keep up.  I hope this game advances at much more slower rate.  We all spend money to enjoy the game!    Don\'t be gready like GOW.  Thank you in advance.  Kirk',
       'Overall great game, however to play and be competitive ait is important to spend. In fact just to unlock some features you must spend at least .99 which is fine by me since I love to spend on this game anyways. I have been playing koa from the start and when this game came out I jumped on the bandwagon in the first 50 kingdom servers. So with that said yes it is LOTS of fun, I love my GoG family and definitely addicting LOL see you on the burning war field ;)',
       'It is a fun game and is the most indepth game I\'ve ever played. That all being said, unless you have a ton of money and a lot of time there is no way this game is worth it. I\'ve spend over $100 and play multiple times per day and I still find it hard to level up my estate. Even in an alliance unless they\'re all very high level it isn\'t much help. I\'m sure they\'re are much better games in this genre then Guns of Glory. To me it seems like a game for wealthy people and made by a company to just make money.',
       'What a great game!  Need to have introductory levels for newcomers, though.  You build your kingdom up and larger kingdom\'s just rush in and destroy you.  When you recover, they come right back.  Level into the attack mode, so people will enjoy the game more.  I am uninstalling after 6 weeks of running an Alliance, because it\'s just not worth the trouble.  Great concept, fantastic graphics!',
       'Love this game! Very entertaining, never boring. My only complaint is with some of the collecting events. You have to do certain things to obtain the necessary items to put together, but for some reason with the current one you don\'t get enough of one item, and too much of another. It would be great if you could trade within your alliance for things like this.',
       'It\'s an interesting game of strategy.  You make allies in order for your alliance to grow. At the same time always on your guard knowing at any time your allies can instantly become enemies to prevent you on your way to becoming the strongest alliance in the kingdom. There are new quests to complete weekly. Each with different rewards that help you to achieve power.There are many kingdoms on the map which is great. The only downside is you have to leave one kingdom and join another to enter it and play the game in it. Not sure if you get to keep the same level and strength you achieved. But I\'m sure that the developers will one day have it to where kingdom will be able to attack kingdom and there\'s a lot of kingdoms. The game would definitely become very intense and even more exciting then. It would also become one of the best of the best strategic games there is.' ,

      'Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it\'s advertised too much, but it\'s definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That\'s slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.',
       'Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I\'ll be playing this for a long time! I\'m working on the living room right now, getting close to level 600. Can\'t wait to see what the new character, Jerry, has in store for us! Thank you Playrix!',
       'I really like this Game so Far. I will play for awhile to See how it Works & If I like it. Absolutely Love Your Game. Play it ALL THE TIME!!! I Must Admit that I Really Do enjoy this Game! Sometimes I find myself Having a Hard Time With Certain Levels. I Could be On that Level for Days or a Few Weeks. I think with Some Improvement that Would make People Play. This Game More. But I Must Say Hat\'s Off to The Developers',
       'Fun at first but levels become way to hard to quickly and it makes it very hard to advance in the game. U have to beat 2 levels to do one task and some levels u need to play 20 time to get past. Abd with only 5 lives at a time. Makes it kind suck. And frusterating to play. Please make 1 task per 1 level',
       'The reason why I love the game is bc its very addictive An it helps me concentrate. The only thing that I would like to suggest that we pull our friends in the game an work at these harder levels together so we can move forward to help Austin an his family members out. We still  need to be able to use our coins when we desire to not have to go through 2 boards on a game.',
       'It\'s catchy and addictive. Hooks you early. Enjoy the graphics, storyline and gameplay.  However as you get further into the game you pretty much have to spend money to advance. If you get an award, say an hour of free playing time, its rare to advance during that free time so it\'s a waste of an award.  On a smaller note there are not many decorating options. This is not a deal breaker for me however.' ,

       'After I posted my recent comment, there were some angry comments pointed out at me. I apologise for that. I mean, this game in great! There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars. For someone who says "too many notifications", go to the settings and turn off that notifications button. Thank you for those hate critics you guys made. It really teached me a lesson.',

      'I have seen this as an ad. I thought I should give it a try. It worked out. Before long, I reached level 15. Now I\'m on level 33 and I have 8.448 trillon gold! I automated 100% of my farm!  I\'m already making lots of gold with automating potatoes. Potatoes give away so much gold! Great update!  Keep up the good work! Thanks, Idle Farming Empire! What a good replacement for Farm Away!                  Idle Farming Empire is like the best simulation for farming. I gave the game 5 stars for a reason. I loved the game! Look under the review! There\'re many people rating the game 5 stars. Over 78,800 people did it! Thanks for everything!',
       'I LOVE THIS GAMEE!! It\'s so addicting and once u get used to it, u can\'t stop playing it! It\'s a great time killer and it auto saves (not of u connected to Facebook.) Again, I love this game and I would recommend this game to EVERYONE because it\'s for all ages (unless u are a very serious person) JK LOL! :D',
       'OK, I love Idle clickers and this is a great game in this genre. Easy to get into, ads not forced on you, nice graphics.  There is one thing that is really bugging me though. You start out with your standard 9 crops and you can then unlock more for each plot. My issue is it does not tell you when you unlock a new one if it earns more than the standard one. Do they just look different but earn the same? Apart from this... Love it. Keep up good work devs',
       'AMAZING! I love this game. It is so addicting and a great way to pass time and boredom. I think though for one small improvement you could add a thing where there are like \'mini games\' and you earn coins for that. Using those coins earend in the mini games you spend it on things like watering cans, fences for live stock and more! This was only some suggestions for a bigger game if you can have or make a new game called like farm life or something like that....LOVE IT...',
       'Like so far But, 2 issues. 1- I don\'t Facebook or do any social media so needs to be a way other than ads for those bonuses. 2- daily rewards Don\'t happen. Shows that they were collected but will not activate unless I have enough diamonds. Please fix. Play offline on tablet and hotspot to get daily reward.',
       'Great and addicting game, but with one major bug. I went to collect my idle money and I watched a video too double it (46 billion total). But when I hit the button to collect it, I never got it. All the money dissapeared and I got nothing. What\'s the point of an idle game, if you don\'t get anything for being idle?' ,

      'I really like the game, but as soon as I played multiplayer my phone crashes. I know it\'s not my phone itself but the program because my phone never crashes to anything. Please fix the multiplayer mode! It\'s really nice but constantly crashes!!! Only because of that, I\'m giveng it one star. As soon as it\'s fixed I\'ll be sure to give it 5 star and share it with my friends.',
       '1. The online mode isn\'t letting join a match 2. There should be special moves, like when you fall down, if you press the slide button, you won\'t lose speed (like in Mirrors edge) 3. The courses/levels are too easy, make it more harder',
       'The game is good. I like this game because of the fact it\'s parkour. The fact I don\'t have a life means I can take time on the game,the graphics are great I can clearly see what and how I\'m doing. So the game play is good. I know what controls to use, what to do, and it\'s a good. But I can\'t get over the fact that there is not a lot of color. There is only red and black. So I think they should be color.  Good game otherwise',
       'The game is amazing, just the online part, not that it crashes it\'s just people leaving the game, such as disconnecting when I\'m ahead. Can you add a system to where you can\'t leave a game even when you close the game. It will be great for people to stop rage quitting when I have a good lead.',
       'So I turned on the game and I did some steps, maybe 30 passed and I laughed, I turned it off and I uninstalled it.  It is without a doubt hilarious.',
       'Some of the player crashing in the game pls fix so they can\'t cheat no more and when you do that I can give you 5star' ,

      'I love this game. Every game I\'ve had, I played for a week or so, and uninstalled. But this one? Ive had for almost 6 months. Been playing every single day. Finally reached legendary 32, I\'ve unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so. Or at least a new adventure spot. Making a modded version of the rally car would be fantastic. Also, an upgrade on the formula car where it doesn\'t almost dead stop after it lands from a big air.',
       'Superb game! Too bad, the elements of hate like to hack good things and cause frustrations. For this reason, constantly run constant updates. I wouldn\'t mind paying through my rather expensive data to diffuse the damage by these bored, small prick nincompoops! Africa😝😝😝',
       'Pay to win sh**.  Written by sell out morons.  Unbalanced....  Frustrating......  Physics models change almost daily or are perhaps \'randomised\'  to "re-balance" the game.   Net effect, as you maximise your vehicle, it gets slower!   Don\'t waste your time.....  Way too many adverts too, rewarding the imbeciles that created this drivel....  AVOID AVOID AVOID!',
       'Pretty good game the Ads are insane and they want a ton of money per month to get rid of them. Seems to be the way all the games are going. For the Chinese new year could have mad a tuk tuk I think it\'s called a mini taxi. Or something cool for China.',
       'Alot of fun but needs new maps and vehicles. Wayyy overdue for some new stuff.  Update: since the latest update I was very disappointed to see that they nerfed the magnet. Still waiting to see new maps and vehicles',

      'Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!',
       'Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm\'s Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!',
       'Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I\'m just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it\'s going to be good.  We\'ll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!',
       'This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10',
       'I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game since the last lvl was ToE. First time when i was surprised was an update with three or four new maps, also demon levels, but that was actually nothing, i felt at this moment \'\'Wow, update, ok\'\'. I got more admired by new update with this walking thing, still dunno the name, but things they have added, i still love it. Animated trails, new wallpapers that was awesome. New updates have arrived in mini-games for free, also awesome, but now i guess they have no idea what to add, because what they\'ve done this is the biggest and greatest update. I love this game so much, so i can\'t just put 4 or less. Gg RobTop, Gg.' ,

      'After a week of play , I am getting to attack smaller cities , KILL KILL,  grate time filler,  some sexier clothing options for the (ladies) would be nice,  lots to do and manage, clans mates are important, so chose wisely. I am enjoying this immensely.  Edit after (time seems like forever,)  I am really enjoying this,  Negotiated a couple of Peace Treaties, built my crew and strength, I am getting to be a force to reckon with... But there are still bigger fish, frustrating  Would love a feature to hunt the attacker, but then that would backfire too,   Great game...lots of challenges and opportunities for growth,  Highly recommended   *****',
       'So many players have reported on one player that keep spamming the city.  Just because he cant take it when his city got burned .  Check ur report n banned him from playing. Or many others player will start quitting.',
       'Game just made to make money. Well of course, all games are like that but other games you can enjoy. I\'m getting offer to buy special packs of gold all the time and that is annoying. Of course Ill buy sone stuff and spend sone money but first I want to make sure game is type of game I want to play for longer time. I also received card to move my base for free. Cool, great thing. So I decided to move my base and there is interesting thing happening. When I choose where I want to teleport I need to pay in gold. When I choose to use free move card I cant choose location. So I ended up using card for nothing and now only option is to earn or buy gold. Is it a bug or made on purpose so that players must buy gold I don\'t know, but I know I\'m deleting game because I want game that I can enjoy more. If you fix this problem let me know and Ill maybe give second chance to game. Anyway its too sad for such a cool game.',
       'Newbie dont play this game. It\'s was fun at first then you follow the instructions as normal. But at the end of the day you will get stuck and you will run out of supplies.. Their idea is to make you buy.',
       'It\'s your standard "GOW" clone with a Godfather ripoff motif.  You know the formula: spend money, build fast, get stomped by the kiddies with access to daddy\'s credit card who spend thousands of $$$.    Guaranteed to trigger the easily offended due to scantily clad women.  Hilariously bad "Engrish" text throughout the game.    Just get your currency for whatever other game it is you play as fast as possible and move on.',
       'I reported a spammer a lot of times and for whatever\'s happening I know I\'m not the only one who does it but he\'s still there. The server chat is crashing and we see no actions done against him. This is getting ridiculous. One of my clan mates who is a p2p has already quit due to this level of obnoxiousness. Do something.' ,

      'I think it\'s a good game but sometimes the ball would go in but then it bounces out you should also add modes, one like there are walls all around and I like the game keep making these addictive games:D also all you guys stop with the adds just turn off your WiFi let them have some money after hard work on many game\'s like would you want to make a game and not get money and just get  ALL YOUR COMMENTS WITH ADDS! ohhh that would be soo annoying.',
       'Ya hate ads? Turn off wifi and play. Stupid phone/gaming noobs. Its a good game and dont hate on it for ads. The ads make the people who made the game MONEY. Give then a break. Let them have money while u watch something u might want. If u wanna turn it off, like i said, turn off wifi.',
       'Fun simple game burdened by a slew of constant advertising. Ads while you play, full screen timed ad when you restart (99.9% of time) and an optional 1 time 30s full screen ad to resume. Simply put too many ads!',
       'Would pay for the game to remove ads. I get you can turn off WiFi/data but it shouldn\'t be necessary, and is unfair to the company itself. Please offer a paid ad-free version!',
       'I genuinely liked the game it was fun and addictive but the ads is what kills it. Ad pop up like almost everytime you lose.. other than that its a grest game. The ads make me want to delete it. I hated giving this game a 1 star..',
       'Fun game but way too many advertisements, which happen to blow through data. I\'ve spent about 1 hour playing the game and have gone through 224mb of cellular data. There is a 30 second ad after every single restart. Even if you goof up and get a score of 10. It\'s horrible. I have to turn off data in order to play the game, and then I can\'t do a 2nd chance. You neeeeeeeed to cool the ads' ,

Even if you don\'t mind to wait 200 days, you will not able to afford it (lvl 10 military Def, Atk, Health cost 100m gold each). DO NOT GO FOR HIGH MILITARY AND T4 WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE GAME.',
       'This game is fun but be prepared for the mother of all Pay2win games.  These folks at IGG are experts at crafting new and exciting ways at fleecing their customers of every cent they can.  You CANNOT compete if u dont pay and pay often.  Players here ...just regular people... dump hundreds of rl $$$ regularly.  You have been warned.',
       'If you like spending mad money to be an Internet tough guy this is the game for you.  Of you have tons of time to kill to be a punching bag for pay to play Internet tough guys it may also be the game for you.  If the computer random stuff kills off your troops don\'t expect to get tech support, it will always be reviewed in 1-3 days, even the next time you ask, another 1-3 days.',
       'Game Sucks! Super high levels can come in wipe you out, seems like if they had a level limit, let\'s say 5 levels above you they can\'t attack, but O NO!!  Every day I come in to find I have been attack by a level 25 and I\'m only a level 14. It takes days to rebuild, so yeah everyday same thing, about to uninstall this game not worth it to me...',
       'Too many higher lvl people attacking lower lvl players. ( lvl25 attacking lvl10. lvl45 attacking lvl8. ) Even in a guild doesn\'t help.  Fix this and it may be playable. It is too long a slog to get any lvls or resources to be build your castle to any lvl to have any sort of fun. Takes to long and not worth it. Better faster ones out there without the ganking on earlier lvls. Avoid like plague unless you like paying to get ganked by others all the time !!!! They only way to get ahead is to pay and then you still get ganked !!!!',
       'This game is a money pitt. You spend time of money to get a head just to have somebody who has played longer than you and spent mote money than you target you and destroy you. Or have the overlords put a title on you and now your a target and get a negative buff that is impossible to get rid of. Don\'t waste your money.' ,

      'The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won\'t annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie',
       'Its a legit fun game to play but...  For me I get streshed because when I need to do it over again then u  streshed by not doing it...    Its still kind of a good game though..

       'Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it\'s fun because it\'s challenging and there\'s super fun things in GD except hacking because that\'s no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I\'m super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂',
       'Well, I admit, I\'m addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn\'t be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can\'t Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍',
       'It\'s a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it\'s super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.',
       'The game is great. I just have three words it\'s AAA Addicting annoying but awesome at the same time. The graphics and colours made the gameplay even better. I love it! And for all the people who have it u just need to practice cause practice makes perfect and don\'t rage quit !😎' ,

      'Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It\'s nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don\'t want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn\'t get a key.',

       'Fun game but takes forever to get gold to upgrade. The cost to pay for the gems to buy so you can buy gold is really expensive. Not much dynamic to the game. Same stuff on each level just takes longer to bet enemies cause of higher HP.',
       'It stopped working on my One plus! Help! I was excited about the side games! *********************************** Excellent, addictive fun. I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn\'t level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can\'t progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.',
       'This game is really good.  The more you play the harder it gets but it is doable and you can watch ads to get you trough without paying.  I am around level 35 & haven\'t spent anything.  It is a hard to put down game.  The visuals are super satisfying,  especially when you get your little bombs kicking butt on the upper side of the enemy and they get faster and faster.  So satisfying!',
       'I wish I read the reviews before I downloaded this "game". Absolutely awful. Seriously, don\'t waste your time. If you like a stupid amount of ads and you are a fan of being bored then go for it.' ,

      'It was really bad the control\'s were very slow. Animals and mobs were very glitchy. If you want something simalur to Minecraft the closest thing is crafting and building you can even go on cools servers and stuff and it\'s almost just like mcpe. This game needs a lot of work and it should still be in beta.',
       'The game loaded just fine but the controls are weird and there are SO many ads.. Wouldn\'t recommend unless you\'re just really bored and don\'t mind having ads ever 3 seconds:)',
       'Okay, Okay, Stop worrying about the ads. I must tell you that... This is not Minecraft, It\'s Dumbcraft. The reason is is that you can NOT activate Redstone (Bluestone) stuff cause preserplates, Buttons, and Levers don\'t activate and all you do is hit a thing. So don\'t download this.',
       'there are way to many adds there are so many I didn\'t even have time to load a game it i sutpid! I do not think you should play this game!',

      'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'Well after playing it for so many months. It now has not let me play for about a  week out of no where, it loads to 50% and then it asks to try again later I have uninstalled it many times and retried time after time. All of my other games work just not this one. Don\'t really know what to do. It sucks because this is my favorite game too.',
       'This is  the best game ever. And supercell, can u add google + sign in so that people who don\'t use facebook can also have friends.. Also I have like 8 leggie right now and I am so happy. And the new clan battle is awesome, it is the best. I wish it is permanent. Anyways clan battle is so fun to play and who ever created it.. U r awesome. Keep up the good work Supercell. Love you so much and ur games.😙😙😙❤❤❤❤😀😁😁😊😊😊',
       'Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn\'t one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you\'re better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖',
       'This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.' ,

      'Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I\'m 32 and play this often so it\'s not just for kids . Give it a try it\'s very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen 😉',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.',
       'Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can\'t do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!',
       'I love this game, its very challenging. The only thing I don\'t like is that your aquariums end up way overcrowded with stuff before you can move to the next aquarium. Of course you can move on to the next one as soon as its unlocked, but I won\'t move on until I have all 3 stars. So honestly, I guess this is just my issue. I probably should have given it 5 stars, because my issue is the only reason I didn\'t.',
       'So far I like it. But not on a very high level well see how this progresses. Well now I\'m on a level that I keep losing  by one  or ten mainly bcuz all the graphics  are stationed in the exact space so. And while it\'s true u don\'t need WiFi to play u do need it for ur daily prize which u really need.',
       'Oh this is so cute! Other match games don\'t give such a reward - it\'s like playing a decorating game also! It would be very helpful to grey out or list the items & fish already purchased. It\'s easy to duplicate items which wastes coins earned & doesn\'t count towards trophy challenges. I don\'t like the bomb boosters on the right as I\'ve accidentally used them when not needed. I haven\'t spent any real money on this game. I just keep retrying the level. I\'m on level 644. Lots to go yet!' ,

      'The game hangs rather often. It also has some notable bugs e.g. after completing a time-based challenge, I have to exit the area and reenter otherwise I cannot select another challenge. Also, I spent 60,000 coins on a box but then game hanged there, and when I restarted, the coins were gone but I had no rewards added. Disappointing in these aspects but generally action-packed fun without too much thinking.',
       'I initially gave this game a great review but after some weeks of playing the game it started to restart and take me back to the tutorial stage deleting all of my characters without allowing me to retrieve my saved data, even though there is a Google play option that assures you that your data would be retrievable if you click here. Fix this issue and I would be more than willing to change my opinion of the overall game. Until then it\'s not worth downloading',

One thing that make me frustated is the energy sistem how to heal and revive so i cant fight all day . Its beter not to heal or revive so we can play for hours',
       'This is not tekken, it\'s something else entirely with a tekken skin. I\'d rather play tekken 3 on epsxe, why didn\'t you just stick to the original control format for fighting. May as well be playing candy crush and leave my brain to turn to mush.',

      'I think that we should get more  coins for winning the levels. I find that the game can cost me money that I don\'t have, so I will spend less time playing your game. I love this game alot but why play if you are not getting enjoyment because it costs to much to play. (Otherwise I love the game) I also never got my horse, please give me my horse, I really need that horse btw. I already had a name for her to. I was going to call her daisy. The name goes great with the garden theme. (If you hadnt realized thst already) Please please send me daisy, I love her already. Peace.',
       'It was a lot of fun the first few "days" but got very hard very fast. Don\'t bother with power-ups as it doesn\'t really make a difference. The only way to win is to get lucky with a big bomb. That\'s it. It\'s a shame because the game is nice, I just progress way too slowly now for it to be worth playing.',
       'I enjoy playing this game but I think 900 coins is crazy for 5 extra lives. There are other games I play that offer less coins and a boost for a smaller price. On one game I play it\'s 65 coins for 10 extra moves and a boost, on a different one it\'s 25 coins for 5 extra moves. I also think that stars for each level should vary too. For harder levels it should be 3 stars, for medium levels it should be 2 stars, and for easy levels 1 star. I\'ll continue to play no matter what, it\'s fun, challenging and strategical!',
       'The first thing that comes to mind is that you guys have gone above and beyond on this one!! It\'s so much fun!! From the interactions of restoring the grounds, to decorating them (custom, might I add !!)    To the actual sounds the game makes while playing.. I can\'t stay off of it. And yes I\'m constantly tempted to purchase coins when I can\'t beat a level, for like the 7th time!!  Haha 😂 Great game guys!! We would ALL appreciate more gifts than currently available. Especially for your daily addicts, 😁 Forever a gamer.     Xx',
       'I rly enjoy this game the only 2 dwn falls it has.. is it only let\'s u spin the wheel every other day and when you get a free life.. it won\'t let you use it. It says ur lives are full. so you never get it also i wish it gave u more than 5 lives im on level 244',
       'Loving it.  Reached level 370, and am really enjoying the game. Fun, good graphics, good story. Nice balance of challenging levels and easier ones, but so far no levels that look impossible. On the negative side, 900 hard won coins for 5 extra moves is ridiculous. When replaying a level it would be nice if you could go straight to the game play without the screen telling you what you need, we already know.' ,

      'I think there should be option of chatting with guild members and other players not voice chatting but message ones.  There should be some research option in every guild or either there should be some Commander talent points by which we can increase some of the tactics of team & player.  Main Idea :  I think there should be some event in which 2 guilds can fight with each other & there should be option of ally & others.  I know it\'s kinda different game but it will make fun to game.   Overall this game is best and addictive,  Thanks for making this game.  Great effort by dev team.  Love you.',
       'The game itself is awesome, the gameplay is awesome. However I\'d suggest to make the following changes to make the game better. First I\'d add an event each week which would allow players to play different matches like training with bots or zombie apocalypse and many more. I know his might be hard but I\'m also recording free fire  for my YouTube channel ( Natan Prokop ) and trying hard with it. So it would be nice if you also added ladders and so you could climb to like buildings and towers. I\'d  also add revolvers, at least one type. Please sub to my channel and if you could add the things above that\'d be great',
       'This game is good fun but pls can u stop peoee from running u over as when 8 get in top 3 some keeps running me over. It\'s still and amazing games but when people run u over its boring and wish u could stop people from doing this   is th8nkthere u should maybe be able to drive places but when u want to fight they have to get out and shoot and have a proper gun fight . Overall this is a great game my favourite mobile game and it\'s really enjoyable. But pls can u make people not being able to do this. Thankyou',
       'I\'ve been facing a new issue. I always used to get a ping of around 140 - 180 ms with my Jio until day before yesterday. But, since then, I\'m always getting a ping of 300+ ms. This is really annoying. Close combats are pretty impossible. I\'ve checked everything. My network is fine. I get a better ping in other online games which I play. My friends have been facing this issue as well. So, it has become harder to play squad and duo matches as well. Please do something about this Garena. I would definitely drop a 5 star then.',
       'great game!  i love the game, its a great game to pass time, with epic moments like a random dancing gun and etc. I have played other games like this on my phond i still prefer FF. BG, the update was also good love the addition of the grenade. 1 thing that would be good to add is a chat box when players are still in lobby. I would have given this 5 star but There are still bugs and glitches',
       'This game is soooo addictive, i play like 40 matches on day. It would be cool a new map in desert or something like that. 4 stars this game because almost everything you need to buy with real money, but no money matters skill matters. Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!' ,

      'Very fun and time killing. I play with my bf and 2 friends and we all try to beat eachothers high scores. It can be pretty competitive. Im prob gonna try to get more ppl to play with me too lol. There could be more variety in the blocks, and there should be like different modes, just an idea',
       'Its cool and all but needs some extra features.  Maybe a way to store 1 brick for later or some level advancement.  Maybe challenges or a power up system. The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.',
       'What they show on the preview and what it gives you in game don\'t even match. They make it look like it so easy. You cannot rotate the pieces. The pieces they give are so random, and most games you can barely get past a couple of turns before you can\'t place anymore and you lose.',
       'This is very deceiving. It looks like it\'s Tetris, but it\'s not. The pieces don\'t come down like the pictures show. I hate apps like this who deceive people to believe its a certain game when it\'s not just to get people to download. Will never download a game from this developer again.',
       'This app would score a lot better if there was an option to get rid of the adds. If gladly pay to have them gone but that isn\'t an option for some reason. They\'re so intrusive and far too frequent even for a free game. Uninstalling and won\'t be coming back',
       'This game says it has all different types of shapes but it has the same ones from another puzzle game. I think this game was very boring and that you should not download it' ,

      'So nice to sit and enjoy a game of challenge. Almost as much fun as chess, but easier to carry. Great way to relax while waiting for the zombie apocalypse or the bus to come. Thank-you and keep up the awesome work.  *UPDATE* 17 FEB 2018.  Have started my friends and family trying to get Top Score. No one is really trying as they are all enjoying playing the app to care. Brought a tear to my eye. Once again, "Thank-you"  for a truly  wonderful game.',
       'Great game. Starts easy so you can get your eye in and then gets harder. Fun to play and not so difficult that you give up and uninstal. Ads are over fairly quickly and I like that you can choose to watch some to get extra coins.',
       'Nice game I like it very much and in game if we don\'t have money so they ask watch and after watching video they give 100 or 200 Rs the game is very long and after win we got a new Ball',
       'It starts easy but gets you thinking later on. the graphics are good for the style of game as well. Overall a very fun and addictive game.',
       'Addictive and keeps your mind alert to new routes for the ball, the adverts are annoying but hey!!!',
       '1/13/2018:  I really really love this game!! Hope you keep making more levels!! Keep them coming!! Thank you !!  UPDATE:2/6/2018 Still love the game even tho the levels are getting harder. Keep them coming!! Thank you!!' ,

       'It\'s awesome very addictive, my game likes to freeze or glitch sometimes and I crash or die but it\'s a free game so not overly concerned about it. Overall great game when they game out with the sequel it addressed the main problem with this one mainly no other maps and you have to pay to get the female character',
       'I think this  game is so interesting  that I play it all day , and somtimes  it tell you that you  should  never ever  steal any thing  from a dangerous  place where nobody  is there, it is really  difficult.  Good luck  and be  safe',
       'It\'s a great game to spend time playing on but I would like the controls to change, their to annoying when I jump I die and am like WOAH... I JUMPED, THOUGH!!! otherwise. Great game.',
       'The game is cool but there\'s a few things that have gone wrong because when my 10 and 5 year old grandchildren  play they say when we try to jump it won\'t let us so it would mean a lot if you changed it a bit',
       'I did it I mean I get my high score and then I died makes no sense right snow total stands but not mad at this game because like I can definitely not beat it it\'s like a fun and active game I would give it like a 5 of I didn\'t die like the heck' ,

      'First of all It\'s joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add "Edit and changing names"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱',
       'I realize y\'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don\'t pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I\'m pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It\'s a pretty good app and I\'ve sent many people to download your app.',
       'Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don\'t decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don\'t mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don\'t actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.',
       '8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don\'t win any games until those coins are over and I\'m only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don\'t know why this is happening but it sucks because it\'s putting me off the game.. it\'s like 8 ball is making sure I\'m losing hence the rate 3',
       'This is the most addictive game i have playing since a bought this phone. All the new updates are cool. Need to get rid of those hackers playin along. Also when we get a phonecall the game reopens, its better if you  reconnect it during the tier its self .. very plesent game give lots of happiness.. make sure you work with above mentioned glitches, then 5* is sure.',
       'I love this game an it is def super fun. Only complaint I have has nothing to do with the actual game play tho. When ever I try to get free coins from doing offers like surveys even tho I do everything it ask in order to get the coins it ends up never giving me the coins even after I do everything it says... plz fix this problem. Or reward me with the coins I never got from completing certain offers.other than that I love the game.' ,

       'IT\'S SO CUTE! I LOVE IT! I JUST HAVE 3 SUGGESTIONS.  1. CAN YOU ADD A BOOKSHELF INTO THE BED ROOM SO WE CAN READ TO OUR BUNNY? 2. WHEN RUBBING THE BUNNY IT PURRS LIKE A CAT?

       'Love my bunny,but would like to be able to save my progress from one  device to another maybe via email form as I\'ve worked hard on her,game sometimes bit glitchy please also add more games so this game does need an update',
       'Like everyone says, it is a knock-off. But beside that it is super boring. And tje animation is creepy. Also they bombard you with ads. Don\'t waste your time with this trash of an app.',
       'I\'m so impressed! I am only on level 8, but I love this game. I found almost all of the hidden animals, which makes me happy because it\'s nice to get special things. All it really needs is mire mini ganes. Great game!' ,

      'You\'re game is ok at best. It kinda really sucks that it takes way too long to upgrade ships or even make any gold playing the game in order to upgrade. And when I do play the aliens are disproportionately stronger than my ships and the power up come way to far and between to make the game overly enjoyable. And I don\'t want to have to spend that much money or invest that much time for a game on my phone. It could be a way more addictive game if you made a few upgrades to power up faster or earn gold quicker.',
       'GREAT GAME, AWFUL DEVELOPER! Downgrading from 5 stars to 2 stars. There are some ridiculous bugs such as winning on PVP mode not only failing to pay out but actually leaving you with less money!  Don\'t bother asking the developer to fix or credit your account, emails are ignored. This developer is one step short of criminal.',
       'Just purchased a Galaxy Pack, thinking I would get the 4 additional ships. Surprisingly, it didn\'t and just got robbed $6. Just messaged their FB page and never got a reply.   I recommend to have this gaming company closed down for scamming and robbing people of their money.   TWO THUMBS DOWN FOR THIS GAME',
       'Game randomly places a big red "buy" button right where the big red "play" button is.    I\'ve been given a message saying "could not process payment" several times without intending to buy.  My account is locked down on purpose.  It\'s a real shame because I want to give this 5 stars but can\'t because it\'s trying to contact me out of a lot of money.',
       'Spend $$$ in the 100s or waste 100s of hours getting what you need to "win" and on top of that half  of your time will be wasted watching ads between ALL beginner levels.  It is addictive, does not always work properly, NO customer support and constantly finds ways for everyone to spend their money on a make believe spaceship that is gone in seconds.',
       'It\'s a great little shooter that\'s easy to pick up. Only thing I\'d like to see is a way to pick which ship you\'re always using at the start instead of the starter green ship and having to rely on getting the ship you want to switch to to drop..., other than that this game earned the 4 star rating.  Edit: Now it seems that an update has zoomed the screen in so much that on the main screen theres icons being cut off and can\'t be seen.' ,

      'It\'s OK I love to play the game when I\'m bored and it helps me to be settled back and have a good time. But these all happens when I\'m offline. But when I\'m connected to Wi-Fi there\'s too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you\'ll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I\'m playing the game??!! It\'s too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.',
       'Nice game but became boring in just one day! 2 options of controls: Spin (Steering Wheel) and Tap. Tap option is easier than spin. You have to complete the damn missions but the coins are only available in Normal mode they aren\'t available in arena mode. For making easy highscore follow this!! 1. Switch your controls to tap mode. 2. Open Arena mode. 3. In the beginning take the U-turn. 4. Keep driving in the middle line i.e in between of lane 1 and lane 2. 5. Just keep driving on that small line dividing both lanes and you\'ll get your highscore until and unless you get tired, I\'ve made it to 3,887.  Normal mode is quite harder than the Arena but it provides coins and you\'ve to play it for getting your missions accomplished!  Thanks',
       'I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don\'t you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?',
       'It\'s stupid. It\'s really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn\'t turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked.',
       'I dont know why people are rating Ketchapp games below 4 stars... I agree games are difficult but one of the unique one\'s in every launch. Their creativity is awesome... Love to play each of their games. Kind of more chanlenging and unique ones',
       'This is an amazing game! But there\'s a tiny problem with the controls: they are hard to be used. In addition, there are so many advertisments and that\'s the only reason I gave 4/5 Stars' ,

      'Good graphics but the character movements are clunky.  I\'m a hardcore FPS gamer and I like to test the limitations of a game.  So tried shooting a shoulder and the bullet went for a headshot instead whereas I clearly know my aim would miss. Glitchy.  Clunky and not so realistic unfortunately.  So not sure why the high ratings.',
       'Is game could be so much more than it is! After a few weeks, PVP becomes a joke when you are up against paying users who have one shot kill guns and a barrage of armour.  Then single player is just rinse and repeat over and over again.',
       'Still full of annoying bugs. The worst game I ever played. Earnings are exactly layed out so that you can\'t level up as you should and in a way that you should spend a lot of money... 👎 Graphic & other bugs, really not fluid etc. 👎 Full of annoying ads 👎 Some can shoot through walls; but you can\'t. Some can see you behind walls, but you can\'t. Starting pvp, you get placed on the map with the back to the others. Your oponents have 10x stronger weapons... Fairplay 👎 Nothing is balanced fairly in pvp 👎',
       'The latest version is so annoying. On the sniper arena, my men get killed immidiatly at the end of the countdown to begin. If i even shoot any sniper he wont die rather it will finish it shoutout and then turn to my soldier and kill it. I hate now i hate d game. Please do something about it.',
       'The game is fun. The campaign is very grind worthy. And the PVP is nothing but pay to win. Every match there is at least one person with the 100$ sniper. The Dimond currency if extremely slow so if u wanted to buy the best sniper u would have to level 4,000 levels. Overall the game is fun if u don\'t mind committing hours of game play for little reward. If it wasn\'t so heavy with pay to win I would rate it higher',
       'The basic concept of the game is fun, but like all games these days, micro transactions are rammed down your throat. I would be fine if that was all but then they time gate you with the weapon upgrades you need for missions and lock content out for you unless you\'ve paid for a better level of gun. Avoid this one.' ,

It\'s very upsetting since I loved this game????!',
       'Okay heres the thing,every f game is with money and this game was so much better without those money,i was 1000 lvl and my tom is gone why? Cuz u didnt made that feature back in the days,also u made this stupid diamonds alll for money,and not coins like it was...its not all about money get it? This game was so popularbback in the days and now is trash with all those videos to watch all those money you need to spend on clothes for tom...its ridiculus...sry for my english im just disapointed cuz u turned this game in real money not coins where you can be able to buy everything by playing like i did....',
       'I like this game very much. I have played this game from 2,3 years but I don\'t the recent update of this game in which the premium galactic and royal fittings beddings, clothings are brought by diamonds which I don\'t like. Before this update these things are brought by coins and now these are brought by diamonds which I hate it and give it 4 stars.',

I emailed for help and was sent to a the community site which does not have a solution to my problem anywhere. Please correct this!',
       'This game is the worst. When u get an ad, you don\'t have any way at all to get out of it, so u have to log off and then back on. Also, you can\'t even tap on the left side of the screen at all, so you cannot make any matches. UNISTALLED!! THANKS',
       'It seems like this game has come a long way since the last time I played it. Thank you for the improvements. I just might keep it for awhile until I get tired of playing it altogether. Good job.',
       'At first this game is very easy and fun to play. When you get to level like 175 you can get stuck on it for a day. And when you pass it finally it was pure luck. I like thinking games but when you play on luck its like gambling.. very anoyying.  Now I\'m at level 207 and I\'m not enyoing this game at all any more.. I will delete it. Play to 150 and delete it',
       'I don\'t like playing game but this is the first game i can play easily. It also brings me and my boyfriend (a gamer) have a common habit. We try to beat each other or play it together',
       'A very relaxing match game. Stress releaver, and makes you face challenges that can be solved and make you happy. I like how the game gets more challenging as you go throw the levels, as you go you come across new things, and it\'s just like trying something new in real life.' ,

      'Uninstalled and reinstalled app because the update made it to where the game was unplayable. Went to login, using Facebook credentials. It says it failed because I would not allow them access to my friends list. Something doesn\'t seem right about that. Never had a game NOT allow me to login, after denying access to my friends list. Sorry, would prefer you not send messages to all my friends with my name tagged on it.',
       'I don\'t have any problem with the game but the problem is that I don\'t like that miniclip is adding the bot because the game is less popular or don\'t know but to win against a bot is very tough you cannot win a match against them. I am losing my many coin because of bots. To recognise bot player they will be in guest with 6 digit number and having same level or somewhat close to it.',
       'There is a bug in your game I went first of my league, supposingly I am entitled to 350 cash, but it wasn\'t there.  How could you make it so unfair for someone. Why bother having a prizes if not given to the right person.',
       'I am in love with this game.. But the only bad thing happened today and I\'m very disappointed. I won carnival cup so I should get the announced price which includes 2 VIP  cards also. I didn\'t get my prize and I\'m really very upset. I have a screenshot of winning cup also.. I hope miniclip will help me. I\'m expecting my prize from you. I really love this game.',
       'Every once in a while when I get on I try to click my free spin and it won\'t work. So it\'s like my phone froze but I can play every other app. So it\'s just this game that freezes every once and a while. I have shut my phone down and turned it back on but I\'m not going to do that for every time I want to get on the app. I do really love it. It\'s just that it freezes so I can barely play it.',
       'It\'s a fun game but it\'s super glitchy which makes it incredibly frustrating sometimes. I would love a way to play all the games but with AI so that you don\'t always need an internet connection and you don\'t have to worry about your money' ,

      'I really like the concept of this game. Unfortunately I am not prepared to even give it one star as it doesn\'t take you long to realize that the only aim from this game is to extract money from all who wish to play. Pitiful really as there are many similar games available which you don\'t have to feel pressure to buy',
       'The game is very fun, but I only get to play one or two hands before I have to wait another hour to get more credits to play. Would be a lot better if you got more credits for wins or had free play. I\'m not spending money to buy credits. Also, it would be great if there was an option to turn off the fancy card movements; I get motion sick from it.',
       'Its great game love that I don\'t need Wi-Fi to play it. But some of levels just get so impossible to beat you spend four day on one level. Make the crops pay out more and levels make them a bit easier make the challenges be the hard ones.',
       'Great game concept, great graphics, however it really sucks that the amount of coins required to play  increases too much and you don\'t get enough coins. I wish it didn\'t cost so much to play, it seems like they just want you to actually buy more coins. No thanks. Will be deleting.',
       'Great solitaire game! If you want to play on and on, you need to buy extra credits, which I did because I could not wait+their CS is amazing!! Games are fun to play and challenging... You could still play without buying credits,,, it would just be slower. Highly recommended,! So grateful for fantastic customer service',
       'way better than other solitaire games ive played! super fun, easy to navigate, and although you have to use a currency (credits) to play each game, you\'re never on the brink of bankruptcy, and there are ways to earn it without playing. really awesome game!!!' ,

      'The game itself is very well thought of, highly addictive and is a great time killer. Plus, there are almost no ads in this game. However, there are just too many animations. It\'s almost impossible to play this hame st a consistent frame rate. Maybe add an ability to downscale the resolution or tone down the animations?  Edit: after the new update they fixed it. The game runs buttery smooth',
       'I really like this app. The first time I played this game I kinda liked it. But it has ads in it and I hate it. It\'s graphics are awesome but also you have to slice the fruit outside the real game.😃😁😘😀😱🙃😛😨❤💙💚💛💜🍉🍌🍍🍎🍏🍐🍓🍑🍇🍒',
       'AMAZING! I played this on my kindle a few years ago, then deleted it. After about 2 years I got a new phone, then remembered this game. I downloaded it and wowowowow lots had changed. Good changes. I LOVE THIS GAME IT IS SO GOOD DOWNLOAD IT NOW!',
       'This game is very addictive but it just seems like an ad watching game. All the company cares about is money so they spam ads on to the game. Why play mini games for Golden Apples when you could just watch ads for Golden Apples since they let you watch infinite ads. Why play Classic, Zen or Arcade for Starfruit when you could just watch ads.',
       'Gutted, fantastic game but the stupid ads are way too much, you can\'t skip em n they seem go on for ages, would be five star if it was just pop ups or not an ad after every bloody round, uninstall',

      'One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.',
       'înstaII " UNOPAY " App Enterr (GEMSO) to Start Earmings So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. Uno points equals uc instead of like some of the others where it takes Uno points to reach uc etc....Also, înstaII " SUZICASH " App Enterr (SUHA) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to waIet/GEMs. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to waIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn\'t get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.',
       'I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That\'s why if I\'m going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.',

      'Game all in all pretty cool.. they only thing is the game really is rocket based. It really has nothing to with your bike. I have the best bike and like lvl 4 bikes are beating me. I don\'t like the rockets because it takes away from the rhythm and flow. Im probably done, but it was fun for about 4 days. Im not spending 20$ on rockets every day.',
       'This is an amazing game! The graphics are nice, game play is smooth, and it is difficult. This game actually makes you learn how to ride the track better to be able to beat the opponent. Nothing negative to say about it, other than earning cash is a bit difficult.',
       'Love The game, just like i loved mad skills motocross. Just wish they had a head to head like motocross, to challenge friends. Hate the gold to upgrade, and no way to get gold without buying it.',
       'Great game as a fan of Mad Skills Mx 2. I would like there to be more fun ways of getting cash once you defeat all of the bosses.',
       'It\'s certainly a good game. Bit it\'s just another example of pay to win. It\'s practically impossible to beat the top end bosses unless you\'ve purchased upgrades or a better bike.',

      'Latest update: The agressive pop up ads are gone and have been replaced by video ads. Even when connected to mobile data services. I wouldn\'t say this is an improvement. Draining my data volume for advertisement is not nice. It\'s just greedy. This app is producing so much money anyways, why video ads? Wouldn\'t normal images be enough?  Update: The agressive advertisement is back and it\'s worse than ever. There are huge amounts of unauthorised browser popups partly midgame and even when the app is simply running in the background. This needs to be addressed!  Earlier: I like this app a lot. The concept behind it is great and it\'s great fun to play. The questions are mostly balanced aside from the annoyingly football heavy sports category. Lately though the app kept opening up dubious websitest, usually at the beginning of a round. This is absolutely untolerable (!). It should not have the permission to do this. I\'ve been hoping for the latest fee updates to fix this - they didn\'t.',
       'Die App macht was sie soll, aber die Menge an Werbung ist sehr ansträngend.  Nach JEDER Runde muss man einen GANZEN Werbespot zu Ende schauen. Dann lieber doch ein Banner.',
       'So viel Werbung !! An sich ein super Spiel, aber tonnenweise Werbung. Macht den gesamten Spielspaß kaputt.  Richtig , richtig schlecht gemacht von den Leute , so viel Werbung darein zu packen. 30 sec und keine Möglichkeit zu überspringen!!!!!!!! 5 Sterne, sobald weniger Werbung dabei ist.',

      'I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn\'t have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn\'t get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren\'t vigilant of their customers and don\'t take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.',
       'Game is really tooo gud, graphics also nice n smooth controls but u guys released only one game mode(Team death match), but in lot of fps games they provided free for all, bomb mode, Flag capture n many more modes.. If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games 😀 n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area.',
       'REALLY GREAT GAME! The ONLY thing is,when I try to get enough money and save up it takes sòoooooooooooo long so plz INCREASE THE AMOUNT YOU GET IN BATTELS! :). My family always plays this game so they would really apriciat if you add money to my account. Thank you if you DO. My name is TheOneProGamer50.',
       'The best shooting game ever. Lobed each and every single thing about this game but there a little suggestion that we can see the player if they are online or not but how is this if we can see there live going on matches? That concept will be great and games lag sometimes so if you can fix this and add my suggestion in guns of boom that will be hell great!! #the best game',
       'I was loving it and have spent alot of money but this update made it to where i can\'t even open it back up. Please fix because i loved this game and have invested time and money and if i don\'t get to play it anymore sometime soon I\'m not coming today back. Please fix very soon i was trying earn a special gun but I\'m not sure if that\'ll be an option if an when it gets fixed',
       'Played this game on my old 6S and S7 edge without any problems. Now that I have a Pixel 2 XL, controls have a major glitch. Seems to go nuts on its own or sticks too one side of the screen. Happens every match, almost unplayable. Very disappointing!' ,

      'It is ok however to delete the account you have to submit a form to the company, which is fine however the reason all reflect negatively on the customer making the company look flawless. Game play is ok but progression is slow. I suggest you make the "reasons" section free text so that you can get an accurate assessment for process improvement instead of a BS pre stagged answer.',
       'The game has been majorly revamped and has benefited from it. It\'s so much better to see that content and events are happening more often. Hopefully we\'ll see the first wave of gen 4 by April or May and a nice egg event will happen to get a higher chance of a baby Pokemon from gen 4. Keep up the great work only downside is legendaries. I can\'t get them as not enough people in my area play Pokemon go and I\'m not travelling for a Pokemon. Can we have a legendary event for one week you can get 3* legendary raids? That would make it easier.',
       'I like the game, I was a bit worried to get it when it came out at first, but after installing it and learning how it generally works I like it a lot. I would love to see more pokemon added and maybe even some PvP/ being able to challenge other people around you some day. So far it\'s been great, I\'m not really sure why so many people have been so upset about it, but it\'s definitely a 5/5 for me so far.',
       'Tried it...Loved It! It\'s a game I can enjoy with my 8 yr old. More addicting than I thought it\'d be & I\'m 48 yrs old. I love the part where you walk & get rewarded while you do it. It can be disappointing when  eggs hatch and its a repeat monster but the candy you need to maximize it works itself out in the long run.',
       'I love pokemon go and always get pulled back into playing it. I\'m still getting use to the updates after not playing for a while and am disapointed in the gyms. While I love being able to use them like pokestops, I wish to recall my pokeon from the gym. I love I a rural area and my poor Vaporeon has been at a gym for 13 days. THIRTEEN. I want my pokemon to come back please.',
       'Great game really but word of warning.... do not invest too much into it you will be disappointed. There are so many bugs glitches and errors in this game its beyond belief. But as long as people keep spending money devs dont care.' ,

      'The heroes should be for all players from the lower level. They can make their own choice to choose the hero or switch them. If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy? It\'s the strategy game, not for only the big or strong players. Thanks!!...',
       'Coc is on the first place in my games list. It is very addictive and enjoyable. I am looking forward till the day town hall 12 comes. I am not much happy with SUPERCELL ID thing. Because it is not much easy to use. I recommend using the normal GOOGLE PLAY sign in method because it is much more appropriate for me. Overall COC have become my life. I also recoomend to have a time limit for coc, like coc automatically switch off if the user plays coc more than 1 hour. Long Live COC!',
       'Awesome strategic game, love it. But I have one request to Clash of clans creators that pls update clan castle of coc village that there would be an option that how much treasury do you want to Transfer to your storage. I think all coc players would be love this option and it would be great idea because you can transfer required amount of treasury to your storage and the rest of it will remains safe in clan Castel. If you like this idea and will work on it then pls reply me. I would be thankful to all Coc creators if that happens.. 😊',
       'NICE GAME, NICE GRAPHICS,NICE GAMEPLAY.. Been Playing Since 2015 and I See A Lot Of Changes..  I Wish new content would Be Added More Frequently and I HOPE The Village must Have Village Houses! Cause A Village Is Not A Village Wihout Houses SUPERCELL. There should be houses that has different colors and traits, some which raises stats of barbs and valks, or reduces time to produce troops and spells like in Builder Base,there should be houses which raises defense or offense and houses which reduces building production. This May Give Clash Of Clans A New Spark and Would Be More Strategic than usual. Thanks For Reading Devs Godbless.',
       'Hey supercell,no doubt your game is awesome but I didn\'t like the supercell id technique in the new update...why did u removed the Google play login system? It was easier to change coc account in it...but in the supercell id it takes a lot of time to change the accounts plus we have to write our email then wait for the password....please fix this issue..... Probably I m not the only one who is facing it......    So I hope that your team can fix this issue..',
       'it\'s a good game and challenging. Strategy is needed on going through battles, Arranging your defenses is very tough to manage lol..... You want to keep away the enemies from your lawn though........ and I love the "Builder hall" when I\'m done on my "Town hall" I manage the second camp.... although the loot in Builder hall is limited it\'s fun and addictive a real time killer........ keep up the good work developers........ have a good day.... ^_¤' ,

      'I used to play this game a long time ago with my brother. I thought since after all these years so many new updates have come, the game must feel different. But it\'s the same. I love the tune that plays as you play it. It\'s so nostalgic. My brother isn\'t anymore with me but playing this game makes me really very happy. It\'s just like I am back in those old days. Specially for me, as it has so many memories, this game is the absolute best.',
       'I have a problem with my account. My punk zombird was maxed out. Level 3. Then when I opened the game, my punk zombird was gone... I obtained that by waiting patiently and gathering 90 diamonds. I had to watch 3 15-30 sec long video for 2 diamonds each. After watching the 3 vids, I had to wait another 8 hours for it to be available again. It took me a month to obtain that bird and then all of a sudden it dissapears?! I obtained it again but I had to start all over again. I uninstalled this app because of that issue.',
       'The game is really addictive. but repeated zombie birds are generated and diamonds are getting wasted. Please change that. One bird one time please. One bird should be at max 3 level not another set. It\'s wasting my internet to watch video to get diamonds for collecting birds',
       'I personally loved this game. First off,  u cant jump for high periods of time cause u to run into the bombs. Secondly, whats sup with these prices? Thats ridiculous. You cant level up with prices that high and u have to buy 💎 gems and coins just to get a level up... But tum... Very great game overall.',
       'I love this game cause it kills our time when were bored. Yep, we, my mom also is addicted to this game hahaha, shes always getting my phone and play this game whenever im sleeping. Love it, I recommend this game to everyone💖 you\'ll be definitely love this game. MobiGame you slaaaay hahaha',
       'Too much bombs. Like i have 16 zombies and they put 7 bombs in a row! How am i supposed to win if i cant jump that high with all those bombs in the way.' ,

      'This is a great game but it has it\'s draw backs. Due to a glitch in the game I had some coins and trophies taken from me in a game that never loaded. The biggest issue with this game is there is no offline solo play. A solo or practice mode would be great to allow people to get a feel for the game and be able to make tweaks in certain scenarios when playing with others. Easily worth 5+ stars if some adjustments can be made. Very addictive, very fun and suspenseful, and a great time killer.',
       'I think that you should win the balls all so instead of just trophies!! You pay so much money to qualify for a tournament and you got to pay a 10,000 dollar entry fee and then 1000 ever hole!! The game is coming to how much you can spend instead of how good you are you shouldn\'t be able to enter a rookie tournament if you have over a thousand trophies!! Maybe it shouldn\'t cost so much to be able to get into the tournament!!! Besides if you spend a lot of money the people who can\'t spend as much!! I enjoy this game a lot I play it all the time I believe that it should be cheaper to qualify for the tournament!! And when you lose your game that you should loose the ball your playing with!! I really appreciate your time in listening to my opinion!! Hopefully this might make it a little more fair to the people who can\'t spend the money they would like!! Sincerely a Huge fan of the game!!! Thanks Joseph',
       'Awesome game. The only thing I don\'t care for is, why am I playing people that have 80 trophies but have played 2,000 games? I mean I\'m working with starter clubs and they are playing me with so much better clubs.. I just don\'t think that\'s very fare. And is there any other way possible to receive extra gems and coins or get extra clubs higher-ranking clubs? Thank you for your time and thank you for coming out with this game it is awesome',
       'Really a great experience! The game play is awesome and very addicting. Only issue I have is when I finish in the weekly division standings I am not receiving my rewards. I just placed 3rd and was supposed to get a golden chest but I did not receive anything. That was a little disappointing after investing all that time, but still one of the best apps I have ever downloaded.',
       'Game is based on luck. Could be so much better if it was more realistic ie club selection. How can it be fair when it is easier to chip in from off the green than it is to hole a putt? NEED TO FIX BUG THAT MAKES MY SHOT HAPPEN WITHOUT MY FINGER LEAVING TABLET SCREEN!!! HAS COST ME HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF COINS!!!',
       'Game seems fine as long as you DO NOT BUY ANYTHING!!. Game is so rigged and its about the most obvious Ive ever seen. Just before tourney time, you will not make a shot and you will be reduced to ZERO coins, balls and trophies. I have over 10,000 matches so I know the game and support very well. DO NOT BUY BALLS, COINS HEARTS OR ANYTHING ELSE FROM PLAYDEMIC.' ,

Because all the rude comments I\'ve seen have been commented by adults and for people who hate that it\'s sooo slow well maybe check your internet because it works for me and I\'m just 9! So to all you haters maybe you could have better attitudes Please? Because I\'d appreciate it 😐😐😐',

      'Cool passtime. Several elements I recignize from series like Sid Meiers Civilization or the Settlers. The fights turn based combat. And the guilds are surprisingly helpful. The game offers some pay to win stuff but nothing you cant get with a little extra time. Nice game. 1 star taken because i have some issues launching it sometimes.',
       'Nice game, plays well. Only when you scroll the screen it keeps making a clicking sound if you touch a building doing so. Also, some free diamonds once in a while like in clash of clans would be nice. Give some free stuff then maybe people will be willing to spend some money',
       'The latest update "moved" Rogues from 1st on the list to "hidden" way back in the rest of the troops.  Very frustrating.   ALSO the fact that we can only "trash" or "use" rewards given to us in the Expedition.  Shows how worthless many of the rewards really are.  If we could sell them or trade them with others?  That would make them actually valuable.',
       'This game follows a typical progression. Early game moves fast so new players stick with game. Then there is a rapid slow down in the game where you either a. Spend real money to have anywhere close to the same sense of progression or b. Wait and wait and wait. Very quickly the game turns into logging on every 4 hours just to tap the screen a couple times and then exit. Eventually you won\'t play for a few days or maybe a week and then you log back on and tap the screen a few times and see that nothing has changed durring the week so you log off because you made no progress and are now bored. So you go delete the app and then write a review as honest as this one.',
       'The game is challenging and fun. Gave it 4 stars because you better not depend on the people who made the game. They are snotty and snobbish. They told me they couldnt be bothered to answer "basic" questions. The players have been super nice and helpful. The graphics are so, so amazing.',
       'Nice game. Sometimes hangs.Slow to initiate. Expenisive early in game!!! In game expenses starting to cost more early in game. Takes to long for  needed resourses. Some challenges  impossible to  achieve. Can\'t seem to message others in game. Not giving up my email might be the problem! Interesting game, Graphics are nice verygood animation. Remove these annoyances could be a great game....' ,

      'InstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (TVCD) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. VEarn points equals vac instead of like some of the others where it takes Toyo points to reach mac etc...Also, InstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TVCD) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to Bankk. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to WaIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'I just started playing this game and I don\'t think it\'s live matches. The opponents have ai style movements. I\'d like to play against other players in the matches. I\'ve been crushing the ai and want to try real people. But all in all it is very fun. Best badminton game I\'ve played yet. And most realistic too. I\'ve played badminton for about 15 years so it\'s nice to finally find a good badminton game.',
       'All of all the badminton game i\'ve played, this is the best. I love the graphic, the gameplay and all. But the rank, -50 when we lose is just too much. And the price of the equipment and ability is just too expensive. Especially because we only got like 12xp and 82$ when we win a game, its doesnt match with the those expensive things. So i hope you\'ll change something about this whole rank decreasing, the xp and the coins that we get if we win a game. Thank you :)',
       'i should have given 5 stars to this game very addictive and easy to play. But only thing it lags is that a player cannot update there game progress to any platform do they can play from same account if they change there devices or anything like that if this thing fixes up surely u guys are up for 5 stars...',
       'Early game just keep hitting short, AI will always mess up after 5... Trophies broken says smash 100 times at 99/100 smash 15 times in game trophies say 99/100. Hasn\'t changed so can\'t collect or move up for that to get what little money is given to buy gear. GEAR, omg wait for box to unlock, unlock gear, go to equip screen and still have to buy it, with what coin? forces you to watch videos for more chump change or pay real money for more.',
       'Wow. I have never played a worse badminton game. Hits always go out, the voice that yells "out" is insanely annoying after about 5 hits out, you cannot see the birdie in the air when playing through the story. Training level is ridiculous, "special shot" does not work and is unstable. First level is ridiculous, you lose one point and the game stops completely, the CPU trash talks you, and you never want to play again.  DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. Instant uninstall.  EDIT: thank you for replying to my comment so quickly. +1 star for customer service.' ,

      'Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I\'ll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily "less than 20 coins" reward. Sooooooo cheap!',
       'Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don\'t ever plan to, but here you also don\'t really need to. I\'ve won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you\'re not forced to watch them. It\'s not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.',
       'Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don\'t even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.',
       'Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn\'t be putting people in the "club" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this "club" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they\'re INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game',
       'Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don\'t terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.',
       'Awesome game, definitely feels like I\'m playing the UNO card game. However, the little bit of energy you have is a killjoy. Especially since matches are short because it\'s timed and most of the time, there\'s no real winner. I don\'t mind the energy so much as I mind the games being cut short and instead the winner is decided by a point system.' ,

I hope my tears will help u guys. :)',
       'Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it\'s just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............',
       'Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!',
       'At first I wasn\'t sure how good the game was but after playing it several times on Android and Windows 8.1 phone, I like it.  It doesn\'t weigh down on the phone\'s processing power. A very addictive game!! Give it go.',
       'I love it and I\'m addicted to playing it.   I like the fact that you can earn points if you don\'t want to buy them.  It would be great if tilting the phone had an impact.  don\'t change much though, its a great game:)',
       'Yow I had this game on my old phone and I really liked it but could you please add like a mini games  that reward gems but only appears once a day like a daily challenge and each day in a row it gets harder and the reward higher... You know like reach this airtime or travel here or jump this high etc. Etc.' ,

      'This is the most ridiculous game ever. I love it but i do have one suggestion can you make at least one new free map or make other free for a month during their seasons( for example: the buck to school map is free at the staer of july or august).p.s keep up the good work',
       'The gameplay is of course billion perfect and also the graphics!!! If any 1 wanted to play any interesting game....THIS IS THE ANSWER: goat simulator!! But when I was in a house in the game, I found a hilarious thing ..... Doritos the chips, hahaha it was really funny! Also when I went to the supermarket in goat simulator I found lays, Doritos and Oreos..can u imagine??!!!?!?!? Then I hit a girl and a boy with a gas car but they didn\'t die??!!! and that\'s a little bit creepy and weird. If u r asking a question why goat simulator got all of those downloads the 500 million I will answer u, cuz it\'s perfect and no 1 can do a game better than this. The graphics and gameplay and costumes!!',
       'Most rediculous game ever and I love it! But could you at least expand goatville (put more stuff in it and make it bigger) since you can\'t play in the other levels without buying them and a lot of people can\'t?',
       'Good o\'l goat sim put into mobile, maps cost money which sadly I do not have but it\'s still enjoyable until you find all the trophies and secrets on the first map, great nonetheless but gotta uninstall it, loved it while it lasted',
       'So, I got super excited, because it was ( and is ) for free. But you need to buy the other maps ( it only has that country side map ).I mean, it\'s pretty fair, they need to make more money, but I just got upset. =/',
       'This amazing sad that you need to buy the levels though but nice goats this is funny and ridiculous but I love the the game this made me laugh so put a multiplayer so you can join people and instead of getting your goat at a customize so we can make our own goat I LOVE THE GAME 😄😄😄 oh I\'m still typing ahhhh' ,

      'This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don\'t worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you\'ll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!',
       'I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who\'s better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn\'t seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don\'t think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.',
       'I\'m in love with this game. It\'s challenging, you don\'t have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks.',
       'This game has no WORLD\'S favourite song  DESPACITO  SO i m hating it tooooo much  when i see this then i think that let\'s download it bcoz it contains despacito song also but when i see all album of this app then i started hated it. So i would request from CHEETAH GAMES that plezz add DESPACITO SONG also in it This is my humble request from CHEETAH GAMES.',
       'TOTAL GARBAGE!!!!  (MY Rating: -100)  Songs constantly skip and stall out or both at once. I sent numerous emails report it but never heard back. It\'s ridiculous that the music skips between 54 to 100 times in one single song. Will never waste my time on this game again unless it gets fixed sooner rather than later.',
       'This game is honestly a great time-killer and even has it\'s challenging parts, but from what I\'ve noticed as you get to the higher tier songs they just get slower and slower and are just flat with barely any challenge. I expected more of a challenge with a higher level but now this game is getting horribly boring.' ,

      'Great timewaster! There are a lot of characters to earn and you don\'t need to spend real money to get them, so that\'s a plus. However, rated it a 3 cuz there are sooooo many ads. I get that ads generate the revenue to keep a good game free but an ad populates for literally every action. Win a game=ad, lose a game=ad, go to the settings=ad, change the volume=ad... ok the last one is fictitious but it really seems like that\'s how it works',
       'The game is simple to immediately start playing and fun. I shouldn\'t rate a game based off of this but, these pop up adds are tremendously common. Adds are essential so that the app can support itself but to have an add after every single play and then have an add to open a chest? Really? That\'s a bit much, especially, when the adds are not easily skippable and even force you to the download screen of the add. The game is simple, fun, and has witty, silly, and quirky characters. But the adds are a bit much.',
       'Me and my son have had fun with this game and made an attempt to collect all characters. The game is set up so you can not earn all of the characters but have to buy the last couple in a cash grab. It would be fine if they we\'re only available for real money but the game gives the illusion that you can win them in a chest. One that we have spun over 50 times without success',
       'The game itself is enjoyable and the controls are quite simple. Very intuitive. But Jesus Christ on a frosty log, the ads are way to much. After every round, ad, want your prize? Ad. Wanna do anything in the game? Enjoy the ad. Jesus guys, I don\'t mind ads and I understand that\'s how you make money, but you shouldn\'t have to watch an ad to get your prize for winning... Come on.',
       'Everything else is great, EXCEPT the amount of ads... I love the game, but I don\'t want to keep turning on and off airplane mode so I can actually enjoy it.  Edit: there are ads after I go into settings and more information, which doesn\'t leave the app!? Seriously? And the "messages" are all more ads for other apps too, lol. Bro calm down with the ads. This is why I\'m now uninstalling.',
       'So many aaaaaaaddddddssssssss!!!!!!! The game itself is super fun! But the amount of ads is ridiculous and effectively kills the enjoyment. Now every ad opens the play store regardless of if you watch the whole ad or hit the X to close it. This is the last straw. I\'m rating one star until this gets fixed. Will give 5 stars when the ads no longer inhibit gameplay so severely.' ,

       'The ads are so Terrible they interrupt gameplay now so if you were placing a block forget it it just placed itself because it registers that you let it go. Good game but not worth the annoyance.',
       'Really you have no idea what\'s coming next, so you can\'t plan on your next strategic move. Its all luck if you make it to the next round or not. So theres no challenge. I do appreciate the fact it has no ads.',
       'Foolishly made game, many a times the three blocks they send don\'t even fit in the remaining blocks. I mean, u shud send the blocks such that people shud love thinking where they all will fit, if allowed in comments I would have sent screen shot of game where I lost in it, to ask u guys where the hell these three blocks fit. I wud suggest to take it as an error in ur game n resolve it.',

      'This is by far the best chess "trainer" for me.  It\'s got a nice flow and the game isn\'t "stupid" like most other chess apps/games I\'ve played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I\'m making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.',
       'I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn\'t show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.',
       'For the non experts, let me tell you that 5his game cheats. I sat with a real chessboard to analyse why wasn\'t I  able to crack master level.   And what i observed was it didn\'t allow you to make actual moves when you show high levels of intell8gence. Sometimes it makes moves which are faulty. I think there is some mistakes in coding, perhaps deliberately made.  So not a fair play but a foul play.',
       'it\'s just a chess game yea, but it actually looks nice for a change. most chess games are really boring because all they have are symbols and very rarely, possibly sound. when you think it\'s boring that means you don\'t like chess, but not the app. what do you expect? guns and explosions? didn\'t think so.',
       'So far it\'s o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It\'s not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game',
       'The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.' ,

      'Good fun and very addictive. I see people moaning about the adds 😧 but what can you expect from a free game? You get an add pop up after about 5 puzzles and to be honest it is only for a few seconds....just close it if you don\'t want to see them.',
       'Saw it advertised and gave it a go. Pretty fun, once you understand the tactics it\'s pretty easy but I still like it. If you want to waste time, but not on a Candy Crush rip off, this is it!',
       'I usually can find something "wrong" with almost any app or game, but this is about as close to perfect as I\'ve played or used. I did not find the ads to be *nearly* as bothersome as most games. Good stuff!!',
       'Simple easy game that just let\'s me stop and focus. I don\'t find the ads too bad, gives me a break between boards. I like the occasional board I can\'t figure out right away.',
       'To many adds to the level of being annoying. Game it self is ok but can\'t see myself going through so many challenges to get to higher levels. I\'ll pass.',
       'Love the game but WAY to many ads. Not bad the first level. A 5 sec. ad every 2 or 3 boards. But by half way through the 2nd level it\'s a 30 sec. ad after every board. Definitely going to uninstall it. Too bad.' ,

      'Would of gaven 5 stars. But there some bugs that need to be worked out. Like connection and handling. But other then that this game is really close to PUGB for the phone. Massive open world. COULD do little better on the mechanic of the game but nothing to major. Would like to have a better money earn system like small amout per kill or something. This game is well dont. Ive played almsot all games on gogole play and when i say this game is fun I MEAN IT!!..',
       'Thank you for constantly improving the game. Id say at this point not to add more but to fix and adjust what you already have. Fine tuning before more additions would be great. Optimizing sounds, movements, vehicles, rendering, scoping, responses, all that good stuff would be great. Its a little laggy but thats just what you get for a giant game and 100 million+ players. Love it either way.',
       'The game has so much potential they just need to make it easier to see other players and easier to shoot people close to you. Also the game doesn\'t need to look realistic they should make it more like fortnite graphics and gameplay wise.  My main point is that it is too hard to see others in the game. still a good game though',
       'honestly a great game. but dont get diamonds to buy their packs. not only are they really expensive but the chance of actually getting their special clothes is so small I bought 10 packs of the monkey king and I got the same 2 grey items from all 10 packs.... like wth???',
       'Yea sure there\'s some bugs, but pros totally outweigh the cons. The game runs beautifully on a good device. Most of the problems that people are having deals with their poor devices. Lol. New gears and new map are just awesome. Best game on mobile and very ambitious for portable. Bravo! Keep those updates coming.',
       'This is the best mobile game that adopt PUBG genre, with good graphics and customizable good controls. A five stars game on normal condition. Unfortunately the game won\'t allow me to login around 10am to 10pm GMT+7. It stuck on the selecting server scene with loading icon spinning endlessly in the center, which I can\'t do anything about it. I can\'t even use any button and I can\'t tap anything. So, three stars it is, until the problem is fixed.' ,
    recentChanges: 
      'In Fearless Fiord Solo Mode, there will now be two cargo planes that each carry 150 players.',

      'Really liked this when I first started playing. Honestly,there is no point me keeping it now. Can\'t perform my operations,as don\'t have bought staff and ward not on the appropriate level. I can\'t get any new staff,as I don\'t have enough hearts,and once you are at a standstill like this it take FOREVER to earn hearts back. Have loads of cash but nothing to do with it!! Game seems to be designed around getting people hooked initially (as performing operations etc is really fun), but then can\'t continue or progress without purchasing hearts!! Not wasting my time with it any longer.',
       'Your new update will not let me, or several people it looks like,  get into the game. I am currently doing the 12 day event and am on level 17 please fix it ASAP! I refuse to lose all my progress. This is the best game I\'ve had on my phone in a very long time.',
       'I\'m VERY unhappy!! I downloaded the update and the game informed me there was a problem with the download. I then uninstalled and reinstalled the game and ALL my progress was lost. Its back to the beginning. Worst part is I just spent 10 bucks on content...money down the drain. Lesson learned. It\'s a very good game but DON\'T spend money on purchases.',
       'I downloaded the game, it\'s a great game except for today when I did an update and now won\'t let me get back into the game. Also, really difficult to level up after level 7. Everything is really expensive. Not so much fun when you have to wait along time for money to accumulate. Might delete the game.',
       'This last update screwed it up so i cant get it to let me play it just sayd issue loading game and to come back later. I uninstalled and wont be re installing becouse im not doing all that hard work all over agian.',
       'While this game is interesting, it doesn\'t really save your progress, so do not attempt to uninstall and then reinstall because you will start from the beginning. Happened to me. There was an issue with the game being unable to download some info after the recent update, so i decided to uninstall and then reinstall. That\'s how I found out.' ,

      'I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it\'s meant to be "skillfull" but thats harder than skillfull, you can\'t even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don\'t care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.',
       'Why I liked it? Because it\'s a simple game that doesn\'t make you addicted to phone but rather enjoy going forward focusing your attention entirely on your finger. What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven\'t listened to this game\'s. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I\'m entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.',
       'This is game is ok if you are bored and don\'t know what to do.... however it becomes irritating after playing for a while.... overall its a nice game',
       'I would like to report a bug. When you pause the game, moving obstacles keep moving. Someone would use this as a cheat',
       'This is the best game to relax. But i have a problem i do i change the music there are some music that i like and i want only that to play so i request ro put a music option  Thank you',
       'It\'s ok because the controls are horrible I say that this game is very annoying and that you should not play it if you are stressed because it will irratate you even more it is an ok game if you are bored and do not know what to do' ,

      'Most of the controls are excellent, I love the snap-to by selecting a ball, and the fine tune dial, however the "spin" mechanic is terrible to the point of being broken. No matter where you put the contact spot on the cue it is always maximum front spin or back spin, there is no diagonal spin or English, and no gentle spin of any kind. Fix this and you have a perfect pool game.',
       'I played without sound for a long time. After Upgrading my tablet, the sound won\'t turn OFF!   I have it off in the settings but am still getting sound after sinking a shot and at the end of a game.  I am very dissappointed that i wont be able to play this app anymore.',
       'Was disappointed when I reached level 816 and found no more game. Also, game could use some kind of "side game" to avoid boredom.  But still good time killer.',
       'Really like this game but now at level 563 and it is becoming repetitious. I think I am missing something because at one stage some of the pockets were blocked. There has to be more to this. Anyone help ?',
       'It\'s not horrible by any means but it\'s basically the children\'s version of what the game should be. Way to basic way too easy and no points and buying system or any sort of upgrades every level just diffs with amount of balls and placement not difficulty Thanks',
       'I enjoy playing this game. I already reach level 400 but i don\'t know how many levels this game have. Do you increase the levels every time you update this game until it reach to never ending levels so that no one will stop playing this game because of the never ending levels. This game is fun and challenging.' ,

      'After reaching level 39 my camp game completely erased and I\'m back to level 2. wasted so much time making hearts. .update. I tried to play again. I even have cloud saving my game again. I reached level 30. Suddenly all my dragons are gone. Again. What the hell game! Update: once again  the updated and all my progress is gone. This time om at level 53. I\'m done. The creators don\'t even reply or show that they are listening to the players to come to a solution. I\'m not playing this game again. WASTE OF TIME!',
       'Purchased the 30 day gem subscription. Got the first few days then it stopped. No way to contact support from inside the game, help menu continually crashed. Emailed support from outside the game and received no reply. Hoping Paypal can get my money back. Cute  time wasting game but don\'t spend real money on it.',
       '2018.02.19 update. Game crashes mid level, when reopen game, doesn\'t start in level, have to start over. Chalices lost, recharge time vs level cost ridiculous. Don\'t always get rewards from special events. Customer service completely absent. Have emailed from their website several times with no response. Game is fun, but such a hassle.',
       'Love the idea. Would love to have getting gems be a little bit easier without spending money, watch ads or something for gems, since they are required to complete some quests. Also, mine all of the sudden stopped working. Said the hardware in my phone couldn\'t support it anymore. Same phone. So, now I can also no longer play. Bit bummed about that.',
       'This game is fun and pretty but DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON IT. The game WILL crash and the developers will do nothing to help you. The reviews and the Facebook group are full of people who lost money and have never been helped.   I loved this game until the Jan 16 update made it stop working completely, with no response from the developers. I purchased dragon gems which i did not have a chance to use yet, and if the issue isn\'t fixed soon, I\'ll have to file a refund request with Play Services.',
       'The dragons sleep more than normal. They come out to do 1 thing then sleep again what kid do you know sleep every 5 minutes for 15 minutes at a time this kinda makes no sense if all they do is sleep I am going to uninstall very soon. It\'s boring this way. I am literally merging more plants than dragons. To be some big ass dragons they sure get tired like they have worked a 12 hr shift . Please GET IT TOGETHER.' ,

       'With each *regular update* this app has gotten worse. Now none of the high quality mobile servers can be played because the app can\'t fit that into itself, thus causing a disconnect. My perfectly ok phone was playing this fine until recently, but now the app can\'t even play what little it could to begin with. Just remove the app from the store already.',

      'Definitely addicting. The levels are challenging, the tools are fun to figure out and the reward set up is not unattainable. The only other thing is they grew more wise  for the latest update, you can\'t change the time on your phone to add lives anymore! Probably better that way, one (read: I) should pace themselves when playing....',
       'The arena levels are very hard to pass even though I have unlimited lives the leves become boring because you play and play and never pass. I believe they keep us in that level becuase there is no more levels. Really boring.',
       'It\'s addictive, but madding when you have 10 lives and it\'s been that way for months and now it drops u down to 5. You have to wait so long to play.',
       'The game could be fun but when you run out of heart\'s, they tell you to ask a friend? Who are these people, I don\'t know them, their not my friends. Why don\'t you let me play the game, I\'m not a beggar. Gentledove 🕊💖💖💖💖',
       'Love the game but unless you buy coins to buy more moves/lives, many of the levels are hard and require more moves. Takes days of playing to get past about half the levels.',

      'OMG! I love the gameplay in this arcade game I love everything about it. It is very cool that you can evolve sharks that can eat more stuff. Keep the updates coming it would be better if you added more sharks in this game . I recommend downloading this game if you want something to do in a long amount of time. This is so addictive I can\'t stop playing it!',
       'My apologies for the negative review lately. But to be honest, I have to use VPN just to log-in in Google Play and enable cloud sync or else, I wouldn\'t be able to sync my progress. Just a little request, can you make the gameplay smoother for lower end devices, such as devices with 1GB RAM? It lags frequently during gameplay. Thanks a lot!',
       'Amazing game. I completed this game in 48 minutes Hahaha! Because I used luckypatcher :) I downloaded the luckypatcher in Googlechrome But it can harm your Device..... And the last shark is Moby dick His baby is as big as Megalodon.',
       'The is the most intense game ever.When you think you\'ve got it ,it\'s gone. Can\'t figure out how to boost. Controls aren\'t the best.Rhis game could improve. Oth er than that it\'s fine I guess.Too many pop up ads. Really frustrating. I want to play the game not look at ads. Sometimes  you can\'t back out of the ad.',
       'i would rate 5 stars... but.. something with the cloud save broke, i used to have the megalodon, without any cheats.. but now i have the mako. could you fix this somehow?',
       'Requiring Google Play Games to save is lame.  It should save my game stats to sd card.   I can not even log in to Google Play Games, so I guess I will never see the good sharks.' ,

      'This game was great until the most recent update now I dont play as much. Only being able to save 25 cupcakes when before tgere was no limit IS terrible! I\'ve purchased boost to pass a level & several times when I\'ve used them the game freezes so I lose the boost. I contacted customer service got a generic response & no refund but they want me to rate their service 🤔 no thanks! I loved the game before but not so much now!!',
       'Would of gave full marks but on a few cooking appliances when I tap on it doesn\'t work. Second I think it would help if you could carry money over from one country to another and convert currency. Some of the levels are hard to achieve and you don\'t earn enough power ups and spoons to help you through the levels plus restore lives take ages. Customer waiting is to quick.',
       'It is a great game and very fun to play but just needs a little more to it. The one thing I can\'t figure out is why do we keep getting coins if we can\'t use them to purchase anything after you get all the upgrades on your ingredients. There should be a use for them or stop giving us coins in the rewards of each day. I wish there more things to buy or if the coins could be transferred to the next level or something. Okay thanks. P.S. I was just enjoying this game until you guys decided to cut my cup cakes down to 25 only so that means I have been saving mine only to know that after I use them up I can only get 25 at a time well that sucks and I hope you change that back if not my time with this game has come to an end.',
       'Was a great,  fun game,  but now with the new Update things will not download.  I\'ve sent emails to them and nothing has change.  I did receive an email back asking to rate their and of course I told them you don\'t want me to rate something I never received!!  Can\'t open game,  this issue has gotten worse!!😡',
       'I LOVE IT!!  Very addictive & challenging. My only problem is that I accidentally uninstalled it while removing games from my tablet that I no longer play. I had just reached level 50 so now I have to start all over again. Fortunately this is one game I don\'t mind doing that with!!',
       'I love this game so much, but its not alowing me to add friends. I also do like that im limited to my facebook friends. No one on my facebook plays this game. I wish we could add random people. Can this happen place. It would be five stars if you did that.' ,

      'I love this game!!! The differences between the levels are amazingly creative!  I just wish I got one or two free skips because solving the math problems within a certain amount of time was too difficult for me to do very quickly. The only way I could pass the last round was to quickly type the equation into a calculator.  But, general math, like that, is difficult for some, especially when it\'s timed.  So, I can easily see someone quitting the app completely just because they can\'t pass that level.  I believe you can quit the game and then skip the level. But, I\'m not sure, I haven\'t tried it.... Yet.',
       'Good time pass puzzles for cognitive and reflex scenarios. Completed all 120 levels with 517/600 stars. Of course I\'ll improve on some. However, the name could have been something diff from Skillz, as it\'s not actually skills that get measured. But I recommend it fully! Loved it!',
       'While I love the challenge, some the games flat out cheat. Level 15 for example. You need to guess the color\\hue within 50% accuracy, but somehow even at 90% I got it wrong? It\'s always the last one too so I have to start over. Why? If I\'m almost 100% correct or even 51% correct, why am I not allowed to move on? Yes the next levels are unlocked but why am I not allowed to finish this level? It\'s bull.',
       'The biggest problem, beside stealing my brains, is that most of the time the ads don\'t let you go back to the game. So it means going out of the game and closing the app completely, then going in it again. Very time consuming and boring.',
       'The strobing smile faces in level 25(?) gave me a headache. This is not a good game option for people sensitive to such things. You might offer a pass specific to this level that doesn\'t require so many brains.  Was enjoying this game but uninstalled for these reasons.',
       'Fantastic! It\'s challenging without be overly difficult where you can\'t pass the levels. It\'s well varied in the different challenges you\'ll get through the levels. The ads are not too intrusive at all. I\'ve been disappointed by most of the other brain training games out there. This is my favorite "brain game".' ,

      'I used to love this game, very addictive but recent updates have made the game have too many elements (clubs - who cares???) Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels "fixed" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.',
       'This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.',
       'This game is fun, it is addicting. However because of the constant changing and the unfair advantages that some players get (not everyone has the same events, quests, or in game things) it\'s becoming less and less appealing. And the multiple device fix is a joke! EVERYONE had that advantage you they took it! Dumb!',
       'Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the "boards" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it\'s addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It\'s becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.',
       'I really liked playing as mindless entertainment despite what I consider to be unreasonable costs of the games as you advance in levels  and even tolerated the forced ads when they began. Unfortunately 2 days ago   it refused to load and continues to ask to retry or restart.  My connections are optimal and no updates pending.   Have tried to contact support to no avail. Disappointing.',
       'Love playing this game but I\'m getting sick of some of the levels feeling rigged. They can be impossible to win. And not just like, oh I didn\'t plan my strategy well enough. No. Like I will legitimately get NO useful cards in the entire deck and won\'t be able to clear ANYTHING. it\'s clearly fixed for us to spend money on it. Disappointing.' ,

      'Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn\'t respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I\'m willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.',
       'I\'ve noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don\'t think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying.',
       'Absolutely great game.. I love it!  For those who say that there is so many ads, its not true, I don\'t have that problem..But if you want to be sure,that ads won\'t appeare just turn off your cellular data.. :)',
       'Fun little time killer. My only problem is that daily rewards fail to show up most days. It could be a problem on my end, but I don\'t know, and it\'s a pretty small issue so I don\'t really care.',
       'This is the most addictive game i have ever played. I always play it when am bored and you can play it when your offline. Totally recommend it but pls answer this question..what is the world highest score?',
       'Definitely a fun short game. No real incentives to keep on playing though. The eye candy is not good enough and the music is repetitive.  Needs something more than the simple leveling system and the music either needs to be in beat with the obstacles or have more variety.' ,

      'Ever wanted to be Mayor? Ever wanted to run a town, develop the land, and see a metropolis grow? Well, look no further than Animal Crossing cuz this game does none of those things. You just merge buildings into better buildings. It is fun, if you spend money so that you\'re not bombarded with ads. But then you run the risk of being unable to watch ads when you want to to do things like double your earnings or unlock a better building from the mystery box.',
       'I like merging games, but this one has a huge ad issue that makes the game somewhat frustraiting to play. I\'ll click the store to buy a house and it will auto start an ad video. It\'s lacking a bit in the story line department too. For a base merging game it\'s simple and fun, but definitely needs some work.',
       'Such a terrible money grab. Ads cinsta tly pop up, making a consistent method for progressing impossible (which was most likely the goal). Didn\'t have patience to get very far, I feel like I\'ve wasted my time in the 5 minutes I played. Greedy devs forcing quality content behind a paywall making the game virtually unplayable for free. Terrible job.',
       'When opening the game it loads fine Nd does its idle thing, but I can\'t tap on anything. Completely 100%unrespomsive. After multiple attempts. Will change rating if game becomes playable before I forget about this review.',
       'The game just gets exponantially harder without any sense of progression and the worst prestige system ever. Didn\'t mind spending 2$ to remove overextensive AD use. They try to sell you lvl ups for base chest that are useless. You still need 256 boxes for the next building and 512 for the next evolution. Still grinding? To bad now its 1024 boxes',
       'Too many useless ads! I don\'t like being forced to watch ads. Especially when they take up more of your time than gameplay. The game forced me to watch a 15 second ad just to open the store. UNINSTALL!!!' ,

      'PLEASE READ: This game is great I love it though I would rate it better if you were not so money hungry. This game is a pay to win but nearly every time you get a big update the weapons you have become really bad and you loose a lot more matches. Coins are cool to have but the weapons u need to win matches always cost gems and gems are too hard to get for free. Increasing the chance of gems would be a bit better because what fun do people have if everything good costs real money and you lose every match',
       'This game would be more fun if 1. Did not die every 2 seconds 2. Fight with people my level, not 20 levels higher 3. Everyone else survives for way longer with nothing while I die every 2 seconds with golden armour 4. To not get shot from nothing 5. actually get rewarded for playing, win a really hard round of arena? Here\'s one coin! 6. Actually getting rewarded with leveling up 7. Actually getting rewarded for playing 8. Being able to buy coins with gems, and being able to buy gems with coins 9. Being able to buy stuff with in-game currency, not real money, like I said in 8  There you go! Please take it into consideration, or at least understand Thank you Edit: and if you think that\'s done, no, you get oneshotted WITH FULL MAX LEVEL ARMOR AND MAX HEALTH. WHY, JUST WHY',
       'Its Great You Can Rent Guns you dont have yet and u can earn diamonds but there a problem. Every time i use the chest i never get a gun so can u increase the luck system? I love this game and its awesome my freind got it for me',
       'Absolutely wonderful, great graphics, good range of skins, nice selection of modes and maps and epic items!! it\'s awesome and a great game to enjoy. But abit of lag... I\'d rate 5 ⛤s if the controls were less laggy other then that its a marvelous game',
       'This is an amazing game! I love the pixel graphics and the variety of wepeons that you can choose is outstanding. However they\'re is some bugs that you must fix. Sometimes when I battle against players my the app crashes. And when I load the game back, it says penalty for leaving match, then I loose trophies. Overall, comparing to other games, when you leave a match u don\'t loose exp, grids etc. But this game you do loose trophies. So pls get rid of the lost of trophies.  Also one question. Is there a computer version of this game. Thx for taking the time to read my opinion.',
       'I luv pixel gun!  I luv Pixel gun 3D! It is fun and addicting! I only have one problem  . . . You need to have it where u can sign up in to your Gmail so it can save!!!

      'Pretty, addicting and intriguing. Love the gameplay so far, and no purchases are required (they help a lot, though). Constant technical issues are a great nuisance, however. Force stop or reboot is usually needed to get the game running, and models occasionally fail to load (playing on a oneplus 5). All in all, thumbs up for a great and non-greedy game, which could use some serious bugfixing.',
       'Graphics are really beautiful. Controls work 90% of the time, 10% of it requiring you to tap 2 to 3 times due to it being unresponsive. Gameplay wise, its great at first, then after a while the wait times are too long and there is very little gameplay to fill the time in between voyages.  Overall, great graphics, controls can be optimized, gameplay can be more in depth and varied? I find myself just comin on every hour or so just to collect and set stuff.',
       'Black screen on load. Will not load or go past blank screen. Tried everything and nothing works.   EDIT: After the latest update it is working fine again. Awesome game and very addicting. would be great if had an option to gain resources or something from ships enroute while waiting for them to return',
       'Shame... Won\'t load the game. It said I have no internet even though I have 4 bars and LTE. Then I forced closed and tried to open again and there was a black screen for like 3 minutes before I gave up. Looked like a great game but I wouldn\'t know.',
       'I\'m having one major issue with this game, and it\'s reoccurring. It keeps stating it Error cannot connect, even though my signal has full strength. Come on developers, my provider says that there\'s no problem my end, that leaves only one end possible, doesn\'t it!!',
       'Every time I close out of the app and reopen it there is a flash of the loading screen then it goes black and I can\'t get passed it. I have to uninstall and reinstall the app and it works a few times then the problem persists. Please help me because I really love this game. I play on a note 8. EDIT: The game is no longer playable it just opens to a black screen even after uninstalling and reinstalling, which is why I went from 3 stars to 1 star.' ,

      'I\'ve been gaming on my cell for 10 yrs now and in all that time there\'s been maybe 5 games total that I\'ve played for yrs, continuously, and will always play. This is the newest to that short list! I\'m not a skier, although I had a ton of friends who\'ve skied their whole lives. This is what I would think it\'s like. Total rush! Wow! It\'s an adrenaline I\'ve gotten from no other game. But super peaceful and calming @ the same time! Here\'s to hoping the Developers are just scratching the surface wth this amazing game! But if this is it? Kudos to you guy\'s on a job well done!',

       'It was good but then this happened. I was playing just like any other day. My phone had died while I was playing, so I charged it and left it untouched for about an hour or two. When I signed in, all off my progress was erased! Please respond and tell me what happened.',
       'The game was great than EA got to it with there sticky fingers and put adds everywhere, it isn\'t the same game I enjoyed ages ago. It\'s just another add infested game now, even if you do pay for it l. The charm is gone',
       'Irritating. At first it gives you an option of playing a video to receive additional help. Which works only for the first time. Next time onwards no way to cancel the video in case you don\'t want to install it. It is so frustrating. Either allows to cancel or tell the users what to do next. Worst way of promoting other apps.',
       'Why ask people to pay to have ads removed and still have so many features that you need to watch ads for? It just seems like a rip off to me very disappointed in this purchase',
       'I had to update it so I did and when I wanted to play after that, it says "watch video to get extra seed slot" WHICH I ALREADY PAID FOR WITH THE COINS I COLLECTED ALL THESE TIMES. Even before the update, it has so many ads but this is much worse. Definitely not happy with the update.' ,

Graphics don\'t lag at all. Please fix. Also would be great if you could add some button to start and stop a timer in free mode so we can set time challenges for ourselves. I like the game but it is unplayable after a few minutes after the recent updates',
       'What you should improve is that YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ADD\'s I MEAN SERIOUSLY I WATCH MORE ADDS THAN THE GAMEPLAY. I ONLY PLAY FOR A LITTLE THEN MOST OF ADDS SHOW UP. I WQ5CH ADDS THAN PLAY8NG THE GAME FOR CRYING OT LOUD!!',
       'This is crazy like I understand that you need ads but the fact that they are popping up on the middle of the screen is crazy! Like I woodnt mind if you had a small one at the bottom is the screen but the fact it pops up at random in the screen is really annoying and finds the game. I do love this game but the ads ruin it. Please fix this!',
       'This game was just really really good! But please please make the exact same game but instead, if you do something illegal like crash into another car, the cops start chasing you. If you do do this I will comment on every single game that comes up on the adds. But, there is a tiny bit to much adds. Anyways, AMAZING fame!!!😊',
       'Just redownloaded game after break. Can\'t believe you have adds coming up & interrupting game play!!! You obviously sold out.  Once was a great game. Unfortunately I can\'t reaffirm that comment. Really disappointed.  RW♠' ,

      'It\'s a really great game for a fps online. I\'ll rate 9/10 because of the crash I\'m getting sometimes. Whenever it load a game, it just crashed into home screen. Hopefully it will be fix soon and make sure to notify me when it fixed. I really love this. This might be the best fps game I\'ve played so far.',
       'It\'s a great game overall, great controls and everything. The only downfall is there is to many hackers... from radar hacks to bullet rain. I hope this game makes a better anti-cheat. I am also a content creator so feel free to check out my channel :  AtomixGaming C-OPS',
       'Sucked. Graphics and game play are inconsistent. Laggy, and no scoring system or room for advancements. No way to change weapons without exiting the battle. Needs a lot of work and then will still probably be lower grade then all the fps games on the market.',
       'It\'s a great game! Very well made and very, very fun. I just need help because it says my game has crashed and I don\'t know what to do.',
       'The game is very noob friendly in my opinion as of my experience when first starting out but overall I really enjoyed the game its a really good portable replica of CSGO',
       'I HATE NEW KNIFE SOUND.. NOOBS ANNOY ME WITH IT.. THE AIM GOT WIERD AND I WANT IT BACK... AND IT STARTED LAGGING.. SRY BUT THIS IS MY REVIEW TILL U CHANGE AIM BACK AND THINGS LIKE THAT' ,

      'It has the right elements of effortless competition, continuous improvement and no blatant "pay to win" aspect. I\'ll keep running it because I can pick it up and drop it at a moment\'s notice.  Also nice to see one of these games that isn\'t just a re-tread of the spaceship scroller. It\'s a different theme!',
       'I love the game but needs just one tiny update, you need a create your own ride option, all out make your own vehicle and guns and gun damage, based on what you created it will tell u your damage and health,, also you need a user store to publish and use other users vehicles, you make cars semis bikes planes etc.but in order too get all these cool features, you need to beat the 3rd boss in the game.

      'I\'ll keep this short, this game was way better when players were able to buy things like the hearts (lives), small and large boosts 750m and 1500m, and other items like this. I have since started to play this again after getting a new phone and this game has changed a lot. Although I like the new power-ups, it wouldn\'t hurt to bring back the old ones as well, and by that I mean allow players to buy more lives, boosts etc.   I hope the developers can make this happen, although I\'m only one person so they will not listen and probably couldn\'t care less what I think, but listening to the customer (or player of your game in this case) would probably work out quite well.',
       'I love this game. It\'s pretty old, but amazingly, still one of the best games on a mobile device. It\'s unbelievably addicting, which is quite a problem.. 😂 But I love this game so much, and I play it everyday. Keep it up, Halfbrick Studios! I\'ve been playing this game since I was about 5, so sorry for the late rate. 😄',
       'Pretty good game. It\'s a really fun game to play, and a great killer time. But it has way too many ads. It also tells you to spend a lot of real life money, to the point that is ridiculous. Like, having to pay to be able to use a third slot. Really???',
       'I love this game. It could be improved though, I think that during missions where you have to do a certain amount of something in one game (for example, ride 500m on the hog in one run, or collect 4 tokens in one game) there should something that tells you how much of that thing you have done during gameplay. This would be super helpful so you don\'t have to count yourself. Also to those who are complaining about ads, I simply turn off my WiFi when I am playing (this prevents ads) and I turn it back on to do the S.A.M challenge.',
       'I remember when the game was new, you did not have to pay for as many things. Greedy developers, that\'s right milk it for all it\'s worth.',
       'Played this before and really enjoyed it, second time through was not so great.  Felt much more monetized.  Also, ads frequently fail to give rewards. I sit through a 30 second video and then game shows an error and doesnt give the reward.  Uninstalled because this was frequent.' ,

I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!',
       'Amazing game... Loved it...😍 The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it\'ll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it\'s okay 😊',
       'It\'s an amazing game. Sure I run around my bedroom screening every time I fail next to the end.... but there is something about this game that makes you happy. Is it the music? Maybe. Is it the back ground and the way it moves?possibly. It\'s all of those things plus more   In a nut shell I really really really really really really really really really love this game :p',
       'Good songs. That\'s about it. The hitbox detection and lag spikes are horrific, the checkpoint system is a blatant cash grab, and what annoys the most is that the timing of music+taps (the core mechanic of the game) is completely broken. It is significantly easier to play the game with audio off, so that you don\'t get distracted by the miss timed turns. Doesn\'t even fulfill it\'s most basic selling point. Atrocious.',
       'This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn\'t as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn\'t there but now it\'s forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.',
       'The gameplay is unique, but one thing I notice that is so hard to get the highest level as we totaly have no idea about the beat from music while we play it. Need to play the same level on and on until I become familiar with every single beat from it. Anyway, use your best headphone. They come with so much beautiful musics you\'ll ever heard' ,

      'This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you\'re willing to go broke',
       'Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.',
       'This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!',
       'Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses.',
       'I really like this game it is very fun. The only thing is, how do you wave, I dont know but I play it on PC so I am not very sure how to wave so please tell me if you can do it on PC. Also can you maybe update is so you can use it on PC with w a s d because I am used to it. Anyway love the game good job!',
       'Lots of fun, creative and very easy!  Review update: I reinstalled in 2018 to find it has changed. You cant dig down very far like you could before, or down to water (it only floods a little bit in places) so I couldn\'t make a moat for the castle.' ,

This is very frustrating and usually I have to wait a while before I can come back and the character can be controlled by tilting again.  Thank you for your help in solving this problem.',

A few bugs and connection issues which can be frustrating at times especially when your team depends on you for points. Though I believe they\'ll eventually fix these issues as this is the BEST racing game out there and it\'s only getting BETTER!',
       'Love the new updates where you can carry on the trials without having to go back to the garage. It would be nice to able to trade up your keys i.e 500 bronze for 10 silver or 100 silver for 1 gold. And the stage 6 upgrades be not double up or get stage 6 upgrades relevant to the cars you have.',
       'Best onlin3 mobile racing EVER!! IM A VETERAN GAMER AND THIS GAME IS HANDS DOWN TOP OF THE MOBILE RACING GAME. Great detail and graphics. Precision tuning. REALISTIC CARS IN ALL ASPECTS. PLUS an added Bonus is it features FAST AND FURIOUS AND CARS FROM THE SERIES. I need access to more cars. Its so hard to get more silver or gold to get newer cars updated.',
       'Customer support has won me over. They have literally provided the best resolution can think of for the game removing all my fusion parts. Hopefully I don\'t have many issues in the future but this one time moment has definitely filled me with confidence that in future, zynga will fairly sort things out.',
       'Prepare to have your pockets emptied with very little support if anything goes wrong and trust me it will. From losing fusion parts to losing your account and connection issues that have been present for the last few months. Don\'t worry though you will get bombarded with cars that cost a small fortune from events and a new special offer every now and then tempting you to pay more money. If anything ateast the devs are consistent and are very good at taking your money off you but putting in as little effort to fix things as possible',
       'Great single player. Fun gameplay thats simple but entertaining. Decent customization and great upgrades. A little pushy on spending money but it\'s ignorable. My issue is with multiplayer. I can never connect with anyone which I don\'t have any interest in. But two out of three of my goals are for beating other players. One wants to me to beat thirty people. That\'s ridiculous.' ,

      'I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It\'s fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn\'t want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.',
       'Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It\'s reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series\' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis\'s and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I\'m offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,',
       'Hi there Admin.  The cash purchased Super Giant Box has just crushed on me while I was opening it. I think much of its content is still out there instead on my account.  Would you be so kind and check the status of this cash purchased Super Giant Box?  Best regards,  C',
       'Game it self is great and a ton of fun.   But, the system for showing ads is so annoying.  It\'s not just your normal video ad no, they make you watch 3 different ads and a min of 16 or 11 sec each.  After you have watched the minimum time, you have to hit next and repeat again',
       'Wasted up to 200gems in ultimate league so far. When you lose a match, they offer you to keep your progression in exchange of gems, but they put the option on the right side instead of left. I keep pressing it by mistake and waste gems that I\'d much rather use to reset gang fights instead.',
       'That stupid balloon weapon has killed and ruined the game for me. Also, supply boxes have gone rubbish recently. Getting the same old rubbish which is always alot less powerful than current level. Not had a decent tank in ages. Was a good game, not anymore.' ,

      'good improvements, make more tracks and some challenges to do. also remove rocket bunny cars and make just rocket bunny parts, make more parts, last exhaust is curved but flame goes straight, let us tune engine by putting different parts, like intercooler and turbo, let us change tire graphics, also let us put different wheels on front and back. this game got very big potential, try to involve some multiplayer, with ghosts and rankings, or open multiplayer room for more users live. high graphic option need very powerfull phone, my nexus5 doing 10fps, on medium i got stable 30fps. after update i had to buy last track even when i buyed it before, save file keeps my cars but no track data. let us make layouta for parking track. thanks and thumbs up for you :)',
       'love this game!! The control are easy, the graphics are amazing, really well made!!! I would LOVE to see some BIG updates soon, like able to somehow earn gold plz?!?! And maybe have a little more variation of parts u can change. And hopefully some new tracks will come out Right?!? But GREAT JOB to the developers and everyone who put effort into this game. Thx guys  :D',
       'Well... Ive bought all the cars that you can without gold... All you have to do is get to 50x and you will have around 120,000cr and thats enough to buy all the cars... And put what you want on it... Add more cars and add tuning, also remove the god damm machine gun exhaust not all drift cars do that... Fix it because its annoying and it also over powers the sound of the car...',
       'Its got great potential, the physics are pretty good and the game stops lagging if you put it on low graphics. The fact there is only one option for steering is upsetting as i would prefer tilt steering to be a bit more precise but all in all its a great start to something big',
       'I know I said that this game is one of the best but I\'m not so sure now. One of the reasons for that is that the buttons need to be customisable while playing the game because I can\'t seem to press the turn button at the right time because my thumb is not where I need it to be ( plus I need it to be bigger) and you guys have retracted the CR mode for purchasing Nissan GTR r35 and Ferrari 458 Italia as well as the Mercedes AMG c63 and the BMW M4 rocket. Bring back the CR mode for purchase of these vehicles. At least for the Nissan GTR r35 please',
       'I love the game but there\'s a few things I don\'t like. The pause button doesn\'t actually pause the game. It\'s just brings up the menu to continue or go back to the menu. In first person view the textures are broken inside the car (blue grids everywhere) and some times the controls for going left and right become unresponsive for a split second. Not enough to do any damage but enough where I felt I should put it in my review. Once those things are fixed I will definitely give it a 5/5' ,

      'Parts of this game are really confusing. I built all the materials to make a ship and they\'re not usable in any way. The quests are also really messed up and once you have nets collecting materials there\'s nothing left to do. Seems like most of the issues with this game would be simple to fix but the developers obviously aren\'t interested in making the game better, just in getting people to click ads. Shame because it could\'ve been a fun game.',

      'Don\'t bother playing unless you\'re made of money.  If you play without paying a lot of money you will lose a lot and never win a tournament.  The lag is terrible which also causes you to lose a lot. When you decide to pay for some gems watch out cause they will charge up to 4x the amount, then you get to go through the process of emailing idiots and taking days to get your money back. Plus they don\'t match you to your equal the person could be the champ and you\'ll never win against someone that has played it years longer than you. Well best of luck to those that this review didn\'t scare off.',
       'This game is awesome and better then Cacer Royale,  Pro: 1. Cards are balanced, 2.you can add more cards in ur deck 3.Cards have better short and usefull story 4. Cards are original(EX: powers)  Neutral: 1.Towers give no damage and if you\'re assaulted all lains you lost(10 dmg, no more is usefull)  Contra: 1.No more players and is so hard to find a clan in castle 2 or 3 and in castle 4 is fifty-fifty  (2.And is hard to make moneys but is fine I think)',
       'Graphics need works. When the you have alot of characters on the field the game will start to freeze alot. Fun but charges gems for every  challenge. The price goes up every time you loose. Dont even get extra tries. As soon as you loose you have to pay more and more. Prices keeps going up. Also when it saids it will match you with people around your playing status, it will actually put you against people who have cards that you have never seen. Fun but petty on the challenges and gems stuff.',
       'If u don\'t spend money you will never be a big winner! Everytime a new card comes out everyone buys them up and you can\'t win. That makes this beautiful fun game suck turds!!!!',
       'OKAY HERE\'S 3 GOOD REASONS YOU DON\'T DOWNLOAD CASTLE CRUSH KIDS!... 1: The chest take wayyyyy to long to open nobody wants to wait 3 to 18 hours to play a game. 2: If you loose internet connection you will automatically loose..... 3:The game tends to constantly lag really bad which causes you to wait to put out your cards while your opponent has already summoned 3 moves ahead of you.  Don\'t get me wrong this game can be addictive but all and all this shouldn\'t have a 4.5 rating.',
       'It\'s a fun game but a mahor money grab. The Piggy Bank update proved that. They give you more gems than you spend but you have to keep buying them to afford the bank. Ive spent a few dollars but I\'m done doing that and close to deleting the game everytime the bank pops up asking for more gems.' ,

      'It\'s a great game in terms of versatility (as versatile a single game can be) and you can almost always play as there is a table for any amount in the start-up kitty. Like most Android poker games it gives you the option for daily free chips so you can play daily should you wish. Where it falls short is table talk and conversations are extremely limited. I mostly play in bed, at night, until sleepy so table talk isn\'t really for me most of the time but if you are wanting a social chit-chat game this isn\'t it.',
       'Look at your ledger board.. Typically the 1st names are Fake profiles, so you can\'t advance without buying chips to beat unreasonable winnings.. They all have similar stats.. no best winning hand.. no pic.. some have same name or real similar..It\'s obvious they are fake and Zynga has confirmed this, yet hasn\'t removed them.. They continue to allow it every week..',
       'Good game, but it has a major bug that a lot of people face daily, most of my poker buddies get the same issue. Joining a table will leave us on the loading screen and it gets stuck there. Back button does nothing, and you have to force exit the game. Sit and go tournaments do work every time, which is odd. I\'ve invested over 50 euros in this game, but with a game breaking bug like this, I\'m considering uninstalling it.',
       'I have to bring you down to 3 Stars bcos I think you manipulate my play. Imagine within 1 day I lost 400 million chips. Every hand I lost weirdly. Examples, I had a pair of Aces but lost to 2 pairs, I had a straight but lost to flush, I had flush but lost to house and the list goes on. Don\'t tell me that was coincidences or no luck and not my day. Then your announcements kept popping out telling me it is time to purchase chips and continue to play like a real HiRoller. This is really sickening to realise that I had been taken for a ride. Sorry I won\'t buy chips after this scam. When Iost the balance 47 millions chips I will say "Hasta La Vista" to you!',
       'Had trouble restarting sit and go. Returning to lobby and reentering addressed problem. Pretty good app. Real problem is goals get more difficult when previous goals not achieved yet. Why if I\'m not that good yet? And what are these trophies?',
       'What the hell zynga? I won around 20m, went back to lobby and suprise. 7m dissapeared in the dust. How can you take so much from a win? This game is so unfair and I\'m sure it\'s rigged. In real life you\'ll never see dozens of flushes and straights and a few 4 of a kinds in a day. Every day. And bots, hackers or whatever they are make it impossible to get to top xx in leagues so there\'s no way to advance unless you have a lot of chips and win a lot. I recommend you to not purchase anything because this game is broken.' ,

      'I like this game. I purchased it because it deserves, also I want to remove ads. 3,50 € and ads are not removed completely. I\'m disappointed, expecially for the "restore purchase" button that not works. Despite this I think that as a game is fun but monotonous in the long run, defect of 90% of apps of this kind. I hope developers will add something with updates that are not other challenges that ofter go to luck (and waiting time should e removed also). Sometimes there are some bugs but irrilevant for gameplay. The development house has made other interesting apps too. Sorry for errors, is not my first language.',
       'Hi everyone!  I\'m really not a fan of this game, I mean it\'s ok I\'m not going to lie but is very boring. The graphics are ok but it is repetitive. I suppose it is quite addictive but I lost interest after a few goes. It wasn\'t my cup of tea so to speak. I hope this review was helpful and remember to give it a big thumbs up!!! Be sure to look out for my trade mark "Xxx" and I\'ll see you next time!! Bye! Xxx. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍',
       'Was super fun until you introduced balls achieved by watching ads and a luck based ball/challenge system. The devs got greedy and ruined this great time waster',
       'Great game 🤘🏼 totally addicted from the moment I started to play! Very few ads unless I request them...Lots of challenges... Excellent free game.... We worth a download 🤘🏼',

      'Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can\'t stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn\'t happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can\'t buy any of the bikes.',
       'After only playing a few short but addicting levels, I am already having a blast! The game may not look spectacular on a technical level. But the gameplay is so freaking fun! And the controls aren\'t too complicated either. Recommended for everyone!',
       'It\'s a fun little game at first, but has many, many flaws. You have to link it to your Facebook account if you wanna play all maps. There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can\'t play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That\'s just ridiculous. Not to mention it\'s very buggy. Sometimes you\'re racing someone who\'s in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it\'s just stupid.',
       'Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you\'re racing friends.',
       'Bugs and Glitches... Multiplayer links are not being sent back and forth properly. Some games keep giving me desert level 1 and not showing any replays or ghost bikes are doing a different levels then the one I am suppose to be racing against. Please Fix!!!',
       'I love playing this game but id give it no stars seeming that there are so many ads and when I collected enough stars for a ghost bike I DIDNT GET IT!! HORRIBLE!! unless you can fix this, you\'re not getting a good review on my hand. Oh and also, for anyone wanting to know, it\'s 21 dollars a month for some bikes. Not in real life. Wow such a great deal... No really a great deal.' ,

      'I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance',
       'Great simple game with AMAZING colours❤ I love this...dead simple and fun. It took me ages to work out how to unlock the new skins...click on the banner that has the amount of diamonds you\'ve collected and what looks like 3 sheets on top of one another  (it comes up before you press the start key...)',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME This is good game design. It rewards you no matter how high you go with a beautiful little tower. The colors are really satisfying. It keeps me engaged since you can "regrow" your blocks. That creates tension too--something to strive for. It\'s so simple but soothing and really addictive!!',
       'A Great Game For When You\'re Dumpin\'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin\' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I\'m in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren\'t too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I\'m happy to say that. I don\'t like to stay too long. Great game!',
       'So,  basically it\'s a pretty fun app to play when you\'re bored. It\'s a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It\'s a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don\'t really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!',
       'Good, with a major flaw I\'ve ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I\'ll tap, and the game won\'t register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I\'m on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I\'ve closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It\'s an issue I\'d like to see fixed.' ,

      'The ball is super hard to control. Half the time I\'m swiping over and over again just to make the ball move. The game acts like it is super easy when it is the hardest task to do. I\'m also being spammed with ads because once or twice you restart the level because you lost an ad plays. Plys the ads take me to Google Play without me touching the screen or tapping on download. And since the controls are a nightmare because of lines glitching around the ball, (thus making it not move a single centimeter) I have to watch an ad. or lines just glitching themselves. And finally, this game spams me with notifications to "thumbs up" you and download your other games. I\'m obviously NOT INTERESTED IN PAYING YOU WITH ADS!',
       'The ads are forced onto you, and that is the worse system I\'ve seen yet. The controls are pretty good if you have an s pen. Most puzzles are way to easy.',
       'Don\'t get me wrong this game is fun and gets your brain thinking but I hate how many adds it has. Plus every time an add comes up it takes me straight to Google play with out me even tapping on it. It gets annoying. Another thing I don\'t like about this game is after a certain amount of levels you have to watch a video (add again) just to unlock more levels. And it does this more than once to. On the flip side it is a good game that gets the brain running and the levels do get more challenging throughout.',
       'It keeps on hanging or get slow and this is most I the times. Other wise it is good  But because of this problem I Am unable to play the game',
       'its excellent first it was hard and hate it but normaly grew to like ot you do not delete  quicly wait then you would feel thats excellent  lovely game',
       'Too many ads and it glitches like crazy. Needs more levels, other than that it was a good game.' ,

      'I like this game, I really do. It is intense and fun, but the ads are a little too intrusive, if I connect to a game and the players disconnects before the map starts - you get an ad. I do understand that the game is free and all and I want the game to have ads to support the game, but this game has the most ads of any other game I know, so please atleast have a limit to the ads shown a day or have it shown every 2 games. Also I think it would be cool to have an option to watch a couple of ads to get a club ticket or have it to speed up the 24 hour cool down on the club arenas. Overall this game is really fun and I hope Ninja Kiwi keeps improving it.',
       'The ads are ever increasing, I don\'t pay for games and being forced more and more is a deterrent to continue playing. Turn it down a notch.... edit to developer reply...that doesn\'t explain why more and more ads are popping up. What was wrong with it before?  Getting greedy with get you nowhere.',
       'It\'s a fun game, great for passing the time. That being said it suffers some very problematic connection issues, if I tab away for even half a second it disconnects me and causes and auto loss',
       'I thought it was a really good game and very addictive. I wish that instead of you losing when you\'re connection is down the game should carry on until you join again. I\'ve lost loads of battle\'s that where going really well then lose connection and it won\'t reconnect so I get a loss. Also there are loads of ads.',
       'Ranking system is horrible,  to many game options make matching a hassle.  Defence mode is to hard to play even though its made to be like single player, very discouraging.  Then when you get into it the game it crashes.  This happens frequently, very upsetting I don\'t know how this game has a 4.4 star rating.  It also throws ads at you randomly as well as has pay to win with  the ability to buy metals.  One or the other please.  Not made for the player at all.',
       'Great game always loved the btd series. One thing I can suggest is to nerf the Moabs (and up) because as soon as you reach wave 18 it\'s just a race to send one.' ,

      'This game is dope I play it all the time! Alot of ads but I may just pay the 3 bucks to remove them. Only thing I would request is maybe an option to view the race stats at the end of each race. to see who we raced and their times rather than just a quick glance. So say I beat a high ranked player I\'d like something to show for it. Besides that I love this game!',
       'This game was worth 5 stars until the updates... More than half the time i try to connect to a race its doesn\'t work and doesn\'t give me back the 20 energy it requires to race. Also, I watched 50 videos to get the new car BLADE and i received absolutely NOTHING!!!! Until they fix this issue its getting a 1 star from me.',
       'So first of all way too many ads... When you click race you get Frozen and then sent to home screen and you lose your fuel... When you\'re "waiting on players" and they don\'t show up you lose fuel.. out of 10 attempts to start a race I play one',
       'Awesome game! Play it everyday. Even have spent actual money on it. That goes a long way for me.  Although, it\'s sucks after the latest update. Can\'t even go 12 races before it freezes up entering races and during races as well. Thats when i go to a different game. It\'s too bad.',
       'I reinstalled the game because the game has no sound what so ever, and now it has put me down to level 3 and I lost all my progression. Hours just down the drain. And to top it off, there still is no sound.',
       'Amazing concept, I just hate when I just spent 20 gas tanks on 1 race and either it moves me to another lobby where I have to spend another 20 gas tanks and it might happen again, or I am in a race and the server crashes and I lose 20 gas tanks. Other than that, this is a very fun game. The gas tanks regenerate to full in a quick amount of time. And there are many chances to earn a lot of stuff, Wish I got it sooner.' ,

      'I love this game. Amazing sound effects, graphics. You guys did a great job that\'s for sure! But still couldn\'t give it a five star because of the lastest update. The entire screen goes black after playing the game for 5-6 minutes. That\'s pretty irritating not to mention how much slower the phone gets as well. Didn\'t have these issues with the last update. Fix it please!',
       'The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen',
       'RSYFJH Great game very addictive, and I don\'t know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats\'s kind of ridiculous. That\'s the only bad thing I have to say about this game.',
       'This game is very nice and the best game I have ever played. If you have a chance to download this game dont let this chance to pass by. I prefer you to download this game. In this game you have a small place to decorate but there is more place which you have to buy. There is a guide in this game called Ernie who has the most beautiful town ever. You can visit his town any time you like and also make friends with anyone else. Me and my all sisters ( I dont have a brother )play this all day long and have much fun. This is the best game ever.',
       'This game is sooooo addictive,  it\'s like 4get cooking,  cleaning once you start it\'s hard to stop lol.  Lots of fun races,  prizes,  co-ops to help each other & make friends and have a great time.  But be forwarned this game can cause you to lose track of time.  Oh I will play for couple hours & next thing you know it\'s 1 am lol.  Hmmm few more mins bam it\'s 4 am.',
       'I love this game! It is very addicting. The details and graphics are outstanding. The only thing I don\'t like is how long  it takes to accumulate coins and cash, the videos to earn coins and cash are glitchy most of the time and don\'t work. The factories are expensive once you get to higher levels and are hard to buy due to how many coins it cost. Overall, this is one of my favorite games hands down!' ,

      'Fantastic RPG I\'ve played despite any problems with it you report the issues that are on the game the Movga team are on it. The graphics are brilliant and the updates are even better. The battleships and details are amazing and even better when you\'re in battle. To all future fleet commanders download and enjoy plus I\'ve been playing this for over a year or so now and it still is my go to game. So if you\'re new to Rpg try this one. All hands to battle station\'s.',
       'Movga not answer requests, game very expensive if you want to play and on the top of this you could not trust developers  because you are charged for items you did not get,graphic effects your eyes  and if you\'re longer playing you could asleep. All the time game crashes and stalls, Samsung galaxy S7 was locked several times. Game is developed for crazy profit  and normally you should pay to have fun  otherwise some one will but not you.',
       'The game seems to go through faze\'s some times good some times just ok. If you only speak english it can be very taxing, not to friendly at times. Has a very clicky higher archery . If you fall out with them you can have wasted all the money you put into the game.',
       'The translator needs fixing,  it\'s ok but could be a lot better,diamonds keep vanishing and there are other issues in game I don\'t like, it seems some legiins have preferential treatment regarding tasks and rewards. Other issues with the chat keyboard freezing or not working properly.',
       'As always the same issues constantly highlighted by many users bugs, game kickouts, freezing. These issues have been brought to attention by many but the usual response by speak to movga directly look at all the other bad feedback given they Don\'t want to put off potential new people. Is Waste money try a different game nothing ever gets sorted and if they do it doesn\'t last long and same issues arise.',
       'Game would be better if was based on skills rather than how much money you can spend on it. They should remove prosperity as it is abused before legion battles or regional battles. The players with the deepest pockets win no skills required... I love the game but the model is wrong.' ,

      'Easy to play and speeds up your visual and touch senses.   HATE the adverts...drives me crazy when I need to reshuffle and have to wait 30 seconds to resume play or start again. Other than that I like it',
       'It would vastly improve game play if the ads didn\'t pop up when shuffling. By the time the timed ads finish you\'ve lost the game and have to start all over. Somewhat frustrating.',
       'Best Mahjong I have played, lots of fun! Pausing does not always stop the timer. Shuffle 2 identical pieces stacked gives empty, broken.  5 stars if they fix these. Ads Between levels, but most have short timeouts, a pause that refreshes. Time to beat is challenging. 1st 30 levels are good, easy, but short times to beat. Long delays on a few level ads really annoy, but shuffle penalty delay is fair. Speed is adequate on my average tablet. Needs more than 1 music choice, but I just turn it off, is ok.',
       'I play a lot of different mahjong tile games in my phone and in my opinion this is one of the better ones. I like how you can close the ads. I like how clear the tiles are. I like your selection of art on the tiles. They are a bit different from other tile sets on other games. This makes the game a bit more difficult as your eye is not adjusted to the \'standard\' (for lack of a better word) monotonous art on generic tile sets. I keep downloading and trying other games by other makers, just to delete them and try another. This is one of the mahjong games that I keep in the rotation of other mahjong games, on my phone. I have yet to be bored with it. I think I will keep it for quite a while.',
       'I want so badly to give 5 stars fully, but I\'m not too thrilled that paying the fee to remove the ads doesn\'t remove them fully. Other than that, I love it. The ads even after paying take up too much time though, which is a deterrent for wanting to play it more frequently.',
       'I think I really like this game. It helps me remember things. And yes I enjoy playing games that will help me remember things. Great work to you and your team on creating this game. And also I really like the music compare to the other games. Keep up the good work. Please pass this to the others.' ,

       'The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don\'t get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new "enemies". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you\'ve lost some lives. But that\'s not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.',
       'I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It\'s more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.',
       'Completed all but just couldn\'t get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I\'ve ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.',
       'I love this game 😍😍 it is my favourite but.... I don\'t like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it\'s a great idea😋😋 btw i loved it 😍😍😍 ill give it 5 stars then😊😊',
       'I believe this app will quickly become 1 of my most played. It\'s very enjoyable also gives a good challenge. I\'m getting the hang of the controls in time I\'ll get better... I hope lol I would recommend this app definitely 1 of the better 1s of today 😍 👍 I would give a 👎 to the wait time if you loose too many lives you will then have to wait 17 mins to try again. I just started so this is my opinion so far. If I find more good or bad I will then update my comments 😊' ,

      'Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!',
       'Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can\'t just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can\'t advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it\'s basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.',
       'This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said "add break". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them.',
       'Love this game, its an addictive time killer. But I would like to have replays and not sure if it\'s only my device because I haven\'t seen other reviews about it but it doesn\'t have an accurate count of flips, my friend counted 11 and it said 3.5 I do many more (yes at one time, before landing) and it still says 3, 3.5, 4',
       'Since the last update, being able to double up on coins from hourly balloons is impossible.  Also watching videos for coins isn\'t working.  This game is great when everything works right.  However, it is getting frustrating not being able to view videos for coins.  I\'m game ad breaks are still working, so what\'s the deal?  The # 1 thing that keeps me in a game is not having to spend real money.  I a star simply because of this.  Fix it please.',
       'In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it\'s newer it\'s boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star' ,

You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'First, I don\'t like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don\'t like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you\'re just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!',
       'im not sure what\'s the cause of the problem but what i know is the sims\' act a lil bit freaky. i just redownloaded this game bcs i cant log in this game before bcs i just updated it. before this, the sims is ok, but now they act really awkward. when they\'re walking, they legs dont even move! it\'s like they\'re flying, plus when they\'re doing any action like "clean the dishes", they dont move, they just stand still in front of the sink. this is freaky. please reply to my review bcs i really want to know more about this. i really like this game except what i said above. this game is really addicting:).',
       'I like everything about this game no questions asked but i do find a few things annoying the main one is selling items in you inventory 1 at a time i wish there was a sell all for an item that would make this less annoying  to sell after house building and such. Please add a sell all oh and when do you think you can make more quests i really like doing them.',
       'Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools "playable",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it\'d be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.',
       'For the fact that we can\'t sell multiple items at once is a big downer. I have accumulated so many windows, computers, chairs etc with watching the daily news ads and it\'s a complete pain to delete 30, 50, 70 or even more! items one by one. Please consider adding this function in the app as it\'s in the real The Sims games.' ,

      'This is way better than candy crush. You can connect them instead if just finding 3 in a row. The characters are adorable and it is so satifying to upgrade the charaters. I love the theme of killing slugs! So cute! There are in app purchases but they are totaly worth it! If you get the game now you can get 5 dollars worth gold and diamonds! Ans the themes are lit! I can say that i am very hooked to this game! Me and my friend are battling to see who get get farther! We are at 12 and up! See if you can beat us! Download now!',
       'Very fun game so far. The creatures are super cute and I love some of their unique powers. I\'m only on level 38 so I\'ll come back if something changes 😀. Update: I\'m back. I\'m close to level 200 and have become obsessed with upgrading my fiends. Sigh. I\'m surprised this game is not quite in the top 100 grossing 😁😭😁!',
       'A screen popped up asking about buying some items for $4.99. There wasn\'t a button for me to exit out of the option and I accidentally hit the box.  Is there a way to refund the 4.99?',
       'It is very challenging once you get into the upper levels! I really enjoy playing the game, the only thing I would like to see is for the creators to give us a chance to win more gold bars.  It can get expensive buying them!',
       'Love the game! Sometimes when you have about 1 more move to go and you need three of something but only one of them is on the screen can get a little annoying, but its still a lot of fun!',
       'As of today I can no longer finish any levels. It gets to the give up or get 5 moves screen, I click give up and it freezes. I have too close and reopen the app. The worst part is it takes my lives, but doesn\'t give me credit for the Rose challenge. I updated and tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Please fix this.' ,

      'Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don\'t like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option',
       'Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it\'s good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can\'t take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren\'t recognised either. I\'d enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.',

Lovee It!',
       'This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!',
       'Update:  now the game won\'t let me start a new game.   Original post: Buggy to say the least. Paid to remove ads since it was only .99. And now the game randomly quits, and erases any games I\'ve started when I exit from the game for any period of time. Was find until I removed the ads. Great way to treat the people paying your bills.',
       'This game is very addicting and so fun to play. Some are challenging and can be hard if you don\'t spell the word correctly. I only wish we got 60 seconds. Some of the categories consist of longer words and some people can\'t type that fast. But I do love this game, just not an ad after every round.' ,

I do believe giving an emergency C-section for an illegal is a bit much for a story line, but whatever. Totally makes sense. I love how we\'re able to take care of the premies and foster them until they\'re adopted! 6/10 - Would play again if bored.',

       'It was realy fun but I think  you should be able to choose what the mom looked like and the babies and choose if you wanted a girl or a boy and choose what teddies you wanted to give them like a rabbit toy or a dog toy but apart from that it was great. Thank you so much.',
       'This game\'s control quality is terrible and I even started to get frustrated because the game wouldn\'t let me do something I needed to do to advance.',
       'This game is really good the best part is dressing up you can match them with the mommy and Iove how you can name the baby number one was Laura and number two was Lauren ok last words I liked this game',
       'This game is good I liked it also not so many adds are there  and the part I like the most is that the dressing of the babies.if looking for a game like this please download it. Thanks' ,

      'I\'m 11 and i love it so much.I have some Ideas for a toca kitchen 3. You can be able to make sandwiches and soups or stews. And more ingredients, more people. And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.',
       'I want YOU to read this Toca Boca I love it! But I have to ask, Why is there bread if you can\'t make a sandwich? Also can you make there a way to make soup? I really like your games but I am only 10,how do you expect me to pay for the games. At make 5 free like this!',
       'I like how I can give the guests disgusting drinks and food a see and hear their really funny reaction! Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!😆😆 I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!',
       'Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I\'m sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP',
       'I\'m giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won\'t make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least',
       'This is the best game ever it is also funny because I was giving the girl food and I gave her some strawberries and I put a lot of lemon, hot sauce, Barbiecu sauce,Manas,keckup,salt, and pepper... SO funny, it also sounds just like a kid is playing with the food, that I\'m eating grapes right now,😂😂😂😂😁😀😊☺🙂😐' ,

      'I never EVER been so absolutely in love with a app. I only read about 3 stories and spent $82 for gems and tickets because not only I couldn\'t resist it\'s the least I could do for the creaters for creating such a perfect game that seriously was meant for me in every way possible! (And I NEVER spent money on ANY apps so THAT is how much I LOVE this!) This brings me endless amounts of happiness! It\'s EVERYTHING a story lover could love! 😍💓 AND THERE IS NO ISSUE AT ALL ABSOLUTELY NONE! And I am so not lying when I say NO ISSUE! 😁 100/10 game! My only wish is I\'d love for another way to earn gems.',
       'Game is fun. Dont even mind spending money in gens every now and again. But seriously to get the outcome you want, this app is charging waaaaaaay too many gems. Like 50 for one simple choice. And its goes up higher depending on the amount of gems you have. If I pay $5.99 for like 60 gems.. that should get me through and entire story. Not just one chapter. Will delete app if they dont change it. Not gonna spend $40 to finish a story.. Sorry but I think thats outrageous.',
       'This game is really fun! I wish there was a way to restart a story that you are in the middle of or that you could change your appearance or other people\'s appearence at any time. Also when you decide what your character is wearing, sometimes you can\'t see it because dialog is in the way. Also when you choose what you look like. I would prefer it to be against a white background. It\'s hard to see what the darker colors look like.',
       'The stories seem great so far, the app is really nice. But the limiting of how much you can "read" is way over the top. Two short chapters and then a 4 hour wait to get another two. Or buying more chapter tickets. All the actually fun choices are also gated behind premium currency. If it was even a bit less limiting, it would be great. As it is, its fun but annoying.',
       'Really fun, the animation style is adorable but the waiting time is killer! Two short chapters, then you have to wait a ridiculously long amount of time to be able to play more unless you pay. Also the best story options are only available through micro transactions to get more gems to unlock the ability to make certain choices',
       'I like it.  So it\'s really fun and it\'s full of drama! But your options are short because when you have to choose between things, you can only say yes to something IF you have enough gems.But to get gems you have to pay with actual money SO . . . It\'s limited options every single time I play.' ,

      'I was really enjoying the game, it\'s fun. Don\'t get me wrong. But I\'ve signed in every day, every single day and I make sure I do, and sometimes I do it from my iPad and sometimes I do it from my phone. And sometimes it lags and says I missed a day before it fixes. But today I signed in and it told me I missed a day. So I tried it on my phone and it still said I missed a day so I had to restart from the first day in the current collection item. I\'m very frustrated and upset by this. So this whole \'signing on from a different device\' thing is glitchy af and my game got messed up because of it. Very upsetting. Otherwise it would be a 5star.',
       'This game is amazing! Most games of this style sacrifice story for the sake of puzzles, or vice versa, but this is a perfect balance and blend of both. I was hooked from the first moment, and the briliant and individual characters and challenging - but not impossible - puzzles have kept me eagerly impatient to play more. (My only complaint is that the energy refill feels SO SLOW when all I want to do is play more!)',
       'I\'d prefer being able to search when I want to, and am disappointed that games like this must put limits like "energy" into their gameplay. However, the scenes are progressively more challenging so as to keep your attention, with good graphics and interesting storyline.',
       'I\'d give 5 stars for everything if the new update would work. It continues to crash. I love this game and wish I could play. I\'m also loosing 2 days of a boost item b/c I can\'t play ANY level.',
       'Love the game but miss not been able to get coins or energy with the new upgrade (like you could with the snowmen). Also when the games get tougher, a little extra time added when you add more things to find would be nice too.',
       'Thoroughly annoyed now. Another update, another problem. If this could be sorted then it would be worth recommending but once again it\'s glitching so I can\'t play it. Says it\'s awaiting downloads but won\'t do it.' ,

       'Used to be my favorite game.  The latest update completely changed the character of the game.  The ball is faster, bouncier, and everything is smaller, and it all adds to just randomness.  The AI got worse at the same time, so it\'s not really harder... just more random.  I now find that this game stresses me out instead of helping me relax, so I have to give it up.',
       'Stale gameplay with nothing interesting. AI sucks. Lv 27 has little difference from lv 1. Too boring. Time to rid this trash from my phone at least I bothered playing with AI till lv 27. I wonder if there is even a end game or maybe the level keeps increasing aimlessly without any interesting change. Bored to max.',

      'Several times now I\'ve tried to type in a logo name and the app has told me I got it wrong but I thought it was right and couldn\'t see why I was being told I was wrong. So I hit "solve" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I\'ve recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you\'ve ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?',
       'This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further.',
       'Not a bad game, but would be great if you could simply type the name down, instead of slowly searching for each individual letter. Makes it all sluggish and takes away the fluidity of the game.',
       'First Level at Barbie and Twitter, even if type the words correct, the app tells me that there\'s a mistake. Solve shows me exactly the same word I\'ve typed in before',
       'Several times I have tried to use a hint and it  wouldn\'t take it off and it was difficult and easy. When I type in the logo it would tell me I\'m wrong then I hit solve and it was the same thing I wrote also and if people don\'t know some of the logos what is the point of the game.',
       'It\'s too easy to amass a huge number of hints and use them. I\'d like not to be able to complete every level without doing some online searches.' ,

And this is first time i\'m very exited when i managed to finish a level, even after that, i repeat again till i can surpass it perfectly. Even i haven\'t sleep for 2 days, felt like an alien or zombie, etc. But this game cheers me up alot. Recommended ? Yes! Good job dev, just download it guys. Lu pasti hepi dah! Keren!',
       'Wow... as I was writing this review it suddenly all disappeared as it said unfortunately traffic rider has stopped. Wow.. nice. I cannot even open the game without freezing up my tablet. Real nice. And tbh I love this game! On my phone it works..... 😥😣😈👹',
       'There are some idiot missions such as combo overheading. I would give this game 5 stars if not those missions.',
       'LMAO I CAN\'T SEE THE WHEEL ROTATING ON BIKES LIKE HD FROD TOMA AND OTHER VISIBLE FRONT TIRES, CAN YOU FIX THIS PLEASE COZ I REALLY LIKE THE GAME. THANKS',
       'Gave one star less because the missons lack mathematical accuracy There was this level to travel 8 kms in 130s and it was showing it an easy mission with a bike of top speed 172 kph 😂 The graphics and gameplay are superb I like the game',
       'I can\'t stop playing this!! The missions are really hard and thats what makes it fun! although i almost threw my phone twice. but this game is amazing! the graphic is good too!' ,

      'Fut can not be developed with this building team. Football is one of the most attractive games but how this fut goes? In Vs attack mode, what the hell meaning do chances have? Players must creat chances by themselves not the game. You must let them play whole game and create the chances by themselves. EA is a big builder in football games and develop a lot but have you ever thought how your fut only stands at this place?',
       'overall its an awesome game great experience. but Its hard for free to play players to complete and go through the events..... the icons are too difficult to get please make them a bit earlier to get, it will be awesome to have them in the team.... its difficult to get elite players in a pack of 500 fp totw pack n few others packs too... the vs attack mode is great.... EA please make sure that the free to play players to get a good experience of getting new and better players....',
       'Can you please make the following improvements then your game will rule the playstore. 1) Make your graphics good. Sometimes one can\'t even recognise the player. 2) Add  real referee there on the pitch. 3) Add a feature of commentary in all languages. 4) Add an option of the records of every individual player\'s stats, goals, assists and all. 5) Add some weather conditions,night mode, attendance. 5) Add a number of more celebrations and especially player\'s signature celebration.  Please take a look on my review and make the game more beautiful.',
       'Dear EA Sports: We really want to get the icon Ronaldinho but its changed and its very hard. Before we were required to have an 89 ovr+ team with atleast 5 Brazilian players but now it has completely changed. Now we are required to have a 98 ovr+ team with atleast 6 Brazilian players. I hope you make the icons a bit more easier. Thanks☺',
       'It\'s really good game!! I would suggest others to download this!! The only problem with the team hero\'s event that I faced is that even after playing that event so many times and opening so many packs I still haven\'t got a team hero and because of this I am not able to upgrade my FIFA mobile master Ronaldo!!! Pls see if u could do something about it!!!',
       'FIFA Mobile is a awesome game and I have a good team after a few weeks with the events that they given it makes it easy to get coins.The only problem is I can\'t create a league. Plz fix this it is holding me back because I can\'t get me mobile master xp for Ronaldo Overall great game.!!!!' ,

Im currently at 39000 Gems. Looking for Guild members at Butt_Pirates. I\'m Guil Leader (Draft_FS), message me via Castle Clash built in messanger.',
       'I\'ve played for 3 years and this game has just gone way downhill, this is the biggest pay to win game that exists. It\'s enjoyable to see people have the ability to buy what I worked so hard during the last 3 years for a mere $10. I haven\'t enjoyed this game in months, it\'s a chore to still play. Download only if you\'re willing to drop a fortune.',
       'OMG This app is annoying in all ways... And on Certain hack things I play this for 30 seconds but still don\'t get a pass! Tell CoTops to give me my credits',
       'Lol I\'m changing my review once more. I love the game but every new hero you guys drop completely messes up the game and makes things unfair. I don\'t know if your way of trying to fix it is by making more OP heroes but it simply makes the game less enjoyable. The last few heroes that came out completely made my account useless and if I don\'t put in a good couple hundred dollars is just gonna stay useless. I think that\'s unfair so for now I\'m taking off a few stars. I know you guys don\'t care but its the only thing I can do to express my opinion. In my humble opinion you guys should balance the useless heroes you already have rather than coming up with new ones that make the old ones  useless.',
       'DO NOT ENTER!!!!  Unless you have thousands of dollars lying around and burning a hole in your pocket, do not bother! This game takes care of p2w (play to win) players and it is getting borderline impossible for f2l (free to lose) players to catch up and the gap is just getting bigger by the day.... its ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Edit: After 4 years of playing this game I have finally thrown in the towel.... I loved this game, and maybe I still do, but you guys make it bloody impossible to play anymore  (*Queen playing in backround* ...another one bites the dust)',
       'Very unfair. D\'ont download it unless you want to spend a fortune. After four years of playing, the new op heroes available for cash, will crash your in a second. Be aware !!!' ,

      'Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can\'t without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.',
       'First up the images used as what the game looks like are fakes. I saw too many polygons.... (Shudder) Secondly there is no start menu. NOPE! Just some fancy loading screen and boom you\'re in the game without a chance to look at the controls. Plus your first mission is ruined by the tutorial at the worst places on the track.   Bad game knockoff. If you download this just delete it. This game is EXPLICATIVE',
       'Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that\'s excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.',
       'Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?',
       'It would br better if you could exchange coins for diamonds, not just diamonds for coins. I also have a screen shot which shows that I should be the 1 place, yet another car which was behind me and crossed the line 1 sec later got the first place :/',
       'So many ad\'s, there back to back ad\'s. When I am finally able to select a race, guess what...another ad pops up and takes me to the play store to download it. I go back to the game and I gotta start all over again from the first screen. Ad\'s ad\'s ad\'s I was only able to play on the first day I downloaded it, after that..... Ad\'s ad\'s ad\'s                    "AD\'S!!!".... But i did like the game when I played it' ,

There is no actual game here. And what happens when you run out of spins and realize you still need millions more money to upgrade worthless buildings? give them real money. this game is so lazy it might as well be classified as a scam.',

But please add stuff like levers, iron doors, animals, Redstone, Buttons, iron trapdoors, texture packs, adventure mode,  Redstone torch\'s, Hoppers, Ripeters, dimensions like the Nether and The End, And other stuff from the game, "Minecraft". Also, add skin packs and make it like people can see there hand, and add mobs like dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, and foxes. Dogs, Man\'s best friend. Cats, Always cute. Birds, Watch them well you build. Rabbits, See them jump. Foxes. See one on an adventure. Please Also pay for Minecraft if you want it for stuff like Creepers. Also, add farm animals like chickens, sheep, cows, And other stuff like that. But plz do it. Also, add all paintings, pictures from Minecraft, and caves. I will Enjoy the game more if you do. Bye!',
       'Love the game! My only problem is that for some reason, when I grow wheat and try to get a cow to follow me, well they just ignore me. I haven\'t been able to find carrots for the pigs either. Frankly, I would like to be able breed animals pure and simple. Otherwise good job',
       'I really like this game. I\'ve never played Minecraft and since it cost money to download the app, this is something fun for me to play and not need to spend money. The only issue I have is in survival mode there doesn\'t seem to be enough cows, and I have only managed to make some shoe armor. But then again, there\'s a lot I haven\'t figured out yet, but it\'s been fun learning.',
       'It is a nice game but it is just shot of (some) things.. e.g animals, red stone ,pail (can contain milk ,water and lava or it can be empty) , red stone torch, paintings (diffirent sizes),mobs. Also, it would be nice if you can label the items that we picked so that it would be easier for us to pick the item that we want. I hope you can add some more items into the game.it will be more thrilling to play. Thanks' ,

But once you have been playing it for bit you get board or at least I do.and to the creators of this game to make it less boring you could put levels or different modes in it or add more  shapes. Please reply or just update. Thank you.',
       'Your English is so bad it is insulting.    You need to hire someone to proof read before you post requests for ratings.  A definite turn off to the game which is actually quite fun and challenging.    Requires strategic planning.',

       'My four year old likes it and I feel like it helps him on making decisions. I can actually see him thinking what going to be him next move. I like this game and I love playing with my son. Only thing I hate is that it does have to many ads 😒',
       'Great game to pass time. Adverts are frustrating but necessary unless you want to pay to stop, BUT very annoying when they pop up as you just lifted a puzzle piece and because of advert it just drops randomly. Also being able to rotate pieces would be handy, granted not as challenging however.',
       'Game is good when they ask you for the rate they say "Our God we are begging you for a rate" or for  "help " sorry but I will not play this game I am not there God and I refuse to be called their God. It has glitches wear it just freezes up in the middle of the game or it just randomly puts your block somewhere because it freezes up and wherever it freezes up at his where it\'s at' ,

      'Love playing but have 2 suggestions. We need another mill.  When we have large orders to fill it takes forever to complete those orders because the mull is tied up all the time. Maybe every 40 levels add a mill purchase option. When selling on the market, we need an option for a blind add or a neighborhood only sell or trade.. make these upgrades and so far game would be perfect!',
       'I love these type of games just like hayday. I have noticed it freezes and takes ages to load the newspaper. Also would be helpful if it could tell you who needs help in the newspaper would help filling orders quicker. Also I have noticed alot of people selling the same parts and harder to get others and it\'s extremely rare to get the land parts without paying',
       'It\'s great to be able to buy from other farms in theory. But there are WAY too many times that you click on something and it\'s either sold or not even in the roadside stand at all. The for sale paper needs to update quicker.  Also, it\'s very hard to accumulate any \'west bucks\' in this game and you need them to do almost anything, so the game is a big money suck too. I\'m deleting it.',
       'The game doesnt give enough case vs things to buy or fix.  Also have issues with getting product into the alloted spaces.  I thought it was my screen but had it cleaned thoroughly and it still happens.  It takes several attempts!!!  The story is cute.  The graphics are cute as well.  Ive noticed it has a couple of choices from other games Ive played on older phones. I would suggest the game to others but get the issues fixed and itll be a 5star game.',
       'I love playing these games. I\'m not sure why we are rating gameplay they offer apps not a game. It\'s crazy how they ask us to rate game at the beginning of game. We haven\'t learned the bad points. This game makes us pay for treasure chest instead of giving us to them free like most games. Which means we have to pay for everything. Totally not fair. Takes the fun out of game.',
       'Was totally looking forward to playing this game, the graphics were so cute that I couldnt help but download, but I havent even gotten past the tutorial and its frozen? The game started panning to the billboard right after you sell your first visitor the cream and then it just froze and now it won\'t let me continue on.' ,

      'Great game, fair balance of ads. Only thing it needs to mix all the songs thru all levels, as the single song while does hold up to repeat play, eventually gets repetitive. Also need better dictionary because I often play real words and it doesn\'t count them which stinks.',
       'They repeated words a lot. Also, words that exist aren\'t always counted. And some words that were counted in some rounds aren\'t counted for others. For example, ale has been a valid word for most of the levels but not for some of them. When I first started playing, did was not accepted and then became accepted as my level got higher. Sloppy work, and it\'s so frustrating. The level I\'m on right now, for example, is not accepting "wad" "wed " or "dew"',
       'I love it. There\'s only two problems. When you\'re on a streak and you accidentally hold a letter and don\'t make a word you lose your streak, even if you don\'t try to make a word. As well as that, the WORST part of the game is the notifications that constantly pop up even if you turn them off. Seriously might be the reason I uninstall the app.',
       'Several problems with this app, and I see the same complaints I have over and over again. From the first moment, this is not the game I saw in the ad, which looked like mine sweeper. But it still looked like a good word game, so I played for five days. I expect a certain number of ads for a free game, but not every level. The word acceptance rules are arbitrary, sometimes accepting plurals and sometimes not. I\'m pretty sure "legs" is a word. Sometimes does not recognize other actual words, most recently "stork." Frustrating, notifications constantly, uninstalling as soon as I finish this review.',
       'This game is sooo addicting, I can\'t stop playing it. There are several games that are very much like this one but I like this one the most because when it starts off with just 4 little squares it doesn\'t go on and on. The beginning is so boring when it\'s only 4 squares. This one starts out 4 squares but only goes about 8 levels then it gets harder right away. The others go on & on & on!! WORD CROSSY IS #1 !',
       'I enjoy this game as word games go,  particularly when you finally get to the more challenging levels.  However it is very frustrating that the same word may be accepted on one level but not on another.  So when you enter the word that was previously accepted you lose the accrued points build  up.  This is particularly an issue with plurals - it is so inconsistent in accepting such words. Plus how about only using real words?  Swop on level 275 is not a real word. I do like the daily challenge.' ,

      'The whole concept of the game is very interesting. But the game has way too many glitches due to ads and maybe the new update. This game can literally give someone cardiac arrest because you could be about to get a goal and then the game just freezes. Lol.',
       'This game beats the whole purpose of dumb ways to die. It\'s meant to be a game with mini games after mini games. Not ads and points and avatars and money and everything complicated! Deleting and getting the original.',

       'OK, so personally, FANTASTIC! I only have a few things I don\'t like about the app. 1. WAY to many adds. 2.Bad Controls. And 3.Kind Of Slow. Other than Those concerns, this is an great app and I suggest it to anyone who likes these kind of games. Also, this is a great time killer to. Please make those little changes and you app will be perfection. Thanks!',

       'The game is great. But a lot of annoying ads are ruining it. I understand the ads, where you receive coins or where you speed up things, but ads every 3 times when you die are just ruining the app. Hope to update this policy, so one can see ads only when it will give you credits or anything else!' ,

      'The gameplay is unique and challenging and fun but this game feels like a demo as all the other game modes (PvP , co-op etc) are locked for free users. And you can\'t even use checkpoints without paying them( like SERIOUSLY?!) So once the game is over you have to start all over again if you are a free user. Apart from that this game definitely deserves a try from people looking for casual , relaxing yet challenging gameplay.',
       'Great game This is a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing aesthetics and highly addictive. Totally worth the $2 for the premium version. I do have one problem though: even though I am pretty decent at the game, Google Play won\'t give me any achievements even though I\'m sure I have earned some. It won\'t even let me open achievements or leaderboard pages. Is anybody else having this issue?',
       'BEST GAME EVER... Love this game,  a must have on every phone.. Well worth the price, amazing graphics.. Also bought the VR version truly unbelievable. Just 1 wee problem... When you reach infinity there is not a lot of glass to smash for extra balls which is a must have especially when it goes super fast.  Thankyou and keep up the great work..',
       'Spectacular Shockingly Good Game This game is addicting and amazing who thought breaking glass could be so fun. I mean somebody thought of something random when they made this. I I love it it is just so amazing. If only the person who thought of it made the game so that you didn\'t have to pay for some stuff like extra levels. Still if you\'re reading this and you\'re questioning if you should download this or not you definitely should.! 😉😀☺',
       'I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I\'ve decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I\'ve upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!',
       'Really fun and addicting! The first time i saw this app was when my dad told me about this game, he said that it was very good. Literally the first 10 minutes i played this game my mind was blown and i beacame addicted. Around 2 years later(now) i found this game again and instantly installed it. I love this game and I have played it for a long time. The graphics and music are amazing. This a really good game and you should install it! Who could think that glass could be so fun. However I think this game would be better if some of the thing you have to pay for would be for free.' ,

      'I never had to pay a single cent for this game, and it\'s working out perfectly fine for me. Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don\'t like my non-responsive faction members and I\'m worried once I leave my faction I couldn\'t join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.',
       'This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn\'t make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!',
       'No one from the support team will respond. My game was unistalled and reinstall and I lost 2 years worth of data. Can\'t remember sync it and I know scopely can do it for me. I\'ve provided everything they need and still nothing via email or in-game support. Will change my rating if this is sorted',
       'The last update has caused it to have to load every few times I log in. It takes 4 to 5 minutes each time. Never had this problem before! Can\'t get past prestige rewards screen... I have uninstalled and reinstalled... not happy',
       'I love the game it\'s really epic. But one thing that pisses me off is during the tournament for survival after completing a level with 3 stars there is this part where u have to claim tokens ND after claiming the game crashes  ND starts again. So could u please fix that would mean a lot.. otherwise I got no other problems',
       'I used to play this game on an older account and became bored of the difficulty spike. Uninstalled. Came back to it after some time and have now found upon reinstalling that I can\'t progress past the opening page, skip and next are unusable...  Scopely&gt;Fix the issue please.' ,

      'The graphics aren\'t the best and the set up isn\'t totally comprehensive. Some maps are so zoomed in that it\'s hard to recognize the general location unless you\'re already really familiar with geography. It could be more interesting, but the questions are good and it has helped me learn some.',
       'I\'m extremely impressed by your app. It is not only fun, but it is the best educational app that has taught me so much! The border outline is the only thing that needs better graphics...otherwise I couldn\'t be happier!!! (An offline mode would make this app perfect) . Thank you!🙋💯💡👍❗🌠🏆💝☺',
       'Was a great game, I learned a ton of geography. But now the ads are seriously out of control. Top players are really the ones who watch the most ads. Also, it would be nice if the encyclopedia allowed you to compare countries for a given category instead of only being able to view a single country.',
       'The graphics/fonts and everything are outdated, but there is SO much information you can be quizzed on. I\'m learning everyday!',
       'Good game, but could someone help me? I don\'t know where to ask anywhere else. I\'m a level 32 and I have changed my phone. Now it asks for my user ID, which apparently isn\'t the same as my user name, which I know. Where could I retrieve it? I\'d hate to start over.',
       'It is challenging and does exercise the brain! I do find the format a bit confusing and the categories misleading (e.g. questions about Africa under "Americas" (?) But fun overall.' ,

      'It is inexcusable to allow ads to make such noise when both my phone is in silent mode AND I have the sound off in the game settings! I went over other reviews and the developers wanted to know which ads. Seriously?! How about all of them?! They have to be aware yet refuse to fix the problem. Do not download this intrusive app. Also I get a migraine with the annoying "Ready? Let\'s go!" voice when the sound is on.',
       'Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.',
       'Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you\'re given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.',
       'The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item.',
       'Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.',
       'Annoying ads with sound even i off d sound , if u need a life they forced u to see the ads first there is no option to buy energy power by u\'r point still u want then they are selling in $ ... and lots more... Bad experience i m going to uninstall the app.' ,

      'A truly fun, interesting & free game. A good game for any age. If you need to do something relaxing, this is a good way. You\'ll get hooked!!! I\'m in the 500\'s & it\'s still fun! The ads only require 1 more touch on the screen than you have been doing. Well worth it.',
       'Great game, Love it! Very creative, fantastic graphics. Not so difficult or loss of life\'s to where you can\'t even play.  Yet still challenging.  Only negative is lots of ads. Would gladly pay nominal fee to get rid of them.',
       'I love playing games like this to relax, but on other similar games I can\'t stop myself from buying the stupid in app purchases all the time which makes me more stressed! This game is perfect because it\'s not so difficult that it\'s not fun and I don\'t have to worry about wasting my money on imaginary things!',
       'I really like this game but newer version I have updated to after 3 months and I see the Hooray Sound in the end and some more sounds in between has been changed to Ticking kind of sound.   I seriously and kindly request to the developer to restore those sounds which were there in old versions because I seriously loved it. I wish those sounds can come back which makes the game more amazing.   And ofcourse I still continue to play this and have hope for those sounds to be back.',
       'It\'s a cute game BUT there are way way too many ads compared to any other game, I understand that they have to make money and that ads are a must on free games but 3 and 4 ads  every round of play (5-7 seconds) is over kill, uninstalling now',
       'Great game. Gets harder as you progress but never impossible. One of the few match 3 games I\'ll stick with.  Update: Been playing a while now. I\'m at level 664 and I still really enjoy the game. Worth playing. Lots of fun and they don\'t rig it so you have to buy stuff to win!' ,

You need to sort a league out also need to sets and legs against players and also the scoring when it looks like it\'s in a treble it\'s given as a single there are not fall outs or hitting wires which make things more interesting',
       'Love the game but recently when I have been coming off the game then when I go back on to play half my coins are gone! Al pretty annoying when trying to play friends.',
       'Love the game!! The only thing I could say that would make it a little better is if they had a throw counter for those good enough to possibly go for a 9/10/11 or 12 dart finish!!',
       'Really love the game but recent changes in ads makes gameplay lag and it crashes after watching ads. Please sort it out, I\'d buy ad free if it was cheaper as would many - I\'d also do that. Cheers',
       'I would like an opportunity to get rid of ads for a small fee',

      'I have enjoyed this game immensely up until level 240. In this level, rated HARD, there are most often no options to make strings and you\'re stuck with only strings of 3 of just plain air. When you see the game itself changing the color of treats several times during one game to give you a move, you know you\'re not imagining that this level is designed to screw you over into making fruitless purchases to overcome it.',
       'Great game but it continually crashes and freezes and you have to force stop the app to get it working again. Seems to happen when the ads pop up, please fix this! **update - this is getting worse! Every time i lose or win a level the game crashes and I have to force stop',
       'Highly addictive. And the animals are funny when u miss out on feeding them. Love it. Using an S pen makes it easy',
       'It\'s beautiful, really. But if you create stories in tot. levels will be more creative and gorgeous',
       'I\'m a bit disappointed with the game. I\'ve found it boring. Then, level 240 is where I got stuck. Three weeks and still can\'t get past.  Lost interest and will uninstall.',

      'I kind of miss the old version because isn\'t that why they came out with a 2nd game so if we eant more we got it.  Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad. On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.',

And about the ads there are a lot of them but if u turn of wifi and data then u won\'t have a problem with the ads cause they don\'t show up!              Please pledge to be safe aroun trains',
       'This game is really good and fun but strate after you lose all 3 of your lives it goes straight onto an add. There are loads of adds and I don\'t think it needs that much adds for a game like dumb ways to die, on the other hand it\'s a grate game and it\'s a laugh and a joke, I think it\'s a really good game☺',
       'I love it and all that but it should really make some more valentine mini games because it just gets boring after a while and the thing i don\'t like about this app is that every time when you die it just goes onto an advert which are so annoying. Everything else i like and the app is actually quite good and funny aswell',

BEWARE PLAYERS: this is a bait. it wont made the ads go away. ads will also appear out of nowhere during my gameplay. delete it now',
       'Used to be a fun game but unfortunately it no longer works. Game has you waste your coins on quests which you complete and then you receive no reward for some reason. You\'re supposed to get free coins but about half the time you don\'t actually get it after you click the button. I wasted 90 coins and complete a quest and then I received nothing but it clearly thinks I completed the quest because I need to pay another 90 coins to get a new Quest. This is happen like half the time! Sometimes I get no XP for some reason. I don\'t know what happened to this game',
       'What is this???? After every 1 or 2 game when the main menu comes I touch screen just frozes I can\'t even touch any button. Neither I can play nor I can go to shop it\'s nothing I can do but just to quit the game. My phone is Samsung S6  Pls do something it\'s really irritating',
       'This is a nice idea for a game but needs a lot of work. First of i couldn\'t even understand how the game works. Always saying "connection is slow" every damn time. Controls? Terrible. Before i even learn how to move i get eaten. Please look into these and you might have a good game there.',
       'fix the laaags please. I have high speed internet but still facing lags. I spent a lot in this game and don\'t want to loose it. Still lagging :(. It works with only high speed internet. Can\'t play with the data packages only strong wifi.  You didn\'t fix this in the new edition of the game and the rush mode is not working. The new party is sucks big time. Fix fix fix',
       'Over all great game, but there\'s just one problem. The problem is that when you get huge (35k mass or higher) it tends to lag and freezes then eventually the app crashes please fix it really annoying .. Edit : There seems to be a bug in the controls shooting food will split tf' ,

      'I love playing the game but there are so many updates all the time. And when they do their bimonthly update you have to download new package and then some gameplay features dont work. I have had a couple things not work from last update. I tried to contact support and they havent replied at all. Its been three days now. Im an everyday player who spends real money in game. Would rate higher if someone would help me out..',
       'I just realized this evening that this game uses the microphone feature to spy on the players and listen to their conversations without their consent. After joining one event I could clearly hear conversations of other players (not about game and I\'m sure without them even knowing that they were being listened to) while I was having my sound turned off, even after leaving that particular event and when having my game in the background the sounds didn\'t stop until I turned off the game. This game should be called Legacy of Spies, nice try 👍🏻',
       'Will i ever get the chance to play again? Cant sign in to complain and it doesn\'t look like LOD  really  care about the players. I haven\'t been able to get on since The 8th!!! The game has stoped loading after the last update. It will either reach 21% or 71%.',
       'Same problem as most people, my wrath wings menu has been freezing since 4 updates ago and now my skywings freezes the game as well. How do I contact the software report team to fix this I feel like I should be twice as strong by now. Really cool game but you\'re going to lose a lot of players if things go on like this. Please fix the bugs I feel like each update just makes things worse.',
       'I am level 83 and i love this game. But plunder dont work soul vortex also dont work and more players are experiencing same thing. I send support ticket 10 days ago no one answer. If u fix these bugs il give 5 stars',
       'Spent almost two months time in this game but end up their glitch after an update resulted certain claim item forfeit. Maybe I was an f2p hence not worth their time and effort to assist me. Game deleted.' ,

      'Pretty good design, but there is a cheater mode which tells you when one is wrong even if it\'s not apparent. So the fastest times are always really fast even for the hard ones. Also the ad bar is right below the numbers so you accidentally hit it when you play. Pretty sure that\'s intentional to get extra clicks, but super annoying.',
       'having lots of fun with the game, especially the daily challenges. But  ads that cannot be skipped pops up way too often, and its quite irritating. Also it would b good if u can ad d something like automatically mark (diff cotour, shade out) the numbers thats already been fully filled so we dont have to check it manually.',
       'I love this game. I can play nice and easy games when I have "brain fog" or when I\'m feeling better play the hard games. Still haven\'t been able to finish an expert one in under 30 mins although I will keep on trying.  I understand the need for ads but putting them between each game is ridiculous!',
       'The ads are too frequent (after each game play) very annoying, and you have to wait too long for the option to close them.  If I wanted those other games I would have downloaded them already.  I\'ll probably uninstall because of the ads.',
       'Over all....quite nice, challenging but not throw the bloody phone difficult. I really like the colour options. So far I\'ve completed all january and most of the up to date febuary puzzle. 8/10 always room for improvement but definitely worth a few moments here and there.',
       'I NEVER thought I would like this game. As it turns out it is so much fun...so far. I\'m just a beginner. Soduku is a very addictive game and thrilling when you "get it!" This particular game is designed very simply and clearly, which I like. The only drawback (hence only 4 stars) is that the "choosing" numbers at the bottom are spaced too close to each other and I often tap the wrong one accidentally, making my choice incorrect. They need to be a larger or thicker font or be further apart from each other. Otherwise I am excited to move my levels forward.' ,

      'Whenever you die in the game you start completely over again. And after each game an advertisement plays. Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It\'s a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It\'s very competitive!!! I swear my husband can\'t beat my score no one has lol',
       'It\'s good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it\'s my opinion so don\'t get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don\'t have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn\'t play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀',
       'It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone\'s or tablets I find it hard to control I don\'t know if anyone else thinks so but that\'s my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company',
       'Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface',
       'start to crash often when playing online. i think it need some sounds or music. playing silent for long time feels like going stupid after long time played. since it so addictive . keep repeating boring play but keeps ppl playing. is fun though, but I think everyone need to keep control how much time played. can\'t believe I can play for like hours haha. don\'t know why my Nick name don\'t show anymore. usually is \'eat uuu\'. but shows as nothing ____ now.',
       'Game lags way to much. I can\'t enjoy it at all. It\'s a waste of an app. You guys really need to fix it. To many people like playing but the lagging has got to stop so the game can be enjoyed. If this game coast two pennies, I wouldn\'t by it. I am uninstalling this game for the 2nd time. Never again. Sucks, cuz I really like playing without the technical difficulties' ,

Additional to that i saw therr locked 200 diamonds i clicked one of that and all my 420 diamonds gone and onlu 220 diamonds left and its showing me 2 big circle white and pink.. that\'s not fair....',
       'Found a game called "Infinite Balls" on my friend\'s iPhone, we loved it. This is the best Android alternative we could find, but it\'s not quite as satisfying. Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls. Would be nice to turn off the help lines, too.',
       'I found a bug. If u are playing offline and game is over, you choose to watch video ad while internet is off, it gives u the life anyways. Without watching ad. May b your developera forgot to call the reward video function on that UI\'s onclick () 😂. Overall a nice gameplay',
       'This game is fantastically addicting. Would love some extra ability to fine tune shots with micro adjustments, maybe as a power-up. Also, saveable instant replays would be super cool.',

      'Angry Birds used to be a game you could just tap on and play to your heart\'s content.  Now it\'s gone fee-to-pay (sic) -- you can read the other reviews to see how well that has been received.   Not well is an understatement.  I\'d say more, but you\'ll have to gain 50 more stars to read each new paragraph.  Meanwhile, watch these unskippable half-minute-long ads.',
       'Between ads completely over running gameplay and the new requirement of having to earn stars to proceed, Rovio continues to run this once great game into the ground. **Update** game now freezes randomly requiring a force close. This is beyond ridiculous. I HATE what this franchise has become. Rovio should be ashamed.',
       'Too many ads way too often. I get a few sponsored ads help keep apps free or inexpensive but the frequency here makes the app annoyingly unuseable. Sponsors need to realise that the more we consumers are harassed with unwanted advertising, the LESS we will be interested in their product. I outright boycott or blacklist such companies and products.',
       'I loved the mighty league ... until it forced an update that caused a glitch, and all of a sudden I was back in the Feather league --- and no matter what I did, I couldn\'t get out of it. I waited for update after update --- but to no avail. I was stuck. Not so fun anymore. So I uninstalled and reinstalled --- and lost over 13,000 points.  But at least I got to play again. I built my way back up... only to have it glitch again, sending me back to the Feather league. More frustrating than fun #Fail',
       'This is nolstaga.  I totally  love this game and rovio keep on doing what you are doing wow this new profile is kinda trippy.  Aslo my boys wow yall changed the name and an added classic.  Hmm good wow y\'all changed the layout and the amount of stars it really never bothered me  that Much.  But thanks anyway.  Anyway I earned the badge that said pop me/them.  Then I played a level I noticed that      rip.     the pig said pop them.  I was like WHATTTTTT I wondered what they used to say.  I thought it was something thing like Omelet it sounded like it.  Which would be totally Fugded up cuz you know the Eggs.  When I  imagine them saying pop them its kinda creepy and scary and weird. Anyway thanks rovio I totally love this Franchise/series.',
       'This game used to be awesome, sadly I have just removed it due to the star issue. I used to be able to play for fun, however, due to the its current standing, one MUST achieve three stars in each level in order to play other levels. Madness! Great job for taking the fun out of a game!' ,

And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I\'ve got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.',
       'A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it\'s a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you\'ve done them and reached level 10 on both, there\'s really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.',
       'It\'s a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the \'colony\' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you',
       'Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON\'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!',
       'Well I was only shown this game last Friday and by today (Wednesday) I have reached level 10 on earth and Mars, both my rockets are fully upgraded. Nothing to do now, I thought you would be able to set up buildings and colonies and keep jumping to different planets. But no. If it\'s enjoyable but over quick, nothing more to it after you you level 10. Can keep taking astronauts up but to what end? You don\'t go no further, they make you money but you\'re maxed out on spending anyway. Shame, concave been really good',
       'A Ads. You get most of your coins by watching ads. So if you want to level up then be prepared to spend some time watching ads. Also an ad will pop up in the middle of the actual gameplay and throw off your rhythm. Gameplay lasts MAYBE 10 seconds, why they need to stick an add in there beats me. Good control,concept,gameplay. Simple and fun' ,

       'Inconsistencies in the answers the accept as correct.. they will accept the answer "A large cat" for A - Type of Animal but not "Status Quo" for Q - Band or Solo Artist Names.. found this issue on numerous occasions some answers even more blantantly correct than the examples I have given.. here\'s one for example asked for "Australian Sports Teams" so I inputted Canberra this was given as an incorrect answer even though Canberra has a football team named Canberra.',
       'Great game but the amount of times that the wheel lands on Q, X and Z makes me think it isn\'t  random.   By having to constantly respin, it\'s a ploy to use up your coins and make you buy more!',
       'Really unfair scoring. I typed George Washington and it gives me no credit and my opponent typed the exact same thing and he not only gets full credit but he gets points for being a rare answer. Fun game when it\'s not shorting you.',
       'The game is great but the ads are overwhelmingly terrible. They\'re the kind of ads that have fake "X" buttons that lead you to believe that you\'re closing the ad, but in reality you\'ve just opened their page on the app store or it\'s tried to download adware',
       'It was OK at first. I guess its not for me. The graphics are laggy, words used to complete sentences don\'t make sense. I mean, "I believe in unibrows" is ridiculous but "I lost my lingerine" is pretty realistic, is it not?! Nothing\'s wrong its just... boring.' ,

      'Hey RobTop, the game is ok, but there is one issue. im used to playing geometry dash with my samsung chromebook 3 (it doesn\'t have touchscreen) and when i press the spacebar on my computer (this is the same issue on geometry dash lite and subzero) it doesn\'t let me jump. And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.',
       'Got all the way to the end,  and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow,  and ended up having to restart all of the levels,  fix this,  it doesn\'t happen with the other geometry dash games,  just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted...  Fix then 5 stars',
       'This is really hard. I can\'t buy the full game as I am only 9, but I think I am missing out on a lot. Please add check points to normal mode as some levels are basically impossible',
       'This game stress me out but the next day when I play it I beat the lv in one go and fills my heart up with joy! So what if the control\'s are sensitive? I know they are.. but if you take a day and give it another go you know what happens and you do great!',
       'I love this game just...can you fix one glitch? On the final level final area the wave is bugged ...when I tap it goes down by itself! Can you please fix it? I was trying over 3 hours to make it but I can\' t because of the glitch :( Please fix it.',
       'When I heard that this was out, I rushed to the Play Store, freed up my storage and installed this app. This is fantastic, as I had been craving for 2.1. I finally have a little sneak peek, although…                                           A) No Spider in main levels (Challenge excused) B) Ads…ugh                                                        C) No Account Loading (2.1 fixed)                                      D) Levels too easy and short                               It’s still great!' ,

       'It\'s a great game and a virtual version of fifa 18. You will enjoy it as you are guaranteed good players. It\'s not just about the draft you can open packs and trade duplicates.',
       'I think it\'s a very fun game. But only thing I would like to see is maybe a market where you could put up duplicates for a price rather than having to trade with 25 million people just to find someone who is willing to buy. It kinda gets annoying when you\'re trying to sell some duplicates and all you find are cheap people who waste time. Also, there should be more packs being released because of how many cards there are. It\'s just too hard to find a card you\'re looking for, through trading. Secondly, if the market idea doesn\'t work there should be an option in which you can talk with the trader and/or be able to set a price of the duplicate you\'re trying to sell rather than wait for people to make unreasonable offers.' ,

There\'s one Major issue I have with the game and it is the constant notification to link Facebook with the game, which of course also has some great rewards locked behind it as well. :P I don\'t have a Facebook profile and it\'s incredibly unfortunate that there\'s no other alternative to choose (especially when there\'s plenty to choose from these days) Those are the reasons why I rate only three stars.',

       'It\'s an ok game. Not what i thought it would be.  Actions take a lot of energy and do not recoup quickly. Rewards arent the greatest.',

      'Honestly I think it\'s amazing that they sell this game for free because it is one of the best games I\'ve ever played in my life. It doesn\'t take any internet and the animals in details so good and the graphics. If you\'re ever bored you should download this game and play it all the time.',
       'Sometimes it feels like the difficulty of the levels is way off. Levels labeled "hard" or "super hard" are many times much easier than standard levels. I do enjoy the amount of unlimited lives given, and the speed at which lives are replenished, however. Overall, a good time-passer',
       'I adore this game. However, I have had 7 gold bars for over a year and every time I win a level that awards lots of gold bars the game tells me my bank is full... even though everything costs at least 9 gold bars. According to my math I should have over 100 bars. I would settle for two at this point.',
       'Highly addictive. I love this game but there is one fault that it doesn\'t allow your device to enter sleep mode. I have ruined 2 phone screens with burnt in images because of this. I would fall asleep playing the game and when I wake up it\'s still on the screen.  I also don\'t understand why the special games are not offered on the Facebook game.',
       'Love it love it love it....1/218..this is still one of 3 of my favorite games but... you have this golden piggy who collects gold bars.. i have filled it several times but then i find out you want me to pay for them after winning them... NOT HAPPY...',
       '2/10/18 update: I still love this game, but the latest update for mobile crashes all the time. Hit the Play button, crashes. Hit the Retry button, crashes. Sometimes just loading the game, it crashes.  Please fix; this is my favorite game and my first go-to when I have free time.' ,

      'The mini golf is great! I\'ve had a ton of fun playing and you don\'t need the in app purchases to win as long as you\'re meticulous with your shots. The ads are a necessary evil I guess. My only big complaint is that lining up shots with the button controlls. They need to have some sort of sensitivity changer so that shots can be fine tuned. All in all though, great game! Good job.',
       'Worst challenges ever, setup terribly to make it harder to win, always end up in a corner or another bad angle. Ball speed is so touchy, the smallest amount makes it from "to slow" to "over shot", really needs to have better increments.. usually it takes a while for me to dislike a game but this one had me agrivated pretty quick.',
       'I think the game was terrible.  When you take a shot on target it rebounded up and missed the whole  Also I think they could in prove by making the controls better',
       'Stupid rule set. I got a birdie and so did the other player, yet they won and I lost. Makes no sense, fix your game',
       'Well, I can\'t really say.  I can\'t open it on my Nook. It keeps crashing.',
       'This is really good game and I would recommend getting it the only bad thing about it is that it tends to be very slow on trying to turn the controls when you want to point the ball a different direction' ,

      'Good Game a bit challanging, easy control , Good to play it',
       'Game is good but sometimes the level of ads get silly. Answer a phone call in the middle of a game and you have to see an ad, often messing up one shot in the process.  Also game gets hung when displaying ads.  Over all good but needs improvement on stability and toning down ads a bit to earn better rating.',
       'The game is a good time waster & I find myself playing it quite often.  However I always leave the game feeling frustrated at levels that cannot be completed without using coins. I have read many other reviews saying the same & responses from llyon saying all colours are random. If that is the case then I need to have a go on the lottery because I can predict what colours are coming up towards the end of the levels & they are always repeat colours of those that cannot finish the level.  Of all the bubble shot style games I\'ve tried this is my favourite but just let down by this small annoyance. On top of this the frequency & length of the ads is getting ridiculous. I fully appreciate that these games & developers require income from ads but they are actually dominating the app now.',
       '2/15/18. In reply to Developers response; As I stated in my original review, I DO understand the need for adds, but this game not o my have ads in between levels and to earn bonus bubbles & level helpers, it has ads after before & everything.  And giving a reply that players can get ad free play by buying the premium play is not a good business reply. Every player now a days knows that we can no longer play FREE uninterrupted games, we have to PAY for everything. As the apps say, the download is free, but we all know that the play is not.  Thank you for at least responding to my review. Most developers no longer address their negative reviews so they can improve the game experience. ******************* The game itself is fun and challenging at times, especially when it gives a colored bubble to shoot, but none of the bubbles in the puzzle match.  The biggest negative is the ads. I understand the need for adds, but to have ads immediately after a level is won and then again after you click next and the 30 second ads when additional shooting bubbles are requested is a bit extreme. It\'s a level win excitement kill.  I don\'t mind a few ads, but the amount in this game is to the point where it\'s borderline excessive.',
       'Good game but the advertising is just a bit too much. I know it pays for the game but so many 30 second long adverts is overdoing it. There is one for Wishes that is particularly annoying.',
       'It has stopped working. Please do something. Its really amazing and the best bubble shooting app. I was on 2072 or around that. I do not want to reset it. I am playing it for a year. Please fix it in such way it does not needs to be reseted. Please. Fix and reply to this comment.' ,

      'Great, addictive game! However, real fast, I was wondering how the free box worked. I always hope for something real good but ALWAYS end up with either raw materials or ONE coin. Now don\'t get me wrong, I LOVE getting free stuff, it just seems like the "spinner" purposefully chooses raw materials. Like, it\'s not random like it seems; it never chooses anything close to a weapon! In any case, I cannot play this game enough, very very fun!',
       'Honestly ive been waiting for close to 2 months. This game was like crack for me until the update left me no nice place, no hard earned stuff. I dont mind starting from the bottom again but at least give me some perks. This game is worth every cent and time. But until i get my account back or my stuff back im leaving 2 stars when really this game should be 5 stars all the time. I wont be playing this game til then. Thanks for the good times.',
       'The game doesn\'t load!!! 1.) There\'s nothing wrong with my internet connection! I don\'t have any problems playing RIFT, LOTRO, Neverwinter, Aura Kingdom, Allods Online, etc. or any of my other Google Play apps on my internet connection! 2.) Using Task Manager doesn\'t work! 3.) My device has way more than 200 MB of free space on it! 4.) I haven\'t been able to play for 14 days now!!! 5.) Jurassic Survival looks more promising since there are no loading problems!!!! >:(',
       '**UPDATE** Was an awesome game. Could use a few more perks (ie. Weapons and hard to get items) in drop boxes and yellow zones.Now the down side is if you die in a level your last position is no longer there to try and recoup some of your items. Players killing you as you open trunks in inventory screen. With that I think I am done with this game. Oh ya and the free spin box...give random prizes instead of coins and rope. People will get really into it if perks are awesome.',
       'I love the game. It\'s awesome. But I do have a few questions. Why are the bunker cards so extremely difficult to find? I\'ve been looking for days killing every zombie possible and looking through every crate without finding the cards. Also. Why isn\'t there a disclaimer that says if you die in the game, everything you purchased will be lost? I think that would be extremely necessary so no one over spends their money. Other than that, absolutely smooth running, fantastic graphics, and realistic deaths. I love every aspect except I can\'t find these darn bunker key cards.',
       'Absolute love the game and would\'ve gave a better review but version 1.7.6 and 1.7.7 won\'t work. It keeps saying "connection lost... It seems you lost connection to one of our game servers. Restart the game to proceed" over and over again ever since the 1.7.6 game update. If they fix it I will be updating my review to 5 stars because it is one of my favorite games' ,

      'Why in the f**k does this require an internet connection. Fallout shelter is the same thing but doesn\'t need internet. Sure you can use internet for purchases and rewards but it definitely should not be required. Please consider making this offline compatible and I will change my review to 5 stars and a positive actual review of the game. Thank you.',
       'Definitely worth downloading and trying out.. It\'s just like fallout shelter but a little more. You can do a story line and attack other players rather then just sending people out and HOPING to get something good. It\'s a little slow at first but it\'s really quite alot of fun and the creators actually listen to its players.',
       'AWESOME GAME! Time killer, infact it takes all your time away from you. Relationships will suffer due to this game, marriages will fail, you will forget to shower. I\'ve been married 24 years, or should I say I was married 24 years, Theresa left me today, and she took the kids. I lost my job at the firm, but who cares! My castle is level 50, all my subjects rejoice at hearing the sound of my voice! I am a good king! Being a loving father and husband is for chumps, why take care of your family when you can be absorbed in a beautiful fantastic world of orcs and wizards and princesses. I could probably just watch Lord of the Rings but that is fake, this game is real my subjects! REAL!!!',
       'Good game but when your rank gets high all of a sudden most enemies are too powerful. Then it takes forever to gear up. Solution is to deliberately lose and lower your rank. Not good. Also you will find yourself with a lot of gear after you played a while. Would be nice to able to sort it, not only for your different warriors but also all the production gear. Would be good to be able to more easily compare gear in your stash and what your inhabitants are wearing. It\'s a bit messy now.',
       'Overall a great game, there\'s one feature though that I feel lets this game down. Just the small fact that a father can copulate with his daughter, then again with their inbred child if you so wish. I currently have 4 generations of inbred mutants running my castle, if anything the extra fingers actually help with certain tasks such as cleaning. Do you happen to have a designer working on this with the surname Fritzl?',
       'Deceptive in game offers.   Be careful of what you think you are buying.  I purchased a limited time offer to instantly increase the level of my barracks, vault and training room but after paying found out only my training room was upgraded with the purchase.  When I notified the game support of my findings they refused to upgrade my barracks and vault and are refusing to refund me my payment stating that I could have clicked some sort of link with some fine print stating upgraded rooms will not be upgraded by the purchase.

      'This now a prize example of a freemium game that needs a premium option. I would gladly pay £10 as a one off purchase to do away with the need to say for lives. In the past games worthy of a one-off fee would offer it and this issue such game that should consider it. I will never pay for any in app purchases on any game and I am sure I am not alone. This has 5* written all over it but the long wait times and exorbitant cost of energy replenishing means this doesn\'t get anything higher than average.',
       'Loved the game but if the life was free this waiting for minutes to play again is not cool. Also noticed if you have to score more than 1 goal and you make a mistake you have to start from the same goal you already scored. If we can get the requirements before each challenge that would make it much more fun otherwise I love this game a lot keep updating for more seasons. Thank you. I am on Level 560 with 1257 stars I am awaiting Season 29. If you can also create a full football game with same concept. This is a Great game!!! Thank you developers keep developing Great games like these!!!',
       'Wonderful! Game by first touch   But I can\'t wait till the hearts 💚 are filled!  So Reduce the time. Improve this game more and more and create a new exciting games.  I have finished 390 levels. And I have a doubt what is the last level and what happens after it? All the best for ur future and I\'m a biiiiiiig fans of u guys!!  Hands off',
       'SCORE  HERO RULES This game is so sick dudes. It so cool that this gives us idea that how to play soccer or football. Gameplay is so smooth . They players show us some epic skills . It has an commentary. The worst part was the heart. I can\'t wait till it get refilled ❤❤❤❤❤ this. Graphics are great . Just reduce the time of refilling the energy . Overall this game cool. Thanks for the game FTG.',
       'Most irritating game plan.  Have any one ever seen in real game that if a player miss a goal then all the previous goals are cancelled? But in this game such thing is happening. You should not cancel all the goals scored only for a miss or loss of a ball. Goals should be saved and to be started from where it stopped for missing a goal or losing a ball. Developer should take it into his consideration.',
       'I am crazy about this game, I cant stop playing. Real time killer. The only problem i have is the fact that we get rewarded with credit not that often and its very little compared to cost of the additional upgrade options of the hero player. Finally the game can be very frustrating at times as the cpu makes unneccesary and stupid foot mistakes leading to start all over again with that level. Thanks' ,

      'I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there\'s only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can\'t beat them! Keep making more awesome games!',
       'I can\'t help but love a mobile game that doesn\'t constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it\'s tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.',
       'I understand that people want their games to be entartaining. But i dont understand why there is a thing that downgrades your item upon trying to upgrade it. I have soent the last 3 hours trying to upgrade my helm to lvl 15. Guess where it is now, On goddamn lvl 11. I have spent less time grinding mounts in wow than getting my gear to lvl 15. Stupidest thing ever. One tip. Play the campagin lvls to lvl 40. Then dont do campagin at all and run hell for gold and xp. Repeqt to lvl 80 and then get rekt by the stupid item upgrade system.',
       'This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn\'t always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing',
       'I really like the game. But there\'s one thing that annoys me: when I don\'t play this game for a few hours and then I do another battle in dungeon, the game crashes after killing last monster in that battle.  I found out that if I switch on mobile data it works. So I wanted to asked why is that. EDIT: now all works just fine. 5 stars',
       'Excellent game, can\'t wait for a new map. There isn\'t any tutorials but it\'s quite a simple and fun game, you will catch on quick just be patient. Hope to see new maps soon don\'t make it too easy on us high levels now : )' ,

      'This is the best game in the world. srsly if this was the only game on my ipad then i will be happy. As soon as you get onto the game you just cant put it down. The only down side is that the spins cost alot of coins and those coins can be hard to earn. So 4.5 stars i would rate it is that was a option but its not so i rate it a a big fat 5',
       'this game is the bomb. it is stupid that they asked you is this game beautiful, of course not, people die, and crack their necks, backs, and shoulder blades. This game all in all soooooooo fun and you should totally get it. just say no if you want to write a reaport on this game because it will ask you is this game is beautiful which it is not. GOOD LUCK, good  night, new york city. at late night talk show with stephen colebert......jk',
       'Would rate give starts, but the amount of ads is absolutely ridiculous. I\'m actually thinking about uninstalling please fix that. I know you want players to pay but in all actuality, it\'s quite stupid. Anyway, I do believe the game is quite fun',
       'I  am still going to keep this game but it definitely need a new update like Flip Master which is way better. On Flip Master you can upgrade your characters  So they are better and have more skill but on here they stay the same. The last time I got the game it was fun but this time the characters are stiff and you can hardly do any flips. Definitely keeping Flip Master as my favourite!  Fun game for people who: Want to mess around Need a game that doesn\'t take to much skill Need a game to to pass five minutes  Everyone who likes this game should definitely get Flip Master because overall it is so much better! Hope my advice helped for future updates',
       'Whatever they did last update broke the game for me, this is why I never buy anything in these games. No way to contact anyone to resolve any problems.  Game gets boring anyway',
       'Its a good game however there isnt a very clear plot to the game therefore it doesnt hook the player. Others may argue thaat the game is just meant to be  a bit of fun and there isnt supposed to be a clear storyline however to me i feel like its a bit boring. Anyway its a good game i would recomend it to my friends' ,

       'Really good game to sit and relax but would be good if the balls could go faster than 2x speed. If you have high points then it takes a while for every turn to watch them bounce around.',
       'Great game, great time burner. Absolute !@#$ with the choice of skins for your balls, it doesn\'t let you view them and clicking on it instantly buys it. I\'ve been lucky with the two I\'ve bought but still an awful design.',
       'Would be better if it played in the background if I come out of it as lots of balls take a long time to bounce. Had a couple of incidents. Got to 365 then ball bounced so slow after 10 mins it stopped bouncing and i was left with only the block it was sat on left on the screen so would have been a check point :-( so I had no choice bit to restart and now it\'s bouncing along the bottom line of the screen at 285 so going to have to restart again. Gutted. Maybe a nudge function for if this happens would be handy. Love the game tho :-)',
       'Downloaded this game just to kill some time. It was fun at first but then once I started to play the challenge mode it would not let me see the whole screen during some challenges. So there is no way to win at the challenges that require you finish in a limited number of moves.' ,

      'Good game however, once you\'ve taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world\'s and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.',
       'Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.',
       'Very simple. Gives me a lot of nostalgia. Two things though, it seriously needs music maybe some Celtic tunes or shanties. And secondly it needs more stuff to do. When I first saw a whale I was excited about doing some whaling but nope. The whales do absolutely nothing. Maybe even some treasure hunting puzzles or something. Good game just needs a little more content.',
       'Awesome game! Two things: please do something about the controls, they feel very poor quality. Even addig a left and a right arrow would be more comfortable for me.. Second is content. This game is huuuuge. But I\'m so addicted I managed to conquer all the islands by now, so I really want more challenges. Thanks for the awesome game, keep up the good work!',
       'Amazing game, graphics, and animations. My one wish is for an actual circle pad for movement because I have quite large fingers and I can\'t see what I\'m doing/ what\'s going on. Also would like maybe different routes to go on with boats: better damage but lower turning, faster but less health etc...',
       'This game together with Clash Of Clans are the best games I have ever played. It\'s addictive and fun but there\'s a lack of content. I completed the game and I don\'t know what to do now. I would really love it have my progress saved in the cloud and have more content added to the game. This game has perennial!' ,

      'Great game if you wanna run low graphics for a smoother gameplay on your phone. 40 instead of 100 is great for mobile games as well. Maybe make the controls a tad bit larger for default size. Otherwise really fun. Maybe add a first person mode? Unless I haven\'t found out how to haha. Great game. I seemed to like this one out of all the others tbh.',
       'Good game, but after the last update the game game is riddled with bugs and glitches, making the game next to unplayable. Will often come up with queue error and kick me from the game and the screen constantly freezes. I can move, but I can\'t pick anything up and my teammate position is also frozen. Pls fix or I will uninstall. Also, you got rid of the aim button which sucks. Was way better before the update. You\'ve ruined the game for me😭😭😭',
       'One of my favorite games at the beginning.. Ever since the Last 2updates Been facing Problems almost every single Game.Can only run and open Doors can\'t Pick any Weapons.. Sucks I hope y\'all Fix This or Its Time to uninstall this',
       'Well I love the potential. Has a lot of bugs. Dual or quad mode doesn\'t work and overall it takes too long to wait. I waited 10 minutes for quad and then it just stopped and put me back to choosing game modes. I think thi s game can be the best if it had more work put into it.',
       'This game is good and very challenging but i dont like the new update. My overall Stats have stopped working and im still dyeing even when im in circle and the aim button needs to come back it is so hard to play without it.  But overall a good game it just needs a few adjustments.',
       'Okay, why are servers lagging lately? I got killed multiple times because of that! And the glitch where you can\'t pick up items and get damage in safe zone as well, glitches have returned and fix them plz. Also, bring back aim sight! Edit: Ugh, how many times do I need to die because my auto aim didn\'t activate and enemy one did? Bring back aim button, please!' ,

      'So nearly perfect. I tried several and they all had too many ads... some (others) with startling loud sounds that you couldn\'t turn off! Very upsetting! THIS game, however, has only ONE ad at the start of each game, and allows you to mute the sound "once" for all future ads. It\'s simple to click the ad off before the game commences. *wink* The background is lovely and the graphics are wonderful! So relaxing. The happy little "card dance" animation after each win is nice, as well. Thank You!',
       'I grew up with all I had to do so day long was teach myself how to play Solitaire.  It\'s not like I didn\'t have friends but was bored with the ones I had to play with.  I think the game is very realistic.  And completely challenging.',
       'I usually don\'t play games on my phone and this is the first one that I did play electronically (I usually play solitare the " old fashioned " way, lol, with a deck of cards) but I\'ll have to admit that I Iike it much much more than I expected to....I enjoyed playing!',
       'I\'d really give it a 4.5 - plays smoothly and easily, ads are expected in a free game and these are easily disposed of.  The only downside for me is the "wins" are too frequent - not realistic.',
       'Is there a way to get rid of ads? I\'d even pay a couple dollars to rid of them. I\'d give this app a 5 if it had a way to get rid of all the ads. They are very annoying and you don\'t enjoy the game that much then.',
       'For some Unknown reason Queens Game~Solitaire Won\'t Work On My Tablet Any Longer, And THAT Was My Favorite Version Of This FUN, ADDICTIVE & RELAXING GAME.  That being said, out of Many, MANY Other Versions I Tried Out Recently, I like this the most!  What it Would Take To GIVE IT THAT ONE OTHER ⭐WOULD BE TO ADD "THE MAGIC WAND" TO THE GAME!  I Miss That Cool, Game Winning Feature. A few more SUPER COOL THEMES Would Also Be Needed... there are some nice backgrounds, but most of them are just plain, solid colors, which to ME is kind of Boring.  One last thing is How SLOW The Auto~Collect Feature runs at the end of a winning game~ Sure, it\'s a matter of a few seconds but why not Pick Up The Pace~ It Seems Like FOREVER When You\'re Sitting There  & Watching, Waiting For The Next Hand To Be Dealt!  Maybe it\'s Just ME!?  HOWEVER,  WHEN I NEED TO PLAY~ WHEN I GOTTA HAVE A FEW GAMES IN ORDER TO CLEAR MY MIND & RELAX... THIS GAME IS WHERE I AM & I\'M THANKFUL THAT I FOUND IT!  Thanks To The Developers!' ,

      'There are ads every time you load something new as a level loads, again right after that. which is mentioned in multiple reviews. The game crashes every few levels and the Levels are now designed to be use the power ups for which you will end up paying for more. The first one was such a great game and some of these are enjoyable,  if you have the patience to wait for them.',
       'Its very nice to play. But........there is a gate where they force to get 3 keys by either watching advertisments or asking facebook .   And the worst paet is that u can only watch ones a day which makes 3 daysssss.. Thats what i hate.',
       'The ads are ridiculous. It crashes after some levels. I loved wheres my water 1 because I purchased it. Wish that was an option with this one. I\'ll probably uninstall and look for something else',
       'Ok I beat it but it was to many ads so many that after every level it would go to the home screen but im just glad they finally make the next level free i remember a lot of complaints on that also i was like waiting at the end to do some type of celebration but i dont know if i should uninstall it or like is something suppose to happen',
       'Much like the first game, it\'s fun but the bombardment of ads and the inability to progress without either sitting through tons of them or buying keys is honestly is a disgusting slap on the face. I\'d honestly rather just buy the game outright.',
       'Omg because I can\'t save this app to ANYTHING I\'ve lost all my progress because my phone broke. And I\'ve spent alot of money on this. Why cant u ppl add google or adding facebook to save progress. What a waste. Fix it and I\'ll consider going back and spending more money to get ahead' ,

      'Graphics are awesome, but the game itself is very monotonous. You can fall asleep waiting for something to change and make it more exciting. When a change such as an added bonus does come (bomb or a rainbow bubble) you realize that it wasn\'t worth the 20 or 30 levels you just wasted your time on. Progressive enticing events need to happen more quickly.',
       'On level 19 I scored three stars bit it shows only two. Aside from that, no other complaints... YET. I will say thank you, though, for not aggressively pushing ads, pushing to pay to extend the aim line. So far, its amusing😁',
       'I like that you don\'t have to pay for the Assistance or no stuff on the game to help you advance like the Hammers the ball that matches any color different stuff like that you just got to watch the ads which is fine with me at least it doesn\'t cost you a fortune to play I like the color on the graphics are very bright and colorful and good for children to play no violent content to it whatsoever great game for everyone across the board',
       'This is a really fun game but my  my concerns are that when I have no balls left, for me it doesn\'t have the option to play a video to earn more but for my brother it does therefore it makes me start all over again. The other concern is that when I use a bomb for the chest it takes away a ball for example I have 12 balls when I use the bomb from the chest, I get 11 balls left which it doesn\'t do that for my brother. I hope you can fix this.',
       'I like it other then the fact of every time I got to shoot the ball goes slightly left or right not exactly where I want it. Might be my screen sensitivity?  Other then that I dig it!',
       'It\'s the best! But there are a bit too many ads, but the thing I like about the ads that they are shorter than most ads.' ,

      'Graphics were generic until now for x86 devices. Thanks for that update. And that moving data to sd card, it is really appreciable since now a days even 32 gb  not sufficient. Hope other game developers get inspiration from this. And downloading just updated part is also an improvement instead of downloading whole data again. 4 stars because this game just wont allow to play older version once it finds out new version is present.',
       'Best driving and racing game on the net. There is so much you can do, it not just " drive a car on a track and try to win", in this game you can choose your path on the track, perform unbelievable stunts and trick\'s, take out other players and cars.  The game play is absolutely great and the graphics are f***#&@ awesome, the only step to fallow in the graphics is realistic and their close to that now, love the game, the only thing I would change is I would make it easier to get car\'s, now the bikes and car packs instead of having to work really hard to get them or spend a lot of real money, granted the real money goes to development of the graphics and game, I would like to be able to get the car and bike packs a little bit easier. Definitely a winner, 🤩',
       'Asphalt 8 airborne is a very exciting game to play. The addition of bikes is mind blowing. Wish all time limited events could be on mobile data rather than wifi. Thumbs up gameloft for an exciting game. After the recent update of this app it keeps crashing with a pop-up message "unfortunately asphalt 8 has stopped working". Please fix this issue.',
       'I\'m addicted to this game, I love it. And with this new story mode update  I\'ve got more excited, I won all the starting races and now waiting for the refill. Only one thing that is negative, it is the upgrades are too much expensive and takes a huge time to gather coins versus the escalating events and this is depressing. I hope that game developers will fix this problem and make it fair enough.',
       'They fixed commercial black screen bug. Now i can play normal again. Wish longer time for events and R&D, because of work i dont have enough time to play. Money rewards sucks. You cant buy cheapest part from one 24h event. If you spend real money, you are way above evryone else. Also, slow cars are useless. There must be better way for multiplayer ranking.',
       'As racing games go, this is probably the best. The graphics, sound, gameplay are excellent. Race solo, against friends or the world. The variety of ways to race is big. The selection of cars and now bikes, keeps getting bigger. The only down side is buying something from the shop or on offer. I purchased a special offer and never got it. They got my money, I never got the goods. Trying to get in contact with them is a joke. All replies to my emails were automated responses telling me to do the same thing over and over again.' ,

      'This game is perfect for anyone who loves magic, fantasy, collecting, and a whole new level of adorable! Dragonvale takes everything to the next level! I highly recommend it, as it is a amazing game, my most played, and I hope everyone else enjoys it just as much as I do. Five stars! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Edit 2: I was re-organizing my islands by Element the other day, and I had just finished the Plant Island. I put down a Oversized Oak Tree, and immediately, a image flashed through my mind: a young girl, sitting on a branch of the oak tree, a book in one hand, a baby Plant dragon sitting next to her. Stretched out in front of them was my Plant Island, the dragons freely soaring, the other islands in the distance. And that sparked a inspiration in my head. I just wanted to ask; can I write a Dragonvale book, which takes place at my park? Please let me know !  :)',
       'When I first had it it was super fun. Then I saw a game I wanted so I deleted it I did that before and got it back I could log into facebook and go to my old island. But this time I could not. I was so far and looking forward to seeimg my dragons but it did not let me go to my old island. It left me im tears that I had to do what I did all over again. So I deleted this stupid game and gave this. If I could rate 0 I would',
       'its ok, and you might think you cant li e without it, but trust me.... after a while year of playing, which is what i have waited to wrote this review, the game play becomes very repetitive. sure try it out, its fun, but not something for the rest of your life. dont put money into it, you will regret ir later.',
       'After Gardenias update i was good. Then yesterday 02/08/18 it wont even fully load up. It says it had trouble downloading a file. I tried the classic restart of device - didnt work. So I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I can play through the tutorial on a new park but attempting to load my level 102 park I get the same download message. I play on android. Please fix this. I havent missed a day of play since you implemented the daily rewards.',
       'I love this game but all of a sudden this morning I can not start the game. It says it can not download a required file. I tried on two different devices and got that message on both. My game is level 73, so I have been playing for awhile and this is the first problem I have had. Please help!',
       'Amazing, however I wish there was a way to save you island. I had such a big and awesome set up, but when I got my new phone I couldn\'t get it back. Please fix this, use you Google account or something, but I hate having to keep redoing my island.' ,

      'I hate this game cause one, you can\'t even change the decorations or visitors. Two, you can\'t even get coins for completing a level and the daily wheel is rigged cause you can\'t get anything good. Three, if you watch a video for a reward or life, it never gives you anything. And four, they don\'t give you enough moves for each level, there are too many ads and everything\'s so overpriced. Hate this bullcrap game😡',
       'A great game, but WAAAAY  too many ads. Its the same thing after each level: AN AD. The game is fun, but its hard to enjoy when you\'re watching ads every second. And Im getting the same ads over and over! I want to rate five stars, I really do, but I cant if there\'s going to be this many ads in a game I think everyone would enjoy. 💛💛💛💛♡ (( pretend the hearts are stars )) I\'ll download the game again once I see less ads in your games, like My Talking Angela, which also has way too many ads. Please take this into consideration! Thank you!',
       'The game was great until they put the ads on there, there are too many and 90% of the time I try to "x" out of one, it takes me to the play store anyway, and the game freezes a lot more now. It\'s also frustrating you can\'t alter the decorations. Game needs some improvements, and I hope they address them because it\'s quite fun to play.',
       'This game would be a whole lot of fun IF there weren\'t so many ads! My niece is not patient enough to wait for stupid ads to finish, and u can\'t play the game until the ad is finished! Very disappointed!',
       'Love this game. Super fun but how do you get rid of ads? I paid for coins yet i still have ads. This is highly annoying especially if i can\'t skip them. Still love the game just not the ads :(',
       'Hate this game... been stuck on this one level...there is no way to win it... I had 12 free lives...used them all and still didn\'t pass the level...stressing me out..time to delete game...NOT PLAYING ANYMORE 😠' ,

      'Some things are hidden in such a place makes it hard on note 8 due to curved screen. Level 89 doesn\'t work, as well as other levels where touching the same place over and over and over might get something to work.  Most puzzles are extremely easy,  it\'s just a matter of the game not working.',
       'Got stuck playing til lvl 40 before I realized an hour had past, and I only came to the play store looking for sonic 3, but this looked interesting listed under "recomended." Great recommendation.',
       'Some levels are straight forward. Others you just have to skip because there\'s no logic or something is missing. Could be good with some type of help if you get stuck rather than just skipping an entire level.',
       'Not responsive to most touches. I finally got a cheat only to realize it was the game.  Ads were not frequent but had a strobe light going off (health issues) and would not turn off. Had to close out of the game every time so I just quit playing. Typo many similar more challenging games out there to try and work with this one.',
       'Items don\'t move when they are supposed to therefore making it impossible to complete each task. It is very frustrating because the game would be more fun. It would make it more enjoyable with at least 1 or 2 hints.',
       'I found it boring. A character in the game tells you what to do, where to find the key etc and you do it, then you move a level up. How is that exciting? But millions of people do, so go figure.' ,

      'Sadly have to rate the app with 1*  I did 3 10x summons and got nothiing but 3 stars. It says you have a chance at a 5 star hero so id actually like a chance. And since I can get a 5 star, I can\'t win raids. Would love it if the game devs actually made the game fair',
       'Very fun, combines traditional match 3 gameplay with base building, character collection and deck building mechanics. Have not hit the "now you must buy things to advance" wall yet, but unclear if that exists. Like Candy Crush plus Lords Mobile plus any other collectible card/character deck builder game. Worth a look.',
       'Raid system sucks. Use up all of my resources on reroll to find an opponent I can actually beat. Still lose to people with 4&5 star heroes at same team power. Opponent heroes attack very quickly, I\'ve had raid where 4 or 5 attack in the same turn and just get decimated when they are going to attack again in the next turn or two. Plus the risk and reward are very uneven, win 10 trophies and lose 50?',
       'So you can put the game on autoplay pilot and let it play itself. It requires no skill and their business model relies on you rolling the dice poorly so that you have to buy things instead w real cash. Obnoxiously long tutorial when you first start the game that you\'re locked into. Had to play through the first hour before I even had the opportunity to turn off the music.',
       'It\'s a great game, but they really try to get you to spend money. The only way you get higher power troops is buying things. Even after defeating higher power teams & collecting chest & earning summon tokens. You still receive lower star troops that\'s not worth it.',
       'This app is not that bad but the customer service is below par. They tell you to do something then when you do want to tell you that you are wrong for doing it. The turn  around for your stuff to get finished is unbelievable waiting a day or more for it to be finished. The first couple levels or so are fun then it becomes not so much fun especially when you have to deal with customer service and they have no idea what is going on.' ,

       'I was hoping for a working mod but im extremely dissapointed. This app would of been good enough if it worked but it sadly didn\'t.',
       'When i wanna have a map it keeps kick me out of the game and its working when i wanna go in the water slide its horrible because i canot slide when i wanna talk to fake people jessica said "hi how old are you?" So creepy This game really creepy. DO NOT INSTALL!!!!',
       'Okay some people are going a little too hard on this game like it is awesome that you can relax and everything but what\'s the point of it like you make games that are supposed to destroy Minecraft and they\'re not even half as good as Minecraft and if you guys aren\'t trying to destroy in Minecraft then why did you make this because it makes no sense like wouldn\'t it be better to just go to the pool or go to a waterpark and real life instead of making a game that no sense sorry no offense but could you make one that\'s little bit more more',
       'This game is kind of creepy... I was talking to a boy named Lucas and he asked "What is your last name?" Then I asked a girl named Jessica a question and she said "When is your birthday?" This game says it isn\'t looking for personal data but it is. It\'s not safe and it wants to learn more about people. I don\'t trust this game! Also if someone mentions \'Dr.Wallace" ask them who it is and then you will see what I mean.',
       'If you download this game and you are reading this , ask someone who Dr. Richard S Wallace is. I got the name and went to ask her to "tell me more about Dr. Richard S Wallace and it wouldn\'t let me, it kept kicking me out. CREEPY' ,

       'It is a cute game and it is fun. I just think that having the animals constantly defaulting to a need that requires the most expensive buildings is a little bit much.

       'I get to level 10 and all 4 of my horses get sick and that requires a 17k+ dollar (game money) building that I can\'t possibly buy without purchasing with REAL money... Please fix it... Y\'all had a great game until that happened... was a 5 star game until then.',

      'I hope in the new update you can upgrade the engine and body kits as well. That would bring back the fast and the furious Season 7 track 6 nexts to be check it says three lap but you are basicly doing lap 2 twice and it says wrong way. Third lap starts when u finish three laps and doing 4th lap counts as 3rd lap. Needs to be looked at this is cheating  u guys are doing',
       'Fix the detection when you touch/hit in perfect drift mode. There\'s been hundreds of times where ive definately not hit and yet it ends. So Infuriating, love the game but that one detail could definitely be optimized better. The drift should not end unless you actually hit and it screws up your direction. 4/5',
       'Game is really good. Best drift game I\'ve ever played on the phone. But there are small bugs in the game such as season 7 second perfect drift track (should be Turin) the race is not 3 laps. Even though I finish 3 laps it didn\'t finish the race and it gives the "wrong way" warning Everytime I pass from start/finish line. I hope you can fix this.',
       'I love this game and so do all my mates. It dose have a few light glitches as most games do. I would love a night track of some kind in the future but other wise great game all together. Also out of all the drifting games this is the best one at of all of them.',
       'I love this game! The cars are some of my favorites. There\'s only a couple things I would like to hopefully see in this game. First, if you could upgrade the cars more and you didn\'t have to use the cards. Like us money to upgrade engine parts, buy body kits, etc. And there\'s some kind of a sound glitch. The sound stays on for just a few races and then all of a sudden it stops working but I can still play the game.',
       'Hey! Absolutely awesome game, dev! Ive been playing it daily now.. But id like to report some bug. On season7 career, perfect drift race on turini south, the game reads me in the wrong way when i was crossing the finish line. So the race would never finished altough the time is still decreasing. I need that 1 starr 😢 Xiaomi Redmi 3pro' ,

      'I only rate games for two reasons. If they are very bad or very good. This one is good. Yes there are sone ads but they are smart enough to  use them in a creative way so that you are not frustrated with them and they go by fast or you actually use them to advance the game play WHEN you decide to on your own in certain situations.  Anyway, the game is kind of addictive and super fun. VERY cool fun game Congrats to the designers',
       'I think this game is awesome! But I have some suggestions. When you flip your tank in a battle there should be a button that ONLY works when you flip your tank you press that button and then it will flip you back on to your tracks so you don\'t die. Is there anymore tanks you could add? Because I think there should be a few more. There\'s should also be achievements when you do something specific. Maybe some daily missions that expire after Friday and start Tuesday. Maybe more maps to battle in. And more bosses to fight. And a little bit more health. And for each tank should have the health and firerate as it\'s level gets higher. And some more enemys. And a higher upgrade number like 20.',
       'Well takes to long to collect coins.and even though my tanks max it doesn\'t make it any further then when it was basic. The rank status has a glitch where it may climb up 3 or more times before it stays. I think you need to make more coins, and make an actual difference when you upgrade your tank"heck my tank does same damage to each tank now at max as it did when no upgrades were done"',
       'The aim of developers of the game is just to extort money.  So less coins even after you finish a level. And you need so so much coins to buy a tank.  Also the game always start with level 1, if you die at any level.  Don\'t  know how it got editors choice game tag.  (they must have got some real coins from developers)',
       'This game is so much fun! It\'s so addicting however there r a couple of drawbacks.. one the first tank is super clumsy! I can\'t tell y\'all how many times where I have been in situations where I would either shoot  be nose to nose with an enemy and some how the tank flips over and blows up. Second I feel like u don\'t have as much control over the tank especially it\'s up in the air',
       'Haha This is really stupid. The first tank is ok. You finally get enough money for the next one and realize it really sucks. Then the next is pretty good but then all the others seem like they would be AWESOME...but then they suck even worse! The flame tank has such a short range that everyone hits you! The howitzer tank rocks so much when you shoot that you can\'t hit anything! And then you flip over! The joker tank has such touchy controls that it keeps flipping over! I play a lot of games that look similar to this but this SUCKS!' ,

      'Great. It was working fine i used to have fun playing it before it did the last update! But after that, things changed. The game lost its memory i suppose it isnt loading my account! It starts from the start my all strategy is gone now if you could plz fix that tell me other wise ill have no choice but to uninstall this game.',
       'The game is buggy and needs some work. For me the game does not go ahead and it points on Unlocking the chest when the other chest is in process of Unlocking. None of the functions work, clearing cache, dalvik has no impact. Game works only after uninstall and again install.  Edit : the game is super smooth now . The shadow energy required to upgrade an element is increased manifold without corresponding increase in drop chances of epic and legendary chest. Hence a star removed.',
       'I have given 5 stars earlier because it was early in the game. Even in chapter one, you can\'t really progress because there is no way to make more coin other than the side quest which needs hours to refresh. In the end, you kinda not able to do anything but wait. You can\'t even replay earlier fights to earn some coins. Different mechanics than the 2. Boo.. Uninstaling..',
       'Few suggestions: 1. Add an escape roll or a quick recovery move when downed 2. Beating an opponent in duel should reduce the opponent\'s trophies. It will help in balancing match ups that appear in duels 3. Add an option to discard chests after winning a duel. It\'s most definitely a pay to win game  right now.. hope it gets better',
       'The game is cool and action packed but the only way to level up is to play the main campaign and there are no achievements with rewards to help you out. Also the ai difficulty seems like it knows your next move and not only that but each level is so much harder than the last. Plz fix',
       'Amazing game!!! but crashes after every duel fight, even though I win nearly every duel, I loose coins and progress due to it crashing after every duel!!! Very very frustrating!!!!!!!! Iv done the 10 lunar fights but it crashes after the 10th fight and I never get my rewards, every Lunar tournament fight crashes after each fight and so I\'m never rewarded so iv given up on the Lunar tournament I\'m just wasting my time in fact the whole game is a waste of time due it crashing after every duel fight, this game Could be fantastic but sadly it\'s not due to it crashing every second' ,

It repeatedly says it everytime i fail the level and want to try again.If this carries on i will put absolutely no stars for this game because of the dumb manufacturers who refused to change it.',

       'I posted a good comment about this game but after 10 more levles it got rage quitting and frustrating it forces u to quit. Then there was way too much adds. I recommend you not getting this game. Every one look at the comments before you get any game.😡😠',

      'Cool game and really realistic. I give it a good rating. But can you plz update game sothat more players can join 1 room and plz plz plz plz add more possibility\'s like feeding cows can give more cows and then you can sell some of your cows and buy new ones. Or you can build a pig stall and buy/sell pigs and upgrade a farm house or build a horse place. Or paint some buildings. I would spread the game to all my friends and people i know if you add some of those things. Plz add some of them cause I really like the game alot.',
       'Good games. Fun.. Need more equipments for farm like oldest planters to newest planter balers drill seeds ects. Need john deere too. Need rid of slurry thing not need it. All need is manure and spreader or just hual manure to make mulchs for fields to cover up dirts and need oldest tractors to newest tractos also',
       'Purchased a bunch of tractors and unlocks and had my account charged only to find the game to block me from using my purchases. This game is a money scam. Do not be tricked into making in app purchases. I even tried contacting giants software to give them a chance to correct but to no surprise i did not recive a response to my email, they got my money why would they care now. Save yourself from being taken by this company!!!!',
       'I have absolutely no qualms about giving 5 stars. It\'s a nice game. I  hope their updates will give an alternative way to the tilt control of vehicles. It\'s tiring. Can you also consider faster response to queries to your customer care Department?',
       'Fun game that really passes the time. Only complaints I currently have are:  1. I just bought a new harvestor and there\'s no "work" button so I can harvest my crop. Trying to give it some time because it seems like a glitch. 2. I\'d really like to be able to manage animals as well. Like chickens, pigs, goats, etc.  3. It would be nice to be able to store things IN the barn. 4. It\'d take the game over the top if you could interact with and customize your house on the farm.',
       'WHERE are half of my purchases??!!?? I know for sure I bought the big red harvester and the bigger mower, tredder, and wind rower yesterday. My first save has them but today its saying their all locked and I have to purchase again... and yesterday I\'m pretty sure I got charged for 250k coin package twice and only received coins for 1 purchase. Can you please fix this or I will be forced to contact Google billing to solve this. FYI I have tried the restore button but that doesn\'t work as well. I gave you guys several days to respond and nothing. So I\'m going to have to cancel those charges' ,

But then it has lots of ads everytime i arrive at the green light and also when purchasing weapon at the weapon shop😣😣 its also difficult to climb up the hill or mountain especially when i accidentally fall into the sea.  Maybe add some extra moves like to able to grabbing thing, and speed up the ability to punch or kick people/thing.',

      'This game is the WORST!!! The controls don\'t work and there is not even demonstration on how to play. Also every time I retried to do it a stupid add came up. I AM FURIUS!!!! Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don\'t get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don\'t mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!',
       'It\'s honestly a fun game, and I\'d love to use it as a stimulating activity (ah, who am I kidding, it\'s just a great time killer), but it makes my head hurt-- and that\'s a problem. I\'m not even the type of person that is negatively affected by fast-paced graphics or rapidly changing colors. It\'d be five stars if it didn\'t give me headaches, but, for now, it gets three; good graphics, smooth gameplay, but no matter how great the app, it isn\'t worth physical discomfort. (Note: if you are looking for something similar, try "Run". It has the same sort of concept, but without the advertisements and headaches.)',
       'The game is stupid. I HATE IT. It\'s very annoying because of all the ads. It\'s sad that some people actually LIKE  games with all these ads. I mean, WHO would give this game 5 STARS? That would just be an idiotic thing to do. ZIGL, This game stinks. I mean, REALLY SKINKS. It stinks worse than DOG POOP. HOW DO YA LIKE ME NAH?! I\'m not trying to be mean ZIGL, But I\'m just giving my opinion. Thanks for reading ZIGL, don\'t get mad at me and go crying😢 to your boss. Bye!!🤙',
       'tbh it\'s a really good app! The only problem is that it gets a little boaring after a while (obviously that\'s my opinion) And I don\'t know if it\'s just me but there or tons of over 30 second ads.',
       'I like this game  very much cause you dont know what comes in front of you which makes this game more interesting. But 1 problem is there that the second i crash to any obstacle an add popups',
       'I really do like this game. It\'s a good way to learn to think quickly with what side you should move to. Although, it would be even better if you didn\'t have so many adds, but every rose must have it\'s thorns and I\'d say the adds are this roses thorns.' ,

      'Brilliant follow-up to YELLOW! ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES! And, there ARE games trying to pretend that they\'re the same...only Bart Bonte does it right!  I try not to let myself do too many levels at once, just so I can extend the game. I can\'t wait for the next color!',
       'I love these games, really, and I was on a roll, but I can\'t get pass level 48 because my Wiko LENNY3 touch screen isn\'t responsive enough to register both fingertips at the same time. EDIT: I was too quick to judge the alternative way to be wrong. Thank you Bart, for your response. I retried what you said and had no trouble finishing the game. Can\'t wait to see the next game. You have a beautiful mind. These things you create, are a work of art.',
       'This game and yellow have single handedly improved my relationship with my niece. She loves playing these games over and over every time she comes to visit. Christmas day she didn\'t want to play with her gifts, she just wanted to sit with me and play yellow. It means so much to me. Thank you for making these games.',
       'By far one of the best puzzle creators for Android games! I was hoping for another "Yellow 2", and changing the color really surprised me, Looking forward to... Blue? (PS: after playing for a while, All I see is orange :P)',
       'Bart Bonte is a genius! If I see his name, I know I will love it. I just finished this one tonight and I loved every minute. I only needed the clues for the very last level because I\'m familiar with Bart\'s mind by now. &lt;3 I think it\'s great that clues are available though and that they don\'t give everything away right away. It\'s a big bummer when that happens on other games. Love, your die-hard fan! Please make another one soon!',
       'Thank you, thank you, thank you, Bart Bonte! I\'ve been waiting for a very, very long time for this game to come out since I first played "Yellow". Thanks a lot! But here are a few other questions I have for you: what will be the next game? How long will I have to wait until the next game comes out? Could you at least give me a hint? Thanks!' ,

      'EarnFreeMoney👇 DownIoad "UNOPAY" App Enterr (ALEXA) to Start Earning So far so good. Fun way to get Money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. 3000 points equals $6 instead of like some of the others where it takes 3300 points to reach $1 etc....Also, TOYOCASH App is very reliable in paying you when you redeem to Paypal. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Paypal for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for adding some fun to my day.',
       'Finally! For the the longest time I\'ve been waited, the gaming performance has been improved! No more annoying lag and the gameplay feel a lot smoother now and I am so happy about it. But the graphics still needs to be improved because it doesn\'t look too good and some minor bug needs to be fixed.',
       'Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it\'s so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I\'ve had to start all over again... but the fun continues!',
       'This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don\'t play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don\'t make us wait foreverrrr!',
       'I\'ve had to start this game all over from the very beginning 3 times. After working hard to get all the way to the top sharks, the app will suddenly refuse to connect to your Facebook account and want you to start a whole new game. Waste of time. Very frustrating. Not enjoyable at all. Find a game that\'s enjoyable. This one is definitely not fun.',
       'It\'s a fun game and I\'m enjoying it. However, I\'ve come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.' ,

      'I love playing slot machine games, and Pop Slots feels like the only game that does not immediately shoot me down when I get a little crazy/ ambitious with my betting. It is the ONLY game I have ever played where I\'ve hit the jackpots on multiple occasions. Now maybe it\'s all completely luck on my part, but it feels like a game that doesn\'t immediately take all of your money faster than you can collect it. It\'s very easy to level up with a good win streak, and those hourly and daily bonus grow pretty quickly. Love this game!',
       'Game is really fun to play probably my favorite, and is the best slot machine app. I\'ve been playing at least 5 years But have recently stopped because it\'s not fun if you hardly win. And I totally get that it\'s supposed to be like Vegas, Win some could lose a lot. But it\'s just a game, it\'s for entertainment and I get that you can redeem the gold chips for real rewards in Vegas, but that\'s not why I play. I play because the games and different casinos are fun along with the bonuses. I spend 11 million just to play the pirate gem bonus and only win back 5 million. I could really care less how frequent the gold chips are, you only get 1 in 4ish balloons anyway. I just want to PLAYYY. Especially the bonuses, but it takes forever sometimes for them to be triggered in some casinos. Any chance it can change?',
       'Great game at first but when you progress you pretty much play for 10 minutes wait for bonus. Started purchasing chips and then they seem to go quicker! I like that is not all win win but damn, throw a dog a bone every once in a while. Basically you throw money away paying for chips and NEVER, and I repeat, NEVER win!',
       'I\'m sick of only being able to play for ten minutes at a time. Would love this game more if I can actually play it but you hardly can win coins, and if you do it\'s a quarter of what you spent on spinning it, and can hardly get coins. If you had more ways to get extra coins rather than paying like watching an ad, or something then that would be cool. Or if they made it so one could not lose 500k in ten minutes while only winning a total of like 5k that would be great cuz I would actually then enjoy it.',
       'The way the game is set up is excellent but I give it 2 stars because you you almost never win any coins. You\'ll burn through the entire bit of your bonus coins without any winning spins. The game I play has a minimum bet of 7500 and you might win a couple payouts of 500 and a couple for 2500 and then it\'s game over after about a whole 3 minutes of play time then it\'s another 2 hours before you get more coins I mean come on loosen up a little',
       'Love this app when I first started playing. The tokens lasted but now 3.00000 chips go within 10 MNS and don\'t get good win on that.. the games have started to stall and freeze up which really is disappointing specially when you\'ve waited for a place on yr favourite game  then lose it due to technical failure.' ,

       'The idea of the app is very nice, however, I am disappointed in the fact that the app requests to access my calls, contacts, and other data. I fail to see why is that necessary for a simple game like this. Moreover, when I listen to music and play the game, the ads come interrupting my music with their own. When I mute them and press X, the music on my phone stops completely, forcing me to leave the game and start the music again. Again, this is inconvenient for an app which I expected to be very simple.',

      'Really fun game. My 2 year old adores Hank. The only thing that I feel is missing is a way to save your progress to the cloud. My phone needed to be reset a couple times and we had to start over. Didn\'t mind so much because hank as a puppy is much cuter.',
       'I like this new update. Hanks now have His own happy meter like Tom and Angela. Nice. Also this is just my suggestion. Can you guys also make My Talking Ben and My Talking Ginger. Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that\'s it. You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It\'s not fair. Lastly good job guys.',
       'Great game, probably best talking animal game out for adults n kids... but sometimes u watch a video so u can spin the wheel n win gems or coins but the wheel not always comes up... ive had approx. 20x it has not happened in last 4 hrs... would like it redeemed n fixed plz...',
       'I like my talking tom and I download this one thinking that it will have some fun stuff like play mini games I know this one have a picture feature but man only eat, pet, sleep , and pics? Sorry I am re-downloading my talking Tom and start from scratch that only take pics feed and sleep on this game',
       'My three year old grand daughter got around my password and charged $40 of in app purchases and did a monthly subscription, too. I have gone through everything to try to remedy this, with no help from the customer service from the this apps developer.',
       'I\'m only on level 1 wrong so correct me if im wrong but I thought the game was a bit boring at first and the game doesn\'t seem to give you much choice andyou have to folow what it says but if you enjoy the game thats great! I also did like that u got stickers for taking pics. I did end up having to uninstall the game as it took up to much storage space D: Overall I did really enjoy the game yay =D' ,

      'Great game, but honestly they need to tweak the chests for in app purchases. Why are the things not all even? I should be able to get the same level of item. If I spend 80 jewels, all the items should be equivalent. There should 3,500 feathers on the same page as 7,500 feathers. If I\'m level 300, even the common chests could reflect that. People will spend the money. Why not offer all the daily specials all the time? It\'s fun, but I spend cash money on this game, let\'s make it worthwhile...',
       'Pro: Its a pretty challenging game but not to put your out. There is also some daily chanllenges, new revamped arena to do with also some clan battle. The new room system that brings makes some level design unique. Some variety in levels and pigs. A new bird introduced: Silver The fortune tower   Cons: The lives system. Doesn\'t have that much of a story. Silvers ability is kinda disapointing.',
       'Game is fun. I\'m giving it 1star because I can\'t turn off the notifications. Just turns back on and bothers me at all hours. Oh, and the stupid debris flying through stupid tunnels over and over and you can\'t progress until the debris breaks and it never will and wastes your gems.  AND the game won\'t connect to other wifi sources. Just your home so if your away you can\'t get daily rewards or play the arena.',
       'It dosentt work at all since last update 2 weeks ago,   I\'ve tried re-installing it on my Samsung galaxy s3 and my tablet..    It is still completely useless on both devices.    rovio needs to be better than this to its paying customers...  It is ignorant as a company to not even try to fix this problem. I know I\'m not the only one that continues to have this problem.',
       'The reason I gave low rates on controls and game play is you are not in control of either, ROVIO is. This is by far the worst game I\'ve played since I\'ve been playing online games due to how crooked and unfair this company is. Stop what you\'re doing ROVIO it\'s wrong. Kids play this game and spend their allowance on it. How does that make you feel ???',
       'The game is very nice.Pls do some minor bug fixes . When will the NFL hat sets will be for sale by using black pearls. Please fix the tower of fortune as the pig never allows to go above 2nd floor and it appears on any card I pick after that. Fix these issues. A very nice game.' ,

      'Lemme just say ketchapp your games are soooo good!! And addictive including this one it\'s fun and ever since the first play I\'ve been hooked there are barely any adds and the graphics are phenomenal. I play it all the time plz don\'t change this, if u do your going to loose my five stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟.',
       'Most of my apps are from Ketchapp. Their creativity and style of games have just been wanting me to download more and more! Right now, Ketchapp is one of my most favourite game groups ever! Keep making more! I don\'t have any improvements, which means that their games are top notch!',
       'Patheitc. Being such a fast paced game you cannot have the blocks starting to move a split second before you\'re going to pass it. Makes the game pretty impossible from the first level. For something that was supposed to be fun, is more frustrating. You need severe luck on your side to get a win. Recommended do not download',
       'Its a good concept, but you need to update it, and make sure the blocks no longer move. Right now, it is by far the most luck based skill game. It is impossible to dodge the moving blocks, so if they are to move, they should move much slower',
       'This game can be a fun one but it keeps moving slow when I roll over about 5 or more of the yellow arrows and it\'s distracting. Idk if the game is new but could you review this please. Only one \'kind\' of obstacle is there. The black boxes. Otherwise good game. 😊',
       'I think it is a great way for amiee to get design for her Xbox 360 and help her get over with her anger with her sister and to help her to figure out what\'s the matter but what is the most important thing is to be a fantastic family together but why are we so lonely.... Well i think it is a great opportunity to make new friends to life' ,

      'I love Beat the Boss 4! But there are some things that I would like to be fixed. For example, when naming your custom boss, the name duplicates. The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can\'t go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.',
       'I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i\'m asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting',
       'Too many ads. It\'s annoying especially when you are connected to the internet. The King Boss is not working and is always saying "Something went wrong, please try again later" and crashes the whole gane. On the other hand it\'s a super addictive and fun game to play.',
       'This game needs a lot of work done. So many glitches its really weird and hard to explain the glitches that happen. One of them was the screen uncalibrated itself an it was moved to the upper left side , an the right side was just black . idek if that makes sense but it shouldn\'t happen.',
       'The game is amazing, but it is pathetic at the fact that there are ads popping up every 2 minutes and there\'s no way to remove them... I would be happy to pay to remove the ads, I won\'t be playing this game until this is fixed. I remember playing this game years ago, I understand you guys may be making more money from displaying ads than people paying to remove them.',
       'I really love this app it is so fun to play but there is a glitch that happened to me and my brother when we were playing, the friend thing didn\'t work and we were logged into our accounts and the loading screen was just black outlines and Joe\'s face. I\'m pretty sure it didn\'t load like that before but over all, 5 stars! Have a good day/Night!' ,

      'I kind of enjoy the game but would like it more if there were cheaper options to buying. After you buy some the prices jump to 99.99 and have yet to see cheaper prices. I\'m not unloading that in one go. The people of this game would probably make more money if they bring cheaper prices. I would buy several different little packs that eventually add up to 100 bit you ain\'t getting nothing otherwise. Also wish you could buy more things with the gold you purchased. Like have a choice to spend loyalty or gold',
       'When it\'s not crashing, it\'s fun to play.  Sucks when it doesn\'t load of locks up during game play.  Also it gets expensive as you have to buy packs at $99 a pop after the 1st 2.  The game play is addicting, but no fun if you cannot afford the special offers they continue to throw in your face every time you log in.  I love final fantasy games but this particular one is a money pit!.  Not to mention the constant crashing',
       'I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.',
       'This game has potential to be fun but it\'s completely ruined because IT\'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don\'t get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it\'s full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it\'s a complete money bucket!',
       'This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.',
       'The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it\'s free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15' ,

      'I wish I could post pictures, but the game is too easy. I beat the first 2 levels both on one attempt. Though I am an experienced geometry dash player. But if I can beat a level first try, not knowing the course at all, that\'s some easy stuff. I highly recommend geometry dash sub zero though.',
       'I love every Geometry Dash version! And this one might be the best. But my only downfall is that the music, which is freaking awesome,gets ahead of the actual gameplay and I miss my jumps. Plz fix and I\'ll rate 5 stars! But keep up the good work!',
       'Great fun but needs more levels. I laughed when I saw a review made by an idiot because he said this was a copy of the Impossible Game LOL it\'s the other way around, dumbass.',
       'Hardly worth downloading. I love the full version of the game and figured this world be similar, or at least have some interesting levels, but much to my dismay it does not. The levels are easy and somewhat boring, which is unfortunate because Geometry Dash is usually neither of those things.',
       'I think it should be more easy it\'s kind of hard and RobTop Games can you plz ohh plz add more levels to try   ok so now I\'m even more upset it keeps on not jumping when I want it tooo!!! I will and I mean I will keep lowering the stars until you fix it!!! I am fed up with this but I will keep the app',
       'This is the worst game ever but it\'s so good even I have to pull my hair out of my face for it! It\'s the worst but the best at the same time! Even my mom plays it! And she doesn\'t have any games on her phone except this.' ,

      'If you\'ve liked the first game you\'re probably gonna enjoy this one. It\'s more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it\'s built around microtransactions so if you\'re feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don\'t understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it\'s likely you\'re going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren\'t aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don\'t expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!',
       'I was unable to launch the game for some stupid reason.....i sent several messages to the developers email seeking help,but everytime i get a same reply,asking me to visit the ea gaamjng website. It doesnt work,and seems like the message the developer replied is auto generated. Does popcap/ea rlly take time to fix it? Pls help me,i dont wanna miss out on speacial events. Thanks',
       'I like this game so much, but after the last update the game is a bit laggy, and I noticed that only the normal level music plays every time no matter what type of level I am playing. For example: the ultimate battle theme and the minigame music are all missing. I am playing on Galaxy A5 2017.',
       'EA doesn\'t care about the problems of the gamers. Im not interested anymore in this game after my profile has gone. 3-4 years of playing and buying stuff and most of my plants are in level 10 plus 4k+ gems, but with one stupid glitch, all of my achievements are lost. the game does not deserve even 1 star. I DONT LIKE TO PLAY FROM SCRATCH AGAIN & AGAIN. STUPID!!! u dont care about our feelings, all u want is money..',
       'Please help! The game crashed so I reinstalled it, now none of my progress is saved even though I\'m signed in to Google+, this is the 2nd time this had happened and I can\'t start from scratch again. Can someone suggest a resolution Please?' ,

      'I really do enjoy playing this game. It\'s a great time waster. Good for breaks at work. Public transit. Bored at home. Good graphics. You can choose the controls method. Great car selection. I enjoy it so much, to help the creator I spend a few bucks now and then. It\'s one of the few games I actually play. Just wish there was actual racing. Or if you could have police chasing you, rather than being the police. Either way, good game. Those would be great to implement. 😁',
       'THIS GAME IS OVERPOWERD I\'ve been finding a game that is  A Leagend Car game. Then i found this cool game and  I PLAYED IT ALOT. But not forever.   🎵THE STORY🎵  When i\'ve played it i saw a !alarm At the gifts then i liked you at facebook Then i subscribed you on youtube  And i liked you at twitter too. Then theres a free luckybucy thing. The free watch and then you will have $500.THANK YOU FOR THE GAME',
       'This game is getting boring. Yah, Next Generation Endless Racing blahblah. But is this all about endless whatever? I think you must put some thrill to this game. This is nothing compared to Traffic Rider which is you also create that game (Yeah. Traffic Rider is one of my fav game.) I HOPE YOU PUT SOMETHING THRILLING LIKE MISSIONS *NOT DAILY MISSION* AND PUT SOME CAR NAMES IN IT. ONE MORE HOPE YOU MAKE THE CARS IN TRAFFIC MORE REALISTIC IT LOOKS LIKE A MOVING BOX... AND I WANT SOME FEEDBACK.',
       'Hello, 😊 I really love this game, my favourite actually! I have play a lot of games, but this one is the best so far! PS.:I never spent real money on games! But in this game you don\'t really have to, so it\'s even better for me and for people who can\'t spend real money in virtual things. I know that there are 1 or 2 cars in the game that you can only buy with real money, but it still is a perfect game in my opinion! 😉',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a long time on a couple devices and it\'s been a lot of fun. There seems to be some variations in scale of one compact car to another. The models themselves don\'t quite seem to be in scale to each other. You might have two hatch backs that should both be small, even very near in size but when you\'re looking at cars to buy you can tell that the model itself just isn\'t quite the right size compared to other similar cars, and then when you get out on the road with it, it looks bigger than it should compared to other vehicles on the road around it. But.. That\'s not too big of a deal. Great game!',
       'Every Thing is Ok But If the camera view changes its positions like during driving someone is sitting inside the car. Such type of view will be very nice. Like in traffic rider it looks like someone is sitting on the bike and is riding. Add this feature in next update. I\'ll be waiting. And it doesn\'t save your progress automatically, this is stupid... Thanks' ,

      'I truly enjoy this game. There is a learning curve at the beginning if you\'re going to have a successful mission. However, soon enough you\'ll be traveling the Stars. This game is challenging enough to keep you interested. You are solely in control of all of your missions, which I like because I don\'t feel like I\'m forced to jump through hoops to get to the next level. Very well designed. Now for the real reason why I\'m sending this review... Designers, please move the engine ignition button away from the acceleration bar. Too many accidental engine ignitions while trying to adjust engine power.',
       'Awesome work with this new updates.  I have an idea. Maybe you\'ve already thought of it.  Multiple engines under the same fuel tank.  For instance, I\'m trying to reenact the Falcon Heavy, but because you can only put one engine under each fuel tank, I had to put several boosters to reach the required thrust/weight ratio.  If we could put multiple engines under a single fuel tank, I wouldn\'t need more boosters.  Maybe, something for the future.',
       'I replayed the game, and also thanks for replying on my other review, but I noticed a lack of, understanding. As I said, it\'s very realistic and challenging, and also that I would really like to be able to send pieces of a space station into space and connect them there, which I\'m happy with now that it\'s possible now. One thing I would really, really, really love and that would help many many people is a hands on tutorial. Like a demo mission(or multiple missions) that teaches how to play the game properly. It may be difficult, but it would just be awesome because me and many other people are hands on learners rather than visual learners. Keep up the good work!',
       'Seriously one of the best games I\'ve ever played. It\'s just so addictive.  However, I am currently working on trying to land a rocket on a platform in the earth\'s orbit and I find it almost impossible. Can you make something that let us target another rocket and calculates the transfer window for us (much like the target system for a planet that you currently have).  Would be nice if that can happen. Anyway, here\'s a five star for the great work!',
       'O.M.G. This is the most beautiful, awe inspiring app I have ever used. I feel like I am living out the history of space exploration! I did two sub-orbital shots, then orbital. I did the three orbits of Col Glenn... ran out of fuel! Aerobraked home after a total of 8 orbits. The coolest game ever! (One thing, I think there\'s a scale factor error somewhere. Orbit periods are about ten times to quick, given your stated velocity. Also mission report says you went to 15km when you went to 150km.)',
       'So I\'ve been playing the game for a couple of months now. i think that there is an awesome game here, with already plenty to do. I do also think that there is lots of room and need to improve upon this. As I have been playing for a while, I do notice it becomes quite challenging to escape orbit with enough fuel to make it to other planets, like mars. i do recommend you add a cheats section that you can enable in the settings, with unlimited fuel, larger build space, indestructable rockets, etc. I also recommend more bits and pieces for building, like bigger and more powerful thrusters, or air vents for turning in space. For later development, a satellite system would be much appreciated, as well as a little spaceman that you can control when docked at a space station, or when you\'re on a planet.

      'I love the game :) ,but can you add unlimited ammo and u can deliver any vehicle u own for free, if our only gonna do one of these, at least add u can deliver your vehicles for free any time. And oh yeah, add multiplayer where u can join someone the host decides whether the server is public or private. And that you can friend people with the Facebook thing. Thank you and keep on adding cool stuff! P.S. add that you can turn on and off friendly fire when host for when you add the multiplayer option and add weather like in the winter it snows and sometimes it rains. Sorry its long but please do all of these things to make the game even better!!!!!!!!',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Alot of things you can do, very fun and the missions are EPIC!  Although there are a few things gameloft needs to add/change: 1. Multiplayer 2. We can die and not spend money going to hospital 3. make graphics better 4. Go inside houses and shops  5. customize cars',
       'Awesome! The latest update rewards old and loyal players like me with the new trophy system, which gives us more than 1000 diamonds for what we\'ve achieved in the past few months. Removing the key system is another thing that we want to thank God of Games for. Keep up the good work. Will be supporting Gameloft in the future.',
       'This game is one of the BEST games i\'ve ever played in my whole life! The graphics,gameplay,story,cars,etc are all amazing! But i have one complain please give the original price of the cheap materials pack... But overall its the best Good Job Devs',
       'It\'s nice but mission fourth is very complicated as well as conjustedly tough. I would like this and would give full stars but my opinion is it should be more graphical, adjustable control,nicely gamed and less storagable. I hope that instead of ignoring the matter you should modify the game and improve it. This is my feedback and you should definitely do it please it\'s my applicapable request.',
       'In my opinion. This game is by far one of the best games I have played. Especially for a mobile device. My only problem is, diamonds. Diamonds are pretty hard to come by, especially if you are a free-to-play player, like me. The trophies can be a simple way to earn quite alot of diamonds but soon you complete them all, like me. So I think, to make the game better, is to try to find an easier way for free players to earn diamonds, something simple, but cannot be spammed by higher level players. Another thing is that levelling up does take alot of time and effort. I would hope that you could try to make it easier to level up In This game as the main story can be very difficult to keep up with as you are about 4 levels behind, you lose track of what\'s happened. So again, try to make it a little easier to level up and a little easier to earn diamonds. Other than that, great game ;)' ,

      'Classic tetris with modern graphics, you can use one touch controls or classic directional pad if you wish, both have their own advantage. I am afraid I can\'t find Bradinsky song. It\'s okay for me with advisement because EA need something to eat right? Lol',
       'Enjoyed it at first, and short adverts were expected, but recently adverts have become longer, and now last longer than the game. The latest video advert lasted inbetween games lasted 8 mins....ridiculous!!!. I understand the need for adverts, but if you can\'t play the game, the adverts are pointless, espeacially if it makes players quit.',
       'I just wanted to play Tetris. Happy to pay for it, was hoping I could pay a $5-10 purchase price and then have the game and play it to my liking. No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It\'s TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred',
       'When I saw that EA took on the game I immediately purchased it thinking it was any good. The graphics are good, but the controls are nerve-wrecking and the game makes decisions for you. It responds slowly and the block hold works by itself. These little things make you lose and make the game unplayable. Don\'t download it - free or not, look for another Tetris because this does no justice to the original',
       'Great game, but there\'s an annoying window that pops up everytime I try and start a new marathon. The window is pretty much useless and wastes my time. Would give this 5 stars if it gets patched',
       'Since you really really want a review, when I adjust music and SFX to minimum, I expect no sound at all. Please allow for sound to be muted. Very annoying to have button that serve no purpose. Sure you need ads to survive EA big company like you, go ahead but you want to play the ad with sound over what I have playing that\'s annoying enough, at least optimise the sound so that it doesn\'t play at max volume.' ,

      'Would be nice if I could actually get a club that can get a hole in one on a par 3. I\'m pretty sure nearly all par 3 mini golf courses we play in life make it possible for an ace. A little disappointed this game doesn\'t give the chance',
       'I was really skeptical about the quality of this, all other mini golf games I\'ve played have sucked honestly. But wait - this is actually a good game! Kind of rips Golf Clash off a touch design wise but who isn\'t copying everyone these days? Remember the Flappy Bird fiasco and the 500,000 clones still on the play store? Yeah, not going to complain about this game lol.',
       'Was 5 star game! But losing connection is a joke! My connection is excellent! 2 xbox 2 PlayStations play multiplayer online all at the same time! Yet this game loses connection as I\'m about to win! Yeah right! Nice try fkrs',
       'Don\'t want to play a long drawn out golf game? Then this puttputt  might just be for you.and there are plenty of twists and turns to make it a challenge. Need I say more!?',
       'Great game. Easy to learn and play. As a suggestion for the creators of the game is there should be a practice mode. This way if we just want to play solo with no coins, or just get some practice we can. Otherwise all around good game.',

      'Saw in Facebook and thought I would give it a try. I am now addicted. I love how realistic they make the interaction seem. The only things that would make it better is if it would let us type our own responses and the system understood them and was able to respond and if there was actually more "proving innocence" and less tetrisy type games.. But that doesn\'t not effect my interest at all. Most addictive and fun game I have found. Will def recommend',
       'UPDATE : Changed from 5 stars to 3 because of the puzzles. As you get further into the game, it is obvious that you are supposed to spend money because you are literally not given enough of the right color blocks to complete the puzzles without purchased hacks. That really sucks. Too bad.    This is an interesting game with some unique interfaces and an engrossing plot. You interact with the other characters (in-game AI) via chat, and telephone (in-game AI) to learn the plot and your place in it. In order to access the info you need to move forward, you have to solve puzzles. Very cool, love it.',
       'This game is great. It\'s my favorite game of all thus far. I love this game. It\'s so addicting and the story line is perfect. I love how you can text and also receive/make calls. Great game for people who like puzzles and mystery. Passes the time quickly. Only thing I am having problems with is trying to link it to my facebook. The first time I had this game I had gotten pretty far and logged in with ease, long story short, got a new phone, installed my game, try to connect to my facebook for my saved game and.... my phone glitches and shuts me out. So I had to start over. Other than that this game is great I would recommend to anyone.',
       'I like the idea but the responses are off quite often. For example: "Please don\'t hang up!" -I\'m here "I don\'t know! Not a clue. Doesn\'t make sense and breaks the immersion.   It\'s another game similar to SIM - Sara is Missing, which I\'d recommend for now. It\'s more polished and engaging. The characters are more distinct than in I Am Innocent.  This just seems to be designed to make you spend cash eventually, not because someone actually enjoyed developing it.',
       'This gave is so addictive. I normally will get bored very quickly of Games on my phone but I run to charge my phone to play this. Some of the levels are hard and seems impossible to win additives. So the only suggestion I have to have more ways to win extra lives, bombs, etc. Otherwise I FREAKING LOVE this game. 28/f',
       'The overall game is really cool and a good game. I loved this and showed it to my friends, and they LOVED it. If anyone sees this, please get this great game! Though I have one thought; could you possibly make the graphics better? There\'s nothing wrong with it, but it would make it prettier and better. So, if you can, make it better. If you can\'t, it\'s still a great game!' ,

      'This is the most addictive flight simulator I have ever played. The game is fairly easy to progress through without having to spend any money. If I had to find one fault it would be that you can\'t reverse when on a runway which means some times you have no option but to crash your plane as there is very little room to turn around.',
       'So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game',
       'A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job \'fun games for free\' 👏👌🖒☺',
       'Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you\'re having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.',
       'I\'ve been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn\'t force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game\'s development! :)',
       'Pretty cool app. I\'d like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it\'s pretty cool so far.' ,

      'It was a good story line, but only gets a 3 star because you can\'t earn any free diamonds.  Other similar apps give you free diamonds for every chapter you complete.  Plus no diamond scene is less then 20.  I have had 15 diamonds since first chapter of book 1, but can\'t use.  And now in ch 6 Rodrigo has to say he no longer cares about Linda all because you guys won\'t give free diamonds.  I am uninstalling because I can\'t make him say that.',
       'The story line up is excellent and also it deserves to be in the editor\'s choice but it seems like it has issues with earning of diamonds. It deserves 5 stars. But I\'ll give only 3 due to the issue of diamonds. If you spend 35 diamonds you won\'t be left with any and if you spend 20 diamonds you will have 15 diamonds that will be of no you. So plz fix it. Thank you',
       'The story line is awesome, but the spelling and grammar is awful. Words are misspelled, misused, or missing altogether. Sometimes it is so bad it makes it hard to follow. Another thing is you have no choice on the decisions unless you buy diamonds. There should be another way to earn them--like watching ads. Other than that, it is great.',
       'I played the first episode and I kind of enjoyed it. There are a few things I don\'t like about it though:  1. Ticket and Diamond system - Even if you buy a ticket you still need to but diamonds just to enjoy the story. Other games are designed to earn some diamond for certain actions or completing a episode. I wish I could buy the whole game instead of being nickel-and- dimed the whole way through. 2. Force choices - I don\'t think it really gives us the options to make our own choices. It feels forced.  3. Like everyone else: the grammar is making me cringe....',
       'This game is really addictive......i love it alot......but the episode 2 of season 2 is absolutely the same. Pls anyone just let me know if u faced the same problem. And u people should give free diamonds by watching a video or by other means, other than that i love this game. I just hate rodrigo and i want linda to be with BRUNO only❤❤❤❤..........👐👐',
       'The game has a good story line. However, not being able to get diamonds really kills the game choices. We are practically forced to make decisions that we don\'t want and I feel it defeats the purpose of having a choice in the game if we can\'t even choose the choice that we want.' ,

      'Stupid game. I spent so much time on it building just for a higher leveled person to come in a destroyed it to point i couldnt rebuild. Not worth time spent on rebuilding things if higher leveled people just continuously attacking lower leveled teams and wiping them out. Only shows u have to have money to play this game to level up to defend. Im not spending a dime on this retarded game',
       'I\'m impressed. This really is a fun game. And with all of the aid, events and rewards there are you really don\'t need to pay to win. There\'s a lot to learn so you may feel a bit lost at first but it keeps the game from being repetitive. I didn\'t think this would be a 5 star game but after 2 weeks of playing I can tell you that it certainly is. A+ 💯',
       'Great graphics and addictive but not alot of explanation on how to do things. Too many updates in short amount of time,  too long of a waiting time on researches. You need to spend money if you want to keep up with the rest and you\'re placed up against players alot more stronger so always have to go protection buffs. Not an even playing battlefield.',
       'A whole lot of effort to get anything done. They\'re constantly trying to sell you things at obnoxious prices and if you don\'t buy them you\'re setting yourself up to be abused by those foolish enough to waste their money on this game.',
       'Really not happy I have spent loads off money over time on buying gold in the game and packs.. I have had major glitches in the game that have made it a waste of my time and money I have lost over 10 advanced teleports on the game and when I contact your customer service team they don\'t even reply to me.  I find this very bad customer service and that all u want to do is take my hard earned money and not even reimburse me what I have lost.i really enjoy playing this game but this is making me want to not play any more',
       'I really like the game. I think i would rate it higher if i could learn how to use points during battles. Thats a big part of game that i just cant seem to figure out. DONT CONSUME OFFICERS THAT YOU MEANT TO KEEEP' ,

      'The game is fun, but results take 2 and 3 days and if other people are on higher levels they have access to better tableware and vases, pictures etc, so their rooms stand out more and they have a better chance at getting 5 stars. And some items I\'ve purchased don\'t work it gives a message saying they couldn\'t find it in the warehouse. But the game never gave me my gems back and of money. NEED TO FIX IT',
       'I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.',
       'I really love this game! It surely brings out my passion in interior designing, nourish my mind as i see others works, getting inspired also to continue want i really love in life, which is designing/art. And it does help me to chill or relax whenever im depressed bcoz it makes me think what to design, and helps me get out of the stress that life brings. It indeed help me with my mental and emotional instability. 5 stars for this! Number 1 app for me. Never failed my expectations. LOVE IT!',
       'I love this game!! "it helps a lot" with my shopping addiction because I feel like I\'m buying real merchandise. I really enjoy the updates and how you guys added more room to be designed!!!! Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))',
       'I thoroughly enjoy playing this game.  It\'s well made and no technical issues. 2 problems I have is 1) you can\'t sort the items by price and 2) and this one is a big one you can only use an item you purchase 5 times.  That\'s it.  I bought more diamonds so I could purchase more inventory so if you\'re taking my real cash you should let me keep the item in my inventory.  That really turned me off so I definitely will not be purchasing any more diamonds until that changes.',
       'I love this game. But getting keys to buy accessories for the game is difficult unless you buy packages. I can\'t do that. I\'m a single mom so that isn\'t something I can do. You get a daily reward of keys but unless you save them up you end up without pictures to hand, plants to place in yoir design. Sadly if I want to play more often I have to submit my designs without these accessories. But I so love the game!' ,

      'I have only had this game for a few days, so I can\'t write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it\'s up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.',
       'On one of the quest, I think 11. There ia a syrange new animal and I went to the game menu for information and there wasn\'t any. It looks like a brown rabbit, I tried killing Rabbits squirrels and deer, but It wasn\'t the right animal! Is it in the snow biome?  Anyways hope you can help me and otger quest 11 users. It\'ll be great that when you get the same animal twice it counts as duplicate. For example "Wolf Common Duplicate +(however acorns). Thanks and the update is great!',
       'It just lags now. The new update made it to where my chat, my character, and my animations won\'t work. I run about as fast as a turtle, and I am not pregnant. Please fix!!!! I love this game. I have a few questions if you don\'t mind... Can you guys add in multi-player mode, like single player mode, that we can pick up our pups, it would be cool to add that option in the top left menu. Thank you guys so much!! Love the games!!',

That\'d be great Thanks! 😃 Oh, yeah also for the new game seasons, I\'m thinking.. Autumn & Summer! And I like how you can randomize the name! And for dog sim, I\'m thinking.. maybe Samoyed Husky & maybe Chihuahua! 😀😀😀😀',
       'Man i love this game!!! So much better than wolfquest!!! I do hope tht this game soon be added new things like more animal to play as, better in performance. The ad free guys...keep it up!!! Just wondering if there\'s a add as mate system in multiplayer in the future? Anyways....this is the best wolf game tht i played!!! Do hope tht you guys one day add more animals to play as (like a snow leopard for example)',
       'The best app EVER! You start as a wolf and than get a fox, than lynx! You can play online and get stronger! No dirty language, they will stop that speech, if more rudeness ban speech for a while, nonstop, banned from all multi! It makes it a clean and fun game as you can also play as a baby animal, when it\'s ready to grow you don\'t have to grow it right away, you just press a button to grow!    I encourage you to play this game and rate it too!' ,

      'To many ads, and if you insist on all the red toy cats and spikes then you need to give free revives. And seems to me that on every new level  the mouse gets slower and the cats get faster. I thought this was a good game for children but if you make it to hard for them then they will not want to play it.',
       'It will not even let you get through the school portion of the game. Starts glitching at 7 in the school portion. Didn\'t even get to play the game that is so BAD, really glad didn\'t pay for anything',
       'Game is good but it has some bad spots in it for instance like a sandwich with mouldy spots. I waited this 2 toms and it was all because there was too much times and it was too much bad really😒🙁☹️',
       'I really like this game, it\'s fun and retro but still has that old school flow from the show. It\'s easy and difficult at the same time and that keeps it interesting',
       'I can\'t get the knack for controlling Jerry. He\'s sooooo slowwwww and Tom is so very FAST!  Very difficult to get very far past the School level.  Need more transport holes or vases and plants to hide behind. So many great comments, it\'s baffling to me.  Wish I  knew the tricks to get as far as a lot of the reviewers do.  Looks like it COULD BE A FUN GAME, but in present form, it\'s too challenging for me.  Bummer. Guess I\'ll have to uninstall it.',
       'I like this game bcz i lov tom&jerry  But it has too many ads and sometimes it s not control to move little hang dont knw y.. but this game is osm...not get bore to play' ,

      'I would like my 1.79 x2 money back. I clicked on some equipment and it said to upgrade. I brought the dimoans to up grade. To fine it upgrades to one star so you still can\'t make any extra recipes. I\'m now stuck where I can\'t move forwards with the firework order as I can\'t get the recipe. I had enough with this game as I feel as u get into it the more money you expect people to spend as you can\'t do stuff. I Spent about 20 pounds so far when u add it all up. No that not much to some people but there was no point. I wish I could ask for the money back. But I know this won\'t happen. I use to love this game. But I don\'t at the moment.it also nothing like the video you show',
       'I wish there was no such thing as 💰 in this game, everything is for free because I\'m struggling to upgrade coconut flakes to level 3. Also, there are some errors about this my café update. There is no character named Comet when it says new character: Comet. And it says holiday ingredient fortune cookies, are there any fortune cookies no. Please fix this as soon as possible as my sister and I are feeling really angry because we want fortune cookies in this game. Apart from those errors that I not long said, I say that this game is good.',
       'Until recently, I would have given a 5 star review, but lately this game has been very frustrating. I keep getting this message that my profile has been changed, so I have to reload the game, and it erases some of my progress. This has even made it erase that I\'ve completed some orders for Diego, so I have to complete them over again, and restart my 2 hour wait. I\'m trying to save enough money to buy the pudding display case, but it\'s difficult when I suddenly lose $20,000-$50,000 at a time. Does anybody know how to contact tech support?',
       'Unfortunately I have to rate it 1 star from 5star. Previously this app was running smoothly in my device. But since the last update, everytime I am running it on my ASUS Zenfone 2 Laser, it is giving a message that unfortunately the app has stopped responding. I am really really hating this. During the special offer where Diego had visited, I can\'t even run the app properly. Moreover I can\'t complete the festival tasks. It is just causing too much problem. Hope you all will resolve this as soon as possible.',
       'I love this game! It\'s great for fast reflexs. It helps with social intelligence since you talk with yor customers and it gives you choices to start off the conversation! I also love the spice box and how you make special recipes! This couldn\'t get any better! 5/5 for me!',
       'For a whole day I\'ve been playing this game until it stopped working recently. Its always showed that my server isnt working properly when in real life it\'s actually working just fine with other apps and games. I hope you can fix this problem.' ,

      'Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I\'ve never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.',
       'The game is my little boys favourite but the recent batch of adverts in game (Yahoo specifically) don\'t close - meaning you have to force quit the game. Lazy programming and terrible QA process from the developers. Avoid.',
       'Whoever decided to put the HW Poppa wheelie in the game is an idiot. Loved this game until i came across that car. Im seconds away from fully upgrading and moving on but i couldnt let it go. That car is a load of frustration.',
       'The game just started to crash Everytime I opened the game. Other than that it is very addictive and challenging game. Now it is constantly crashing and can\'t play the game anymore. I have uninstalled and won\'t be playing it anymore.',
       'It\'s really really fun  ut the game restarts when I start an ad, or when it\'s finished with an ad. It also restarts after certain levels (depending on how longs it\'s been or what I lress). It\'s the only thinf that is annoying. Other than that, this game is addictive lmao',
       'Upgrading the vehicles makes little to no improvement to their performance, which makes the game too frustrating. For example you get stuck at exactly the same place without enough grip to go up a dumb hill no much how much you upgrade your car. There\'s no skill involved.  The game forces you to keep playing the same tracks until you get a better car.' ,

      'So many of the questions are just advertisements in disguise. Most of the questions are way too easy, very boring, and stupid. The range of topics used for questions is fairly narrow. This game is a huge disappointment and doesn\'t really satisfy those who want something that closely approximates the actual TV show and the questions that appear on it. I just started playing this game and I think I am very close to uninstalling it.',
       'The English is terrible, half of the time the questions make no sense. Sometimes two of the four answer options will be the same word and it\'s pot luck if you click the right one',
       'The English questions are written by someone who doesn\'t speak English.  In many cases none of the answers are correct e.g. they ask who driver a F1 car - there is no answer driver - the correct answer is pilot !',
       'I guess  whowever submits the questions is not a natural English speaking person. Also some of the answers are just plain wrong.',
       'I had 2 change my rate comment cause,,this game is absolutely challenging to the brain. FUN game 2 be played w/friends.',

      'I mean, come on! It\'s a fantastic game. At least some of us should try something new! The creator spent days trying to create it for us. Why don\'t we appreciate it? At least give the fantastic creator credit, because you can just leave suggestions. We don\'t have to push them.',
       'want a fun game to play? Your in luck. Download now. Its short, but challenging. Don\'t waste time looking for games that you  like but don\'t. its very easy to upload. I was very happy when I found something I could upload...THIS GAME. its free and fun. Enjoy playing this! Thanks for reading.',
       'Well, I don\'t even know how to start the game. First, they show me the starting video. Then I just have 20 coins and I can\'t do anything except for changing the 2 people\'s clothes. I would be thankful for anybody who tells me how to start the game. But I really like the mansion\'s design.',
       'Okay, I guess I mean there isn\'t a point to this game. you just keep doing the same thing over and over again. It\'s not the worst thing I played bit defiantly needs some updates, But it isn\'t that bad of a game. All I can say is try it, if you like it, good for you!',
       'FOR THOSE WHO DOESN\'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY: When you get to the homescreen, go to the bottom right and you\'ll see a play button, press that and it\'ll start the fun. For those who hate this, why can\'t you observe closely first before screaming your complaints? Can\'t you see the game creator worked hard just in order to entertain you and you repay them with complaints on not knowing how to play?What if you created a game and others complain not knowing how to play? Is that nice?(Not to offend) thank you',
       'Disappointed It was cute but its really boring, you get a timer that goes too fast, meaning you can\'t get things done in time! You don\'t have control of them, they tell you what to do next so no free will, its not like the sims for kids' ,

      'The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I\'d like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.',
       'Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It\'s very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again',
       'The more stuff is added the lagier it gets. Game freezes when buying items, when going over your city, with the chat, loading the flobsl trade, travelling to other cities and basicly everything nowadays. Requires multiple restarts of the game and reboots of my phone regularly to keep jt playable nowadays. It used to be really good and smooth, but it only gets worse each update and no improvement in sight. I only play now because I made some good friends in my club, but the actual fun is long gone. :(',
       'This is a great game,very addicting, but can you please fix the glitch that makes everything either too big or too small. The contest of mayors screen doesnt even show up  only shows up one third. Will rate higher once this is fixed, its very annoying',
       'Game is basic in its features. The worst part of the game is the trade hq. Rather than letting you buy directly off the hq menue you have to load the other players city. If your phone doesnt load it as fast as someone else they can snipe the goods you need to buy.',
       'Lots of potential! A EA omega blog headquarters building for idears would be good. bring back the cinema, city with no cinema! Simcity needs a expansion. Don\'t like the desaster battle concept, it should of been a stock exchange battle concept. and had a better approach to the desasters.like Desasters emergency service building with weekly events for random desaster repairs for existing and new realistic scenarios. Get rid of vu building and desaster island and replace it with emergency desaster service building and a weather towers. Then instead of having to event there would be 3 online events.' ,

      'This game is just impossible to finish, even if you spend lots of real money. 66% of the game (trick and powder) is about pulling tricks out and you can\'t even choose which ones. Controls are very bad and graphics also. The only thing that makes it more fun is the online challenges, but other than that this game sucks. I would expect a whole lot more from Red Bull.',
       'Did you write this program on a 2007 droid razr? Cause the loading times are ridiculous for the amount of processing that should be going on in this game. Also, the tutorial was frustrating, and controls terrible.',
       'It\'s REALLY laggy and the tutorial goes on forever about upgrading loading is really long too but the graphics and such are good. But please fix this',
       'What\'s with the slo-mo while you\'re in the air? Makes it hard to spin and flip fast!',
       'The game is ok but frustrating at times.',

      'This game is ok. The graphics are good. It\'s my favourite bowling game out there.  However I really don\'t know why this needs access to my phone contacts and other permissions.  As a result it\'s been removed. Apps and games need to sort out their permissions for what it needs to do. If it\'s not required I\'m not installing it. Other than that complaint it\'s actually a nice game for a quick 5 minute time waster.',

       'First if all... Its down right BORING! Also there is adds after every single level! Sometimes the adds are weird and innaproprete! I do NOT reccomend this game, download at your own risk😕',
       'I liked the game and all but there were way to many ads. Every level there was a thirty second video playing and some of them were extremely inappropriate. I got a bit impatient waiting for all the ads to end but I liked the game set-up. I think that was a neat idea. I just think it would be better without all the interruptions',
       'You see I\'m not the only person  who wouldn\'t recommend this game. Adds constantly and how could you play they game when it\'s so tricky to drive. I thought it was my bad driving but it seems I\'m not the only one who disliked this game.so  please make some improvements. I could drag you through all the bad things but I won\'t make you suffer. So I will give it sadly a 👎.' ,

      'I had previously given this game a 1 star but for this update I\'m blown away by the network rectification aspect. The game runs butter smooth even after post FUP data speeds. The game is currently saturated with lvl 140 players with all the prestige weapons, so I\'d request you to bring about a balanced match making in the PvP based on their matching levels and introduce some welcome benefits for the returning players',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s by Gameloft so it\'s bound to be a good phone game. It\'s not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn\'t hold your hand but it\'s not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you\'re also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it\'s definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I\'m stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)',
       'It\'s a best game on playstore!!! I play it lot of.. and it\'s my favourite game.. but one problem is that when i start multiplayer match it says sercer not found or server overloaded. But it doesent matter for much. I give all 5 star for best graphics, bedt controls, and also bestest weapons. I love this game. Thank you gameloft. We expect that you will keep developing games like modern combat. I am waiting anxiously for next series. Thank you.',
       'This probably the best FPS game in the Play Store. Graphics, animations, music, voice actings everything in this game are awesome. 😊  The game runs in my phone in full 60 fps on Ultra-high settings. But sometimes it crashes without any reason and when I run the game again, it starts to verify game data. My phone is not rooted and I do believe the problem is not in my phone, it\'s a bug in the game. 😕  Overall, it\'s a great game. ☺️  Peace out. 🤘',
       'This game is awesome.  But plzzzz ban clone paragon  first plzz plzz plzz.  Every match i see 2 or three paragon...  And mc5 is best game so far... One more thing this game turn into pay to win i think so plzzz reduce  the pay to win system and in match give 40 to 50 credit 10 credit is very lowest credit  to unlock items.... So plzzzz ban paragon first and give extra free credit  resources to earn in multilayer match....',
       'Played one time, loved it. But now when I open it again, its stuck on "loading player profile" screen. I\'m pretty sure its not a mobile phone problem, either its a server issue or a bug.  Edited: I got past the loading screen, it takes simple procedures like \'clear cache\' and cellphone reboot. But you\'ll have to do these everytime you want to play so I\'m uninstalling for now. Hope its fixed soon.' ,

      'Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can\'t play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.',

       'The developers know they have a good game.  So they make sure to lock being a good player behind the $30 a month VIP pay wall, but even that guarantees you nothing.  And even that does not guarantee you anything.  Every card is unknown, unless you spend close to 10k gems for a tier 7 card pack.    I\'ve said this before.  I\'d rather spend $69 and have everything...then spend  $30 a month on VIP that does not give you anything.',
       'Money hungry devs. Makes promises to VIPs but don\'t deliver. Shoddy customer service with all answers given off a script but never really answer your concerns. Take plenty, give SFA back. Battery draining, laggy and constant bugs. Best decision I just made was to cancel my membership based on the fact that these people really do not GAF about their players, especially their VIPs when it is not a cheap membership to have.' ,

      'I like it a lot but I hate how the drawings are so linked with pokemon go. I hate pokemon go!!!!! The graphics are okay but I wish they were a bit better quality. It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn\'t like how easy the drawings were and I don\'t think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn\'t recommend this game if you don\'t like colouring. It\'s ok!!!!',
       'I think there should be more cartoons to draw and color. And it should not always be right colors to trace it in. Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn\'t color the whole background, because what if you didn\'t want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!',
       'I love this app! It\'s sooo good. And its brilliant for when your bored. But its a little hard sometimes to go over the lines with our fingers as the lines are so thin. But overall I think it\'s a fantastic app!',
       'It\'s a great app however it keeps crashing and I have to start the drawing all over again. The whole app stops and my drawing starts over and it\'s really annoying. If this gets fixed I will definitely rate 5 stars',
       'I like it because it teaches young artists how to draw animated characters such as Pokémon Avengers Princess and loads more characters from movies like Snow white and the seven dwarfs and Toy story 2! Overall it is a brilliant app for boys and girls of all ages!',
       'It\'s great except when I\'m learning sometimes the next step button blocks some of the drawing so I can\'t see what to trace over plz fix this' ,

      'There is a huge delay from when you hit the key to when you hear the key and too many ads. I was trying to find something good to get down song ideas so I wasn\'t the intended consumer and I can see how this could he good for learning, but you could get the same thing off youtube and not have the excessive ads.',
       'It\'s pretty good, and good enough to warm up my voice and practice before singing at my church, and when I\'m bored I just play the songs that comes with the app. And it\'s also handy for when I don\'t have my bass guitar at hand and trying figure out song notes and chords, this is pretty useful. I like it.',
       'It didn\'t work. (Desclaimer: NO HATE, JUST BUGS AND STUFF THAT DIDN\'T WORK)  Very laggy and so many glitches,  I\'m just stating the cons, no hate. It just didn\'t work for me and when I tried to record, it got all glitchy and recorded multiple at a time. I tried to press keys but it wasn\'t picking anything up. After a while, all the keys I pressed came into a big bundle and sometimes, it randomly recorded for no reason. Again, no hate. I just found a lot of bugs, which I would be happy to play this piano with, if the developers fixed it. I couldn\'t move the keyboard as well. I tried to drag it to a different spot, but no avail. Just a couple of things that didn\'t work for me, like how it wasn\'t timed when I pressed a certain button. (NO HATE)',
       'Got annoyed by the notifications. Calm down, it\'s just a piano app. There are plenty of them, no way I\'m paying $20 to remove the ads.',
       'If you take synthesia tutorials and apply them to this app, you might just be able to play any song! I can\'t say I love this app but I really like it. .... I change my mind, I do love this app! Glad I chose this one ♡ (watch for adds though)',
       'The ads are literally infuriating, if I let my phone lock it\'ll open with another freakin ad. Then when I\'m trying to play I\'ll accidentally click on an ad and it\'ll redirect me. I\'M JUST TRYING TO PRACTICE. This app used to be good but now it\'s riddled with ads like a virus. Do NOT get this app.' ,

      'Ffxv most sad story I dont like how this game end. noctic die luna freya die.I buy ur full episode  The pocket edition easy to play good graphic good game who dosent have time busy working will have time to play at their phone. Good job square enix hope you guys do more a game like this on phone. Not all player hv time to play at home.',
       'waited a long time for this release and my 2 month old premium android device is not supported. Why can I play any other game in the app store except this one? Come on square, please make your resolution adaptable or whatever the issue is like you did with all your other games',
       'I\'m late to the world of Final Fantasy, I\'ve always know about it but I am not a fan of turn based action. Then Finial Fantasy XV comes out for XBOX ONE X and I still ignore it. I noticed that it came out for mobile and as I just purchased a Razer Phone I decided to give it a try and I loved it. Then I just finished watching Kingsglave on Netflix and I\'m hooked. So because of a Android game I have now watched a movie and pre ordered the Windows edition to through my top spec gaming rig at it in all its glory. Love it.',
       'Translating a vast experience like FFXV from PC/Consoles to mobile, while keeping the feel and atmosphere virtually unchanged is no easy task, yet Square has managed to pull it off.  I have had absolutely no bugs or glitches and thoroughly enjoyed my time experiencing this tale in the palm of my hand. This should be the new standard of what "mobile gaming" is held to rather than F2P and freemium nonsense. This is extremely well-made and executed. Hats off, Square',
       'Love what you have done with this game, the gameplay is incredible and it feels just like the ps4 version. After waiting so long for this to come out, it is better than I could have imagined. The the only thing that i would change would be to add the option to chose to use a joy stick. I don\'t mind using touch for everything else, but would love to at least have the option to use a joy stick for moving around. Other than that though, very impressed with the game.',
       'Oh WOW Square Enix you have nailed this. It is so easy to play, so fun and the gameplay is just perfect for mobile. Those who are complaining just need faster phones. 10 minutes into this game and all I can say is this is amazing!! It is definately a much better launch than ff15 on ps4. 10/10!  PS. Game is now stuck on loading screen when I try to load game. Needs to be fixed!' ,

      'Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.',
       'Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning',
       'Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I\'m just going to name some things that I\'m sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I\'m just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!',
       'Absolutely amazing game!!! I\'m a huge petrol head and this ticks all boxes considering it\'s a phone game. Love the controls. Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress. Literally one downfall... upgrade costs when you get higher spec cars. Apart from that... GOOD JOB!!!',
       'Great Graphics. Good Game with plenty of new challenges. Annoying things are cars that you pass continually try to run you off the track. Or jump in front of you at the last second when overtaking. Or spin your car 180 deg when you are braking. Or you bounce backwards at rediculous speed if you rear end a car slightly. Laggy online game play. Has periods where the game goes into slow motion at the most demanding part of a race. Sound drops out occasionally.',
       'This game is brilliant. Have been playing it for ages. However the updates are messing with previous games, especially NASCAR I\'ve been playing previous events but with update they\'ve gone and replaced by new ones, I\'ve been working towards cars etc....all gone. Slightly annoying guys. Keep up with the good work etc but leave the previous ones alone please.' ,

       'I really like this game and its one that I can play continuously, my only problem is that I can only play once a day.. the game will work for as long as I play but as soon as I exit I can\'t back on until the following day. It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can\'t just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...',
       'Good but buggy Good but buggy, one can earn infinite money in no time then u can upgrade ur vehicle to the max in the very first level. That destroys the fun of the game. Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.',

When i searched on google for any helping contact email id or website, there is no email for help.  So tell me,  what should I do? Either solve my problem or i am going to file a case against you. Contact me as soon as possible.',

I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don\'t read it before. I can\'t find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....',
       'Fun game but janky/sketchy ads. The ads will unmute your device and turn up the volume before they play, over and over again, so you can\'t​ play the game anywhere quiet. The "x" button on the ads is not in the right position, so tapping it doesn\'t close the ad and you have to hunt for the hidden close button.

      'Online matchmaking is utterly broken and totally pay to win. Total mismatches being paired up against guys 5 levels higher with all higher card levels as well. Unless you\'ve got money to burn don\'t waste time grinding through ranks cause 45+ will best you down. Even if you do have the money to burn your still better off using it to keep warm as throwing it at this game will just give you the faintest satisfaction you\'ve accomplished something by simply having access to better cards then those you face.',
       'Simple spawn battle game. It has card elements which sucks be sure card collecting in a phone game is just a money grab. It\'s fun, but I\'m waiting for the point where I suddenly find the game unbeatable and buying a $35 pack of cards seems reasonable... cause yeah, they sell a single pack for that much.',
       'I just downloaded this yesterday and I\'ve only been able to play it 2 short times! First it kept saying no network connection when I really did. Then after force closing a bunch of times and clearing data, it finally let me on. Then I go to go back on it and it\'s doing it again! I have barely been able to play this game, please fix!',
       'Since I\'m the last person who isn\'t cheating here\'s 3 suggestions... synch pvp so both players get the same energy. Temp ban every player generating more energy than possible in a game. Cheating players don\'t pay, they don\'t need to. This game would be awesome if 90% of the players weren\'t cheating. And a 3rd suggestion... synch pvp games so players get the same energy .',
       'The constant loading screens are a pain. The fact that this game forces you to spend money to get better loot is horrible. The random loot lockers are awful, a lot of times the rewards you get are the worst, and even if you play a level several times there is no guarantee that you eventually would get better cards or upgrades from it. Even if you try to grind there is not much of a progress or reward from it. This is definitely a pay to win game.',
       'Like the others say: Too much pay to win Lots of poor sportsmanship, without ability to block I\'m always paired against higher level opponents. If you like a game that is constantly difficult and irritating, play this. Also, install ES File explorer, and it will show you all the background ads they download on your phone!' ,

      'Uninstalling. The controls are imprecise (ball would slip off the desired direction occasionally) and the order of the colours would make it impossible to win on occasion. I can forgive the first thing (muscle) but making it impossible to win is not forgivable.  Work on the algorithm.',
       'It was great at first. Addicting. I was really looking forward to more levels but they suck. Too many kinds of bubbles. Why did the update change old levels too? Major disappointment.  Edit 2/19/18: it was back to being great when they took away all the extra kinds of bubbles. But after a few hundred levels...they\'re back. Balls with three locks, slime, water bubbles or whatever that is. Lured people back in and then disappointed again.',
       'Too many ads. Devs are getting greedy with how many ads they put in, I got 3 before I even got to play. Don\'t bother with this junk.',
       'Games really nice good mind challenge, great for color match making if color blind. You may not know what colors your matching however, ever since i started playing i\'ve also been getting better at matching my clothes and random day to day organising of colored items. Love the game however the ball simetimes seems to go where it wants to instead of where you released it... I noticed this a few times i would aim let go and the line would randomly jump to a new spot and the ball shots almost a completely diffrent location',
       'I loved the game before they updated everything. I hate the new levels and the slim and ice balls. I enjoyed this game bcz it was easy and calming but now its just annoying and frustrating!!😫😫😭😤😢',
       'Was very much enjoying the game but the new update has moved the ball switcher underneath the ad bar.... So I can no longer switch between one ball and the next... I suppose I can\'t play anymore because that\'s just frustrating.' ,

      'So I\'m changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it\'s a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I\'d rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!',
       'Scopely is the most greedy, disgusting company I have ever seen. The ads they have littered into the game play literally crash the game at least 4 times during a match. You will see about 10 ads on top of the crashing per game; you could be in mid roll and the ad will ruin it. So desperate for money.. Don\'t support scopelys terrible practices.',
       'Too many ads, basically requires you to buy dice. Literally the only way to ensure a win is to have dice for re-rolls. This wouldn\'t be a problem except you\'ll hardly ever win dice with the scratchers, and when you do it\'ll be one.  It\'s all a cash grab, and the ads every 3 or 4 rolls are intrusive, frequently locked in, and always very annoying. Gameplay itself is simple but just way too many ads.',
       'Dice Masters cheat. Games are rigged. Too many ads! I needed one 5. Rolled 9 times and not one. Dice Dog is very annoying!! Dice Prize Claw gives dice you already have! Played 10 times and gave me dice I already had 8 times. How dumb is that?!?',
       'This is total bull!! Cant play due to people leacing and i am not waiting 30 damn minutes again on one person too roll! Do not waste your time!!! They do not care if your opponent stays away from the game for forever. I am not waiting days to finish one game this is harrasment! Pissed off and uninstalled!',
       'It has become a chore to try and play.  Infomercials after every 2 rounds?  It is unreal.  Several friends have stopped playing and I am getting close to deleting as well.  Ads cause game play and tablet to slow down.  This game used to be fun' ,

      'Love it! I remember saying to myself while playing Dog Hotel "man I wish they\'d make one for horses" and you did!! I love the game play, a tad bit repetitive but over-all a fantastic job. I especially love the wide range of horse breeds (the unicorn was a surprise indeed), and how easy (but not too easy) it is to get Coins. Buying the horse breed pack really isn\'t that expensive, a fair price, and definitely affordable. Thank you, can\'t wait to what else you come up with!',
       'I love horses and this horse game is soooo good! Its really fun!! But I think it needs more detail like when u do dressage and jumping u use a English saddle not a western but in the game they use a western saddle, in steed. And I think that u wouldn\'t need to pay for different horse breeds. Overall it needs to have more realistic details.',
       'I live this game and hopefully you can make more improvements such as more to do. Also, I used $2.99 and bought the paddock expansion pack after I unlocked them all thinking there would be more to it and there wasn\'t!!  I want my money back. I\'ll keep the horse variety one but I want the money back regarding the expansion because there wasn\'t anything different after I bought it and you didn\'t have any kind of statement saying anything.',
       'Really repetitive, and all the horses are so similar and everything you do is always the same. The care tasks went quickly at least, but the riding style ones were dull and long. Graphics are very nice, just not much to do.',
       'Wow this game is awesome.  I was a lil skeptical at first.. But for a free game it\'s pretty great. You can do lunging, show jumping, dressage , etc. You can look after the horses that are in your hotel and do chores/missions.  Has a variety of different horses and achievements.   Really love this game. Thank you. 5 stars. ☆☆☆☆☆  I just wish there was a lil more to do as it does get boring and repetitive. ..',
       'Overall the apps OK but u guys seriously need to put more breeds of horses into the game for people who don\'t want to or can\'t pay for the horse packages and maybe if u guys like added a couple horses that were rejected and could stay at the hotel until a person came  and bought it to up our cash faster. Also maybe create a more diverse races\\obstacle course. And when the horses come in that need to be cleaned u could make their coats look filthy and shiny when they are cleaned to up the rating of the graphics' ,

      'Keep booting me out of the game. Did what they suggested in the technical FAQ without success. Email support; several days later, they replied with "make sure you have the latest version installed", which I have already stated so in my email. I can play for a few minutes, or seconds, whenever I am able to get into the game. A real disappointment.',
       'Hi guys really like this game, its fun nd simple. Love the idea of visiting the other farms but please add something to do while at friends farms/ a quick quest for loyalty points would be nice. A few issues that i have with it is that u can only do one upgrade/build at a time so it takes forever to get the tasks completed! The developers should really consider allowing us to do multiple upgades at once. One more thing is the amount of money u need to spend on the game to have all slots opened in the market nd for the water tower nd nursery upgrades. Please make it possible to get the required blue prints nd certificates without the need to spend money. Overall a very nice game. THANK YOU GOOD GAMES',
       'I love the game!  But the times on harvesting and updating are ridiculous! The higher you go in levels the times and money get horribly expensive 6 to 12 hours is way to long to wait. It would be great if we were allowed to make updates to one field and one building at the same time. I work a full time job so I can\'t be on 24/7. And if I can\'t get my harvesting done and meet quotas I will be booted from my co-op. Please help us working folks! Thank you!',
       'Well I like the game and I like that we can play with others for challenges and ever point counts.   My team is very encouraging.  Unfortunately there is a bug which shows connection error then it asks to retry but it sighs us off the program. I have emailed tech support for help no answer back yet.',
       'I really love this game.  I would give it 5 stars but it still has some issues, even though it\'s much better after the latest update.  I know this is a new game and I\'m confident as the game grows in use, the overall user issues will be addressed.  I hope to update my rating to 5 stars soon!  I recommend this game to anyone.  I also would say that the best way to fully enjoy the game is to work as a team with the group you join.',
       'I love this game, but after playing for a few months now i have realised that the developers are only after your money..you cannot go forward without spending large amounts of money..Not gonna happen from me. Great game, Shame you cant play ut to its full potential. Not impressed anymore. :(' ,

      'Just too many ads interrupted while I was playing and then ended up dead to start all over. And another thing.. I don\'t understand how you or the gamers collects coins to get a new characters. Graphic is great the control is alright just a bit hard but an introduction would work and teach us how to play it right way. I love this game and it is fun and a great time killer too. Just remove the ads and leave the in app purchase there.',
       'Really good game and I can\'t stop playing, however, there are some faults as when the monkey teeters on the edge it is impossible to play without dieing. The monkey should be either on or off the block. Also the rope drags the monkey back so you often die because of that. But other than that it is a really good game. There are quite a few adverts but it doesn\'t bother me.',
       'I don\'t understand how I could be playing this for such long I mean first I did read the reviews but I thought because they love this game they are telling it addictive. But when i played yes of course i found out it is really addictive. This game deserves a 👍',
       'I really liked the game (can\'t stop playing) seriously! But the only thing that made me give four stars is that there are ads every two seconds it completely distroyes the whole game not fun...',
       'I absolutely loved the game it self but after I played it again like the 3rd time the monkeys before I touched the screen would move alone and I had no control. And there was a lot but not too much ads. But I loved it because its challenging. Plus I love love LOVE monkeys!',

      'I was very surprised  at the diversity of things you can do. And you can speed up EVERYTHING MANUALLY. Ads are optional with selective rewards of either money or one of the three materials you use to build stuff with. The exclusive currency can be bought with irl money or exchanged for materials or in-game cash. Not like any tap game I\'ve ever played, I\'m very impressed! This is a keeper!',
       'This is the best tap games out there. It really loves up to its word saying to timers, unlike SimCity and just about every other game out there. Its easy to play and advance so it sets a wide age range. I would like to personally thank the devs for coming out with this game, something a was looking for for a while. 10/10. Keep up the good work!',
       'Absolutely excellent! I love the freedom of building whatever you like within reason. One thing that could improve it, and it might just be me thinking this, is that the buildings look different as you level them up. I do know that they look different at level 5, but at other levels it would be great, so you remember what level a building is. The idea that each building looks different, regardless of the type of building is still awesome, because it adds a slight feeling of difference and uniqueness. For example, I have come across at least 3 types of apartment and office, so my city/town doesn\'t all look the same. Keep up the good work! 👍',
       'I adore this game, it\'s such a time waster (in a good way)! I wish that the camera controls were compatible with wireless mice. only reason being is because I broke my screen and I can\'t use too much touch screen. :( apart fro',
       'Absolutely love this game, its customisable and you make your city however you want to. One thing I eould like to see is alternative buildings, like instead of a power plant, a hydro plant. Also plz add buildings that can go in the ocean like bridges. Overall love it',
       'It is true that there is no timer but instead your energy runs out very fast! At the end it takes too much time to build a real city!  Also has nothing innovative comparing to other games.' ,

      'I really enjoy this game.  It reminds me of Township, but of course it\'s unique in its own way. I do have some feedback that I\'ve noticed while playing.   It takes a very long time to level up.  I\'m almost at lvl. 12 and want to be able to expand more, but you either have to pay or just wait it out.  Also, some of the decorations, like trees and street signs, are expensive for no reason.  Finally, it is a little difficult to move items when in edit mode. Compared to Township, their edit mode is smoother, but overall, I do really love playing these types of games!',
       'Cityville with better controls. Infact the developer has put their heart and soul to making the game  requiring as minimal input as possible and more enjoyment   Example would be re-seeding the farm. Click one farm and plant. A pop up appears on every farm to plant same crop. Just need to click  it. Same for supplying businesses',
       'Great game with really nice graphic. The only thing I wish that there would be some way to move small objects easier. Some quests are really hard to finish on time, but I giess they\'re comsiderably worthy. Best building game I\'ve ever played so far. Keep up the great work!',
       'It\'s a good game. Just that some of the quests really suck. Like the one I\'ve been working on for a week, have to collect 50 Fragile stickers. I have 20 Stationary stores, but when I collect from them I\'m lucky to get 1 or 2 Stickers out of 20 stores. It\'s REALLY FRUSTRATING.',
       'I absolutely love this game. Thank you for responding. I think all of your updates are making this game very addictive and I love playing it, I play it in all my spare time! For people who enjoy building and doing tasks some may be more difficult than others but that is the challenge of the game I really think everyone should try it I don\'t really play games but this one is that good',
       'I really like the game mechanics in this city-builder, but I\'m not a fan of how some of the clothing is immodest and there\'s weird stuff like a romance-themed reality show. I wish it was geared more toward an all-ages audience.' ,

      'I hate it! There is only three looks to do, and the make up! Literally you have to click on it a thousand times until you get the one you like. The cloths aren\'t that bad, but they can be a little more pretty. They should make it for boys and girls, so you can dress up boys, and maybe the boys can take a girl on a date so, they could get married and then they can have children but, it would be a life cycle! They would start out as babies and grow on and get married!!! Hope you like my feedback!! P.S. Plz update the game!!!',
       'I gave you 4/5 star\'s, if you make a second version then i will install it again and play it then make it 5/5 star\'s, if not i will move on to more dress up game\'s and other types of games',
       'Really! you could only do their makeup and dress them up! BORING! Hmmph!',
       'I 😍 this game. The themes we have to dress her up for like school is awesome but may I suggest new theme\'s, sports,first date, and beach. Any way ❤ the game. PIECE OUT!',
       'It\'s boring because you can only do three themes and all you can do is makeup hair and dress up sorry not the best game',

      'I really enjoy playing this game. It helps me to relax while I am watching TV, or even using in split mode while watching a video or something. It\'s a bit different then the way I originally used to play Klondike, but still a great game and easy to get used to quickly! I don\'t mind the 5 second or so ads between games. It\'s the price you pay to get a good, free game. It\'s not like they play constantly and during a game there is usually an ad on the bottom screen but it will quickly move if you go to start a new game or need to access the other options.',
       'I would have scored higher except there is suddenly super annoying music being played that there is no option to turn off. The ads also now autoplay loud music. I agree with another poster who said it starting to seem like you lose more so you see more ads. I liked this because it was good for a quick game while getting ready to sleep. The music ruins this. I\'m going to try another app now.',
       'It\'s a fun relaxing game. Its so addictive that every device I have, must have this game. I have it on my phone, ipad and tablet. Except my laptop cuz then I would get no work done. About the ads, one pops out each time you finish a game, so I\'m not to bothered by it. Also, theres no videos too watch in order to earn coins or diamonds because none are needed. I just love it. Its stress free.',
       'I love the game solitaire played it on many different computers over the years. Downloaded three other version on my phone. All of which I deleted almost straight away because they were finicky and I didn\'t like the format. This one is easy to use and no glitches. So far so good.',
       'It won\'t allow me to add my own pic for background. Maybe too big of a file but I know other solitare let me. I also wish there wasn\'t commercials after the win or lose because they interrupt my music but I hear you guys make money that way so let it be. I\'ll continue to play because I like solitare and the commercials only pause my music and don\'t cut it completely off to play the commercial, like other apps.',
       'Terrible ads. So bad they hid the menu bar behind an ad banner so you click the ads just to access settings. Pretty sure they recently increased losing deal rate to make more ad videos play. So many other solitaire aps available so skip this one.' ,

      'If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It\'s by far the best maze game app I\'ve come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I\'ve tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It\'s the only maze puzzle app I\'ve found worth playing! 😀💜',
       'Time killer. B&W colors are a bit hard on the eyes after awhile. I wish the controls weren\'t so touchy. Even if I\'m using my stylus it\'s easy to move into a wrong corner by accident when you know it\'s not the right direction.',
       'I\'m not far into it, but it\'s fun so far. My eyesight could be why it\'s not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It\'s still a very good game though.',
       'I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven\'t played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I\'ll have to download a separate kid version for her.',
       '5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes',
       'Where is the challenge? This game is as lame as the rest of the maze games. If you would  try make the game more challenging then maybe I would not have deleted it.' ,

      'Such a bad game. Nekki never gets enough of money so they show ads nearly after every fight. You can\'t earn gems from watching videos as it\'s never available. Tapjoy offers have been completed, but never awarded. All the weapons gets worser as you level up. Nekki wants you to BUY the good weapons. Bad game. Shadow fight 3 is worser than this one.',
       'This game is requires you to spend cash if you wanna get strong or atleast equivalent to the game difficulty scaling. It requires spending more gold or gems rather than actual skills with over priced weapons and gears. The controls are not sensitive and clunky. Overall. Could have been a great game but greedy developers.',
       'Let me just say I don\'t mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high',
       'Its a good game but consuming a lot of time because every next opponent is OP and i have to  buy  every new weapons after defeating  one opponent or craft it without which i will be crush down with 2,3 critical hits  and the coins are hard to find plus the energy should be unlimited. So that the game will be more fun',
       'The game crashes unexpectedly even in the middle of a fight and when I return the energy I used for the fight when it crashed is already consumed when I didn\'t even finish it.  It evwn crashes in the middle of a raid =(    The game is good but I hope the crashing is fixed. I restart my phone and it works smoothly after that but I can\'t have my phone restartung every time I want to play. Please fix this',
       'Challenges ruin the experience. Mandatory in order to progress and level up. Some challenges are just ridiculous, and frustrating when you\'re given five tries and having to watch a thirty second ad to get one back every time, even if you make a simple mistake. Other than that it\'s good.' ,

      'I LOVE this game ... like I am so hooked.... I spend way too much money though because I love all the dragons so much just so adorable I always buy the dragon bundles.   It does suck whenever you get so high up with feeding your dragons then it costs a lot of food to feed them like if I didn\'t buy so many dragon bundles I would have a hard time feeding them to higher levels... Even now it\'s hard.  Anyways I am addicted to this game though other than that!  ♡♡',
       'This game is very addictive, fun, and a great game over all. Eventually if you play it long enough there isn\'t much you can do on the app until you wait but other then that it\'s a decent time killer. I haven\'t ran into any issues with the game and I recomended installing it',
       'Honestly a great game. It has ads but those are optional. You only view ads if you want some extra stuff. You click on a button to view the ads and after, depending on what you picked you wanted, you get. So please don\'t think that the ads just randomly pop-up out of nowhere. They only appear if you choose for them to be there. I\'d say download the game, you won\'t regret it 👍',
       'Need more food or less time to harvest. Crowded Nursery never has enough time to breed then hatch the big point dragons. We should get some kinda credit for making it to the end of the games with flying creatures. Those games make you wait too long between.',
       'It would be better if I didn\'t have to clear cache and data on Google play store and change my display settings every time an update is released just to be able to update the game. I love the game other than that but it\'s a pain to have to make these changes and then have to reset the settings in play store and for display to be able to use my device properly. When that issue is fixed... I\'ll for sure give it 5 stars.',
       '2/14/18- update is not working, in the middle of an event, eeekkk!!!!  Edit: this game used to get crazy pop up ads and those seem to have disappeared, I only get ads when I choose to watch them for rewards, which is exactly what I am looking for in a game. This game is incredibly addicting, especially when you get far enough to participate as part of a team! Love the play style, graphics, you can do a lot without have to pay real money, but there are occasionally some great deals for gems.' ,

I under stands u need money but you should put purchases so u get some more money !! and also I want to have new characters and themes that will be cool course I nearly got all but I haven\'t! also change rating to pegi 3 I know there\'s the characters can be a vampire but srsly IT\'S NOT SCARY what is with wthat!  sorry it\'s long but thanks for taking time and reading bye!😀😀😀😁😁😁',
       'It\'s a very good game! I got my boyfriend hooked on it, but my problem with it is, sometimes when I start up the app it sits on the beginning stage of the app?? Like when am I going to be able to play again? Was just updated? So I\'m going to have to delete it and start it all over and re gain my high score??',
       'There are wayyyy too many ads seriously. You don\'t need that many ads for your game you have enough money you have a bursting game brand . Most of your games don\'t even have as many ads. Every failed turn "here\'s an ad buy my game!!!!" No!!!',
       'The *only* complaint is the frequent,  long 30 second ads after nearly every single round.  It\'s quicker to close the app and reopen,  but either way,  it\'s annoying enough to not want to play the game.   Other than that,  this is a fun game! :D',
       'WAYYYYY too many adds. There is an add after EVERY round. That\'s annoying. The game is great, but that\'s NOT how to get people to purchase it. Please consider lessening the adds to maybe once every 5 minutes, and not every 5 seconds!!',
       'This game is super fun...what kills it for me is 1-2 ads between every round.  Really!?  I think this game can be financially supported by an ad here and there I am sure.  One every couple of minutes is absurd.' ,

      'I enjoy playing this game. The only problem I have is that sometimes when you use a key, your ball will start rolling from an awkward position and you can\'t continue from the checkpoint. That needs to be fixed.',
       'I love the game play, controls aren\'t awsome but still great. But this game is my favorite and i try hard all the challenges! 👍👍',
       'Awesome , i love this game, it works on gravity of terrains,  and physics based. Manual controls are quite easy to handle than the tilt ones. I give 5 stars .',
       'It\'s a superb fantastic mind-blowing wonderful game',
       'Honestly it\'s an amazing game. It has a story, but it\'s tiny. its perfect for a mobile game. it feels so smooth and good. developers certainly put effort',
       'The game is excellent👍👏😆,  really. Nice graphics, easy controls, and great gameplay. Good job👌👍👏 for the designers and developers.' ,

      'This game is amazing!!! The little faries and feys (idk what you call em) are super cute. The grafics are great. And I really like that if you close the game the faries collect the money stuff for you while your away. This game is a great time killer and its so addicting.the little dresses you can pick are really nice too. It will auto attack for you so that\'s nice. The only thing wrong is that the monsters don\'t attack. Over all I really love the game though😊.',
       'Since games like this go on forever, giving players an option to save up diamonds to eventually buy the money only options could induce them to stay around longer and not feel that the best stuff is locked away forever. Eventually, they may choose to spend real money on it. You just need to keep them around long enoug to impress them. In addition, cosmetic items could be money only but could be given away for free as a reward for progress to entice players to buy more. Do not underestimate the allure of fashion.',
       'The game is beautiful. All the tapping sort of gets to you after a while. I thought the main character would be able to move about and there was more dimension. Like if there were different level in the game and she could move between those levels, etc. Go high and low to cancel out the dark, and so on.',
       'It\'s a great game. The Bgm in the background sounds enchanting and makes me happy while I play the game. The developer might want to add story updates because the girl and Fey have a mission to defeat the evil, but no real mission after you start completing stages. I think it would be nice to have more story in this game.',
       'An awesome game based on tap tap tap. Enchanting bgm. Little customisation of the girl.  Some improvement could be made in that there should be a story. Maybe. There are so many umbras in a country. Destroy them all and that country lights back up. Giving you bonuses and such like. Thus progressing the girls quest to save all the fey and light the world again. Would also give us players something to aim for other than tap tap tap.',
       'This game is absolutely NOTHING like everyone thought it was going to be. There really isn\'t much to it other than tapping the screen. Every time you get to character level 650 you can perform  "Light Up!" Which basically ends the current "world" and you start all over again while keeping certain bonuses. It\'s addicting to me and I don\'t know why because unfortunately it\'s pretty basic and boring :(....' ,

      'I enjoy the game--very much in the vane of classic sonic racing games, with a lanes mechanic and some mariocart-esque abilities. The micro transactions speed up game play and can help progress your character, but won\'t make up for being a bad racer. Instead of transactions you can often watch ads. Typically, the ads are a fair trade off, but some are nearly game breaking. An Airbnb one is running right now that cannot be exited after watching on my OnePlus 5.  Otherwise, 5 stars.',
       'Decent game but why are there so many rings? I mean literally I have 1000s and the only thing it seems you can spend them on is upgrading your characters. This nesitates you having other pieces for each character which take ages to get then when you finally have enough of those bits it\'s like 1000 rings to upgrade them... Which is absolutely nothing... Give me something else to spend them on or up the price for upgrading characters... Obviously.',
       'An addictive game that never gets old. With the unpredictable players and teir upgrades, there is always a challenge. I have a few friends who play this game, and while it\'s fun to watch them, being able to play against them would be amazing. Also, the graphics for me are a bit janky (the device is fairly new) and isn\'t pleasing to the eye. The smoother, the better, like chocolate.',
       '*Sega does it again*  I am really happy about this game! Some may not like it, which could be reasonable, but I love it. It\'s fun, fast gameplay with killer music. I\'m very happy that they made this game the way they did. I was skeptical about it, I\'ll admit, but was very pleased with the results. It doesn\'t have all the super fancy bells and whistles, which is good. It\'s simple menu and play system is very easy to get a hang of. People who played the first, or even the second sonic dash can get the controls down. I am very pleased on how easy it is to get characters and level them up using a simple card style, collect a certain amount to unlock and upgrade, instead of the DREADFUL wheel in Sonic Runners.... *shudder*  Anyway, it\'s a very good game and the only problem I have is I enjoy it too much....',
       'Very enjoyable play on the Sonic Dash formula and the microtransactions aren\'t as obnoxious as they could be. Occasionally get a loading screen bug that necessitates force quitting and restarting. There are so issues with certain sound effects playing even when SFX is muted and when connected to a Bluetooth speaker all sounds play even when muted.',
       'Yeah great game and all but trophy system is unfair. Also a big bummer is that the game keeps crashing, sometimes even before u have entered the game. Cannot start a new match cos you are still racing in a match u never actually even entered. And due to this u now have lost 1 of ur reward star runners goes... Disappointed!' ,

      'The amount of ads is ridiculous! Especially from that "Tune Blast", it\'s really annoying. And, w/some of the ads you have to wait 30sec before they\'re done, there\'s no "x" button. The actual mahjong game itself is decent.',
       'When I first downloaded this game, there were some issues, such as not being able to sync this game. So when I had to do a factory reset on my phone, it removed my stats. So after completing just over 600 games, and all the daily challenges, with over 110 "hints" and then having to do the reset, wiped out everything. The game kept going back to the first level when I selected next level after removing my stats. I uninstalled the game. Not going through each level again. It would be a much better game if it allowed syncing or even saving.',
       'Would be a great game to pass time if there werent an ad every 5 seconds. Seriously an ad when you click on options? Thats just greedy and stupid. Id give this less than a star if i could',
       'Like the game BUT WAY TO MAMY ADS. No game needs this many ads, I can\'t do anything without an ad popping up. It is really getting on my last nerves, ecut down the amount I don\'t mind a few but not that many.',
       'Overall, I love the game. The only thing wrong is that there\'s too many ads! I can\'t even go from menu to menu without an ad popping up. It\'s very irritating.',
       'It would be better if there were more tile choices, besides the basic 3. What really annoys me is that if you pause for a few seconds to look up or think of a move, an ad pops up. A 30 second, non skipable ad. The ads are also there after you finish every match. I know you need to make revenue but jeez. Calm down.' ,

      'This game is one of the best Sudoku puzzle games I\'ve found. It has a wide range of puzzle options and has detailed explanations for hints to build up your knowledge of logic tricks. The UI is clean, the design is not to die for, but the gameplay is 5 stars in a heartbeat.',
       'Excellent, lots of options. Uninstalled a competitor app (Sudoku "Fun" Free by Smoote Mobile, which I found was riddled with Malware). Your app is very comprehensive and of the highest quality. The ("try out in pencil") option to test, in turn, different numbers in cells when the answer is uncertain in one or more cells in the Harder puzzles is particularly useful. Thank you.',
       'Additive!  Great game, easy to use. Never any issues with gameplay.  Lots of difficulty levels which I love, I go for an easy one when I\'m short on time but like the challenge of the harder levels too.  Highly recommended  🌟',
       'Great sudoku puzzles and good tutorials to teach tricks. Only thing I wish I could change would be to prepopulate each open cell with "pencil" markings for all the numbers, because I prefer to eliminate numbers and it\'s a pain to have to add them all first.',
       'After maxing out one of the competing apps, I found Andoku. It took awhile to get used to the interface but now I think it is far superior. Additionally, the level based tutorials are very good, though a couple of items suffer from confusing descriptions. My game has improved with this app.  I would make a suggestion for enhancement of statistics.  That would be to include statistics for unassisted games. As far as I\'m concerned, if you get a hint or even check your work, you haven\'t solved the puzzle.',
       'Stupid. Really good game to play..but one level far too easy..next level can\'t f-ing complete! So irritating. Will go back to an alternative developer\'s version which is more progressive. Shame.' ,

For example:- multiplayer endless runner- multiplayer birds with flapping wings- platform jumping game- 3-in-a-row with Tic-Tac-Toe like rules- crossing a busy road together- bingo- a strategy game where you send armies to capture castles (has nasty AI in single-player)- football / soccer (close to Pong and hockey)- a multiplayer version of the 1024/2048 puzzle- tapping only your own tiles- balloon poppingWe regularly add new mini-games.

      'It\'s nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it\'s not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It\'s just not fair.',
       'I have now completed a 365 day streak... During this past year of playing this game daily, I\'ve had an idea. What if once you hit a certain amount of streak days you unlock a new something? Like a new pack or flow color? That would be nice so that you are working towards something. :)',
       'I loved flow free from a young age. I\'ve played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I\'ve tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs',
       'Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.',
       'Edit: New horrible LOUD advertising you can\'t stop. Very disturbing to others and prevents usage around others.   Great puzzle games, lots of levels from easy to very hard. However it will eat your battery like there is no tomorrow. If your phone is plugged in, it will overheat. Use for more than about 15 minutes and your phone will burn your hand and shut down.',
       'Fantastic game. Real addiction game I\'d say. It\'s an awesome time killer. Different types of levels never make the game boring. Graphics is okay. Number of ads for a free to play game is less compared to other games out in the market which is a relief.Overall I would give 4.5/5' ,

      'I absolutely love this game. It\'s so addictive and a really good game if your bored. I\'m really curious to find out what happens when you have collected all the balls, does the game just carry on or is their more challenges?? Overall, this game gets five stars from me 😚',
       'Its a really good game. The only thing is, that I wish there was maybe some instructions that appear at the beginning, because I didnt know that you couldnt hit the black lumps etc. Maybe if you add little phrases that say what to do and not to do, then it would be almost perfect.',
       'Great time killer I love everything about it and it is a great game to wake up to. The only down side is that you fall off the ledge and that makes it harder to dodge the black. Everything else is 5 stars so that is what I think about roller coaster.',
       'This game is amazing! It is addicting and fun to play!! The only thing is that I was hoping for some sort of introduction to the game, to tell me how to play etc. Also, I was hoping to be able to choose what kind of ball i use, the black one is plain and kind of boring. But overall its an amazing game!!',
       'Its really fun and addictive. Awesome game play and good for passing time. Not always so friendly to my battery and too many adds. Other than those little hick ups I absolutely love it.',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH   I love this game because it is exciting and addictive, it has easy controls and it is so many different colors as you move on and on! Try to beat the next high scores and HAVE AS MUCH FUN AS I DID' ,

      'The gas traps are way to op. No point in trying to get to the cab, when infected, you die in 3 seconds flat, no way to get rid of it. Alot of thief bugs, such as air support doesn\'t called in when used medkits when used are ignored. And about 50%chance it will not pick up cash from a downed friend. Fun game, just needs some tweaking. Update:it wont let you diffuse the bomb on a fellow thiefs back, even if you spam click it as soon as he grabs it. Edit: speed shoes impossible to hit, super fast cooldown. Cheap',
       'Update: server crashes alot ,its really hard to reach top 3 rank those player aare pay to win player plus the market sucks',
       'As the updates made balances to the game everything is perfect, but feel bad for lower levels going against higher during ranked matches.',
       'It like everything else but I hate that we don\'t get gold from anything and that the sniper rifles and that the bags for the thives cost too much and i will love that the cases we get take less time and have even more slots for even more cases',
       'Wish I could have different masks for sniper than the thief',

      'This is a very addictive game. I don\'t understand why people don\'t like it. Fast paced. As for the adds, you people should turn your internet off and play. It will help.. ##VOODOO## Would you accept a video from me? You can use it for advertising purposes. I thought it might be of great help for you.  Please get back to me by replying. I would be happy to email the video to you..',
       'Hey Developer! This is Great Job!. But, if there are other players who have the disease "Afraid of Heights", this game will not be suitable for him. You make players Cringe (Afraid), because there is no music. This game like a Dark Theme Games.',
       'I know a lot of people seem to not like this game but I actually really enjoy it the only thing I don\'t like is the lack of sound.   It would be nice if there was background music of some kind and a glass breaking sound effect when you went through each barrier something pleasing to the ears  Oh and shorter ads would also probably be good.  It could also use more roads and balls and barriers to work towards. I feel like this game has a lot of potential though hope it keeps being updated.',
       'It was hard to play but the commercials r the worst. I get that you have to have some to offer the game for free but every single commercial was 30 seconds long or more by the time u can hit the X. The commercials we longer then the game play',
       'Since I got this phone, no other app have I liked or disliked enough to write a review. This game is pretty fun actually. But after you play it a few times (they wait until you get hooked), they start showing a 30 second ad every time you fall off the map (the map is the same every time, but it is a very different game. It reminds me of flappy bird - you will die almost immiately at the beginning, but your skill will increase with repetition). So every 30 seconds, I got a 30 ad. And the game costs 3 bucks. Rip off. Zero star review.',
       'The game is fine. But OMG the ads....they make you watch an ad every few seconds until you pay for the premium version. This is just sick. I mean games do have ads but the number of ads in this game are unbearable. Very frustrating . So if you are looking for a free game THIS IS NOT IT.' ,

      'Big fan of Beyblade since I was a kid, from the first generation. So this is cool to play this game and see how far its came. Though there are many glitches in the game, this is the second time I\'m gonna have to download because it won\'t open. Overall, it\'s a fun game when it\'s not glitching',
       'Garbage game,is now infinitely looping on a challenge tournament. Once I defeat the first opponent the screen goes black and the game freezes. Reopening the game puts me back in the same match and ends in the same endless loop.   Dev team needs to fired and a patrol of lemurs hired instead because they\'d at least be entertaining.',
       'Everything is great but it can there be like a story mode cause just battling that is kind of boring. Still I think that the app is great, still could use a story mode where u can customize your own cherareter',
       'You really don\'t do anything but press orbs and press to buttons. Plus, just to get cool stuff, you need to go out and buy only beyblade bursts. The game is boring and confusing.',
       'This game is beautiful  but hear me out add human avatars so that you can see them launching that will be cool  and add nightmare shelter regulus  arc bahamut  andddd  of course strike god  valkyrie',

      'Lost another These constant updates caused me to uninstall this. Fun game - very good game!But if it ain\'t broke don\'t fix it. I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.',
       'It\'s a fun game. If you\'re a COD player you\'ll love it. In general It does good on it\'s own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It\'s good that there\'s a grind to get them but I think it\'s a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.',
       'So many people using modified apk to paly... Very few gamers playing ethically.. makers must do something about it.    New update is not stable.  After Every 5 min. It shows that my wifi got disconnected, though my wifi is already connected. Didnt face any problem like this in Previous version.',
       'This game would get ten stars if devs can fix the spazzout camera episode that happens at least once per minute. Suddenly I\'m aiming at sky spinning for 1-3 secs and usually I die or miss a kill as a result.. please please fix this. Otherwise best mobile shooter game available',
       'This game is awesome if i compare with others but it needs improvement if you make exception. Problem is that lack of enough ammunition untill death. Sollution is that you can give ammunition around war places so that we can take and reload ammunition. Tank destroyer luncher has only 3 ammunition but there are so many tanks!! So what i can do? I will kill myself to get ammunition?',
       'This game is an absolute joke unless you spend actual money. I spent weeks EARNING gold coin and tried to upgrade my armor and it failed!! How does my purchase fail?!! And your playing against people with 140% health and crazy armor points so you can\'t kill anyone unless you try to upgrade your armor. Then on top of all that you have people who hack the game and run around killing people with no deaths. Complete rip off.' ,

      'It\'s fun. My problem is on the attention one we are suppose to click stop once the red dot is on the brain and I do. There is plenty of time to click it  but it tells me i missed it. No matter how many times I click it while the red dot is still on the brain. If I press it 10 times then the screen that tells me I\'ve failed comes up 10 times. Driving me insane.',
       'Its rlly a good game for brain training!! Idk why but i didnt find any bug, glitch, or smthing like they all saying. It works well in my device. This is the best app for training your brain. Ofc its not easy, its so challenging, in a good way. I rlly struggle in quick searching and some stages, but its just so addicting and so great!! I recommend you to download it!!!',
       'I love it!!! The games are interesting. Now I am on "memory match" game which was initially locked and it keeps on freezing and promotes me to next level without me completing the level well. Besides that, I would highly recommended it to others, it\'s worth installing.',
       'Some bugs need to be fixed . Often fails to start with java errors. Doesn\'t remember where you are up to so each time you start from scratch. Timeout too soon sometimes.  too many ads.  more like a beta version.  Would be good if no bugs and less invasive ads',
       'There\'s a glitch in "Quick Decision Skill" game. It is based on whether the previous and current object is same or not. When I click on the peach-moon-type object as same, it gives error, though I click on Same when two moons appear consecutively in the game. This way I\'ll not be able to clear the levels.',
       'Things I think can be done just like that are not that easy.. The app just revealed the poor state of my memory/IQ.. And it has been help me to develop my thinking.. Nice App' ,

       'I dig it overall. The controls to set the pieces take a bit of getting used to, but I understand why they did it this way. Your finger starts where it should, but moved slightly lower than the finishing point. This way your finger is out of the way and you can clearly see where your piece is going. Very fun game with lots of options.',

      'It\'s fun building up stuff and I like how the game keeps playing even when closed.   One thing that annoys me, I try to watch the ads for free in game currencey, but most of the time either the ad crashes or the game is reset when I close the ad and I don\'t receive in-game currencey. Probably my potato Moto G5 doesn\'t have enough RAM. Another fingersoft game, HCR2 has the same concept and doesn\'t have this problem.',
       'I somewhat enjoyed this time wasting game until one of the characters (robots) I purchased for millions of coins just left, and sent me a picture to share with friends.  From there I had to spend another million coins to buy a human who had less skill.   Not worth playing a game that takes your hand earned characters away for no reason.',
       'I love this game but I found a bug, I don\'t know how exactly it happened but I was doing an extra task (a clown factory dice making one) I used auto clicker and was just holding one finder down and tapping to sell with the other. Now all of my factories have a die on each person\'s desk and it doesn\'t go away once sold. Other then that, great game and nice timewaster. :D',
       'It\'s a great time killer if you are waiting or have nothing to do. It does get boring after 3 and a half hours,but it\'s still good. Also way less and I mean way less ads than other games. Excuse my spelling and grammar, but you know what it means. (It\'s good)',
       'The only thing I don\'t like about this app is the controls. You can\'t hold your finger to make production faster. You have to tap constantly. But other wise, it was a great app and I recommend it\'s',
       'Absolutely love this game. Becoming addicticed already, had this game for 4 days and I love the tapping where if you use more than 1 finger it goes faster. So my family thinks I\'m crazy sitting there with my hand tapping the screen so fast, they even said "slow down there matey you\'ll break your screen of you keep going like that" long story short, now I have a cracked screen but vwry am addicted. Great game fingersoft keep up the good work' ,

      'This game is great, it\'s a lot of fun. Until it decides that you\'re not allowed to pass the loading screen.  Then there\'s the premium store. The pricing is pretty outrageous for a mobile game. $35 for a t5? I paid less than that for my Matilda IV on WOT. Please address this issue. So we can actually show you our patronage. You occupy our spare 15 minutes. Not hours daily. Think of where this is played and charge accordinly. That\'s all I have to say.',
       'I do like this game. The support team is good and are helpful when they can be. But the silver and points awarded are much too low in my opinion, when in comparison to the costs of modules and supplies consumed during battles. Also the supply crates could stand to be better. The ships are pretty awesome and are very well rendered. Very good graphics. Everything runs smoothly with no lag or server issues.',
       'This is a great game!!.  Yes, computers have issues, yes its short then the PC version.  This is not a PC.  This is a great 5 minute break.  I play the PC game too.  Its flipping fantastic.  The programmers at WOW are brilliant  and they care about the product.  If you love histroy, Warships, strategic games pitting you against other human players.  GET THIS YOUR GAME.  There are other warship games.  None get it more right then WOW.',
       'The games mechanics and controls need an overhaul. The secondary weapons should be automated as fast firing ships operating in touch screen controls requires immense micro management. Second, the post battle screen graphs extremely limited battle details and the UI is equally as lacking in features and navigation. Finally, the battle time is far to short and the majority of battles are ended with ships still in action on both teams. Potential to be a 5 star rating when the mechanics become as user friendly as they they are on PC.',
       'Made you play the game for 30 minutes before you can enter a promo code. Can\'t enter any promo codes in game, you have to make an account for their stupid website. None of the promo codes actually work. Clearly a marketing scheme just to get a bunch of downloads so they can get more money from investors. I say boo.',
       'Great game absolutely the best that I have played on a mobile. However, sometimes when I go into battle it says I have no repairs or the other thing who\'s name I can\'t remember even though I have around 100 most of the time. Could you please look into this? It could be an interesting balancing mechanic if one ship is far and away better than all of the ones on the opposing team but for now it\'s just annoying. Thank you for making such a great game though and I will certainly keep being a highly active player.' ,

For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....',
       'So, this is an awesome, addictive and fun, satisfying game to play and it is really good if you want to become a nail artist. I would of gave it five stars but it is a bit unreal like you can just rub the nail varnish everywhere but it only appears on the nail but that can stop you from being annoyed because it is not as hard as it is in real life and one of my designs didn\'t go into my album because the game just got stuck and randomly stopped by its self and it went back to my home screen. Also there is too many ads. I am not interested! And you can\'t cross them off unless you download the app! What point is that?! And I cannot move and make the stickers bigger on match this so I can\'t complete it. Help! Sort this out!',
       'I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn\'t get me board everytime i have different desins to do.',
       'Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!',
       'Cute Its a very nice game. The best thing I liked in this game is that everything is already unlocked, we don\'t need to spend real money or even coins in the game. It has so many options for colours, designs and stickers. But it also has too many adds. On the whole I liked it very much',
       'I  am finally at the final last level! Before I thought it was boring but after I reached some levels farther I thought it was awesome! And it is the best game ever! YEAH!!!!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💙💙💚💚💛💛💜💜💗💗❤❤ AND when I was playing my 1st game all things were opened but when I played in my small sister\'s tab all, things were closed! I got everything for free!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA' ,

      'Good I hope they fixed the bug where you double buy a car and it gives you the same car but still takes your money. But its still a great game. Ohh! And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.',
       'It\'s good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn\'t too much skill involved but it\'s a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I\'ve lost countless games because it doesn\'t stop or doesn\'t back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!',
       'Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it\'s a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can\'t go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I\'m out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!',
       'Good, but has some bugs I\'m sorry if I\'m being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall',
       'Shalom there, The game is awesome. I liked it very much and hoping that in the future they will be more cars to be added. I really hope that "military helicopter" can shoot something, it is funny...so idle. Last thing, a HOVERCRAFT can go "river mode" ! Wrecked... because of...water. Hope you\'ll add the " police boats " in next update. Overall, abundant of thanks and good luck.',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME. It just need\'s some work to do. Like, you guys need to fix the glitch of the lines by the road. And you need to fix when we explode the oil truck and fall on the ground and you disapear. And can u guys please add some new prizes like to change the color of ur car. And when I have 100 dollars u can spend it on colors  theirs a button to choose what prize you want. Like say I get the color blue for a red car. And I like the red car so I go to the prize machins and choose to buy a color than I have the button to change the color of ur car. That will make the game a lot better. And I\'m sure when u do it there will be more downloads.' ,

      'Squad formation screen has been ruined. You now have to toggle between condition and roles 8nstead of seeing them at the same time. Stupid white circles get in the way and you can\'t see matchups against opposition any more. Please Nordeus, change it back to the previous version.',
       'I have been playing this game for over two years but I am losing interest. Too many changes to encourage you to spend money. I am currently sitting near bottom my league getting beat by teams that are significantly lower rated. Game mechanics are all wrong and the transfer system should revert back to the old way',
       'This game is indefinitely one of the worst football simulation games ever created. Idk if you guys are just a bunch of morons just naive about football. My team has the highest rating and the highest team value and yet still I\'m losing to a low rate team. So pathetic. I play this game every single day and the mangers I face are not even active but they win against my team. Who wrote the algorithm for the game. Come on !! MORONS',
       'What bullcrap is this. You make a downgrade. Substitution doesn\'t happen for an entire half. I play with 10 men. Screw you, you stupid idiots. Spoiling the game. And what garbage graphics are those. Money hungry people run everything for tokens. Be it the challenges or anything else, they are just greedy people. Shame on you. You spoil the game in every update. Will uninstall this garbage game.',
       'Somehow you guy\'s just gotta screw things up ain\'t it..? What\'s with the new substitution interface.. . It\'s really very annoying and difficult to do subs.. . Please remove the white circle thing surrounding the players and also the movements while selecting the players',
       'The game is fine. It won\'t take much of your time. So if you are heavy gamer then it\'s not for you. I really don\'t like the concept of tokens. Why have to pay money and token to buy players? But when sell player then I only get money not tokens. Why?' ,

      'Love this game...best WWE Game on mobile, and I\'ve played them all. So addicting I spend money on it. I do wish it was easier to get TP, and tokens to level up superstars. I\'ve been playing for almost a year, and have EASILY spent 6 or 700 on this game, and only have 1 three star superstar....only because i bought TP  and Arn Anderson crate over Christmas!! For some reason, I\'m still addicted.',
       'I believe I started playing this game of April of last year. I upgraded my phone and the company can not retrieve my old account. I paid money to play this game. I attempted to retrieve my old account in which they requested a transaction ID which I sent them in a text and picture format. They are unable to find my account so the money I spent is gone. Please do not spend money if you want to play this game. There are dozens of gem games out there that will fill that void. I know it is a Wwe licensed product but please be aware that you may lose money because of their terrible account migration system.',
       'Much better update. Battery life is actually decent. No freezes yet. I like the new system to make more coin. Still a grind, but I don\'t mind. I spend some money here and there. Suggestions: bring women\'s division. Unlock finishers, seriously, Bray Wyatt doesn\'t use a Stone Cold Stunner. Please add new music. Thanks!',
       'Love the game except now it\'s not going past the loading screen and can\'t get on to play has been like it since last update... have waited giving the benefit of the doubt that a new update may come and fix whatever bug has caused the issue but still no joy... please fix galaxy s8 new update still not working',
       'Here\'s how to experience the game without dumping tons of money into it.  Think of a wrestler you\'d like to play as. Now, dump $1000 into a bucket and pretend to set it on fire. Afterwards, play any crappy match 3 game, because you can dump that $1000 into this game and still not get to play as the wrestler you want.   This game is a slot machine money grab, plain and simple.',
       'Game loads slowly, frequently get internet connection error(even when all my other games connect just fine). If it wasn\'t for that, I would give a 4 star...but its a 3 or lower for now. After playing for awhile, found out its a money pit, so I am considering uninstalling it. Game is a ripoff. I keep getting screwed out of my duplicate posters, so I can\'t level my wrestlers moves. They screw you so you have to spend real money...really classy.' ,

      'Best color by number pixel art I have played. Beautiful art, reasonable controls (would be better if you could click and drag without pressing and holding first, but the only one that does that has such awful art that it doesn\'t matter), it\'s fun. Thanks for making this.',
       'I love the gameplay, graphics and controls and this is just so relaxing to play! I love this compared to other sandbox games because of the controls are way better! Also when you take a pic and colour it in can you have a palette so you can colour it in different colours to the image that would be great if you could kinda edit photos by using different colours.',
       'Amazing! The only problem is that I might accidentally touch a number I already coloured and undo it. To fix this problem I suggest you make it so if you have completed a number it cannot be changed.',
       'I really  really like it!! But sometimes the LAG annoys me so MUCH!',
       'There\'s a problem where when you tap a certain number is unpredictably colors in the numbers around it instead of the number you intended to color. It\'s makes it impossible to color it in.',

      'The original sonic dash is better imo. had a better atmosphere, maps looks better gameplay also better. the original was a masterpiece. also, I don\'t like that they introduce scenes that requires you to tilt your phone. since i played sonic dash i didn\'t expect it to be there. it\'s annoying when you\'re laying down and play the game and you got that scene just ruins the gameplay.',
       'The responsiveness of the controls I  this game make it unplayable... it\'s slightly more responsive than the original sonic dash but it\'s still no where near good enough for such a fast paced game.  I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it\'s the same on all of them',
       'Way too many advertisements. I actually downloaded this game because subway surfer makes start over everytime you download it but after my next tech upgrade I\'m going back to that, atleast the game not flooded with ads.',
       'I would give it 5 stars, I made an in app purchase to remove ads, but after the game updated non Sega ads started showing again and it asked me to make another purchase in order to remove the non Sega ads AGAIN... love the game, hate the ads...',
       'TOO MANY ADS!! Decent game but ruined by an add every 20s. Sonic forces doesn\'t have half as many adds as this game but isn\'t as good so looks like Sega have fallen short trying to add more pounds to their fortunes and made the game unplayable.',
       'The game is great but the ads are so intrusive, immersion-breaking, and so annoying that I\'m giving the game 3 stars. Please, I understand that ads are necessary to make money for a free game but make it so that they are not so persistent that an ad automatically opens after a single run. A shame really, this would be such a great game if this would be fixed.' ,

      'YOU CAN SKIP THE ADS!!!    (just press back!)  Fun little game for those who think engineering is fun, but not as niche as that might sound!   There are plenty of similar games,  but I found this 1 quite varied and isn\'t greedy like some of its competitors. There are ads, but you can press back straight away and don\'t have to watch them. (I think some of the grumbling 1star reviewers missed that you can skip the ads.. ..but the game does require a certain amount of intelligence, so...)',
       'While this is a mediocre puzzle game, it is a terrible physics game. The vehicle doesn\'t accelerate, free falling is just a constant velocity downwards. What the developers ought to know is that forces cause ACCELERATION. This is why catapults are useless and why it makes every interraction weird. If anything it makes you think less in terms of physics, that is suposedly the aim of the game.',

      'I\'ve been having issues with this app for months, where it will sometimes act as if it received multiple inputs in rapid succession. This completely ruins all the hard work I did getting my board state the way it was, and makes it impossible to recover. I\'m playing up to the 16K range, and it has these issues usually after I\'ve gotten the 4K blocks. 2/6/2018',
       'I enjoy 2048 alot. I play it alot and I would consider myself pretty good, my high score is 250,000. When i was building on that high score, the screen glitched and swiped a number of times, ruining the order of the numbers. This has happened on multiple occasions only in this app. It\'s not such a big problem for people that are newer, but when you\'ve got big numbers, such as 8192, it makes the game unplayable.',
       'Awesome game I have basically mastered this game. Got a high score of 2,892,204. I made the highest tile which is 131,072. This game is amazing and requires intense focus. I lost focus for a second and a 4 appeared and I didn\'t notice. Messed me up when I was about to make the 65k tile',
       'best beain adict game. but 9 grid stage doesnt fulfill. not enough grid box. the Creator cheated. i m going to lodge a complaint against you. you ve to answer my brain😀 anyway superr game excellent',
       'When the game ends it\'s very abrupt - the board disappears to be covered by an ad and load music blares - very unpleasant. I hate the color scheme - this would be much funner if could choose - Caribbean blues, shades of green, Valentine reds and pinks...',
       'The game is great, but the leaderboards are seriously messed up.  The top high scores are literally orders of magnitude higher than it is physically possible to get.  I would assume that they have been "hacked" somehow to display these fake scores.  The developer should cap the high score at the number that is literally the highest possible score (based on the size of the board)' ,

      'I think this game is really good. I just have one problem. Even though it says my energy is full, it feels like I have nothing. And also the mini game 100 energy seems to last longer than the initial 300 you receive. If you could fix this taht would be great. And if it\'s designed like this can you make energy spending more efficient?',
       'The story-writing is really well done and the art is gorgeous. My only problem is that if you don\'t plan on spending money to buy energy, the story moves really slow even if you get full points on the card mini game and watch the offered video ad. I guess that\'s the idea, though, since it tempts one to spend the money to keep reading. I also get really confused with the plot, itself. Sometimes the direction it goes doesn\'t make sense to me and also, the choices sometimes do something I wasn\'t expecting at all given the wording.',
       'Interesting story so far and great art but the energy runs out far to fast for you to really get very far, even at the beginning which is when the story needs to be able to draw the reader in so you want to come back and read more. Which is why I almost didn\'t continue and was thinking about just giving it up.  Not to mention the ads completely break up the flow of the story and you don\'t and can\'t even get energy from them.  So for these reason I give it a 3 even though I want to rate it as 5, but it\'s just to irradiating to ignore.',
       'This game really addictive!! The only problem is they don\'t give you enough energy.😒you either have to buy energy or play a mini game to get more energy. The highest energy points that you can get is 100. Plus the 30 points if you watch a video. Other than that the game is AMAZING. The graphics are realistic. It has a lot of romance too. You should definitely download this game if you\'re not bothered about the energy points.',
       'I m so excited to unveil what happens next, the energy drains hell too quick. I would love if the energy is increased to a lot more because that is effecting the gameplay and annoys me a lot personally. Leaving this issue, the game is fantastic. I have always loved choice games and this current gameplay is the best of all experiences . I wish to read more through your stories..... ❤',
       'Fun game but like everyone else says the amount of energy is horrible. 430 energy for 24 hrs and it\'s gone within a minute or two. Really wish they\'d give more energy. I\'ve honestly thought about quitting like others but the storyline has been good. How about increasing the energy up and might have more people play.' ,

      'As other people said, an amazing mix challenging but not so challenging that it\'s frustrating. I think would be a good therapeutic puzzle game as in it\'s barely ever too hard. The music is calming and relaxing. I have only played a few levels and I already love it. The only thing I would change is to add another mode, it is sometimes too easy, like keep the current game as "therapeutic mode" and add another more challenging for people who would like to test their limits, and call it "challenge mode"',
       'I used to love playing this game growing up on paper or in a book in school and even when being baby sat. Then when I got older they had a more updated version in bars on a game machine, and that was fun, but it would charge you money to play. Finding it on Google play store for free with hints and 3 lives, makes it fun. Because now I can play this game for a while, sober or not and enjoy it just as much! It\'s also great for your brain, kids, and memory.',
       'The game is alright for passing the time, some are easy, some are hard, wasn\'t sure what to do with the controls at first, but got used to them after a few levels and go\'s, as the game doesn\'t really explain what they do. The zoom button only zooms once & you cannot move it around. I dont see the point of that! I would have given it more stars if it wasn\'t for the adverts inbetween each level!!!!',
       'Some of the pictures are so dark too see on a screen. Ads are loud and the differences even if they are long you have to tap the exact spot the game says for it to trigger. Most pictures are good and sometimes interesting or pretty. Good variety of changes not always obvious',
       'This game is well programmed and will provide entertainment for a long time.  Negatives are puzzles being uneven in difficulty, sensitivity to finger touches, and the number of cheat\\hints per puzzle almost makes it possible to win without really trying.',
       'Way way too many ads.  You have to  wait 30 seconds and you have no choice. they are really loud.  Completely annoying. Never have I downloaded a game where I am forced to watch long ads every few minutes.  No thank you... Am uninstalling' ,

      'Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh',
       'I love the game but its frustrating when you have all 8 Spartans and the sword guys get in the way so maybe an extras set of controls to control where your men start or something. Also for me the screen keeps jumping I try to look at enemy and I catch a glimpse but then it jumps to my side then back again and again and again please fix this.',
       'I wish there were more commands. Like maybe you could command the miners to garrison while the rest of the troops guard. Also, redesign the swordwrath helmet. It looks like someone spray painted their hair gold and then glued jewels on it. I also wish there could be more types of zombies. The idea of endless is cool but please add the zombies to the campaign.',
       'It\'s nice how you\'ve mashed together Stick War and Stick Empires together to make this masterpiece. I know its only meant to be a remake of the original Stick War, so I shouldn\'t expect too much updates, but it would be cool if there was multiplayer on Legacy. Keep the games coming!!!',
       'This is one of the most awesome game of all time and thanks to the creators you can play it on mobile too. But it still lack some awesome components, 1. Add Chaos Empire, 2. Add multiplayer!!! Overall still AWESOME!!!',
       'It\'s fun but you should  add  like  you know make the waves smaller on the zombie part it\'s hard to survive  and you die fast are 0it is hard you should  add a guy that brings zombie to the Humans to its in fair to the humans that the zombies have that thing that brings humans to him.' ,

      'Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.',
       'I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I\'ve already dumped into this game and the devs didn\'t give me my in game rewards. I\'ve submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.',
       'Wasn\'t sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to "farm gold,xp,mats". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it\'s an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don\'t be jealous, just play your game and have fun.',
       'Nice graphics, intuitive control, fun. In the beginning, it was a little too much going on for my ADHD self, but now I\'ve been playing for a couple months and it\'s my favorite mobile game of all time. I love collecting all the interesting heroes as well as saving for events and seeing what RNGsus  will bring next!  My only complaint right now is that their notification system is whack. Especially in the beginning, it\'s easy to miss things you can do.',
       'Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I\'ve progressed it\'s just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I\'m not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!',
       'Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an "annoying add". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It\'s simple, it\'s fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend.' ,

      'All the main movie characters and space ships to use. Wish u would make more farmable but over one of the best games out there. I actually prefer it compared to Xbox due to no issues with extensive network down periods. If u want us to pay then we gotta be able to play when we want right? Someone else should send that to Xbox they stopped caring long ago. Well done again for the game',
       'Amazing game. Really hits me in the childhood. Great mechanics, events, character moves/abilities, great art style, and unlike most mobile games, does not require paying a dime. It may take a while to reach a high level, but with practice and dedication, you can really go far in this game. I even recommended it to a lot of my family members. Would rate higher than 5 stars if that were an option. No problems whatsoever with the game.',
       'This update gave the players most of the things they have been asking for over a year now. The only issue i have is that EA is still pushing its pricing model with this game. 300 dollars to full star up a character + another 200 for gear. Its a bit much. The F2P is still full and while you will be hardpressed to make it to number 1 on your shard it is possible and gives great satisfaction. I would recommend atleast giving it a try.',
       'Just d/l this like a week ago. Very good game, the turn based RPG style works well, the graphics are top notch, as well as the sound is accurate and superb. The only thing is: I just updated it and now cant get past the Lucas film/Disney screen now. The update was not interrupted at all when I downloaded it, but I suspect it got corrupted, contacting support, hope they can help me I do NOT want to start over.',
       'The game looks interesting, but when you\'ve finished the tutorial you have to give permissions to Contacts (and then maybe other permissions), which is a big red flag for me. There is absolutely no reason ask for permissions like this just to sign up, with no way to proceed and gracefully opt-out!  Beware that by giving them the Contacts permission you are giving away other people\'s information, not just your own! \'Just say no\' to invasive app permissions.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a good year. It is the one game on mobile that I\'ve never put down. I love the grind and how rewarding it is. It is not pay to win, and you can max out every character without paying a cent. EA made something truly great here! Ecspically if your a die hard star wars Fan! They update almost monthly always with new characters! 11/10!' ,

      'Is a good game, I had a lot of fun with it so I decided to go with the premium, the experience is much better without all those ads. I rate it 1 star because after changing mobile I can\'t log in with my premium account, I asked for assistance twice but I\'ve been ignored. i would expect a better service from Halfbrick.  Edit: After Halfbrick team replied to my review I decided to give another chance and ask help for the 4th time but... nothing, nobody contacted me and the issue is still there. At least I learned to spend one cent more buying something from Halfbrick.  Thanks a lot!',
       'Great game overall. Love the controls and that you customize them, I also like the fact that there\'s HID controller support. However, the ads are what made me give this a 3/5. The ads keep me from enjoying this game as much as I could without them. There\'s ads practically everywhere, and it gets annoying. Other than that, the game is fun and challenging to play. Worth the download if you\'re ok with a decent amount of ads, or you\'re willing to pay $3 to get rid of enforced ads.',
       'I think you should stop putting ad\'s litterally every we\'re, just make the checkpoints add free ok? Also PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD LET US PLAY ALL THE LEVELS WITHOUT WAITING 12 HOURS ITS NOT ORIGINAL ITS JUST STUPID',
       'I played the older version and loved it, now theres a premium service and ads every save point. Paying for costumes was understandable now i have to pay to play levels because theres a timer discouraging me from playing. You used to be cool Dan.',
       'Very interesting, time killer game. I got addicted to it. But the fact, that after almost every checkpoint a random 30 second ad pops up... Its killing me.',
       'TOO MANY ADS!!! THERE IS ONE AD EVERY 20 SECONDS! IT IS SO ANNOYING TO HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL 11 HOURS JUST TO PLAY THE NEXT LEVEL! YOU CAN SKIP THE WAIT ONE HOUR AT A TIME, BUT THAT SOMETIMES MEANS WATCHING 11 ADS JUST TO PLAY ONE LEVEL! PLEASE MAKE LESS ADS AND I WOULD ENJOY IT MORE.' ,

      'Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.',
       'Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don\'t get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a "Create a Player" option under \'My Club\' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It\'d be so nice if you add that.',
       'I will love it if i can send players on loan and be paid some coins instead of directly selling them off. Also switching players for a few or no coins will be great. Since players like pogba likes changing his hairstyles, it will also be great to effect some changes in some players hairstyle. More leagues are needed, if possible, German,  Chinese, Nigerian and south African league. Lastly, commentators find it difficult to call the name of a created player, work on these and this game will be perfect.  Thanks',
       'This Game is what all soccer fans around the world have been waiting for. It is fun and easy to play once you master the controls. The graphics are exciting and the gameplay fantastic. However there are some things i would like the dream league team to improve.  Rate at which coins accumulate is way to slow for the games played. Reward players with a free secret player for every division completed. Make the game slightly more difficult and improve Goal keepers.  Include some legendary teams like invicibles in the Elite division challenges. Overall great game.',
       'Very good game. There are lots of players but Manuel Neuer is missing. Some extra things need to be done for this game to become the top football game. German Clubs and many clubs of other countries like those of Poland, Denmark, etc. are missing. If these clubs are added, then the game becomes complete. Hope this changes are done by the "First Touch" as fast as possible.',
       'Great game. Controls could seize to work at times (not very often though) but as a whole, it is a fantastic game. Quality graphics and game play. It would be nice if the game could auto-update(with internet connection) so teams could be updated and players could be at their current clubs e.g Coutinho (Barca), Alexis (Man utd ), Mkhritaryan(Arsenal)etc. Love this game' ,

      'I downloaded this game and the very next morning my phone got hacked. I\'m not saying it was definitely related to the game softwares but I have no way of knowing, so I will not be installing this again. Also its clearly a straight theft of  Minecraft with only some textues and sounds changes. Blatant copy write theft.',
       'I love this game but you can\'t open chest or crafting table or stove. About the houses: it\'s really fun and easy to build the houses. And also it\'s one of the best and exiting Minecraft game ever!!! But like I said you can\'t open anything😑 But other than that in love it can you please fix the changes that I want if you can please!! Thank you!!😊',
       'At first the game was great but then there were a few things that need to be added. First of all, you can\'t crouch, second of all,it doesn\'t have texture packs, and make the graphics like the real version of momentary. If you add these, I will give you 5 stars.',
       'DO NOT WASTE YOUR DATA ON THIS PIECE OF TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!impossible to see at night due  to ads. ever walk around outside after midnight with a flashlight in your hand pointed at your face? well the ads make it hard as hell to see at night. i have started this game six times and cannot see anything happenning at night. and that is too big of a flaw for me tocontinue to use a game. paid 7 bucks and downloading the real minecraft right now. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!!',
       'OMG THIS GAME IS EPIC!!!!!!!!! I have 1 question, there are these holes in the ground  (in creater mode) and the holes have iron and sapphires but I\'m scared 2 go in. What are they and is it 100% safe 2 go in the tunnels? At the moment, I just block them up. Plz tell me! Oh and I LOVE the fact that the game saves on its own!!!!!',
       'CAN SOMEONE PLEASE CONTACT ME IN ANY WAY OR POST HOW TO MAKE A NETHER PORTAL!?!?!?!!?!? I\'m desperate!! My instagram is _t4nh4_   please message me how to make one or comment it here or MESSAGE ME ON EMAIL ..... Any way works! Please save meeee!!! :((' ,

      'Have uninstalled and installed for the THIRD time because it gets stuck and won\'t move on to the next game! Pity, it\'s the best bubble game out there, but this glitch sucks!! Uninstalling for the last time. Sick of having to start all over again. Developer should address this issue, it really is a good app.',
       'Amazing app! Fun! Never get bored, and perfect time killer!! Also the ads arent bad at all. Most of the ads are ones you can sample and play, and you can skip them about like 3 seconds. The ads arent something id complain about, plus its the companies way of keeping this app free for all so you shouldnt complain about even having ads',
       'Intriguing; one of my goals has been to achieve three stars before moving on. however the scores tend to lose the third star on occasion. This annoys me and keeps me from awarding you a full rating.',
       'Too many ads it sucks atleast there should be an option in settings to skip ads..... good game but just bcoz of ads... pathetic... pls dont download if u dnt hav patience',
       'Loved it. The best part of the game is, unlike other complex games (which eats up so much of brain) I love this game to play after coming back from office. It really brain pampering game. 😍',
       'The game loads slow between levels but those ads sure do load fast! Take some of them off and I\'d give 5 stars.' ,

      'Difficult but great game. I really enjoyed playing it. Well, it was good but extremely hard. I could reach until level 13 and that was the end of it. But still it was a great experience. I downloaded this game like three times and I believe that your game deserves better than this rating. If I had enough money to donate I would have done that. And thank you for this game.',
       'Great game, only problem for me is the fact I can\'t seem to out run the homing missiles, if you could lose them if they go out of the screen would be awesome and I would rate 5 stars, otherwise forget what all these people are saying about the controls and they can\'t pass levels! Seems to be fine for me just gotta get used to it, only took a few tries! Great time waster!',
       'I think the cruise missile isn\'t the problem. The tanks that shoot at you are. There\'s no after effect of particle effect when they\'re shot, so you have no idea when it\'s even being fired. Fix that and it\'s another issue off your list.',
       'Maybe it\'s a glitch on some phones but the plane never out runs the guided missile making the game unplayable past level 4. If it wasn\'t for this I would give 4..maybe 5 stars for what could have been.',
       'The movement of the plane is absolutely garbage whenever you accidently pass the height border because of 2 homing missiles and a helicopter squad.  You can\'t control it. So its like accepting your death anyhow.  Fox that and it\'ll be a nice game.',
       'Worst controls. Not hard to play, but there\'s no fun. The plane is too large and too slow to maneuver. I would have liked it if the plane and enemies were somewhat faster' ,

      'I play real poker and do pretty well. This game is clearly made to force you to lose your chips and buy chips. They are obvious bots, and the amount of time I have a great hand on a turned and get called by absolutely  nothing but lose on the river is just unreal. I understand it happens, but it happens way too often in this. I have spent alot of real money on thia game in the past, and now I just remembered why I actually stopped playing it',
       'Fun game. Most of what I know about this game, I\'ve actually learned by playing it on this app. And yes, it\'s very addictive!! And yes, anyone with negative comments???...they haven\'t taken the time to REALLY know & learn the game & it\'s rules. Just because ya lose...doesn\'t make it a bad game!! LEARN THE GAME & ITS RULES, SPEND A LITTLE TIME ACTUALLY PLAYING, (WITH GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP)...AND YOU\'LL LOVE IT. The more ya play, the better it gets!!',
       'More ad pushes and Facebook posting than anything I\'ve over downloaded. Posts without asking and you can\'t play a single game without 20 notifications asking you to spend money or share it with friends. Popular game but can\'t do anything for 10 minutes after opening app until you sift through all the nonsense they throw at you.',
       'I\'ve played enough years to know that setting down at a real table, playing.... No one is that lucky and no one is that unlucky unless the dealer is dirty or YOUR game is rigged to eat your chips. Heck! Everyone gets lucky once in a while. I\'ve put millions on millions of chips into this game and there is absolutely no way in getting them back. Do I continue to spend real money on this game anymore. NOT EVER!!! TOO MANY other games I can down load without it coasting an arm and leg.',
       'Not only are their are too many unlikely calls , some are absolutely ridiculous! I feel like it is deliberately causing you to lose so that you are forced to buy chips if you want to continue playing. Another thing I don\'t like is being in the big blind with several empty spots in front of you and the button and you fill in those spots one at a time near the end of the hand so you are big blind again. I\'ve had this happen 3 or more times in a row while playing 1-2 million. You are screwing me.!!!!!',
       'There\'s a small bug - once you lost all your money in a tournament, you can\'t see the cards of the other opponents after the show down... Besides that, the app is perfect. I wish I could have this interface in real life games.' ,

      'I played it a long time ago and i stopted like 5 months ago. Then now i reinstalled it and:  1. I could not enter my acc  2. I could not connect to facebook or google play.  3. I had to pay each time i danced wich sucks.  Till that update this game was the best game/app ever. It was so fun and so great that I just wanted to play nonstop.  I mean before this big update u payed for a song and u could dance on it as much as you liked. Now it just ain\'t fun anymore.   Please return to the classic game or your gonna lose much much more players like me.',
       'I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.',
       'Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren\'t enough. And one of them didn\'t work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.',
       'It\'s fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I\'m bored. I love the songs and dance moves it\'s awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it\'s awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don\'t know how to dance then you should download this game it\'s perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.',
       'Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn\'t have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!',
       'I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn\'t make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun.' ,

      'this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It\'s a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that\'s it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame',
       'Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn\'t came in two years it probably isn\'t. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don\'t pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges.',
       'Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.',
       'I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.',
       'Funny characters, endearing cartoon aesthetic and enjoyable game play, but after a couple hunts forces you to wait over 8 minutes before you can actually play again (in order to entice you to pay to make the wait times go away). What kind of game compels you to QUIT out of BOREDOM after playing it for 5 minutes?',
       'I would have rated this game 5 stars but for the fact that I\'m at level 82 and it says more missions coming soon... Who does that? This is the best game I\'ve played in a while so it was a bummer when I saw the message. Explain why this is so or just fix it already. I have no issues with the game itself - control, graphics etc, but this pause is driving me crazy. There\'s no game without a mission. It defeats the purpose.' ,

      'Was an awesome game Very addictive game! Was well done.. until the update. Needs more pens and new themes as I have thousands of coins but nothing left to unlock. Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don\'t register as pineapple hits for the counters. There\'s a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it',
       'Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.',
       'Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.',
       'GREAT!... but the coins are a bit hard 2 earn thought the game is very addictive and the adds are not very frequent but they do appear on the bottom of your screen while playing thought there is a no adds purchase also the only purchase in the game the thing I like about the no adds purchase is that sometimes it will let you get it for 50% off so it is only one dollar instead of $2 (USD). The game has a lot of pens and I so far have unlocked a bit more than half and have played the game a lot of the game. But really needs an update.',
       'Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.',
       'The games controls,  features,  graphic are really good and can\'t get your eyes off the screen once dart playing BUT, They are advertising companies that pop up there add moment we open the app... And whenever huge pineapple is on the move these things pop up please patch this immediately.' ,

      'I think that the game is silly yet good!This game does not have another level of playing. I think that the temple ruins and waterfall and the other levels are the same!e but the description given to it is a little too much. The levels do not have anything more than just the same setting. I think that the creator of his game should\'ve made the game in such a way that it has different levels and it helps us to get more bananas or something like that. But overall, the game is pretty good. Good job on the game.😁😁',
       'My kids enjoy this game however I think there should be an option where you can use your bananas to skip a challenge as some are quite hard to do. This will make the game better as it\'s pretty pointless without the challenges  Cheers',
       'I think this game gets hanged easily.!!And my daughter likes this app. But it needs a little new version!! And as I would like to tell my friends also.!! But, this game needs a little change like, Now you can skip the adds ,than not get hanged easily or like that And etc.!!! ThaNks I think you can do better !!',
       'I played this as a kid, now I\'m playing this again as an adult and the DEVELOPER SCREAM NEVER FAILS TO MAKE ME GIGGLE. THANK YOU. U GOT MY 5 STARS',
       'Towards the end it gets boring. One has to start all over from the first scene, every time one dies. There should be an option to start from other worlds as well. It is really annoying. Also the last levels are at times impossible, for eg. in world 6 almost all the vines are slippery and you never know when you\'ll loose grip on them, causing you to fall and die.  I like the option of watching a video and getting double bananas or the chance to continue. I also like the sounds although spiky plants can be annoying.',

      'Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)',
       'I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn\'t have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it\'s Definitely Not a game you\'d wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!',
       'Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout',

Ur lifebank will be full. Also developers should update the game due to above lacking..😂😂😂😂',

      'Loved the game!! U must download it. It is good for removing stress and keeping us occupied for several hours. Remember one thing that while solving do not start from middle always start from a corner it will help u. And one more thing for creator pls add a feature so that we can compete with other people. It will become more interesting. Pls add this. It will tell us who is smarter. And also add high scores. Pls do this things. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏pls',
       'The game is relaxing, complete with a soothing sound track which pulls you in. Its simple and novel, but scrambled levels can leave you feeling daunted until you work them out. Will have to see if it gets difficult, but it holds together without any need for brain strain.',
       'I like the game. Nice graphics, good theory. I can definitely see this as a nice, relaxing game.  Unfortunately, the controls are tedious. Too much tapping. It would be cool if you could tap to select the piece, and then use your finger on the screen to rotate the piece, then tap to place it.',
       'Firstly the playing arena is too small for smartphones your fingers constantly cover what you are doing.  The game is boring.  Tap screen till shape appears.  Repeat. Yawn!',
       'Makes me really concentrate, but pleasant and relaxing at the same time. The amorphous, amoebic shapes hover at the edge of my sight until I get closer.  I think I\'ll be playing more often to distract myself from thinking about the pitof antimatter I got shoved in',
       'I really don\'t like the smaller pieces because the sensitivity of the tactile screen makes it difficult to only move those pieces. In other words, you end up moving other pieces again and again because of this flaw.' ,

      'Seriously Where did the chance to watch videos for extra chances and more money go??? This was the best match 3 game because of that feature now it\'s okay but just like all the other ones. No longer a stand out in the huge line-up of similar games. Fix and I\'ll give 5 stars!',
       'Love everything about it, EXCEPT that the levels are too challenging! It takes me a week sometimes to earn a single star. At this rate it will take about 5 years to decorate the house!! You need more/ better bonuses. Also you don\'t get but a few coins per game, so it shouldn\'t cost 500 just for a 1 time extra moves. I want to do/ play more, but sometimes ridiculous!!',
       'Thid is like homescapes!! U get up to a certain level, get by boards, then lose where theres just a couple more on the board so thats how they get u to buy so u can finish the board! Otherwise u go through your hearts and lose over and over and cant build up the mansion! You win once in awhile, but if you cant build it up losing so much, what fun is that? And the stars are to much for the smaller tasks!! I like the game graphics, but if it is where i cant advance losing 2 to 3 days in a row still im uninstalling!! Ive been on same board forever!!!',
       'What a crock.. a lot of tiny earnings for costing a lot for dumb stuff like sweeping and finding cats. It really has soooo little fun. Good challenge but with soooo little payoff. If you read this, please dont download. The folks dont read your comments nor do they resoond or change to make the gameplay better. I dont think they really care.',
       'Edit: Maybe it\'s the newest version or I\'m just getting good at it or I\'m on the level that easy to complete or I don\'t know, but it seems so much EASIER to earn stars now. I love it! 5 stars it is!  Haha! -----------------------------------------  I\'m on level 72 right now. I would give 5 stars if I\'m not so frustrated right now. I actually like the game, but it takes me (minimum) 5 tries to earn a star (it can takes me days to earn 1 star) and it\'s  REALLY frustrating when I have to spend 2 or 3 stars to play with the cat or sweeping brochures. I want to decorate the mansion, O M G. Either make it easier to earn stars or please stop making us waste stars. Thank you.',
       'I hate this game. It makes me irrationally angry when I\'m more or less forced to pay money to win. I\'m not spending a dime on this game. I attempted the same level about 40 times and I was always two away from finishing the level. Always only two. This game is rigged beyond all belief. The worst part is if it did have some serious effort to be slightly easier, I\'d keep playing. But I won\'t play an unreasonably hard game to where I want to smash my phone in anger because of unreasonable odds.' ,

      'I like it bc it\'s fun but challenging at the same time. And it\'s a GREAT time spender!!! 😎 Also you should get Cooking Fever!!! I had it for YEARS on my old tablet and got SO GOOD AT IT AND SO ADUTTIED 😊 It\'s from the same creaters. You will know bc the little pom tree in the Conner and bc they both have a face. Cooking Fever has a girl and of course this one has and older man. I hope you feel the same about this game!!! Btw do you like bacon? Random question. If don\'t know what bacon is than you should try some. In less your an vegetarian then you probably don\'t want to EVER think of bacon. 🐷🐷🐷',
       'A lot of fun and very addictive, but very busy and fast-paced. There are so many things happening at once that it\'s hard to keep track of all the action. I guess that\'s why it\'s so addictive!  UPDATE: Now that I\'ve gotten the hang of it after playing for a while, I have some suggestions to make for future updates. It would be a good idea to incorporate a buy/sell feature, where players can sell crops to other players or NPCs, maybe in a central community market or roadside stand, as well as getting a little bit back when upgrading appliances or furniture. Developers, what do you think?',
       'I love this game. Great time killer and if you\'re patient you wont have to spend any money on it. How ever, i wish the game creators could make an update where you can either store your furniture in some sort of inventory to make it easier to decorate and rearrange your cafe, OR make the items easier to move. It takes me a couple days to move my cafe around because of the frustration of the controls.',
       'Currently i at lvl 22 but still cannot enter chef challenge? Overall very nice game, fun with variety of foods n character. It just too expensive to expand the land/ purchase new recipe. Even the price for the floor tiles keep increasing. Make it cheaper a bit plssss',
       'This game is fun and addictive BUT THE PRICES ARE TOO HIGH! It\'s hard to advance in this game without spending your own money, and lots of it. I do not want to play a game that I can\'t advance in if I don\'t spend my own money. They should have better ways for you to gain more gems and coins, because you lose them WAY faster than you gain them. I may have to stop playing if this doesn\'t improve.',
       'I think u should clarify how to achieve cooking another burger when u dont have the ingredient to. I also feel like you should offer some way to get more coins and diamonds so u can upgrade your barn so you can move forward. Im stuck cant get no where cant play rite now.' ,

Declining is useless, because the tasks just keep sitting there. The avatar gets tired very fast and last but not least the portal crashes regularly. It\'s all about spending real money I guess.',

      'Awesome! Best pack opener on the store hands down! 2 problems though.   1. When you have a strong internet and go in to trading it messes up sometimes.  2. Dupilcates cards such as I had one 98 Pelé and ended up coming out with 3 when my opponent did not give me anything.',
       'It is an amazing game and have been playing it for years. I believe that you should add a option to trade packs and tokens as well. It would bring a new and fresh way of trading items',
       'Its great but I don\'t look me the way we need Google play for trading but apart from that I love it and release lighting rounds more often',
       'When I try to play with my friend in pack battles it doesn\'t work',

      'Amazing game. Me and my friend spend hours on it. I get to shows him my mods. He has none though we both have completed the levels. The game NEVER AND I REPEAT NEVER gets boring. Definitely better than the angry birds series must download. The only problome is the metal flap things don\'t work correctly. They just float in midair.Apart from that  Please make a new selection of levels. My life depends on it!!!!',
       'The game and level desgins promote and foster a great degree of creastive thinking. With very unique mechanics and obstacles that actually require thought and consideration when building. It has great art, along with many bonus levels and content. Fun game overall but level experiences do wildly vary sometimes. From simple to extremely  difficult, sometimes you win by mer luck and not strategy. Along with all that I don\'t know if anyone else experienced this but the levers on lvl6 were buggy and never worked. All in all good game to play.',
       'FIX THE ROAD TO EL PORKADO I swear this is frustrating to the point of unplayable. No, those levels ARE unplayable. They cannot be done with this platform glitch at all. Also, sometimes in sandbox mode when I click the tick it disappears when it hits the ground. Occasional and not as game breaking or frustrating as the moving platforms not working but still',
       'Great game but el porkado is broken I can barley ever get any crates, they are in levels that are literally impossible to complete, fix now also the king pig system is garbage. I accidentally piled up about 100 of each cake and then spent about an hour dragging my finger hundreds of times. Power ups are too rare. There should just be a feed all button or something, can I please improve the king pig system',
       'Generally great, but destroyed by graphics/world modeling glitches that render levels impossible to complete! Generally involving trap doors that aren\'t in the right place. Frustrating. AND the new cake race won\'t unlock rewards- 24000 hrs to go apparently so I can\'t play more levels.',
       'I would give it a higher rating, but on those levels like 6-18. The button activated doors and platforms don\'t work right and they glitch out. I\'ve been able to get through a few levels without the doors but on 6-18 you can\'t complete the level without this door working. Please get this fixed' ,

      'It\'s like Cooking Mama from the Wii, but you don\'t have to be accurate at all. There are SO many ads. I mean... They send you an ad like every 30 seconds or so! It\'s a lot. Good game four a you get crowd I think I because it\'s not really a strategy cooking game where you have to time manage and things. It had a decorating feature that I think kids would enjoy. Also, with that feature, a tablet would be better. Or if on a mobile, a stylis.',
       'Nice game... everyone who love cooking should download it. But there is only one problem that the things which are the main are locked and we have to pay the real money or watch s 40 ad. For ex:- In the doll cake we don\'t have the doll so how are we going to bake it.Please fix this problem, otherwise the game is nice.',
       'At first, I was pleasantly suprised this came from TabTales. The lack of pay walls at the beginning is wonderful for their games. Though I\'m not very creative, the game demands it for making food. The graphics look great, gameplay is realistic. I was sad to see a paywal at the princess cake though. If you have 10 dollars and a young girl who loves to cook and bake, by all means buy it for her.',
       'This game is awesome!!!! It makes me go hungry every time I play it!!! The graphics are awesome and very realistic. I luv the fact that it is automatic so you don\'t have to waste your time in perfection... Please keep it automatic like this forever. P.S, for those who are worried about unlocking other stuff like the princess cake, etc. Well, don\'t be, you will get a chance to play it when you unlock the other new bakeries and when you also compete in the competitions.... 😉',
       'Most of the things r automatic so I rate it 3 or 4 stars. Pls guys pls,pls I want u to make it nonautomatic so that we can play it properly .that\'s all I want to say about this game and most and things are locked these r the two things which I did not like about this game. So guys pls make it properly. Then I will rate it 5 stars for sure. One of the best game I have ever played. Thank u so much',
       'I love the game but it\'s not free.. I\'m not paying for the game and buying money through out the game... Pick one ppl, If it was 5 dollars less count me in but 10 no way! Sorry uninstall ed maybe when I check in again it will be free LOL' ,

      'I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.',
       'I really, really love this game, but, I keep losing my ball count and I don\'t understand why this is happening. For instance, I have 90 balls and I\'m supposed to have 92, I don\'t get the 92. I will give 5 stars until the bug is fixed. The ads I don\'t care about because that only happens at the end of each game which is ok. Please fix this so I can give you 5 stars.  Update- I figured out why I keep losing my count with my balls. Everytime I get the balls by the number blocks, it wouldn\'t count them😐 I could get a lot further if this was fixed. If this keeps on happening, I\'m going to uninstall this game. I hope it doesn\'t come to that because I really love this game. Please fix asap!!',
       'If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.',
       'It\'s good at first but you\'ll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.',
       'Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I\'m not spoiling it, but I will tell you it\'s a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don\'t know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.',
       'Both my husband and I have this game.  I opted to pay for the no ads though, he did not.  DO NOT do this!  He is able to get "continues" for watching adds and can keep climbing up the levels.  I cannot since I purchased no adds.  I get to continue once and that\'s all since I have stopped ads from allowing me to get the extra chances.  I wish I would have known this beforehand. Otherwise, this game is seriously fun and addicting.' ,
    recentChanges: 
      '◉ New "Speed up the game" option for the balls to go faster. The option appears automatically during the game.',

For exsample what is the point of money in the game if all it\'s used for right now is for buying skins that do nothing.

      'I gave this a 2 star be cause it needs improvement. Too much ads and it make my tablet lag. I can\'t the game because of the lag and I didn\'t even touch the ball, I was legit 2 inches away and I got killed so please fix this!',
       'It is.. a general improvement from Mmm fingers 1 - more traps ,challenge mode and trails. The graphics are completly different, But what really changed is that the game became ALOT harder than the original. Maybe it\'s just me not knowing the traps, but it still became harder.',
       'The game looks super fun when I see the pictures on the app. But when I actually go into the game, all it says is "Unfortunately Mmm Fingers 2 has stopped." Please fix this. I actually want to play this game because it looks really fun, and I absolutely loved Mmm Fingers so I really hope you fix this bug!',
       '1. The touch responsiveness seems a bit laggy. It\'s not as accurate as Mmmfingers1  2. The challenges menu should have a retry option so that when you fail a stage, you don\'t have to go back to stages menu and choose the stage which you were playing. Retry button will ease the problem.  Other than that graphics and challenges part is great.👍',
       'I never rate games but this is so good I have to rate it. Somehow I find the germs(idk) really cute and I love their different abilities! I like how challebging it is and its just my type of game :)) !! Definitely recommend it!! ;))',
       'C\'est impossible ^^ some of the monsters are so strategic, they won\'t let us go ;D, i liked graphics of the first \'mmm fingers\', somehow i don\'t like bright colors of monsters in \'mmm fingers 2\', still great game after all. Loved it ;)' ,

      'I gave it 5 star coz it is the best game on Android.  But the some thing need to change or put it the up coming updates.  Like make hardcore game mode to the unskilled and fair place to play with normal guns and normal armors or not with armor just regular health. I m sure you got the point and will make it better. Still love it thank for the best game',
       'Great game. Good job devs. Unlike what some people are saying, that this is p2w. I don\'t think that\'s correct.  I\'m a free to play gamer, and I\'m doing pretty good. You just need to find the propper weapon for yourself(not nessesarily the most expensive one) and the game mode you are most accustomed to. A few improvements could be done though,  like add a few bigger maps. Also please add vehicles like your other game WWheroes. That would be awesome. Also maybe a feature to play with your friends on LAN. Great concept,gameplay,controls,graphics. Thanks guys.....',
       'This is one of the best fps. I tell people who ask me about this game game, its like a call of duty for your phone. I\'ve never really liked to many phone game but just end up dealing with them. I can honestly say I really enjoy this game. The only down fall is it can get expensive and that\'s why I would say 4/5. Money part set a side 5/5 great game.       Thank you for making this game',
       'Definitely pay to win. And I\'m constantly disconnected and I stay from 100-200 ping. Once disconnected,  I get this error every time I try to join a game and have to restart my phone to fix it: photon connection failed disconnectbyclienttimeout. Please fix. Samsung galaxy note 5.. So you brought the beta and shut down all your normal servers? Morons.',
       'READ READ READ This stings... i literally played all day and night. Went from level 5 to 18.. and just as i went on a spending spree of golden chests.. a hacker has put a big button over the equipment screen... cant buy anything.. and like 10 legendary rented guns gone to waste.. were is ur contact us button so i can send photos. Update cant enter battles either.',
       'Over all this game is really good and has high quality graphics compared to other games. The only problem with it is how much gold is required to put attachments on guns. People who play this game that aren\'t going to pay to win are going to leave the game if they can\'t get their hands on a good fun and a good leveled up armor piece .' ,

      'The controls are simple.. it comes down to timing and playing it multiple times to get the most out of the combination of timing and luck. I haven\'t figured out yet how to score super well, but it is fine. I kind of wish there was more to it control wise, as right now it seems like just a matter of well timing and random luck',
       'This game is very buggy. I wouldn\'t pay for this. Your reward is 50nstsrs after completing the continental cup, yet you get 30. Then I went out do the game and went back in to see if it somehow didn\'t add, but instead I was left with 0 stars. Also the screen blacks out a lot.',
       'Integration with the adds glitches the gameplay.  It freezes quite frequently. If this gets fixed it will be more fun and interesting. If it would work without glitches and adds in between jumps it would be awesome. Try putting adds before each competition instead of in the middle. I am updating my review. It sucks! !!! I just  finished the season and everything I earned and bought just disappeared. UNINSTALL! !!!',
       'This could be so much better. When you\'ve completed a season...you then lose everything for a second season. I stayed on the season to improve scores and buy better equipment..but although my scores were improving my positions were getting worse and worse which doesn\'t make sense. Even when you hit the hill record but still come 8th....what?!?!',
       'Great looking  game, spoiled by the controls..  Tap to start the jump=OK, Tap to take off=OK, Tap to land=Too hard.. As a casual gamer you really need to either practice, practice, practice!!.. Or.. Have the landing reflexes of a Ninja!!  If for the casual gamer landing was a tad more user friendly it would definitely be 5*..  Not a game to send hours & hours on, but certainly a good time waster for a journey.. Give it a try & give Team GB a World Champion Ski Jumper!! (& the less said about Eddie "The Eagle" Edwards the better..)',
       'It\'s a great game so mental and challengeing I no it will keep you amused for a long time the controls are very sensitive so practice as much as you can before you decide to try out the career mode play happy it\'s funtastic' ,

      'I think its a great looking game, with great thought out gameplay. Despite this, there are some issues about the game, I would like to address.  1. The controls for the dodge are a bit iffy. Sometimes when I slide in the right place to dodge, it would to a lower punch, and get myself hit. I don\'t mind the slide to dodge mechanic, it just may need some tinkering  2. I wish the fighters had some unique moves, you know. To give some diversity in them. Or unique traits.   That\'s about it. If you want to reply you can. Other then this, this is a good game.',
       'Graphics are incredible, I absolutely love pixel games. It has a striking resemblance to Mike Tyson\'s Punchout, which I\'ve always wanted to play. I found a spelling error on the level 2 skills, no big deal just wanted to tell you. Love the controls, I use buttons because dodging is a little difficult on swipe mode, maybe make it a little more sensitive, It\'s hard to dodge if your swipe fails to dodge. Character customization is awesome, maybe add shirts, or at least tank tops. Also I love the lack of ads, it really makes the game more professional. Pvp mode would be cool also, I\'m excited for that update, and more updates. I will continue to support you, keep working hard on this game! Also, it would be cool if you could make it windows 10 compatible on pc.',
       'Amazing fantastic boxing game of all pixel 2d. its like ko fighters in java game but this is not sideview haha.pls add more hair, Beard,tattoo and some cool punching movements  tnx sorry for my english.um pls don\'t add tshirt because is not real boxing if u have shirt while boxing. Maybe add cool costume before fight is the best tnx',
       'I believe this game is absolutely amazing the face that they let you calibrate the sensitivity, button placement, Ability to have your own creativity with your fighter pure geneous I love how the developers take the time to listen to reviews and fix bugs! Great job guys.... P.S. I wasn\'t trying to dick ride but I love this game😭😭',
       'Good concept amd game design. The only thing that I find really frustrating is how unrewarding dodging is. The higher up I go, the less effective dodging is. The opponents up there just keep throwing punches. In real life, when someone like Floyd Mayweather Jr. dodges, he is able to land a fast jab back.',
       'Character loses max stamina over the course of the game. No explanation why, and enemies do not lose as much stamina. Eventually you\'ll only be able to throw two punches before getting exhausted, and you better hope he doesn\'t block those attacks...' ,

      'Seems fun, but there is at least a 10 second ad every time you crash and it\'s really frustrating. I think Acid Cousins is really losing a lot of people to the excessive advertising present in this app even though the game itself has a lot of potential.',

       'The game was awesome and I loved it. But the latest update ruined it with ADS. They put the banner exactly where you mostly tap with the fingers to change direction, the game got laggy which it was not before and has started getting way too many pop ups. Uninstalling. *Sigh*',
       'It intercepts the back press event and doesn\'t allow to quit in the common way. It continuously places the advertisement banner on the bottom of the page and goes to immersive mode so you\'ll hit the ad instead of navigation bar while you are hopelessly trying to exit. Maybe the game itself is not bad but that disrespect overtakes all the pluses (if they are)',
       'It\'s a cool game but it has SOO  many ads. Please stop putting ads whenever we crash cause it gets annoying.',

      'Not good enough It could get more better. It actually failed to fulfill the expectations! Not really very fun to play as was written in the description. The game could include a shop to buy things such as powerups or different colours and styles of jetski and some more creative adventures could get the game into a very interesting zone!',
       'Very fun, I love it In this game you can choose your players, Tom or Angela. Then you can ride and you try to get as far as you can throughout the obstacles and challenges. You also try to collect stars along the way. However many stars you collect determines your score. This app will keep your scores and will let you know if you get a high score. When you run into something you have the option to keep going if you watch an advertisement. This app is not boring at all. It works great and doesn\'t take up much space.',

       'Addictive and challenging It makes me put the score I wanna get in mind so I can work towards it and that inspires me to read my books......... If I can determine that I wanna pass my high score who says I can\'t get better grades....... I love the game keep doing  what your doing and make more games..... To everyone  I advise you to play this game 💖💞',
       'Oh please shut up. It is a very good game and a nice distraction for kids so stop saying it\'s not good enough.  If you are still so sure it sucks then try making your own game see how people reject it',
       'Amazing!!! It is so good good good that I can  play it every day! Well did you even make talking Tom gold run because  if It was your companies game it is great! Sorry that  I putted four stars because I didn\'t see that there were five stars so I accidentally putted four stars.' ,

      'Th8s game is awesome, it is the best ever!!! But can you add some more cars like the new Cadillacs(xts, xts, xt5, possibly ct6)  in the next update. The only gripe that I have about the game is that the mustang, camaro, and Audi tts seem way too expensive, and the camaro looks weird and boxy in the game. Besides that, the game is amazing!!😀 The graphics are amazing, the controls are precise and realistic, weather and vehicle simulations are amazing, customization is awesome( though it could use more wheels, just a nitpick)  maps are very realistic, and the a.i. are unbelievably realistic( though they could use a better braking distance, though isn\'t that realistic, sorry just another nitpick). This game is far better than any other game in this category! And I just love the the new reverse parking camera, and parking sensors!',
       'This game is amazing! The only thing is I would like the other cars to drive a bit better because they don\'t all use their signaling lights and they drive at 1 speed all the time which is rather annoying when it\'s 70km and going 20 mph.  Please fix this thank you billions for this great game, it\'s recommended to anyone just looking for a non-racing driving game. Only non-racing game I found so thank you ITS WORTH YOUR DOWNLOAD THANK YOU LOVE YOU !!!!!!!',
       'I love the game. Just a thing, I would like some more affordable cars and more SUV\'s. It would also be great if we could get XP for using freeride, because I\'ve done all the missions like 5 times already and you get tired of the same things over and over. For some reason my engine switch and mirror switch doesn\'t work.',
       'This game has many , many bugs in it. In the map \'Miami\' , in the exam , when we start , I don\'t know why it says "wrong blinker used" and "stop" even after I stopped and tried using all the blinkers. We get only 1 chance after that which I cannot pass. There is another thing very , very wrong in this game is that the car before the Bugatti Veyron (which is a Ferrari I think) has a bug. The information written about it is that is has 800 HP but it runs at a speed of 43 MPH in sport mode, slower than it runs on \'without sport\' mode.Please fix it as soon as possible, that car literally cost me 45,000 XP.',
       'Graphics are ok and physics are great. Only criticism: with slider pedals and clutch, the clutch has to be slid all the way down when changing gear, but it\'s a long travel and awkward to do, so you slide the gearstick into place but it doesn\'t shift. It needs to have a shorter travel and be slightly higher up the screen.',
       'This game is soooo horrible i cant drive or turn just a lil bit without my car going cysco. Its sooo crazy fix it but for now i am not keeping this HORRIBLE game' ,

      'One token per six hours? So you as a content provider only want me to experience three games a day? That is backwards... Do away with the tokens. You will have users clamoring to purchase the DLC if they can play nonstop. This means that you would have zero reason to charge for the premium game. Anyone who has already paid for the premium gets all future DLC for free and the rest of us would be willing to purchase it. This is a great game that could provide substantial income on well placed future DLC and franchise games.',
       'The algorithm used to determine rolls / battles is horrible.  After less than 200 games, I have lost over 20k troops, while destroying only 16k.  That amounts to nothing more than a piss poor design.  Unfortunately I paid for this app, so I am stuck with it.   Game definitely isnt worth the price paid.  Don\'t make the same mistake I made.',
       'This game is great but it could be so much better.   1. The expert AI is too easy to beat. Risk players normally gang up on an opponent, if they are dominating. There should be a legendary option.  2. It would be nice to have a match summary and timeline at the end of a game.    3. There should be an auto-save game feature when playing against the AI, in case the game drops out.  Edit: They seem to have addressed my third point.',
       'The game was fun i paid for the full game, but after losing game after game because an army of 30 lost to an army of 4 or 5. Or it glitches and my whole army becomes the enemies, or someone turns into a computer and goes in an all out assult i get very frustrated. Risk is fun but so many glitches. Poorly run app with very little work given to it.',
       'This is a very frustrating game. Every single time I play my turn (in a multi-player game that is) I get disconnected! .. and I\'ve to replay it again .. only to get disconnected again! and so on and so on till my time runs out. Sometimes in the middle of all this \'replaying\' I even lose my troops to other players .. VERY FRUSTRATING! And No .. I\'ve both a very good data and wifi connections.',
       'Was fine for a couple weeks.... Then it started freezing up in the middle of my games.... All of them. I\'m using a LG V30+ with 128g ram so it\'s definitely not a lack of storage issue.   I wouldn\'t recommend this app to anyone who likes uninterrupted gameplay.' ,
    recentChanges: 
      '- Forced trade-in of cards now grants additional time in your turn',
       '- Increased stability throughout the app',
       '- Fixed issues with pirate maps when playing the German version',

      'Love the game, easy to understand and they have videos on how to use the equipment and make ur farm expand. Also, their customer service is great!!  Recently my phone was stole and had to get a new phone.  Familyfarm helped me recover my farm within a couple of days.  Their services were quick and resourceful.',
       'I used to love this game. Played it everyday. Now things I\'ve purchased with the special currency have started disappearing?! I\'ve been in contact with support multiple times and they are completely unhelpful. They just repeat back what I wrote to them and say, I hope this helps! It doesn\'t. If I purchase a product I expect to receive it. I\'m not giving money to a charity this is a service just like everything else. Sadly, I have stopped playing the game now. Too many crashes and missing items that you work had to earn. Very disappointed.',
       'As much as I like this game Im thinking about uninstalling it bcuz its still messing up. Been having to repeat the Grape Jam making part bcuz it will say it needs to restart every single time it gets to the part it says "you wanna know a secret about my brother Daryll hes scared of chickens" part. Its a very relaxing FARMING GAME! Doesn\'t have all of the pressure the others tend to have...',
       'Fun game, but...What happened?  Don\'t like the snow,  it lightened all the colors of everything, they are not as vivid as they usually are.. With cataracts,  too hard on eyes,  all print got really small and can\'t read anymore.  Will have to quit til eyes get fixed.',
       'I love the game and have played it for almost 5 years now but for some reason it will not connect to facebook. Not sure what happened in the last update. Hopefully it gets fixed soon. I would hate if my phone got messed up and my progress is not saved',
       '. it would be nice if you could give the. game more expansion as with all the things we need to put on our farms there is not enough room to put things on the land we get. It is getting very frusting when I get videos and do not get. the. green tickets. for the. vidoes. Please fix it' ,

      'Wonderful game if you like PAY TO WIN games. Money made on wins and in orbs is lame at best considering the price of upgrades. Not sure how much longer this game will be on my phone. I dont even entertain the thought of paying into games like this. Just sayin\'  Hopefully someone less greedy will pick this game up.',
       'Awesome',
       'I like this game, where it resembles clash royal with a twist. I personally don\'t mind the wait time to unlock the orbes. The only downside is receiving what\'s inside, is not alot. If it were changed where you get say 10 cards and roughly around 20-40 coins for a regular orb and more than 3 coins if you win a battle the game would be much better as far being able to upgrade if you\'re trying not to spend alot of money. Other than that the game is great and I look forward to seeing what the developers do in the future!!',
       'Great strategy and lots of fun, the only downside to it is that upgrading characters greatly increases their power, which makes it much more challenging when going up against players with higher levels characters. It just feels a little unbalanced. That could easily be sorted out if more people got into the game though, since games could theoretically be more balanced',
       'It\'s a great game, but I\'m finding it hard to compete with people my level or with my level expertise. I\'m getting matched up with people who have Fighters 2 to 3 levels higher than mine. Not to mention this game really pushes you to spend money. The orbs take forever to unlock and I\'m really starting to see the difference between who has dropped money on this game and who hasn\'t. I\'ve been playing this game for almost 2 days and the longer I play it the more I realize it\'s a pay to win.',
       'It\'s a great idea and I very much love the twist on arena battles. I think with some development and expansion this could rival clash royal. Definitely needs some more characters cheaper orb speedup would be great, and just a thought maybe like a weapon system in a future update that would be killer' ,

       'One of the best games I have played on Google play. Or rather it is the best games  Cons: 1. There should be a storyline with this game like a real superhero(and not someone who helps bad guys too)something I found awkward.   2.The area is descent but please add the underground train terminal with some action there too. It will just take the area to a whole new level   3.There are no days and night. No whether change, nothing.   4. Add more fighting style for the protagonist.   5. Please add more buildings and the climbing up is lethargic.   Else it is a great 100 mb game. Keep it up!!!!!! 😎 😎 😎',

      'One of the best wwe games.. even better than immortals.. the difficulty level is always fair when competing with online rivals... gaining loot boxes is also perfect and  not very difficult... I obviously made some In app purchases so I could compete well... just wish to open a loot box and get 1 four star wrestler... things would get awesome I don\'t mind paying for it as well..',
       'STRENGTH : Nice game, wonderful graphics and commentary, great feature of versus and events mode. WEAKNESS : I have spinned loot cases many times but I never got a good superstar. So, purchasing a superstar by using gold or cash should be replaced instead of spinning. Another issue is we cannot remain as a wwe champion as there is no race for championship. Entrance should be added like wwe 2k has done.',
       'My favorite game. But makers please read my request carefully it is very important. The New update has a huge errors when playing as a sting. When i use his finishing move scorpion deathlock the game stops and i have to quit. So if i am winning then also i loose and also then injured sting so that would be not fair. Pls solve my problem',
       'Game is good except for one thing. You gotta fix the "Versus" mode. How is it "fair" for me to be level 3 but for my first match online be put up against a level 12?? Makes no sense. Should be match making so you match up with someone close to your own level..',
       'Missed out on pvp rewards due to event ending early. Ever since release this app has been plagued with issues. Support is not responsive at all. I\'m beginning to wonder if they will ever figure it out.',
       'Not a great game but good in terms of graphics & gameplay but still have lots of bugs. 1)Very limited stories 2) online versus seems meaningless as everytime I pin my opponent but the opponent never breaks it (touching the blue line... How??? 3) Getting 3 stars or 4 stars are rediculously tough. Forget about 5 stars. 4) in loot... If you even try your best to choose your favourite player, they will just change his place with 2star medal. 5) why no Lady wrestler???' ,

      'Whenever I try to open the app the screen starts flashing black and it\'ll stay like that or keeping turning back to the screen I was on and off, which ends up somewhat strobe-like. The actual game itself is amazing despite having a hard time trying to beat the bacteria level but, what\'s the point of a good game concept, if the game won\'t work properly',
       'I thought the new scenario was a free-trial only like the simian flu. (At least you can unlock it after being a brutal pro at the game) I\'m gonna enjoy playing this a good few times and unlock even MORE scenarios. Keep up the good work! I wanted to make a suggestion, but I just can\'t remember now. Oh well...',
       'Fun game. I wish the rate of death was more consistent. 37,000,000 a day at one point, but waiting 6 months for 100,000 to die towards the end. The disease didn\'t change, the rate of death shouldn\'t decrease just because there are fewer people. Good game otherwise',
       'I didn\'t buy the new plague, i might need to. The first 2 difficulty settings are easy, the 3rd not so much. Good game to me! Just have to read what it is that you spend your DNA points on and you should do just fine',
       'Really annoying ads keep repeating and covering controls.  So annoying. Pity as game is unplayable like this. It never used to happen before. Why can\'t developer just charge for extra content rather than make game unplayable. Will have to remove.',
       'Awesome game! Very addicting! You can replay over and over and it doesn\'t get boring! Just keeps getting better!  There is no need to buy if you don\'t want to.... Just because you suck doesn\'t mean it isn\'t beatable... You shouldn\'t give low stars because it\'s a difficult game! It\'s very beatable without purchase!!!  5 stars!!!!  Just keep trying!  Evolve!' ,

      'I like playing this game although i find that male characters do not have many long hair/ girl hair options available to buy unless you are vip or have diamonds. I think i speak for many people when i say that boys and girls should have more hair options from the opposite sex, for starcoins, as some people may take offense if they are strictly only allowed "boys hair"/ "girls hair" unlsss they are paying for it. I think you could inmprove further by making it easier to earn starcoins and another way to earn diamonds because many people do not want to/ cannot afford to BUY items in a fictional world.. Overall, i think this is a well rounded game, with a few improvement points, however i enjoy being able to have my own unique style in a virtual world :)',
       'Become the best star on movie star planet! Message your friends and meet new people create art books and take photos ,make awesome movies starring your friends ! But can map add a private photo send so only People  you know well can see your photos! Thank you if you can x and please add more things to app x',
       'Its a fun game however there are hackers,scammers ,glitches and its really annoying when the game freezes. Also when people post art books they can be really inappropriate. I think you should be at least  13 to play this game because of the inappropriate art books. I think the new update is great but I would like it if we would make n buy wish list on tablet and  on phone. Its a fun game but you reply need to think about who you can trust because many people just ply with your feelings.',

      'Has a nice variety of activities. The big bad part is one you lose a battle when defending your entire army is out for 6 to 24 hours. Th is aspect kills most of the fun when you have to spend a day and resources to heal troops before having more fun. Also once someone wins once against you they get to farm you as much as they want without risk.',
       'I tried this game for a year. I did not pay to play and achieved a sh22.  even at a sh22 sh19 are able to crush me after some features gave pay players huge advantages. I gave the game attention probably 3 hours a day for that  year. So i realize this and im just going to spend my time at more useful ventures instead of wasting my life. Good luck',
       'I DROPPED MY SUBSCRIPTION OF THIS GAME. YOU ARE BETTER OFF INVESTING YOUR HARD EARNED $30 PER MONTH IN AN IRA, ROTH IRS, CD OR SAVINGS ACCOUNT.  I paid for a subscription for nearly $30 per month, but it only works on one character, not on all accounts I own. The only way to advance is to spend money as opposed to pure strategy. World of Warcraft was much better in their payment system as it is subscription only and no in game purchases. I am dropping my subscription as game admin made it clear it will not cover my main and farm accounts.',

So my guy does only 10 damage then when I got the sheep he did 303 damage then the bat did 600 then it went up to 11k when I got the chicken. It is pointless to upgrade my guy if the chicken does 11k damage and the fact that I can\'t collect when I\'m inactive is a bit frustrating. It\'s called idle miner and yet you have to have the game active to get gold and resources if the chicken can do 11k and level 1 and I ONLY do 63 as a level 20' ,

       'Love this game. I like to hear the animal sound effects in the background as it can reduce my anxiety.  However, would you please let us choose whether we want to hear the animal sounds or music background? It\'s quite noisy and annoying to hear both of them simultaneously. Please also consider to add more animal sounds such as birds or gibbons so it feels more like we\'re in the zoo',
       'Love it, keeps me busy for hours but there are a few bugs that need to be sorted out. #1: It is constantly crashing. #2: I can\'t log in to Facebook. #3: I can\'t change my name from Player, the one already in game. Those are the only reasons that I didn\'t give it 5 stars. Other then that, I love it',
       'For me this is definitely not relaxing. There are way too many issues like the time clock, the fact that when you earn a credit to complete a task it is not recognized, completing a task and not having to take a taken. These are just a few of the things but if it could be fixed I would absolutely love this game it has captured my attention even though I\'m frustrated',
       'So far, not bad. Will see if there are too many different steps that have to be done that it becomes tedious or not.',
       'I really loved this game, I found it very interactive and especially loved how you can constomise some parts. I although liking this game found that the level difficulty went up quickly' ,

      'Maybe the reason people think its boring. It\'s probably because they are boring and lame. I beat the first level without a problem, they didn\'t because they feel like everything should be easy and they shouldn\'t have to work hard for anything. The game is challenging and fun if you like a challenge. If your a lame, whinny, expect nothing to be hard, and can\'t handle a challenge as tough as making toast, then this game isn\'t for you.',
       'The game controls are very annoying. The character won\'t go where you want him to. During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don\'t want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn\'t want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.',
       'These other reviewers are jerks! Lol. The game is awesome! And my 4 year old can even play it well!  I like it so much, I\'m downloading it onto my phone (4 yr old plays it on my old phone)  just to see how far I can get lol',
       'NC and you know what you doing today beautiful lady and her husband to be with u but I can\'t wait till I see you in the car and my mom said she will be here for me to go to the store and get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get the money for the first time I was just wondering if you want to be a good day at work and I don\'t know what I',
       'This game is stupid because you have to get a part of the key just to get more lives and the bad guys are technically cheating because they have guns I made it to the last level and it was impossible to beat the boss because he puts fire everywhere on the second level the guy keeps shooting you so it took me an hour to get off that stupid level  it took me about five days to get of the last level but I suggest that you just play the first level. This was a ripoff it doesn\'t make sense to wait that long for a stupid freaking game I\'m to cool for that dumb game. Another thing that is stupid about the game is the remote controls its confusing because they all look the same they should put the names of what that control does in the buttons. And the thing builds the stuff for you at a scale of 1 to 10 I pick 1  I rather play with realistic legos than the iPad ones don\'t waste your time on waiting for the game to download  its a ripoff',
       'It is awsome I love how on the last level (the black night) has two levels the black night and the vampire  the whole game is so fun I\'m done the whole game still play it all the time  but it needs more levels love it so much  so it needs MORE LEVELS' ,

      'this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates',
       'A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it\'s really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it.',
       'I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.',
       'Calling this a physics game is a joke. Sure, it has a physics engine that handles things like acceleration, "mass" and magnetism... But it\'s really just a very limited drawing game. Want to draw a ramp because it would lead to the most elegant solution? Sorry, can\'t... Because your "pencil" is too thick and the ball just hits the base of the ramp and bounces off. Know a simple solution? Well, have fun drawing it fifteen times while you get the exact dimensions needed in a very inexact system. I really think there are far better games to practice problem solving that don\'t get in your way as much as this one.',
       'The ads suck horribly if you don\'t buy it! But it is worth the dollar. Drawing with your finger is not very precise, but more about timing and placement.  So be prepared to reset, and try again numerous times, especially if you are going for a 3 star complete.  Great game!',
       'LOVE this game!! Literally, I don\'t think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it\'s just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜' ,

       'Loved it.but make it offline plz',
       'Ok I changed my review from a star to a 2 star, due to the fact that this game is NOT an online game as it misleads you to think. You can turn off your mobile data and the hands still runs without a hitch. They wee so far as to randomize behavior of the AI. By that I mean in done matches your opponents or team mate will just stop, implying an AFK event. Anyway its a fun game Bhutto don\'t be a sham Devs.. Mean what you say and say what you mean..',
       'I think it would be great if the game didn\'t keep freezing on me after 2 minutes of starting it. I\'m sure it\'s not my phone because I just bought a brand new phone and it\'s been brilliant for me in every aspect and all other games are working fine. Plus the phone has a 4gb ram. I don\'t know how much more you might need',
       'it\'s just like rocket league. I love it. but may I ask something? is it an online game or am I playing against bots because there is no challenge.  but if you the developer\'s make the graphics better and have the first event free I promise to continue playing. good job on the game and keep at it can\'t wait for the full game. also I see you guys answer every comment but it\'s always the same. can you answer me maybe give me some tips or advice on the game and tell me when the next update will be thanks:)',
       'This is a great Rocket League style game featuring tons of high adrenaline gameplay.. I got sucked in as soon as I started. It hosts competitive gameplay while still being easy and fun. Controls areawesome.. So easy to use and totally engaging. Graphics are a little lower than 5, but they will be improved as this isn\'t the full version yet. Could use some pre generated kid friendly chat messages like Rock on!! Or maybe Nice Shot! But anyways, Peace out, rocketball on. ✌️' ,

      'While I was playing, my phone battery died and my phone shut off. After turning my phone back on, I now can\'t open the app. When I click on the shortcut, it opens up a black screen for a few seconds and then exits it the app completely and I get a notification saying "Pizza has stopped" it\'s done this a dozen or so times now even after waiting a day. I would just uninstall and reinstall, but I\'m scared I\'ll lose my progress. If my progress is saved to my Google play account, will I be able to get it back?',
       'Doesn\'t like this new update. It ruin my gameplay. My hired buddies is not working at all. I manually put the toppings on the pizza. I did buy all the upgrades before the update. Now i earn less than before. Hope you bring back the one tap auto  toppings. Oh and I\'m glad that you didn\'t remove the auto slice buddy. It\'s the only upgrade that helps you slice better, not "MANUALLY".',
       'The present version is BAD! the app crashes after completing a day and leading to the profit page. And at certain times, the app crashes if played continuously',
       'This is best game . Simple and challenging. Difficulty is too high but I managed to figure the real answers and it became good ovenist but to arrange the pizza very well it needs artistic skills.',
       'Really bad. Some people don\'t even say what they want. Then complain when they don\'t get what they want. Just like working at Little Caesars.',

Not sure if it\'s a bug, an Easter egg feature or what, or if it\'s because I completed challenges but I don\'t appreciate the inconsistency especially when playing against friends and I don\'t feel evenly matched :(',

      'This game is ingenious and amazing, and the script is beautiful and gameplay is simple and straightforward, timeless, and fun, with increasing difficulty, but also, able to go back and compete against yourself for more Rewards. The user interface is spot-on, and the graphics are perfect. They scale well to any resolution and any aspect ratio, taking up the entire screen without any letterboxing. The actual gameplay is simply a 2 button gameplay, left and right, and yet, this game kept me busy for hours. It\'s addicting, but doesn\'t require you to consistently visit the app. It does not nag you in any way.  I have not seen a single advertisement, and the developer does not have any big paywall or reward system for paying. You will not need to spend any money on this.',
       'I think it is a good idea done well. I havent had any problems so far and the game os more than i expected. I thought the game would just be full of mindless levels but it is not. It even has a cool story and i cant wait to see how it plays out. There ia a cool mechanic wherd you get a speed boost the closer you are to the walls. I really enjoyed the game and i think it deserves 5 stars. This is the only mobile game i loved so much i actually made a review for.',
       'This is the best game ever, that I have ever played 1. I loved the story (You will know what I mean when you have played) 2. The controls are very strange and frustrate some people. But I think that\'s what make the game challenging 3. THE MUSIC. I loved the choices they have made with the music. It\'s really good love it 4. The graphics are really good couldn\'t ask for more 5. Really like the secrets   PS. Would like if you could at some kind of multiplayer when you have beaten the game  - Love Ln\'TCore',
       'Saw this before and saw 4.9 out of 5 with over 80,000 reviews. That\'s... unheard of on the store. So I came back to try it out. Completely worth it. Gameplay is flawless, visuals are gorgeously retro and vaporwave, the soundtrack is all retrowave from various artists, and the story is really good too. It\'s not often I rate games, and even then I\'m not excited when writing them. For this one I can\'t praise this game enough. Perfect retro-styled racing gem on Google Play.',
       'I don\'t often play games and I never review them. But this game absolutely merits five stars.       The writing is stunningly brilliant, kind of like if Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was made into an arcade game.  A very simple and somehow-complex 1980s arcade game.  With lots of fun and poignant nerdy jokes, and all female characters.      The story is full of mystery and human intrigue, and somehow also a nihilistic treatise on technology and how it functions in our life. And I sincerely apologize if that ruins any surprise for anyone still reading this review.',
       'This game... This game is outstanding. It was a fun challenge. The story is short, but extremely sweet. The lore in the background is engaging, I constantly wanted to hear more. The absolute lack of microtransactions has me in awe - this game was legitimately made in order to entertain, not make money off of you. I really want to replay it again, and again, and again. The developers have created something here, something that will hopefully drive other developers to create works of art on a similar level. The game is really short, only 2 hours of story, and then an extra two hours to finish all the extra challenges. If you have a free time slot, why not allot it to this game?' ,

      'not gonna mention too much ads, doesn\'t bother me so much. what bother me are words that dont belong in certain language ( specifically  Croatian here). PAZL isn\'t Croatian word for god sake. Lose too much time seeking that word to finish level ,I\'ve lost my nerves. and thats one of many. stupids',
       'I don\'t know how good is game on other languages but in Croatian it sucks. I\'m deleting this game because of constant repetition of non-existent words in Croatian language... Even all dialects included. I even purchased few times coins just to see which word is it and it wasn\'t Croatian.',
       'An ad after EVERY SINGLE TASK? Really? Too much for me, thanks. Otherwise, the game is fun, graphic is good, I like the variety of languages to choose from. Battery goes to hell while playing, even with sounds off - that\'s also an issue.',
       'Why so much ads??? Continuously during game and after each level two more fullscreen ads. And I can\'t pay without providing personal data. Very bad',
       'Okay app, would have given more points but waaaay too many adds. After each level  an add pops up which is very annoying.',
       'Excelent game, but I think that I found something which is not necessarily a bug, but it might be a design flaw. I am playing in eng. lang. and if I need to enter 2 similar words, in my case these were "oar" and "boar", application recognized later, longer word first, even if i entered "oar" first, but system rejected it as incorrect one...' ,

      'It\'s a good game, obviously an upgrade from the original, just feel a bit bothered with some of the minor changes.  The fact that on the list of things to collect is only 2 items long instead of 4  That after about the 5th one collected, every item just appears on a formation instead of being spread.  And that you don\'t get power ups while playing anymore.  And why is addicted to you not here?',
       'I like the game especially because there aren\'t many like it right now. Though it would be nice to see an update that lets you use other songs too. Even though it\'s avicci\'s app I mean the songs do get repetitive after playing for a long time',
       'Love it! Only wish the older (classics) would be more "split into sections" instead of just popping into next part but I guess it\'s because it\'s older vs newer techniques of making music.',
       'Absolutely love the game and greatly improved over the original version which was already great. Please add a Days/Nights pack, would love to play it to both those songs.',
       'Absolutely fantastic. Ive played the earlier version and this is all I ever wanted from it! I\'m gonna tell all my friends about it. (I have only 2 friends)....So yeah.',

      'Well guys.. I just broke the game 😂 it was the \'HEADLIGHT\' puzzle where I got stuck. I requested for a hint and I accidentally tapped out the E in it and now it\'s completely gone. There\'s no letter E no more in there. You should check this out. (So I requested a hint twice, went wrong on the word and then tapped E, and poof, it\'s gone) and maybe you should make a reset puzzle button for situations like this. 😃',
       'Very easy, boring and full of unskippable ads for no reward. Not a very clever game as some have suggested, this gives the player no sense of accomplishment nor any legitimate challenge unless you do not speak English.',
       'Just got really boring. In a group of 10 puzzles there was; 1 that was a clever brain teaser, about 7 that were just way too easy and severely lacked creativity, and at least 2 that were just genuinely terrible often making little to no sense whatsoever and then it just turned into a game of hangman with unlimited guesses. Clearly this was made by a team or individual who thinks that they are supper clever and witty but in reality just wanted to make a few easy bucks by showering people with adds and a completely unnecessary currency system.',
       'The best time spent by playing this game ... Some are easy, some are funny, some are tricky, some are still out of the mind.... But it\'s a wonderful game and waiting for more levels to come now...',
       'After completing 55 levels I get a blank screen. Are there any plans to add new levels?',
       'Its a great gane but is always glitching out.For example I have three leters after I use a hint,then I earn a hint and the other letter just disapears and it did not go onto the word or phrase.' ,

      'This is a great game and is challenging it definitely requires some focus and concentration. There is a bug that needs to be fixed it is on the gold game mode and it\'s the game that asks you to select which colours are more prominent out of all the squares but the coloured squares don\'t appear. Please fix this as soon as possible because I really enjoy this game.',
       'I really lived thus game because it isn\'t just tapping something but it\'s actually training your brand and improving your attention, memory, logic and your mind in general. If you need help in any of those subjects (or you just like a bit of fun ) I would dwfinately say this is the game for you.',
       'Very great game, I can pic some logic questions here and ask it on my friends ang classmates. It really gives me a brain exercise. Wheneve I feel bored, this game takes my bored away',
       'I just started playing but so far i am truly loving it! I\'ve always preferred games that teach and/or exercise your brain rather than the largest number of games available! Within a few rounds it is obvious this game will promote brain activity and help in every aspect of life! I highly recommend this 💗',
       'Simple but fun. These games are challenging and do make you use your brain without taking much time. You can play a few levels in just a few minutes easily. Ads are not too bad either, not too obtrusive and are sporadic enough.',
       'Cool game, but it has a few bugs. The one where items go through some thing and one of them gets lost - it doesn\'t show me the items going into the thing so all I can do is guess.' ,

      'One of my favorite games. Only issue is the bug where it sometimes doesn\'t tell you when your opponent has played their turn. Wish they would fix that, otherwise it\'s great!',
       'Love this game, and I love the new solo challenges! There are a lot of ads, but you aren\'t forced to watch them thru.',
       'Always fresh and works terrific.  Much better over the past few years.  Only complaint is all the videos and ads.',
       'Very buggy since the update. Almost to the point of being unplayable.',
       'Love it. Great game. Play it every night. I have new and old friends I play with.',
       'The game itself is mostly fine. The words they allow are mitigated by removing potential "trigger words" which happen to be in every dictionary but not in the game, because it might offend someone. So, when you have letters to play a word, it sometimes isn\'t accepted because of their ignorance of the English language. Simply add a control for users to see or not see words played by competitors. Or to play with certain words turned on or off. However, words with friends two seems to believe in word control as a means of deterrence. We\'ve seen how well gun control works in Chicago and how well prohibition worked, so clearly it\'s the most effective method...... (heavy sarcasm)' ,

      'Potential to be a great game but wayyyy to many ads, like every 10 seconds of gameplay there\'s a 30 second ad, and when you choose to watch an ad to get a reward you never actually get it. Waste of time. No idol earnings so you have to have the app open to advance and forces you to watch more ads.i get you want to make money but this app is basically unplayable.',
       'Invasive ads, after most actions. Skippable after 5-10 seconds, but come way too often for this type of game. Games cool, but I uninstalled it after my tenth ad in about ten minutes',
       '1 star for this AD Simulator. I understand you guys need to earn some money, but putting too much ads in your app which is good ruins everything. Consider reducing number of ads. I\'m uninstalling game until this gets resolved.',
       'The amount of ads this game throws at you every few seconds is just unacceptable. Too many ads! Seriously, every 10-15 seconds a video ad plays when you tap anything. The game would actually be fun but the ads completely ruin it.',
       'Great concept... No idle earnings. Too many ads. Paid for "no ads" but still get ads. No response from developers. Crashes when it tries to load ads. Which is every 2 seconds.',
       'While the game itself has the capacity to be fun, being faced with a 30 sec add every ten seconds is not. Mr. Gorbachov, remove those ads!' ,

      'A very fun and addictive game. I make bows all day, but it\'s nice to be able to shoot from my couch at night.  The influence of wind on the arrow is accurate when it comes to drift. A little costly on the upgrades for those that don\'t buy their way to the top, but all games are that way.',
       'Ok game, but bingo mode is a huge pain.  My shots filled out the opponent\'s card better than mine.  Stupid way to lose a lot of progress/coins.',
       'Game was fine. Lately, keeps freezing and somehow opponents are getting 10\'s when I CLEARLY see them hitting nowhere near the middle. Matches are freezing while i\'m ahead, then match ends and says I lost. Somehow i\'ve lost 20 million coins, and not from legit losing either. I also just played a match for 1 million coins, i had over 1 million in the bank. I know sonehow have 0 after I clearly won the match but it said I lost. Either people are using cheats or the game is not functioning properly',
       'It\'s really pathetic that apps like this only allow Facebook login... At least provide Google login too.... Not everyone uses Facebook.... Google should make it mandatory on Google play store apps to provide Google login....',
       'It feels like I\'m playing a cpu, because the first cup is easy and my opponents only score very low points. I mean, I score 8-10 and my opposition have a hard time hitting the mark at all! (I\'ve repeatedly played it a handful of times.)',

      'Lots of fun. Simple yet difficult to master. I play everyday. I like the variety of targets. Purchasing option doesnt work. I tried to buy $4.99 of coins in the app. It took my money  but it never added the coins to my score. Google Play credited the amount back to me. Good app overall.',
       'This Game was very exiting and relaxing  and spend time with shooting king with archers I like Guns  and the bullet was very Big and the level is 100000 I think I will pay every day First higher stakes multiplayer and it appeared with the opponent cheated the time ran out from the shoot but the Game was froze. But the Game was very interesting and exiting I like shooting very much',
       'First higher stakes multiplayer and it appeared that the opponent cheated. The time ran out for them to shoot but the game then froze. I was able to change guns, sent emotes, etc. and I was connected to a stable internet connection. I waited 20 minutes until finally sending the game yo the background so I could google if it was a cheat. Low behold I instantly lost all of my coins. Dont waste your time with this game, poorly made and cheaters will take all of your coins in multiplayer.',
       'Uninstalled after 10 mins. Too many pop ups for other games plus the lengthy ads that you can\'t get out of. Great game otherwise.',
       'It is about slowly balancing your gun to release and take the shot within a set time limit but not quite as easy when you actually try. This makes it a challenge to perfect hand eye coordination so that makes for a good game.',
       'These people are thief, as I had ~29k points when I went to bed, and I woke up in the morning, my point is half. These guys want you to buy extra points from them, and they deduct your points, shameful business practice.' ,

      'I really like this game its exactly like goddess primal chaos. However, like goddess you need to give us spenders the ability to turn off vip status if we wish. People get constantly harassed all day long for spending by the free to play players. Show your spenders some respect and let us keep it private. I\'ll also change my review to a five if this is done.',
       'I can\'t tell you how long I\'ve been looking for a decent game. Literally weeks. I came acrossed this one from a Facebook add and as soon as I started playying it has been super fun every since. The p2w ratio is literally not high at all. So F2P can definitely gain just ad much. Awesome gameplay good graphics for the game itself overall I definitely recommend this game. ♡',
       'Amazing game! The gameplay and controls are very well made and easy to use, the game has enough going for it to keep u playing all day without getting bored.   Suggested improvements: - making diamonds cheaper to buy. It would encourage more people to support the game. -making energy and stamina regenerate slightly quicker. Would keep people in the game longer and more engaged. -keeping more events going after the initial 7 days or making daily login rewards more exciting. Would encourage players to come back the next day and keep playing   Overall great, in depth, game. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys MMORPGs or anime styled games.',
       'Non auto PvP. Not enough room on a phone screen for 360 group fight. When you can\'t even see your toon in the dogpile of toons to know which button to hit. And you burn thru stam in higher levels in an hour',
       'At the beginning there is no setting menu to turn off the annoying music, but there is a menu to give them money for VIP status. That\'s all I need to know this is a cash-grab.',
       'I couldn\'t believe my eyes, it\'s the same layout, controls, maps, locations, events, classes. Rewards, and more...its a rip off of the game "goddess primal chaos" entirely, I\'m shocked. It\'s a watered down version lower quality and the voicing is terribly annoying, only thing changed is the look of characters and monster which are terrible in itself. Not worth.' ,

Me:Ooooh.....is see. Then i come home rest for little bit and seacrh this Game.     THE   END',
       'CandaDroid yesterday I used 5.00 for a gem pack and never got any gems if possible could you give the gems owed cause currently I have yet to see any number change in gems or if you can\'t get the gems could I receive a refund and as proof I payed for it I\'ll email you a copy. The whole situation makes me upset again if possible could I get the gems or at the very most a refund, please and thanks Rhapsodic Archer',
       'When I try to fight, monsters keep attacking me at the Same time. How am I supposed to win a battle when that\'s happening? *Also, I seen a lot of replies and you still didn\'t upgrade anything. I would like a pet to keep me company in the house. edit after playing minecraft: PLEASE ADD VILLAGERS!',
       'Great game (very similar to Minecraft) until you get bored of stuff to do due to no red stone and limited items to build. Plus, mine kept freezing and logging off but when I\'d log back in, all my stuff would magically disappear! Complete waste of my time! Deleted after the 3rd time it happened and it was on multiple devices so I know the issue wasn\'t on my end! Also, you get bombarded with advertisements whenever you sleep, switch inbetween menus and craft items!',
       'I paid $4.99 and still haven\'t got my gems either give me my gems or I will charge back my money. The game is good but I\'m pissed I haven\'t got what I paid for.   EDIT:  It\'s been almost 3 whole days since I paid this app for gems in-game and they have yet to give them to me, I have made a successful charge back for my money by calling Google play. Do not download this app and do not make any in-game purchases from this app. Just pay the $6.00 to play Minecraft.',
       'This app is good and user friendly never played minecraft mini but this game is pretty cool the only glitches I\'ve come  across was that every now and then you see extra inventory floating in the spots where youve already cleared other than that its a pretty cool game. Oh and you drown when you go for a swim theres no saving yourself or your inventory when that happens i recommend saving all you items in a chest so that when you revive its still there' ,

      'I totally like the game and all but there must be balance between different robots especially..... some robots have a big advantage like the haechi with 3 medium slots and its dash ability.. its like u cant even aim at it......  Also please remove the components so that everyone is able to buy newer robots... u can make them available in gold or silver or even workshop points',
       'They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It\'s definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you\'ll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.',
       'Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don\'t be fooled. This is a pay to win game.',
       'A great game that brings back the old Mech warrior days. One of the few good theme fps shooters on this platform that is "FREE". You can pay to win but it will cost you alot. Investing afew tens to smoother the growth? But you can still have plenty of fun without spending a dime.  Until it slowly draws you in deeper.....',
       'I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that\'s cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!',
       'This game is more geared to people who are capable of spending hundreds of dollars but it is still fun.  More non pay for content would be nice as far as more weapons.  But it\'s still a descent game for a pay to play even if you can\'t afford pay.  I think you should be able to upgrade more than one item at a time though.  It only allows it if you pay to.' ,

      'I love it!! But when I had a star on the cross mark at the red line I didn\'t have any more prices. What you shall do if your first nurse is never leaving the bathroom swipe the door left And click the cross button and that you are able to wash your hands and that\'s what you nurses want.',
       'Good but it needs some work done I love the game I really think you should download it. But it  sometimes takes me out and back to my home screen , I think it a good game when I am bord I can play it and the other ones. I think it should use a little work so mines don\'t lag and take me out of it  after all it is great and fun I love it so much that I wish it will not take me out the game because it makes me sad a lot but I will not delete it because I like it. I will give it 5 Stars but it lags a lot. Wish you a have a fun time playing.',
       'It a great game that is a encourage yonger kids to be doctor one day.  However there are some things that can be inproved   1. Can the nurses can be controlled like the doctors  2. Can you add multiplayer please  3. Add a few more mini games  4. That the hospital can expand with every level up',
       'Its a really good game but I have a few improvements firstly the first nurse I ever unlocked went straight to the bathroom and won\'t move so I think she\'s there for ever secondly nurses don\'t really do anything they just pretend to do something also its always the person in the same bed can\'t you have some variety? Finally the person at the door I can\'t actually get to...? I know this comment must be frustrating I\'m trying not to be to pick but I think its for the best :-)',
       'I liked it but the nurse o no! She is so irritating u can\'t even control the nurse she always stands between u and never moves and the 2 nurse is always in the bathroom And in one time u have so many patients u can\'t even hold but if u like then ok',
       'Love it but It needs a lot of work like for instance the screen is sometimes small but I really do love the game it\'s like very special and how you can like teach little kids about hospitals and stuff I like your expertise Playmobil and that is the end of my paragraph peace out  homies' ,

      'I have only had the game a few hours and I am already falling in love with it. It is great to go on when you have a spare 10-15 minutes. The grid is larger than others so I can read the words fluently and quickly without them being hard to see. You get points after each time you complete the grid so if you are really stuck you can receive a hint for some points. I would highly recommend this excellent game.',
       'Only been playing for a few days now, and so far, I love it! Forgot how fun Word Search puzzles can be, and to have it on my phone is priceless lol.. No complaints with the app so far. I will say though, maybe they should tweak it just a tad, instead of giving a hint only after a short moment, possibly creating \'the option\' to have a hint may be a little better. Not a big deal to me. It truly is a great app, love the simplicity of the graphic design too. Glad I came across this game.',
       'I enjoy ALMOST the whole game, being a word find and all, simple, yet deceptively hard at times. Still, I wish there was a way to turn off the \'hints\' it gives, as they get annoying... unless there IS a way that I haven\'t discovered yet...otherwise, I REALLY like the game, and would suggest it to all ages, as it\'s not too tough for the young ones, but still challenging enough for experienced players.',
       'It\'s a good game but there needs to be a way to turn off hints. If you don\'t find a word in the time it thinks you should, it keeps giving hints which ruins the gameplay. I pause for various reasons like talking to someone, cat catching a mouse, watching tv at the time, etc.. Or sometimes it might take longer to fins a word than seconds allowed before the hint.',
       'I love this game. Really nice and well thought out game. It\'s educative too. But I have just one issue with it though: The flashing hint. This gets me distracted each time it flashes. Maybe there could be a hint button at the bottom of the puzzle. That way instead of it flashing and getting us distracted, we could just click on it whenever we need help. Apart from that, it\'s just perfect. Will give it a 5 when the flashing hint is worked on😁',
       'Other reviews are accurate  for me.. hints become irritating in that they only flash on for a second and you miss them rather than find them useful.  They also appear too soon so you have little time to search.  I also found the occasional issue registering a word and having to go over it several times. But it\'s a free game, it\'s fun, it\'s addictive what else is there to say ? It\'s good.' ,

       'Love the Game, it\'s fun and addiciting. But, it seems to be a bit \'rigged\' and NOT just me. But me and a friend of mine always have our game \'Lag\' at 304. Please fix the lagging. I don\'t appreciate it being lagged on the 300\'s, especially when it REPEATS on the EXACT number.',
       'I like this game but it won\'t let me get anymore lives from watching ads but all in all its quite a good game. I would also like to say that this els me control my emotions',
       'It\'s alright, it\'s starts off ok but with in like 10 secs it is going so fast that you don\'t have anytime to get into it and I keeps getting faster until it\'s not humanly possible so it\'s 10 seconds of fun wish the speed would progress over a much longer time, for me there is no point to this game',
       'literally every song fails you at 402 because it freezes on the 402nd note you hit, then skips ahead a few notes and fails you. Would have been fun if it wasn\'t for that major defect.',

      'Best horror game series in all eternity Super fun. Creepy too. Its really challenging because when toy bonnie moves, I cant find him on any camera after he moves from cam 3, so I put on my mask the whole time and then Puppetmaster gets 2 me. Hard and scary! I\'d give it 6 stars if I could!',
       'Very spooooooooky Great this game is great but you should really try doing an update about the purple guy cause it makes no sense that in SL at the end some one stares at a mirror and purple eyes cone out and the purple guy is the only one in the game who is purple! I don\'t know if that makes sense plus the mini games don\'t match because purple guys death was I n fnaf 3 so who is that person in the mirror? I know I mite be Mike or William Afton William Afton is the purple guy but Mike would make more sense cause  the scooper',
       'So scary. Good game. Look this game will scare you until you pee on yourself aka if your 11 and under like me should play if your not scared but,this game is good. I give it 5 stars no doubt. Lol but hurry up and come out with part 3 already plz!😀😀😀 F.Y.I always wind up the music box',
       'Advice to get u passed N1 in DEMO and real version 1. NEVER turn ur flashlight on in Cam 9. 2. Dont go crazy with ur flashlight battery 3. When u see Freddy wait 10 - 12 secs and THEN flick ur flashlight 4. Bonny and Chica don\'t do anything to u 5. Bonny goes to only 2 cams 6. Chika stays at the Main Hall 7. Freddy wont come out if u stay in Show Stage 8. If Freddy comes out and the music box needs winding do it quick *no rush tho 9. 6 A.M. will come soon 10. Night 5 will as well come soon',
       'Best Game Ever! I love this game because the animated animatronics like toy Bonnie he trys his best to hug you. Example: mum is that you? Mum I love you!  The chicken is so weird she has a beak on the stage but when she is at cam 7 in the hallway she has no beak, why is that? Toy Freddie is quite scary but he kind of looks like a stuffed teddy bear instead of an animatronic. Well I love this game thanks for the game Scott Cawthon!',
       'So cool,I WANT TO HUG THEM!! So fun and cool ,but i want to see more animatronics because i want a GOOD JUMPSCARE FROM NO-FACE BONNIE. My brother is so scared when he puts the mask on he wont even wind up the music box. I,on the other hand,take risk. Smart.The Animatronics are very cute.' ,

      'Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?',
       'Ok. I admit this game is pretty fun. But the missions, especially the hardcore ones, are ridiculously hard. So if you want a challenge, I recommend this game. But if you rage over really dumb things like me, then I definitely do not recommend it.',

      'I dont know why you chosen Retro style graphic and i hope for a change. There is a lot of IRANIAN players but PING is over 250ms and too much delay. Add iran flag. Google play sign-in is not working. Add more skins. Events are just bunch of objectives and prizes, add more artworks and stuff for events. Other things are good for now. Thanks for the revolutionary IO game. Congratulation on 10million downloads 💝',
       'simple, fun, addictive gameplay, good graphic with unique animations, great events that keep players active which is good, have great potential. dark adventure loading still takes too long, i already dead when the loading is finished. crashing and some bugs in event tab. talking about awaken system, man atleast dont downgrade the stars or reduce the percentage of downgrade, finding awaken item is already damn hard. this great game need new character and more feature but not p2w. keep the good work barbarq !!',
       'YOU GUYS ACTUALLY LISTENED!!! Im so happy right now because when I saw theres a new update, I immediately downloaded it to see if I can play it without crashing. I can actually play it now with my friends! A little bit of framrate drop but still... I can play this wonderful game. Im going to totally recommend this game to my friends. The devs of this game are the best devs in the Google Play Store. Again, Im truely greatful and I thank you guys. :D',
       'It is the best game I\'ve ever played! With simple graphics and gameplays, you won\'t notice how long you\'ve played! Generous with presents daily and very recommended to spend time. However with the new update, I can\'t connect and it stayed on connecting. Tried to change internet source, but to no avail it\'s still there.  I would like to ask the developers, to reply as soon  as possible, on what should I do to get rid of this problem.',
       'Hello! I\'ve seen this game many times from the ads and I tried installing it and later found that this game was really intertaining and fun. Anyways, I am having problems with the game\'s connectivity to the internet. I am using 4G in playing the game and it seems that it does not connect very well, other online games connect well to the internet. I think that is the only issue I have in mind. Just hoping for more smoothness though.. But I love the game, it is worth the time playing. Thank you!!',
       'Feels like lots of players are AI bots. I\'ve won my first 10 matches with a 10+ holyshit mega kill every time. Looks a bit pay to win as a champ you must buy has a very OP skill. The amount of awakening to hit 5 and get the extra skill is astronomical and will require money to be spent. Also, not one person is speaking English. It\'s all Spanish/Portuguese.' ,

      'Ok I get it but why do the army kill you for no reason? I like this game because you can do roleplay and I\'m a girl and there is girl skins which is amazing but can you start with a girl skin and a boy skin to be fair with the girls  Pls do these. Love your company :-) but can you add a roleplay mode that would be great DO MORE:-) but now on my new tablet it won\'t let me play it please fix that and reply',
       'Good. However, the apple versioned platform overwhelms us by many advantages: They can earn coins and cash quicker n easier. They get options on what currency they use to purchase things. They get to higher leagues easier. Their weapon description overpasses ours as ours literally gives us damage and capacity whereas theirs comes with fire rate, trait etc.',
       'I love this game but I have a couple of requests 1st. Could you add u YouTuber skin back like boy,girl,animal then YouTuber 2nd. Could you add a button that you can press that alows you to make your own custom paint job for any vehicle that would be amazing 3rd. Can you make and road that ends come back into the city at the other side example the road behind the hospital 4th. Could add like 5 houses around the city that you can go into 5th. More vehicles   If you agree with what I have sead in this comment like so the developer can see!',
       'I love this game. But for the next update, u should give each skin there own special ability. Like the flash and hulk skins. Give the flash super speed, give hulk super strength and etc. So that everyone can get a different type of advantage. Plz make this happen next update also make a goku skin. So u can turn super saiyan. And have other transformation. So can u plz have every skin to have different abilities that match the skin',
       'I have been playing the game for 6 or 5 years and it has been the best game i have played. So, i  think you have to make this game better in the next update.Here r my suggestions 1 make the graphics better. 2 day and night shift. 3police attacks bandit in adventure mode.4 add a clan.  I hope u will add these in the next update.Also too many players that hacked their health so plz fix it.Thx',
       'This Game Is Awesome Ilove It Somuch I could Play it With My friends Keep It Up I think That You Should Add some New Weapons Like Lightsaber And You Should Make The People Drive Cars .Why  Peoples Does Not Drive Car?. Well But thats not good make the people drive thanks Keep It Up.' ,

It\'s the TANKS and the SUVS   or make it a banable offence because all people do is camp in the last circle with a tank or a suv. Please fix this and I will rate 5 stars. And I know this is meant to be a minecraft version of pubg but pubg never had tanks or armoured suvs so please fix it. And is it just me but some of the players feel like bots. 😂',
       'Problem I have is that it promotes multiplayer use, but you cannot tell who is an actual player or an AI, there is no chat system like it says, and half of anything it talks about is unavailable in the game. The concept itself is great, the game itself is a great time waster, but I have to call it out on its false advertisement.   Now, if I may have been mistaken, someone please correct me, but so far as I can see there is nothing in the game that suggests multiplayer capabilities.',
       'This game is actually mentally retarded. The only good thing I can say is that at least it runs at 60fps. The controls are not always there, for example, in the waiting match, I cannot jump, because the button disappeared. When I was trying to play this with a friend as a joke, I was genuinely confused as to what was going on, and I have played both Fortnite, and PUBG',
       'This game is so fun! I didn\'t expect it to be so good. I imagined that this would be like any other game remake, you know, a lot of glitches, bad graphics, and very high sensitivity. But, to my surprise, it was not like that at all. It was better than expected. I\'m going to be playing this game for a long time. I\'ll tell you that much!   This game is an instant🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟!!! - Andrew from Roboticfalcon21 Reviews',
       'Way to many ads. Ad to get to homescreen ad to get to waiting area, ad to get to arena. On top of that kept jumping back to homescreen and loading another ad instead of going to waiting area. Uninstalled, a shame because it seemed quite good.',
       'All in all good game but only one major proble is too many ads.  Edit : uninstalled because my upgrades didn\'t stayed upgraded it massed up 🖕 my dopamine level.' ,
